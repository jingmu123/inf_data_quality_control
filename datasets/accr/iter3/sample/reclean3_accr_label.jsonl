In this case report， we presented clinically significant edema that resulted in the dramatic and abrupt improvement in glycemic control after intensive improvement in lifestyle in a 13-year-old girl， with DM type 1who had positive anti-Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies. She had poor glycemic control during 2 years of insulin therapy， and lifestyle improvements with no changes to her medications types or doses， she developed generalized body edema， and face puffiness that resolved spontaneously， without any intervention， and only observation of the patient.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Generalized edema is a rare complication of insulin therapy， which usually occurs in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic patients and after the initiation of insulin therapy， also it can be presented in patients with type 2 diabetes after the intensification of insulin therapy generalized edema must be differentiated from other causes of edema such as cardiac or renal disease which are the most common causes of body edema， and must initially be ruled out 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Here we report a 13-year-old， girl， who was diagnosed with DM type I in 2016. Her DM was uncontrolled for 2 years， and she had a history of multiple admissions to the pediatric intensive care unit， due to Diabetes Ketoacidosis(DKA). She recently presented with generalized body edema including the face， of no apparent cause， after sudden glycemic control with only lifestyle modifications， and became compliant with her medications， without any change in insulin types or doses.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 13-year-old Saudi girl diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2016， had positive anti-GAD antibodies， and in the last 2 years， had uncontrolled blood glucose with a high Hemoglobin Alc(HA1c) level of more than 15%. Her lifestyle was unsatisfactory， including the consumption of many junk foods and a lack of any physical exercise. Despite her insulin dose of 1.5 units/kg/day， she still had uncontrolled blood glucose and was frequently admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) with a total of 5 admissions since her diagnosis，and HAlc level reached 16.9% on one occasion. We decided to provide her with intensive psychological support and give her frequent clinical appointments with the Pediatrics Endocrinology Clinic and a diabetic educator. She decided to change her lifestyle to prevent any diabetic complications and to improve her quality of life， therefore， she changed the types of food she consumed， eliminated most carbs， become physically active， walking around for an hour per day. In September 2020she was admitted to the PICU due to frequent hypoglycemic attacks， with no history of fatigue or decreased energy， no symptoms of cough， shortness of breath， and chest pain， and no history of new medication use. A physical examination determined she had pitting edema on her lower limbs， lower back， and a puffy face. She had warm skin with no tingling or burning sensations at the site of edema and no pain， aching， or numbness. Another systemic exam showed she was within normal， a bodyweight of 58 kg， and had a BMI of 23 kg/m’， with no abnormalities in her chest or heart. A normal thyroid exam and showed no lipohypertrophy at the injection site. Investigations were conducted to rule out any organic cause of the edema， included renal function test， liver function test， and cardiac exams with ECG. All were normal apart from her albumin being on the lower side with a level of 35 g/L. Other labs tests showed a high HA1c level of 15.8%. ACTH and cortisol tests were performed to rule out Addison disease and the results were within normal ranges. The celiac删除1换行profile showed negative antibodies. Thyroid function tests revealed a low FT4 level of 8.2 pmol/L and positive thyroid antibodies. Insulin doses were adjusted with the total daily dose decreasing from 1.5 to1.3 and then 0.7 units/kg/day to control her blood glucose level， and her long-acting insulin dose was changed to another type of long-acting insulin (Tresiba) to minimize her hypoglycemic attacks. On clinical follow-up， she showed much improvement in her glycemic status， and her edema resolved without any medical interventions. Her last measured HA1c level was 7.8%，levothyroxine was initiated with a dose of 50 mic daily， and her last FT4 level was 10.3 pmol/L. Her hemoglobin Alc level decreased from 15.8% to 9.1% and then decreased again in December 2020 to 7.9%.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Insulin edema is a known complication of the initiation or intensification of insulin therapy. It was first described in 1928通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> and occurs in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus， especially in newly diagnosed cases of type 1 diabetes mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. It is a benign transient condition that is usually self-limiting and resolves spontaneously with a rare or no need to use any intervention，treatment， or diuretic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Although the manifestations can vary widely from mild peripheral edema to cardiac failure and massive serosal effusions and may occur in local areas， such as the periorbital，pretibial， and sacral regions， or as generalized edema， there was a young patient who is diagnosed as a newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes， when generalized edema and pericardial effusion developed after initiation of insulin therapy， the treatment was only supportive and all symptoms resolved within 20 days 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. As well， it can be presented at any age with the youngest age was reported was a 9 years old male who developed insulin edema few days after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and was treated as a case of DKA 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. There are no criteria or a risk stratification system for the diagnosis of insulin edema， and it is diagnosed by the exclusion of other common causes of body edema. However， aged being from 20 to 40 years，poor control diabetes either by having frequent hypoglycemia or following DKA treatment， newly diagnosed diabetes with higher doses of insulin therapy， poor glucose control， and low body mass index have been suggested as risk factors for insulin edema 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. The true incidence of insulin edema remains unknown but some reports have estimated the incidence to be in the range of 3% to 3.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. There have been several presentations of insulin edema， William et al. reported a 15-year-old girl with a history of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus who presented with generalized anasarca which was started gradually over her limbs till extend to all of her body including her face and genitalia associated with a significant increase in her weight， her labs were within normal level apart of albumin which was in the lower normal， these symptoms were noticed after 1-week of compliance with insulin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Furthermore， another adult patient with latent autoimmune diabetes was reported to have insulin edema associated with neuropathy. She was a 35-year-old， diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and subsequently developed latent autoimmune diabetes， she was on an oral hypoglycemic agent and her glucose level was high with an HbA1c of 13%. She was admitted to the hospital under plastic surgery service when she presented with a painful discoloration of her right finger. During that admission developed DKA， after treatment of the DKA insulin was initiated and after 3 days she developed significant pitting edema up to her umbilicus associated with neuropathy that was diagnosed by nerve conduction studies. Other causes of edema were excluded， and because her edema was severe so， she was treated with furosemide diuretics and fluid restriction 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Another adult删除1换行case was reported by Wong and Balakrishnan. The patient was a40-year-old woman， newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus who developed generalized edema just after diagnosis and treatment initiation 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Sugiyama et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> reported that a 50-year-old female patient， who is known to have Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) post bone marrow transplantation and type 2 diabetes mellitus， was on multiple medications as prophylaxis and treatment from transplant rejection. Her blood glucose become poorly controlled so； intensive insulin therapy was given to her， after by around 4weeks found to have insulin edema over her lower limbs. The same presentation was found in a 57-year-old male patient with a 5-year history of type 2 diabetes， he was poorly controlled and his urinalysis showed positive ketones and protein. He developed bilateral lower limbedema which was induced by the rapid improvement of glycemic control with insulin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Despite that， insulin edema is a rare finding and usually， it is self resolved， although it can be serious with significant complications as in this patient who was a 35-year-old woman diagnosed recently with type 1 diabetes who presented with polydipsia andpolyuria for over 1 year， and at the last 2 months before presentation， she lost approximately 2 kg of weight. She presented with signs of severe DKA indicated by Kussmaul's breathing and low pH levels and was treated with insulin. On the 2nd day， her renal function started to deteriorate， she had high creatinine levels and then presented with generalized edema， serous effusions， and acute renal failure. This case was different due to the presence of more serious complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Pediatric patients also can have insulin edema； a case report of a 12-year-old boy newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes， presented with edema of the lower extremities approximately one week after the initiation of insulin therapy. This case was considered a typical presentation of insulin edema that appeared soon after the initiation of insulin therapy in a patient newly diagnosed with DM type 1 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Furthermore， Hirshberg et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> reported a 49-year-old female， who was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and developed severe generalized edema following the initiation of insulin therapy. The edema was severe enough to be treated with diuretics but unfortunately， it was impossible to continue the treatment because of the severe side effects of this medication the patient experienced. Even the patients who are on an insulin pump can develop insulin edema； Greco et al. described the case of a 39-year-old woman with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus who developed generalized edema with severe weight gain a few days after the start of an insulin pump therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】Several cases have been reported about generalized edema in patients with diabetes. However， most of the cases reported on patients with either newly diagnosed type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus that developed edema after the initiation or intensification of insulin treatment or even after sudden compliance with insulin therapy. There were no case reports about the development of insulin edema after only improvements in the patient s lifestyle and without any change in insulin dose.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

They occur mainly between the ages of 15 to 49 years with a mean of 29 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【5】Uterine arteriovenous fistulas have classically been related to chorioplacental affection such as molar disease， choriocarcinoma， extensive or focal placental accrete， as well as with previous uterine surgeries (myomectomy， uterine curettage or cesarean section)， infections， as well as the association with diethylethyl bestrol，amongothers. Suelen presents multiple arteries food， a ball of vessels with histological，arterial，and venous characteristics， apart from numerous veins draining one. In cases where this entity is related to previous uterine surgery， the highest percentage of cases is related to uterine curettage instrumented secondary to a traumatic cause in its genesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. It is associated with placental polyps which are defined as the coexistence of this trophoblastic， decidual， or fetal， retained after abortion， or cesarean birth 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.

There are also other diagnostic aids such as vaginal ultrasonography hidrosonografia and hysteroscopy with direct visualization and localization retained tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>.\n\n【17】It is common to consider the differential diagnosis between AV fistulas and incomplete abortion or retention of intrauterine remains. After a thorough review， in most of them the AV fistula at the intramyometrial level coexists with remnants at the intrauterine level， so establishing a differential diagnosis is complicated. The hysteroscopy can establish whether or not there remains intracavitary associated or not 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【18】Currently， we can easily suspect this vascular lesion with the incorporation of color Doppler in ultrasound， which increases diagnostic sensitivity； represents a turbulent flow with high velocities and a low resistance index通用删除6(英):<u> 3，4]</u>.\n\n【19】The definitive diagnosis is obtained by applying arteriography uterine arteries will show a tortuous arterial mass with direct communication hypertrophic veins 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-91</u>.\n\n【20】Once the fistula has been diagnosed， initial treatment is usually expectant with or without administration of ergonovines 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Treatment of uterine AVM depends on the patient's symptoms， desire for fertility， and the location of the AVMlesion. The approach divides the asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. Stable asymptomatic cases are treated medically (controls， gestagens， etc.)， since they may even disappear 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In those patients in whom symptoms persist or bleeding transvaginal is abundant conditioning hemodynamic instability should be considered treatment definitive with performing hysterectomy or embolization selective uterine artery 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u> which nowadays is recommended as a treatment of choice its efficacy and preservation of fertility 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【21】Hemostatic curettage is contraindicated as it can accelerate bleeding， life-threatening 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. The follow-up by color Doppler can evaluate the resolution of the MAV， showing the decreased flow and increased resistance in the vasculature for its ability to detect even smalllesions 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【22】Treatment depends mainly on the patient’s hemodynamic stability and the intensity of the bleeding curettage is contraindicated in est as patients.

On detail history she narrated that about 6 months back when she consulted a general surgeon for her isolated right hypochondrial pain. After getting medical examination and indicated investigations， she was labeled a case of acute cholecystitis with cholelithiasis. She was given oral treatment and asked to visit after a couple of weeks to assess resolution of acute condition. Her laparoscopic cholecystectomy was planned. On subsequent visit she denied any fever， vomiting and her intensity of pain was much reduced. So， she was referred to anesthetist for general fitness. Chest X-ray was done that showed left lower zone opacity and she was labeled as a case of community acquired pneumonia . Beside she had no sign and symptoms pertinent to CAP； she was started on treatment and asked for follow up. Her surgery was deferred till resolution of this pneumonia. Follow up visits and radiology showed persistence of this opacity， and luckily her right hypochondrial pain disappears completely during this tenure. She was again started on injectable antibiotics and labeled as having lung abscess but her chest X-ray was not improved and develop no complications. At this time she visited our OPD， after getting detailed history， examination and reviewing her chest X-rays， she was advised to get chest X-ray lateral view . She was advised to get her barium meal studies as suspicion of diaphragmatic defect (Hiatus hernia) and displaced stomach .

Liver dysfunction makes the course of the infection more aggressive. We report the case of a 56-year-old man with a medical history of abstinent alcoholic cirrhosis and repeated infectious events including cervical abscess. He had been scuba diving instructor for 20 years. He presented to the emergency room for chills， rigor， and high temperature.\n\n【2】A Citrobacter freundii prostatitis was identified and treated. Then he reported mechanicallower back pain persisting despite analgesia. MRI of the lumbar spine demonstrated L5/S1 spondylodiscitis with an unusual signal modification of S1 vertebral body. This case enlightens the high susceptibility to bacterial infections in cirrhosis. Special attention should be given in patients who scuba dive regularly in case of bacteremia with back pain.\n\n【3】Keywords： Cirrhosis； Spondylodiscitis； Dysbaric osteonecrosis\n\n【4】Background\n\n【5】Challenged by these repeated spinal infections， two predisposing factors must be discussed：Cirrhosis and potential dysbaric osteonecrosis. Firstly， cirrhosis is a major risk factor for infectious events with increasing frequency of multi-drug resistant bacteria related infections. This infectious predisposition is secondary to the interaction of internal factors such as relative-acquired-immunodeficiency involving both innate and adaptative immunity， increased intestinal mucosa permeability， reduced bile flow or dysbiosis characterized by increased populations ofgram-negative bacilli (Enterobacteriaceae) and gram-positive cocci (Streptococcaceae and Enterococcaceae)通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. External factors as proton-pump inhibitor overuse or multiple antibiotic courses also contribute to this susceptibility 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Those factors lead to chronic immune system exposure to pathogen bacteria notably by translocation which results in chronic inflammation and recurrent sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. By those mechanisms， cirrhotic patients are up to 10 times more likely to develop bacteremia compared to general population 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. Furthermore， infectious events are a major risk factor of cirrhotic decompensation mainly by a higher risk of developing ascites and kidney failure 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Hence these events are independent predictors of death by deeply impacting survival of cirrhotic patients irrespective of remaining liver function or cirrhotic etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>[10-13]</u>. However， spondylodiscitis is a rare disorder which is mainly a secondary infectious site from bloodstream infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Hematogenous spondylodiscitis preferably affects the lumbar spine due to a greater vascularization compared to cervical and thoracic spine 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. In cirrhosis， the typical sources of bloodstream infections are primary infections and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis caused by gram-negative enteric bacilli 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. The prevalence of spondylodiscitis in the Western population is estimated at 0.4to 2.4 per million with cirrhosis as identified risk factor (0.05% of cases)， subject to an obvious lack of data 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Secondly， Dysbaric Osteonecrosis (DON) is a form of Decompression Illness (DCI) characterized by aseptic osteonecrosis due to hyperbaric environment exposure， conditions met in scuba diving. The physiopathology is not well established but the main hypothesis，based on Henry's and Boyle's gas laws， is the intra-tissue loss of solubility for intra-tissue dissolved gas due to ambient pressure decrease during the ascent to the surface.\n\n【6】Intravascular or intra-tissue bubbles will form and embolize in capillaries and cause focal ischemia， or increase the intra-tissue pressure responsible for microvascular collapse 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Anatomical sites preferentially affected are joints， proximal femur， and shoulders， but all can删除1换行theoretically be affected， resulting in bone fractures or irreversible joint damage up to bone collapse requiring orthopedic surgery. The diagnosis of DON is based on radiological signs and clinical history but challenging. Indeed， radiological signs can appear only after a few years after dysbaric environment exposure. Non-invasive therapies are mainly symptomatic (analgesics) and preventive to limit the necrosis progression (exposure to dysbaric environment avoidance mainly). Those therapies are ineffective in case of advanced osteonecrosis for which the last remaining treatment option is orthopedic surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[19-211</u>.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】We report the case of a 56-year-old man with a medical history of abstinent alcoholic cirrhosis， Child-Pugh C11 MELD (Model for end stage liver) score of 21， complicated by portal hypertension and infectious events as cervico-dorsal epiduritis， urinary tract infections， repeated cellulitis for which he is on long-term antibioprophylaxis by cefalexin. He has been a scuba diving instructor for 20 years and dives weekly at shallow depths exclusively with air tanks. His symptoms began with chills and rigor while he was on holiday. This was followed by confusion characterized by spatiotemporal disorientation. Urgent medical check-up was performed concluding at ammoniacal encephalopathy without any identified etiology. He received lactulose enemas. The situation improved， allowing his repatriation to our hospital. Physical examination showed sub-icteric status and flapping tremor. Lab tests showed grade 4 thrombocytopenia (17 ×10/mm通用删除6(英):<u>[150-450</u>×10/mml)， moderate inflammation level (CRP 91.6 mg/l[≤5 mg/l]) with stable kidney function and liver tests. Microbiological tests were performed including blood cultures， chest X-ray and urine examination showing mild leukocyturia (290/pl[<25/pl]) and significant microscopic hematuria (5848/ul [<25/pl]) with negative urine culture. Blood cultures returned positives for multi-resistant Citrobacter freundii. In this context with elevated PSA (5.45ug/l[<2.5ug/l])， it was concluded to a prostatitis with secondary bacteremia. In the meanwhile， the patient developed cirrhotic encephalopathy and liver dysfunction. Intravenous antibiotic therapy by meropenem was then administered and the evolution both clinically and biologically was initially favorable.\n\n【9】After one week of Intra-Venous (IV) antibiotics， a relay to oral ciprofloxacin was performed according to the antibiogram. Then， the patient complained with mechanical lower back pain but responsible for nocturnal insomnia. Considering his previous history of spinal删除1换行infection， a lumbar spine MRI was performed and demonstrated ischemic changes in the fifth Lumbar (L5) vertebral body MRI signal in accordance with the diagnosis of aseptic osteonecrosis complicated by spondylodiscitis . PET-CT was then performed which confirmedthe spondylodiscitis with L5-S1 hypermetabolic infiltration of unfavorable evolution despite IV antibiotherapy characterized by an inflammatory extension to anterior paravertebral musculature. Associated endocarditis was excluded. Surgical options were ruled out due to ascites and decompensated cirrhosis that contraindicated surgery with anterior approach. Despite clinical and biological favorable evolution ， radiological investigations showed paravertebral muscle damages. Blood culture showed persistent Citrobacter freundii growth despite 2-weeks of antibiotic therapy with meropenem relayed by oral ciprofloxacin. IV antibiotic therapy with meropenem was resumed for 2 additional weeks followed by a4-weeks course of oral ciprofloxacin for a total 6 weeks of antibacterial therapy. The patient’s evolution was then favorable， and the patient was discharged after stabilization.

We were also unable to objectively measure the patient's risk of vertebral compression due to the lack of validated scale to evaluate the risk of bone collapse in DON. The Ficat system which evaluates the risk of articular surface collapse for avascular osteonecrosis of femoral head is by default used in the literature for hip DON without any scientific data confirming its diagnostic values for those cases.

If the joint infection leads to sepsis it can cause substantial mortality， especially in cases involving immune-compromised patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>， unusual organisms 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-10]</u>， and delay of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The time frame commonly cited for necessary intervention， however， within the first 48 h， is on a different order than that routinely emphasized for other instances of sepsis. In sepsis the notion of a “golden hour\"has been found such that each single hour of delay worsens mortality from sepsis通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. The caveat of extreme time urgency most emphasized with other presentations of sepsis is not customarily part of the literature of septic joints.\n\n【6】Many times we view， in retrospect， that we have not managed a case as quickly and effectively as we might have liked.Often such reflection falls into the realm of straightforward quality assessment， material considered appropriate for the standard intradepartmental“mortality and morbidity rounds. There are times， however， when a clinician believes both that he and she might have handled a case more expeditiously and also that the case itself was interesting， unusual， confusing or unanticipated enough that it merits review in a broader forum. When the patient has ultimately done well， it is possible to share that learning opportunity more openly.\n\n【7】We present here a case of a young woman with a diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosis(SLE)， End Stage Renal Disease on hemodialysis (ESRD)， and chronic joint pain that progressed into septic shock within hours of presenting to the Emergency Department. We were able to drawlessons from the rapidity of this patient’s deterioration that we believe can apply to all patients presenting with joint pain. We also draw lessons with regard to the care of patients who have indwelling venous catheterization，commenting both on the evaluation and use of such devices. Finally we make some删除1换行comments regarding the care of patients in whom a suspicion exists of pain medication dependence. Primarily we observe that patients presenting with septic joints merit consideration for being treated in an analogous time frame with other patients who present with sepsis.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 26 year old woman with a history of Systemic Lupus Erythematous (SLE) and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on dialysis， presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a complaint of leftknee pain. She had been in the ED the week before for joint pain at which time a diagnosis had been made of Deep Venous Thrombosis(DVT). A prior diagnosis had been recorded on the chart of“drug seeking behavior\"， and staff， familiar with the patient suspected her of having shown the same. The patient denied fever， chills， nausea， vomiting， chest pain or rash.\n\n【10】On examination initial vital signs showed a temperature of 98.9°F， pulse of 98 bpm， blood pressure 93/46 mmHg and respirations 20 per minute.\n\n【11】She was a well developed， well nourished， and chronically ill appearing female crying in pain. Examination of the head， ears， eyes， nose and throat， heart， lungs and abdomen and neurologic system were without abnormalities. A dialysis ‘permacath' catheter was in place in the chest， and not initially noted to appear infected， although the presence or absence of erythema， purulent discharge， swelling or tenderness was not specifically commented upon. Positive findings were confined to the musculoskeletal system which showed a swollen， tender left knee， not noted to be erythematous or hot， but which was very painful to any movement. Skin and neurologic examination was normal.\n\n【12】The patient was initially scheduled for a Complete Blood Count(CBC) and metabolic panel， X-ray of the knee and repeat venous Doppler of the lower extremities. She immediately asked for the proprietary name for an injection of intravenous hydromorphone. Owing to the prior diagnosis of chronic pain and her relationship with a pain consultant familiar with the patient， she was given an oral dose of hydromorphone while a pain management consultant familiar with the patient evaluated her， and recommended an injection of ketorolac and topical 4% lidocaine. The plan was made to obtain X-rays and then perform an arthrocentesis.\n\n【13】Initial blood results returned “Quantity Not Sufficient\"， and the patient refused several times to permit further attempts at intravenous access. As the patient does not urinate，X-raywas delayed by protocol for a serum BHCG， the repeat venous Doppler obtained first， and X-ray of the knee obtained and resulted three hours after presentation.\n\n【14】The X-ray showed a joint effusion. At that time the patient was seen by her nephrologist and her rheumatologist who， with ED resident staff， performed an arthrocentesis of the left knee and obtained cloudy opaque yellow fluid to be sent for cell count and culture. An orthopedist was contacted upon visualization of the specimen， who asked to be informed immediately when results of cell count and gram stain were available.\n\n【15】The patient was recommended for intravenous antibiotics. She was still “vocally refusingperipheral IV placement. Use of the hemodialysis catheter， not customarily use for non hemodialysis reasons， was not initially considered. The decision was made to attempt to sedate the patient with intramuscular ketamine to attempt删除1换行a central line. As the discussion was taking place， the patient was noted to appear increasingly ill， her vocal protestations against line placement appeared less focused， and her BP was found to drop to75 systolic. The diagnosis was made of sepsis with impending septic shock. After immediate consultation with the patient’s nephrologist the decision was then made to access the patient's dialysis port， to give fluid bolus and intravenous antibiotics.\n\n【16】Results of the body fluid analysis returned. The specimen contained 9700 White Blood Cells (WBC)， with a differential of82% PMNs， and 7000 red blood cells. Gram stain showed 1+ Gram positive cocci in clusters. An orthopedist was called with the results. The initial impression was that 9700 WBC was indeterminate and that contaminant bacteria in the cocci family can be found， but upon hearing that the clinical course of the patient was deteriorating an operating room time was set for one hour and the patient was prepared for immediate surgery.\n\n【17】As the clinical condition appeared to worsen， and surgery was imminent， the decision was made to intubate the patient. It was decided to institute vigorous fluid resuscitation and an infusion of norepinephrine was begun. The patient was escorted to the operating room where an incision and drainage of the knee with washout was performed， draining grossly purulent material. Shortly after surgery the laboratory values obtained during access of the central line were available and revealed WBC 0.5， Hgb 5.7， and platelets 28. The patient had been considering renal transplant and family were initially resistant to the idea of transfusion.\n\n【18】The patient remained intubated and on vasopressor support for the first day. Cultures were positive for MSSA from both blood and joint cultures. Suspecting the dialysis catheter to be a likely source of contamination the catheter was removed and cultured， and another later reinserted after several days of antibiotics. The family reconsidered their opposition to transfusion and two units of packed red blood cells were given. White blood count began to return to normal. Over the next few days then patient gradually could be weaned off pressure support and extubated.\n\n【19】Her clinical condition improved steadily， and she was transferred from the ICU to the floor. She had several dialysis sessions as an inpatient， had extensive evaluations regarding continued pain management， was ultimately discharged to rehabilitation and has subsequently done well.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】We believe that this case presents several management issues which merit review. As has been emphasized in a myriad ofliterature， the key to treatment of septic shock is early， almost immediate recognition and the institution of aggressive fluid resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic treatment 11-14.\n\n【22】Reviews of the common emergency presentation of a painful joint swelling identify the septic joint as the most threatening possibility among a wide differential diagnosis， and cite delayed identification and treatment as a major cause of morbidity， permanent joint destruction， as well as mortality with a case fatality rate cited as high as 11% to 16%通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Although the classic presentation is one of sudden onset of a single，hot， swollen， painful joint， which resists any movement， some patients will present with multiple joints and longer onset删除4-1:<u>21</u>.\n\n【23】One systematic review 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> of eighty better quality studies drawn删除1换行from thirty to fifty years of literature review found that： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the vast majority of cases were gram positive organisms， with greater than90% being staphylococci or streptococci； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> common risk factors include arthritis， either Rheumatoid or osteoarthritis， prosthetic joints， diabetes， cutaneous ulcers， prior joint instrumentation， and low socioeconomic status， alcohol or intravenous drug abuse；通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> more than a fifth of the cases presented as polyarthritis so that multiple joint presentation cannot be relied upon as suggestive of a more benign etiology； 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> a duration of symptoms is usually in the range of less than two weeks but may be longer with organisms of lower virulence 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> the absence of fever does not exclude an infected joint 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3，15]</u>.\n\n【24】The importance of prompt and timely diagnosis of the septic joint is wellappreciated 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，11-14]</u>，but the time course is usually considered to be within the day， and the notion of the “golden hour” for septic shock is not often considered. Most interestingly， in a comprehensive review this year of the most modern approach to septic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>， a table showing “potential sources of infection associated with sepsis by organ system\"， admittedly not exhaustive， did not include septic arthritis. The three most commonly associated sources for sepsis are lung， abdomen and urinary tract and potential septic arthritis is not commonly considered as a high likelihood precipitant of septic shock. Of course， the phrase “septic arthritis\"， more properly pyogenic or infectious arthritis does not always induce a state of septic shock，and there are “mimics” of the condition 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Ours， however， was a case where， we believe， had the onus of time consideration followed septic shock guidelines rather than those usually cited for pyogenic arthritis， the initial course in the department might have been different.\n\n【25】Septic arthritis in immune-compromised patient can have fatal consequences. Salar et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> present a case of a 63 year old female with rheumatoid arthritis who， on a second presentation for joint pain was initially treated for RA exacerbation， but was found ultimately to have multiple septic joints. Despite two joint washouts and 14 days of intensive care and antibiotics， she died in septic shock. The rapid progression from pyogenic arthritis into septic shock is not frequently seen in the same time line as we have come to view the usual presentation of sepsis. In that patient， for example， the interval from presentation with joint pain to hemodynamic compromise was several days.\n\n【26】One factor in which the primary clinician may have been more focused， which may have been used to better advantage in facilitating the care of this patient would have been to have focused greater attention to the possibility of line sepsis in a patient with ESRD and indwelling venous access. Catheter related blood stream infections are the second most common cause of death in patients on hemodialysis， with a 28 fold increase in infection when compared to matched patients without renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Rates of infection have been shown to range from 0.19 up to 5.1 incidence per 1000 patient days 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u>. This is due to several factors， including comorbidities， disruption of the natural skin barrier， as well as immune dysfunction caused by uremia， which would have been doubly relevant in our patient with SLE. In patients requiring intravenous access for hemodialysis， central venous catheters have been associated with a 15 fold increase in bacteremia 通用删除6(英):<u>[18-21]</u>.\n\nWhile the tunneled central venous catheter for our patient was not initially noted to show clinical signs of infection in our patient， the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) notes that clinical signs of erythema， induration and tenderness are not necessarily删除1换行reliable when evaluating for bacteremia due to indwelling catheters， so called Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections (CRBSI) 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Rather the diagnosis of CRBSI relies on catheter removal followed by sending both the severed tip of the catheter and peripheral blood for culture. Extra caution is recommended in such patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[16，17]</u>， and it is possible that had the risk of bacteremia in presence of an indwelling catheter initially recognized， the association with a painful swollen joint might have immediately led to a greater impetus to initiate vigorous sepsis resuscitation. This consideration mitigates，in some degree， our caution that any septic joint might be a harbinger of septic shock， however does highlight the demand to be particularly vigilant to sources of hematogenous spread to a septic joint， before bacteremia leads to sepsis and shock|删除段之间换行|As our patient refused intravenous catheter attempts， which left the dilemma that removal of the catheter would have left no vascular access. Our general practice is to avoid when possible using hemodialysis catheters other than for hemodialysis， and it has been recommended that health care personnel who do so， usually nursing， have specialized training， competence assessment procedures and protocols 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. As our patient bordered on extremis， it was decided to use the catheter after communication with the nephrologyconsultants. To eliminate potential communication delays， procedural texts in emergency medicine have recommended accessing hemodialysis catheters by emergency providers in emergent scenarios 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>.\n\n【28】The finding of a relative low joint fluid white blood count in what was found to be a septic joint is particularly worth note. The range of joint fluid WBC commonly cited as suggestive of septic joint needs to be tempered with an awareness of the systemic WBC. A synovial fluid WBC of greater than 50，000 or even more specifically 100，000with differential of 90% PMNs is commonly cited as indicating bacterial arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. However patients with peripheral neutropenia can been shown to have decreased joint fluid white blood cell count， and patients with peripheral neutropenia have been reported to have culture proven septic arthritis with very minimal synovial fluid neutrophils 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，25]</u>. One needs to be vigilant for the possibility of septic arthritis in a neutropenic patient with a low synovial white count. A patient with either overwhelming sepsis or SLE can become neutropenic 通用删除6(英):<u>[26，27]</u>. According to our orthopedic author， it was the patient's clinical deterioration， and not the initial joint fluid cell count which prompted immediate surgical intervention.\n\n【29】One review 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> found no single marker in joint fluid aspiration to reliably rule out a septic joint. Of further interest is the fact that serum WBC and inflammatory markers such as ESR and C-reactive protein are useful in monitoring response to treatment，however their absence does not exclude the septic joint. Mcgillicudy et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> report that the previously suggested threshold of 50，000 synovial WBC lacks the sensitivity to be clinically useful in ruling out septic arthritis. Furthermore， one would think that laboratory guideline is even less helpful in a patient with SLE given normal levels are commonly seen approaching 40，000 white blood cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>.\n\n【30】It has been commonly held that delayed diagnosis can lead to profound， extensive cartilage damage within hours even when sepsis is not present， however not every review has found delay in surgical treatment to have a significant effect on outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>[31，32]</u>. In assessing the need for immediate surgical debridement， some studies have found no difference on mortality or incidence of ICU admission with early surgical debridement. However， each of their patients had diagnostic arthrocentesis and institution of antibiotics. It删除1换行may be that in patients who have had early diagnostic arthrocentesis and institution of appropriate antibiotics， the difference cannot be shown between six and twenty four hours until surgical washout. However septic arthritis should always be treated as a potential septic emergency and diagnosis and institution of definitive therapy needs to be started in a time frame corresponding to sepsis， especially in the immunocompromised patient.\n\n【31】Finally， one area which on reflection is troubling， or rather， illuminating about the care of our patient is to question what effect a prior suspicion of pain medication seeking behavior may have had on the pace of her evaluation. Especially in an era of changing perceptions regarding opioid use and increased sensitivity to the possibility of pain management seeking， one has to be increasingly careful to avoid bias and minimization of symptoms. Although there were several elements already mentioned which affected the rapidity of diagnosis and treatment， one must consider whether the perception that this patient had a chronic pain condition， and that the patient had been indicated in the chart as possibly presenting with pain seeking behavior， and that the patient had recently presented with the same complaint and was identified by a staff member from recent memory as a potential drug seeker all may have contributed to moderating the pace of what might have otherwise been a higher priority and more immediate diagnostic endeavor.\n\n【32】There is extensive literature regarding delays in treatment of pain in patients as a function of age 通用删除6(英):<u>[33，34]</u>， gender 通用删除6(英):<u>[35，36]</u> and race 通用删除6(英):<u>[37-40]</u>， however we did not find prior literature reporting the delay of diagnosis of a significant medical condition based on a perception of drug seeking in the patient. Of course， that might be a situation difficult to report and own up to.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】We believe that this presentation of a rapid development of septic shock in a patient presenting with an isolated painful joint serves as a reminder of the importance of rapid identification and institution of treatment of sepsis， in the patient with a septic joint， especially in the immunocompromised state. It is a further reminder of the need for special attention， and sometimes uses of long term indwelling venous access catheters. It also serves to remind us that patients with frequent use and demand for opioid analgesia often， if not always， seek pain relief from frequent and recurrent real pain and that these patients may be doubly at risk for potentially serious and catastrophic consequences when symptoms are viewed through the lens of pain medication seeking.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Placental and autopsy investigations confirmed in-utero transmission of disseminated congenital HSV-2 infection without any maternal history of HSV.\n\n【2】Keywords： Congenital HSV； Extreme prematurity； Hydops-fetalis\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】An extremely premature male infant was born at 25 weeks gestation by an emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress. The mother was a 23-year-old primigravida. Her prenatal laboratory tests were negative for any sexually transmitted infection including syphilis， gonorrhea， chlamydia， human immunodeficiency virus， and group B Streptococcus. She was immune to rubella. She had no current or past history of genital or oral Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection.\n\n【5】At 17 weeks of pregnancy，the mother was admitted with vaginalleakage of dark amniotic fluid followed by fever (38.9 Co). She was treated with antibiotics including ampicillin，clindamycin， and azithromycin for chorioamnionitis and threatened loss of pregnancy. Expectant management was successful as pregnancy progressed without further leakage of amniotic fluid to 25-week gestation. Mother reported decreased fetal movements during her clinic visit at 25-week of gestation. She was admitted to the hospital for fetal monitoring. She was not in preterm labor and membranes of amniotic sac were intact. Fetal biophysical profile of 3 out of total 10 (1 for heart rate， 2 for amniotic fluid)， indicative of poor fetal well-being prompting delivery by an emergency cesarean section. Membranes were ruptured in operation room at delivery. Apgar scores were l and 3 at 1 and 5min， respectively. Infant required resuscitation at birth with endotracheal intubation， mechanical ventilation，external cardiac compressions and administration of epinephrine.\n\n【6】At birth， the infant appeared hydropic with generalized body-wall edema， protuberant， firm abdomen due to severe hepatosplenomegaly with liver margin reaching 2 cm above the pelvic brim and ascites. The infant was large for gestational age with a birth weight of 1，090 gm primarily because of diffuse edema. Soon after birth， diffuse bullae developed over extensive areas of the skin covering the face， arms， chest， and abdomen that progressed to diffuse sloughing of the skin . These quickly became hemorrhagic. By four hours of life， the infant developed profuse bleeding from the endotracheal tube， orogastric tube and insertion sites of umbilical catheters. Laboratory tests showed disseminated coagulopathy that was treated promptly with infusions of fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate followed by platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia. Continuous infusion of dopamine and dobutamine were administered to treat hypotension. Broad spectrum antibiotics including ampicillin and gentamicin were administered for suspected sepsis. In view of infant's critical condition， empiric antiviral medication， acyclovir (15 mg/kg/dose divided every12 h) was added despite negative maternal history for HSV. Ancillary laboratory studies revealed thrombocytopenia (platelet count =30，000/mm’)， leukocytosis (white blood cell count =81，600/mm)，and high concentrations of serum transaminases (Aspartate Transaminase，AST>10，000U/L， Alanine Transaminase，ALT=972U/L). Bacterial cultures of blood and fluid specimen from dermal bullae were negative. However， HSV-2 was detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction test (PCR) in specimens obtained from blood， mouth，hemorrhagic skin bullae， rectum and placenta. Despite all supportive treatment， infant did not survive beyond the first day of life.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】HSV infection in neonates has devastating consequences with high mortality and morbidity despite treatment with acyclovir 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Advances in medicine have reduced neonatal mortality rates in disseminated HSV infection from 85% to 29% and in isolated central nervous system disease， from 50% to 4% 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Primary infection during pregnancy is more severe than in the non-pregnant state with a greater risk of infecting fetus (50%) with primary infection than with recurrent infection (<3%).\n\n【9】Vertical transmission from mother to the neonate can occur in-utero (5%)， during perinatal (85%) or during postnatal period(10%)通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Ascending infection along the birth canal in the presence of rupture of membranes from active genital lesions is an important mode of transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Mother in our case did not experience any genital lesions during the pregnancy or around the time of birth. The epidemiological data do support that 70% of congenital HSV infection cases present with no preceding maternal history of HSV. Furthermore，congenital HSV in extremepremature infants， as in our case， can present in non-classical manner with atypical presentation删除4-1:<u>1-3</u>.\n\n【10】It was unusual in our case that although there was vaginal leakage of two-day duration at 17 wk. of gestation， subsequent fetal ultrasounds indicated that ruptured membranes had sealed with re-accumulation of amniotic fluid. Amniotic membranes remained intact from 17 wk. onwards until theywere ruptured artificially during cesarean section. Amniotic fluid was light yellowish to dark brown in color reflecting in-utero infection. As is usual practice， in most of these cases， includingours，appropriate antibiotics were administered to mother following prolonged vaginal leakage of amniotic fluid at17 wk. of gestation but she was not screened for HSV at that time. Clearly antibiotics can only be beneficial if the intrauterine infection is of bacterial origin. As reported recently， microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity can occur due to microorganisms other than bacteria where viral infection can play a role in pregnancy loss or early neonatal death 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. We believe that in our case， HSV was inoculated into feto-placental unit at 17-wk. of age when the mother experienced amniotic fluid leakage. Although pregnancy progressed subsequently in asymptomatic manner， congenital viral infection reactivated删除1换行when the mother began experiencing decreased fetal movements. As described in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， this assertion is further supported by the placental pathology in our case which showed areas of focal opacification with degradation ofamniotic membranes and chorionic villi and necrotizing inflammation with stromal cell necrosis of umbilical cord and fetal surface. The HSV DNA PCR was also positive for HSV-2 from placenta that was trans-abdominally delivered in sterile manner trans-abdominally during Cesarean section 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【11】While congenital HSV infection presents most commonly as either Skin， Eyes and Mucosal disease (SEM) or CNS infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>， our case presented with the least common variant， as the disseminated disease with hepatosplenomegaly and hydrops. As in our case， HSV infections can have atypical presentation in premature infants attributable to an immature immunologic response to the virus通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Typically， cutaneous HSV is described as vesicular or pustular eruptions with erythematous base 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Our case rapidly developed diffuse，large hemorrhagic bullous lesions coalescing together within a matter of few hours of birth， progressing rapidly with sloughing of skin . This was highly unusual and unique presentation. The lesions appeared somewhat similar to infants presenting with scalded skin syndrome， aplasia cutis congenital or congenital bullous dermal disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. A somewhat similar case of vesiculobullous lesions in a 27-week-gestation preterm neonate with HSV has been reported before but unlike our case， active recurrent genital lesions of HSV were present in the mother prior to delivery in that case 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. The findings of leukocytosis and hydrops with severe hepatosplenomegaly in our case were also consistent with previous rare reports of neonatal HSV disease and with in-utero transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3]</u>.\n\n【12】The presence of fever with premature prolonged rupture of membrane as in our case without any evidence of a bacterial infection highlights the need to investigate an alternative infectious etiology. It is prudent to have a high index of suspicion for HSV in such cases and to screen mothers for HSV-2 in addition to screening for bacterial infection. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics has provided guidelines for the management of neonatal HSV among those with maternal history of HSV and for those with primary and recurrent exposure， screening for HSV during pregnancy is not yet routine practice in the United States specifically in the absence of positive maternal history of HSV infection or in the absence of perinatal exposure. As most cases of neonatal HSV infection occur following cervical viral shedding without any clinically detectable genital lesion， universal maternal screening for HSV serology is warranted 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The epidemiologic data suggesting a rise in the prevalence of neonatal HSV infection because more HSV-1 sero-negative individuals are entering sexually active age group combined with the changing sexual practices， the need for universal maternal screening is even more important. In addition， continued adherence to measures preventing vertical transmission from mother to neonate in the presence of known maternal history， including maternal treatment and prophylaxis with acyclovir， may check potential future increase in neonatal herpes infections. Trans-placental passage of acyclovir has been shown to offer protection to the fetus against maternal viremia； however， justification of its use in preventing neonatal HSV in the absence of documented maternal HSV infection remains unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. Additionally， various prototypes for both therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines are being developed but none has yet been proven effective for mass use. Continued investigations to analyze cost-based efficacy of vaccines against genital herpes maybe justifiable 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】In-utero transmission of HSV-2 with absence of maternal history of HSV and with absence of premature perinatal rupture of membrane as in our case is rare. Our case highlights the importance of considering HSV infection in pregnant women presenting with intra-partum fever without a clear bacterial etiology， and screening all mothers for HSV even in the absence of history or in the absence of active genitallesions. Congenital HSV infection continues to exert high mortality and morbidity in neonates. The outcome is even more severe among extremely premature infants often resulting in loss of pregnancy during first or second trimester. Our case also highlights the rare form of cutaneous， systemic presentation with hydrops in extreme premature infants. Empiric and early treatment with acyclovir should be considered particularly in a sick premature infant with unique vesicobullous lesions even in the absence of maternal history and in the absence of history of exposure to HSV because of very high mortality. There is a need for continuing research on identifying newer strategies for screening and treatment of HSV during pregnancy so that in-utero HSV transmission to the fetus can be prevented even in asymptomatic women with subclinical infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Inflammatory complications of pilonidal disease such as cellulitis， abscess，and recurrent sinus tracts are well known to general surgeons 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In rare cases， long-lasting inflammation can lead to malignant transformation of the disease， most commonly to Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-6]</u>. The incidence of carcinoma development in pilonidal disease is less than 0.1% and is associated with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. Carcinomas may show uncontrollable growth and cause substantial disfigurement. Giant cutaneous SCCs larger than 5 cm in diameter are uncommon and can be very difficult to treat 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>. Total surgical resection with free margins is the treatment of choice for SCCs arising from pilonidal disease， and tissue defects can be repaired using rotational flaps or skin grafts 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Here， we present a case of a patient who underwent excision of a huge cutaneous tumor arising from pilonidal sinus on the midline of the gluteal region with an optimal clinical result.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】The patient was a 66-year-old male retired truck driver with a 5-year history of a growing cutaneous mass on the midline in his gluteal region who was admitted to the general surgery unit. The mass was a protruding， fungating， ulcerated， firm， cauliflower-like tumor. The lesion measured6.5 cm x14.2 cm x16.8 cm that had developed over a large erythematous skin area . He reported that the tumor developed and reached that size within a 5-year period. However， 10 years ago， he had developed Pilonidal Sinus (PNS)， for which he did not seek medical advice. Instead， the PNS was managed by herbal remedies and moxibustion， causing irritation to the area. Thereafter，删除1换行cited.\n\n【9】the PNS burst open with foul-smelling pus and bloody discharge. The patient recognized that the skin lesion had developed from the PNS but neglected treatment. He finally sought medical advice because of recurrent bleeding， a foul stench emanating from the lesion， and troublesome wound care. He had a history ofweight and appetite loss but did not have a history of fever or changes in bowel habits.\n\n【10】Examination\n\n【11】The patient was conscious at the time of examination； his condition was vitally stable and afebrile； oriented. The examination findings were as follows： Temperature， 36.8C； heart rate， 93 beats per minute； respiratory rate， 20 breaths per minute； blood pressure，106/60 mmHg； SpO。 99%； and weight， 50 kg. A perirectal digital删除1换行examination showed impacted stool， a normal sphincter tone， and no perirectal bleeding， masses， or ulcer. The patient was admitted for observation and further investigations and administered analgesia， antibiotics， and gastrointestinal and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxes. A punch biopsy was performed for the ulcer margin， the histological examination of which revealed a moderately differentiated， keratinizing SCC of stage T4N0Mx according to American Joint Committee on Cancer staging. Preoperative work-up included a CT scan of the pelvic and abdomen， which showed a posterior superficial cutaneous enhancing mass extending deeply to the gluteal muscle and sacrum with no intraperitoneal extension associated with possible bony erosion but no clear destruction. No lymph node or distant metastases were noted on imaging . No suspicious pulmonary nodules were identified in chest CT. Lumbosacral spin radiography showed mild degenerative changes of the spine， and no other detectable abnormality was identified. MRI of the pelvis indicated a giant exophytic cutaneous gluteal mass with aggressive behavior that showed early infiltration to the adjacent subcutaneous fat， muscles， and bone. No extension to the rectum was observed . A Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan showed a large hypermetabolic posterior subcutaneous soft tissue mass lesion in the midline of the gluteal region. Hypermetabolic small lesions in the third part of the duodenum may represent small bowel Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)， while ectopic pancreatic tissue is another possibility. A small mass lesion with low 18-Fluoro-2-Deoxyglucose (FDG) avidity is likely to be benign in nature. A multidisciplinary team met with an oncologist and a plastic surgeon， and a decision was made to perform total surgical resection of the mass and coverage with a rotational locoregional flap， skin graft， and Vacuum-Assisted Closure (VAC) application.\n\n【12】Hospital course\n\n【13】The patient was malnourished and showed low albumin levels (18g/L). Therefore， he was started on a high-protein， high-calorie diet. Furthermore， he was losing sleep， had a poor oral intake， and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder during his hospital stay； mirtazapine7.5 mg PO HS was started. He consented to an operation and after induction of general anesthesia； he was placed in the prone position and underwent preparation and draping under sterile conditions. The tumor was totally excised layer-by-layer till the sacral bone was reached. with 0.3 cm from the deep margin， 1 cm away from the right mucosal margin， 1.5 cm away from the left mucosal margin， 1.5 cm away from the superior mucosal margin， and 2 cm away from the inferior mucosal margin around it  next， freshly frozen sections were sent for histological analysis， and the results were negative (free margin). A histological examination of the surgical\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Pilonidal sinus disease is a long-standing inflammatory disease that often arises from the hair follicles of the natal cleft of the sacrococcygeal area 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Pilonidal sinus recurrence is a matter of concern to both patients and healthcare providers 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Its risk factors include obesity， sedentary lifestyle， family history， hirsute删除1换行body habits， and trauma or irritation to the gluteal cleft skin 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【16】SCCs arising in a pilonidal sinus are extremely rare complications of a common disease. SCCs have been shown to develop more frequently from chronic precursor lesions， including chronic ulcers， sinus tracts， orburns 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. We observed this phenomenon in our patient， with the patient's son reporting that the mass started growing in the patient's buttock and that the patient noticed it arising from the PNS over five years of multiple trials with herbal remedies and moxibustion. Thus， the duration ofthe disease is a significant factor influencing the malignant transformation of a pilonidal sinus 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The present case is extraordinary in many respects， considering the site of the tumor and the fact that the buttock is not a sun-exposed site. With regard to the molecular basis， the pathogenesis was considered to involve the release of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species (RONs) produced by inflammatory cells at sites of infection inducing DNA damage. Moreover， RONs can also amplify inflammatory responses， leading to increased DNA damage that predisposes patients to malignancy. Immunosuppression and human papilloma virus infection may also be predisposing factors inducing this transformation 通用删除6(英):<u>[15-17]</u>. Almost all tumors arising from pilonidal sinuses are SCCs (90%). Uncommon subtypes such as basal cell carcinomas， adenocarcinoma， and verrucous carcinomas have also been reported. Preoperative evaluations in such cases should include historical examination of an excised or untreated pilonidal disease along with clinical inspection and rectal and sigmoidoscopic examinations 通用删除6(英):<u>[18，19]</u>. In the present case， malignant transformation was suspected due to the recurrence， chronicity，and delayedhealing. However，the diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy. Since carcinoma tends to be deeply invasive， preoperative assessment of the degree of invasion by physical examination and endoscopic examination complemented by CT scans or MRI for the sacral region are crucial. In our case， the mass extended deeply to the gluteal muscle and sacrum with no extension to the rectum. Although distant metastases are rare since most cases tend to be locally extensive， positron emission tomography is a good tool to exclude metastases. CT scans or MRI in addition to careful palpation of inguinal lymph nodes can be used to assess intra-abdominal metastasis， including the spread to the iliac and para-aortic lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>[18，19]</u>. In our case， preoperative MRI and PET scan showed negative findings for metastasis. According to a literature review， en bloc resection including at least a wide margin of skin， presacral fascia， subcutaneous fat tissue， gluteal muscle， and， if required， bone is the treatment of choice 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Prophylactic inguinal node dissection is not recommended. Radiation alone or postoperatively has not been beneficial in trial reviews， although local control has been obtained for moderate periods of time 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The decision in our case was to only perform a total surgical resection of the mass. The resulting defect can be repaired by performing primary or delayed reconstruction. Depending on the size of the postoperative defect， skin grafts or local flaps are being used for the reconstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. In the present case， the plan was to cover the defect with a rotational locoregional flap， skin graft， and VAC application. Recurrence rates can be as high as40% to 50%，and recurrence usually appears 9 to 16 months after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The 5-year survival rate of patients with SCCs arising from pilonidal sinus disease is almost 55% to 61% 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Metastasis appears in 14% ofpatients and is usually fatal 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Considering the high recurrence rate， regular postoperative check-ups are recommended every 3 months during the first 2 years， every 6 months for the next3 years， and yearly afterwards 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. These checkups should consist of physical examination along with abdominal CT scans to excludelocal删除1换行recurrence or distant metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>.\n\n【17】Table 1： Labs at admission： (WBC) White Blood Cell， (BUN) Blood Urea Nitrogen， (PT) Prothrombin Time， (INR) International Normalized Ratio， (APTT) Activated Partial Thromboplastin， (Al kph) Alkaline phosphatase.\n\n| WBC  | Haemoglobin  | Platelets  | Sodium  | Potassium  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 7.97x10%L  | 8.7 g/dL  | 500x10%L  | 135 mmol/L  | 3.4 mmol/L  |\n| Creatinine  | BUN  | PT  | INR  | APTT  |\n| 84 mmol/L  | 4.1 mmol/L  | 17.9  | 1.3  | 32  |\n| Bilirubin total  | Alk.

He was conscious and alert on arrival， and able to give an approximately two week history of occasional visual disturbance and dizziness. Cerebellar signs were evident on examination. Initial imaging was inconclusive， although suspicious for pathology. The clinical team were asked to bring the patient back to the radiology department for repeat Computed Tomography (CT) with angiography of the intracranial vessels. This revealed an almost complete occlusion of the left vertebral artery， and cerebellar infarction. An atypical presentation of cerebrovascular ischemia， this patient was transferred to the local stroke unit for further treatment.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Cerebrovascular accident is a very common presentation to the emergency department， and is increasingly common amongst Western populations. Seizure is not usually considered as a presenting feature of ischemic cerebral events， and more commonly associated with the post-stroke period. Wepresent this case for clinicians to consider ischemic in addition to hemorrhagic stroke as the underlying aetiology in a patient presenting with new onset seizures.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 56 year old man， was brought to the emergency department by ambulance， having suffered two witnessed tonic-clonic seizures whilst at work. On arrival into the department，he was alert，with observations within normal parameters， Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 15， and normoglycemia. Seizures had been terminated with intravenous benzodiazepines with the paramedic crew.\n\n【6】He described feeling generally unwell throughout the morning， associated with dizziness and blurred vision. There was no associated headache. On further questioning，he had been experiencing these symptoms episodically over the preceding fortnight. There were no concerning cardiac， respiratory， or gastrointestinal features in the history relating to his presentation.\n\n【7】Significant past medical history included hypertension and hypercholesterolemia， for which he was taking a statin， and ramipril. He had a moderate smoking history， and drank below the recommended weekly alcohol limit.\n\n【8】Examination findings of significance were a persistent nystagmus in all directions of gaze beyond what would be expected post-ictally， past pointing， and normal tone and power in the limbs and facial musculature.\n\n【9】Initial suspicions for the cause of seizure given the clinical findings and age of this patient were of a spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage affecting the cerebellum. Computed Tomography (CT) scanning did not reveal any areas of hemorrhage. Initial unenhanced CT imaging however， did reveal a dense left vertebral artery， suspicious for thrombus， and the patient was therefore recalled for CT intracranial angiogram . Advanced imaging then revealed reduced contrast filling in the left vertebral artery， confirming suspicions of acute thrombus in this vessel.\n\n【10】Differential Diagnosis\n\n【11】An intracranial cause for the seizures was suggested by the persisting neurological signs following the cessation of seizure activity，and a rapidly improving post-ictal state. Whilst vascular risk factors删除1换行were present， the age of the patient suggested a hemorrhagic event， although an absence of headache went against this. Cerebellar signs localized the lesion to the posterior circulation.\n\n【12】Treatment\n\n【13】Initial treatment was supportive， with oxygen and intravenous fluids promptly given. No pharmacological treatment for convulsions was administered as these had terminated prior to his arrival. Once stroke was confirmed on intracranial angiography， oral antiplatelets were given. Further therapy was carried out at the local Hyperacute Stroke Unit(HASU)，which is based at a different site to the emergency department which this patient attended.\n\n【14】Outcome and Follow-Up\n\n【15】After transfer to a local HASU， this patient was discharged after a short period oftreatment and is recovering well at home.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】We report a case of complete vertebral artery occlusion presenting as generalized tonic-clonic seizures in a patient with vascular risk factors， however no previous stroke or seizure history. Whilst under-recognized as a presenting feature of stroke， several cases are reported in the literature. These cases involve both anterior and posterior cerebral circulations.\n\n【18】A.ssociations between cerebralischemia and disorders of movement are well recognized. These associations encompass focal weakness， hyperkinesia， post-stroke seizure， and infrequently， seizure as a presenting feature. Furthermore， there are a number of neurological conditions which can mimic the typical phenotype of an ischemic stroke.\n\n【19】Seizure mimic in the context of stroke can include the sequelae of thalamic/subthalamic infarct， known as hemiballismus. This is characterized byuncontrollable violent， usuallyunilateral，movements ofthelimbs. Stroke mimic in the context of non-ischemic neurological disease is also well recognized. Hemiparesis and speech difficulty can either precede or follow severe attacks of migraine and true epileptic activity， the latter often termed \"Todd's paresis’. Differentiating these conditions from true seizure activity as a presenting feature of stroke relies upon accurate history taking， including a full past medical and drug history. This is crucial in determining the chronology of neurological deficit， and associated features， to guide clinicians in the删除1换行correct diagnosis of the underlying condition.\n\n【20】True seizure activity has been reported as the presenting feature of both anterior and posterior circulation stroke. Otsuji et al. report three similar cases of posterior circulation infarction presenting with seizures， each treated with mechanical thrombectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Post-seizure conscious level was impaired with each patient， as in our case， with thrombus demonstrated on subsequent angiography. Similarly， basilar artery occlusion has been associated with generalized seizure as the presenting feature， 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> whilst pontine infarction and abnormal posturing is also reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Multiple acute lacunar infarcts presented with seizure in a case report published by Marian et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> interestingly with no other appreciable neurological deficit on examination.\n\n【21】The mechanism of seizure in acute stroke is not well understood. Disruption of the blood supply to neurons is known to induce hypoxic changes， which in turn can result in the formation of an epileptic focus through metabolic and electrical changes in neuronal membranes and their environments 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Similarly， disruption of descending tracts can result in abnormal posturing 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-7]</u>， which can be mistaken for true seizure activity.\n\n【22】It is likely that in this case， the preceding symptoms of dizziness and blurred vision leading up to presentation were transient ischemic attacks affecting the cerebellum. We recognize that in this case， seizure activity was not witnessed by healthcare professionals， and it is possible that whilst true seizures may have occurred，abnormal posturing could have been mistaken for true convulsive activity. In either case， involvement of the vertebro-basilar system in acute ischemic stroke is associated with movement disorder in a number of published reports\n\n【23】Learning Points\n\n【24】Although common presentations of common conditions are most likely， it is important to consider atypical presentations of common conditions.\n\n【25】Neurological signs persisting beyond the post-ictal period should raise suspicion of an underlying cause for seizures.\n\n【26】New onset seizures in adult/elderly patients with vascular risk factors are red flag features for intracranial pathology.\n\n【27】Good communication between teams is essential when specialist services are split across various hospitals in order to facilitate timely transfer of patients when clinically necessary.\n\n【28】Patient's Perspective\n\n【29】“Please be aware， I then had another episode on the 30h of April， and was admitted to hospital， and released after 2 weeks， then had another stroke on the 6th June.\n\n【30】I have just been discharged and returned home on the 18h of June， watch this space!”", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Nonetheless， data regarding aortomitral continuity as substrate for PVC in normal hearts is still limited. We present 3 cases of young patients without structural heart disease， with frequent symptomatic PVC， without clinical improvement after anti-arrhythmic drugs treatment. All patients were submitted to an electrophysiological study that identified the aortomitral continuity as the earliest site ofPVCactivation. After a successful ablation， all the patients improved their clinical status. These cases and literature review of the aortomitral continuity substrate highlight the indications， efficacy， safety and limitations of catheter ablation.\n\n【2】Keywords： Ventricular premature contractions； Aortomitral continuity； Left ventricular outflow tract； Radiofrequency ablation\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】In the absence of structural heart disease， the presence of Premature Ventricular Contractions(PVC) or Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) is frequentlylocated in the Right Ventricular Outflow Tract(RVOT) or Left Ventricular Outflow Tract (LVOT). The complex relationships between the LVOT and the surrounding structures and its unique electrophysiological properties can limit the physician approach.Regarding the LVOT，PVC can arise from some sites surrounding the LVOT， such as the aortic root and aortic cusps， the mitral annulus， the superior basal septum， the epicardium and the Aortomitral Continuity (AMC) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The AMC is defined as the continuation of the anteromedial aspect of the mitral annulus to the aortic valve； it consists of a curtain of fibrous tissue extending from the anterior mitral valve leaflet to the left and noncoronary aortic cusp. The AMC is connected with the left and right fibrous trigones to ventricular myocardium and the right fibrous trigone to the membranous ventricular septum 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> .\n\n【5】The knowledge of the electrophysiological properties of the LVOT arrhythmias are incomplete通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， and the ECG does not allow the precise localization of the PVC origin 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. AMC and PVC are uncommon and have limited literature information， which may difficult mapping and ablation procedure. We describe three patients with symptomatic AMC PVC refractory to Anti-Arrhythmic Drugs (AAD)， who were submitted to catheter ablation that result in a complete PVC suppression.\n\n【6】Case Series\n\n【7】Case 1\n\nThirty-three years-old female complaining of frequent palpitations. The ECG showed frequent PVC with inferior axis ， with more than 50000 monomorphic PVC on 24 h Holter monitoring. Transthoracic echocardiography and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy excluded structural heart disease or ischemia. An Electrophysiological Study (EPS) with 3D electroanatomic endocardial mapping was guided by the Ensite NavX/Velocity mapping system (Abbot， St Paul， USA). Through a 7F arterial short sheath in the right femoral vein， an irrigated-tip therapy ablation catheter (SmartTouch Thermocool； Biosense) was inserted via transseptal approach for mapping and ablation. Clinical PVC was sustained during mapping and the 3-Dimensional geometry identified the AMC as the PVC substrate . Radiofrequency (RF) ablation was then targeted at the AMC site， with a power range from 30W to 40W， with a maximum temperature limited to 40°C， and a flow of 12 ml/min. PVC elimination was achieved on the third RF attempt. Three weeks after， the patient had recurrence of symptoms with frequent PVC. A new EPS was performed， with a 3D electroanatomic mapping guided by the CARTO system (Biosense Webster，USA)and the earliest activation site was located on the mitral annulus， in the AMC (Figure|删除段之间换行|4). Power was delivered at 35W with a maximum temperature limited to 40·C， which resulted in immediate PVC suppression. The duration of RF was 300 sec， with a fluoroscopy time of 4 min. There were no recurrences in the following 6 months.\n\n【9】Case 2\n\nA 53 years-old female presented in the cardiology outpatient clinicCcomplainingoffatigueand frequent palpitations. Transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed absence of structural heart disease. The ECG sowed frequent PVC， with an inferior axis， positive QRS in V1 and negative QRS in DI， with more than 15000 monomorphic PVC on|删除段之间换行|Holter monitoring . The EPS，using an irrigated-tip ablation catheter for 3D electroanatomic endocardial mapping was guided by the Ensite NavX/Velocity mapping system (Abbot， St Paul，USA)，and identified the PVC earliest site on the anterolateral mitral annulus at AMC . Two RF attempts were performed with a power of35W and a total RF time of 60 sec. After further mapping， a third RF\n\n【11】Case 3\n\nA 56 years-old male referred to the cardiology outpatient clinic due frequent palpitations. Transthoracic echocardiography also without structural heart disease. Holter monitory and ECG showed frequent runs of sustained VT， with an inferior axis， negative QRS in a VL and DI， with a positive QRS in V1 . The EPS， using an irrigated-tip ablation catheter for 3D electroanatomic endocardial mapping was guided by the Ensite NavX/Velocity mapping system|删除段之间换行|(Abbot， St Paul，USA)， showed the PVC earliest activation site on the anterolateral portion of the mitral annulus in the AMC . RF ablation was targeted at the substrate site， with a power of 30W， with a maximum temperature limited of 40°C， a flow of 12 ml/min. PVC were immediately eliminated during the first RF application .\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】AMC is a complex fibrous tissue that can include remnant of the atrioventricular conduction system (dead-end tract). These cells have histological and electrophysiological properties， like the cardiac conduction cells， a characteristic that may favor idiopathic AMC PVC 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. This fact explains the capacity of the AMC cells to generate an electrical potential and its propagation for the ventricle resulting in PVC. Also， this aspect may allow us to consider the AMC as site with high arrhythmogenic potential 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，7]</u>， since its cells can had singular electrophysiological characteristics compared with the surrounding LVOT structures 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，6]</u>. Apparently， there are no myocardial cells composing the AMC 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Yet， the entire nature of the AMC arrhythmogenic substrate remains a mystery.删除2换行cardiomyopathies that should be clarified before any approach 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. PVC originated from the LVOT occur more frequently in men， rise with age and maybe register as non-sustained or sustained runs of VT 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. PVC cause several symptoms， as palpitations， fatigue or heart failure. Another form of presentation is asymptomatic Left Ventricular (LV) dysfunction (directly or indirectly associated to the PVC) 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【15】All the variants of LVOT arrhythmias seem to have similar QRS morphology characteristics. Nonetheless， some authors advocate that further analysis allows the identification of the precise site， something that would facilitate the procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. According to Kumagai et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> ECG characteristics of AMC PVC or VT are： R wave without an S wave in almost all the precordial， R/S wave transitional zone in V1 lead， absence of S wave in V6 lead and/or a greater intrinsicoid deflection time. Other authors， identify in the inferior leads the presence of tall R waves， positive QRS in lead I and negative QRS in the superior and lateral basal leads， as well as the qR pattern in Vi lead 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Chen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> stated that an early R/S wave transition in precordial leads with equal R and S wave amplitude in V2，and an R wave in V3 are typical of the anterior AMC location， a finding displayed in our patients'ECG . On the other hand， an early R/S wave transition in precordial leads， with equal R and S wave amplitude in V2， but high R wave in V1 and V3 suggest a middle AMC location. V1 lead with “qr\" morphology on the ECG exhibited high specificity to AMC PVC in the electroanatomic mapping 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Our patients exhibited an inferior ECG axis， with an early R/S wave transition in V2. However， the first case had negative QRS in lateral leads， and the second a positive QRS in lateral leads， proving the difficulty of PVC localization by the ECG. The AMC is an ample zone and the substrate localization may be more anterior or posterior，which can promote an early or late transition zone in the precordial leads. This fact can be a reason for the lack of consensus among authors.\n\n【16】LV dysfunction can be induced by frequent PVC，nonetheless there are limited literature focused on this issue， and even less publications describing AMC PVC as a primary responsible for LV dysfunction. AAD can reduce the PVC burden， and， therefore， may be used as therapy， with one or more of the following classes of drugs： B-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers(diltiazem or verapamil)and/or class III agents (amiodarone， sotalol， dofetilide) 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. In some cases， these drugs cannot accomplish the PVC control or may even present serious side effects， being important the clinical and ECG monitoring after AAD initiation 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【17】Catheter ablation is more efficient than AAD to treat PVC， particularly in monomorphic PVC， and can provide a definite PVC suppression with low complication rates. Another interesting find is in patients with LV dysfunction， that show a high rate of recovery after a successful PVC ablation 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，13]</u>. Nowadays， PVC catheter ablation is a class I recommendation in symptomatic patients PVC/VT refractory to AAD 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，14]</u>.\n\n【18】AMC anatomical tissue and the difficulty to access this area can influence the procedure， since may not allow a stable contact between the catheter and the potential substrate. An eventual cause of procedure failure is the epicardial location of the substrate. Nonetheless， the major difficulty during the mapping and ablation maneuvers is the absence of PVC during the EPS that do not allow the substrate site identification.\n\n【19】AAD therapy，autonomic and hormonal response，environmental删除1换行factors and sedation can influence the PVC burden during the procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，15]</u>. In the cases in whom PVC are not present during the procedure， pace-mapping is an alternative approach to reproduce the QRS PVC morphology allowing RF ablation 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>.\n\n【20】A transseptal approach is usually performed， allowing having a better catheter contact and stabilization 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. The electrograms can be divided into two components： First， the frequent low amplitude potential that precedes the QRS (pre-systolic)， and second， a large potential that occurs with the QRS onset. Despite a lower rate of complications described， coronary artery rupture with acute myocardial ischemia is a potential risk， justifying anatomical 3D geometry or angiography before RF application.\n\n【21】Regarding PVC catheter ablation， several settings and energy delivery protocols can be applied according to the type of catheter used the center experience， and operator. General recommendations for LVOT PVC advocate a maximum energy delivery of 30W， with a maximum temperature of 40C， and an irrigation flow range from 12ml/min to 20 ml/min. If PVC suppression occurs in the first 10 sec the application should be maintained until a maximum of 120 sec. If not， the application should be suspended followed by another attempt， after PVC remap 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，16]</u>.\n\n【22】AMC PVC recurrence is uncommon， even in patients without AAD treatment.

Women have more time between onset of symptoms and presentation and are less likely to undergo diagnostic tests such as EKGand troponins， especially younger women. The presentation can be similar between men and women； over 80% of both report chest pain when presenting with acute coronary syndrome.\n\n【2】Obiective of the Study： The aim of our work is to assess the differences between the two sexes； the cardiovascular risk profile， management of acute care and secondary prevention as well as in-hospital and 1-year mortality.\n\n【3】Methods： We recruited 346 patients， the mean age 63.4±12.7 years are admitted for ACS (179(51.7%) STEMI， 120 (34.7%)NSTEM and 47 (13.6%) unstable angina)， we evaluated the clinical characteristics，electrical， biological，therapeutic as well as the risk scores and the intra-hospital and1-year mortality according to the sex of all the patients hospitalized for an ACS.\n\n【4】Results： We have 100 (28.9%) women and 246 (71.1%) men， a ratio of 2.46， men with ACS are older than women (66.34±12.3 vs. 62.13±12.7；p<0.01)， 17% women and 23.6% men are under55 years old， there are more hypertensive women (80% vs. 39.2%，p<0.01)， with a ratio of 1.6， there are more women with diabetes (65% vs. 47.9%， p<0.01) with a ratio of 1.4， There is no significant difference between the two sexes in terms of frequency of dyslipidemia (p=0.06)， 85% of women are menopausal， at the ECG the involvement in women is more extensive (number of leads affected>6 in 76% vs. 64.2%， p=0.04)， Renal involvement is more significant in women (p=0.02)， there is a Statistically significant difference in mortality at 1 year between women and men (17% vs. 7.3%； p=0.01).\n\n【5】Conclusion： Women hospitalized for ACS have more cardiovascular risk factors than men and cardiovascular mortality at 1 year remains higher in women， this observed difference is mainly linked to the disparity in the quality of care and the results in patients with ACS.\n\n【6】Keywords： Female； Clinical profile； Acute coronary syndrome； Long-term mortality\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】Traditionally， cardiovascular diseases (coronary artery disease， arterial disease， and stroke) and more particularly coronary disease are considered to be diseases mainly affecting men， women being considered \"protected\". However， statistics from the World Health Organization show that cardiovascular mortality is higher in women than in men. Cardiovascular disease is even the leading cause of death in women， ahead of the more frequently cited breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. But if we look at the incidence of cardiovascular disease in large epidemiological studies such as Framingham for example， for all age groups (between 45 and 95 years)， the incidence is higher in men than in women通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. This brings us to the first paradox. In Algeria， ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death with 36% according to the latest 2016 World Health Organization data 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【9】Materials and Methods\n\n【10】Study population\n\n【11】Single-center， cross-sectional， prospective， cohort-type observational study carried out in patients hospitalized for ACS in the cardiology intensive care unit of the internal medicine department of the University Hospital of Douera， the inclusion criteria are： Any patient over 18years admitted for an SCA； including ACS with elevation of the ST segment， ACS without elevation of the ST segment (MI without Q wave and unstable angina)，the non-inclusion criteria are： Patients删除1换行under palliative care with neoplastic pathology whose life expectancy is lower at six months，patients with severe chronic respiratory failure oxygen dependent， ACS occurring within 48 h after a therapeutic intervention (angioplasty or coronary bypass) or other cardiac surgery and pregnant women. Follow-up of all patients for 1 year.\n\n【12】Results\n\n【13】Characteristics of the study population\n\n【14】Represented by Table 1， the male population with acute coronary syndrome represents 71.1% of the overall population， the average age is higher in men (66.3±12.3 years vs. 62.1±12.7 years，p<0.01)，there is more STEMI in men (58.1% vs. 36%， p<0.01)， more diabetics in women (47.9% vs. 65%，p<0.01)， more tobacco users (82.9% vs. 5%， p<0.01)， more hypertensive in women (80% vs. 49.2%， p<0.01)， the BMI is higher in women (28.7±5.6 vs. 26.1 ±4.1 kg/m， p<0.01)， more metabolic syndrome in women (80% vs. 47.2%，p<0.01)，renal function is lower in the female population (65.3±33.1 ml/min/m²vs.74.6±31.5 ml/min/m’，p<0.01)， pharmacological fibrinolysis is used less in women (18% vs. 30.1%，p=0.02) and there is more angioplasty in men (32.9% vs. 20 %，p=0.02)， on the other hand no significant difference concerning coronary arterybypass grafting， cardiovascular inheritance，dyslipidemia in both groups.\n\n【15】There are more women with a very high CRUSADE score(40% vs.9.3%， p<0.01)， on the other hand no statistically significant difference for the intra-hospital GRACE Score and at 6 months and the TIMI score. Between the two sexes.\n\n【16】After one year of follow-up， there is more mortality in the female group (17% vs. 7.3%， p=0.01)， more cardiovascular events 通用删除1(英):<u>(64%Table 1： Clinical characteristics of the study population.删除2换行vs. 51.2%， p=0.04)</u>， more heart failure (37% vs. 17， p<0.01)， more severe bleeding (13 vs. 5.7， p=0.03) no statistical difference between the two sexes concerning ischemic recurrence and the number of rehospitalization after one year of follow-up .\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】In this single-center study， women hospitalized for ACS have more comorbidities with more diabetes， hypertension， metabolic syndrome in accordance with previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，61， </u>there are more men in our study corresponding to the data from the ACCESS study通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， mortality after one year is greater in the female population， previous studies have shown that the differences between the sexes in early mortality after ACS are largely explained by these clinical differences during presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>， Previous studies have reported early excess mortality after STEMI in younger women and detected an interaction between sex and age 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>. Our study found that women presented to the hospital for ACS treatment 1.2 h later than men.\n\n【19】This delayed presentation has been associated with an increased risk of death and recurrent events in patients with ACS. This prolonged delay in hospital presentation in women compared to men can be attributed to misinterpretation of symptoms，lack of awareness and barriers to accessing care 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>.\n\n【20】Women are lesslikelyy to receivereperfusion therapy(thrombolysis， ATL) on arrival than men. These disparities in acute treatment also contributed to the difference in death rates between men and women.\n\n【21】A meta-analysis that investigated gender differences in mortality删除表格换行in patients treated with primary ATL concluded that increased mortality in women was likely confounded by differences in baseline cardiovascular risk factors and profiles.

Women with ACS had a higher unadjusted risk of death than men. Women were less likely to receive acute reperfusion therapy than men. However， the reasons for these differences based on gender in the clinical management of ACS remain largely unknown. Gender differences in quality of care mortality and cardiovascular events after one year of follow-up underscore the need for further investigation and a specially targeted quality improvement program to reduce or even eliminate disparities in care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

A large cyst in the left nasal cavity was found by nasal endoscopy， CT and MRI examination . Therefore， left ethmoid sinus cyst resection and open sinus were performed under nasal endoscopy. One month after the operation， there was swelling and pain in the nasal and frontal. After several symptomatic treatments， there was no improvement. On September 17k， 2018， the patient was admitted to Tongren Hospital again. A neoplasm was found in the left frontal sinus under the outpatient nasal endoscopy， which was easy to bleed.

{"seq_id": "9a7d739b-36da-4a4e-b841-669b61dc38f6", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】A Toddler with N-Methyl-D-Aspartate(NMDA) Receptor Encephalitis. A previously healthy three year-old boy presented to the emergency department due to episodes of leg jerking， clumsiness， a brief unresponsive episode， and a single generalized tonic clonic seizure. Parents had also noted behavioral changes and secondary enuresis in the week prior to admission. Initially he was very well appearing and cooperative. He had normal strength in his upper extremities but weakness in his lower extremities with an abnormal gait. Soon after this exam he became inconsolable seemingly without a trigger. He would not cooperate with an exam or instruction during this time. This inconsolability lasted for approximately 20 min and resolved. EEG results were nonspecific. MRI brain and total spine was normal. Spinal fluid studies returned positive for N-Methyl-D-Aspartate(NMDA) receptor antibodies consistent with NMDA encephalitis. NMDA encephalitis was first recognized in 1997 in association with an ovarian teratoma； however， in the pediatric population this is not always the case. Classically， adolescent patients first present with psychiatric symptoms and often proceed to develop neurological symptoms. However， in younger children the opposite often occurs. Typical neurologic symptoms include movement disorders and seizures. Psychological symptoms typically indude behavioral changes but can also include psychosis and catatonia. The diagnosis is made after finding NMDA receptor antibodies. Treatment is aimed at the source of the autoantibodies. For this reason， in all ages it is critical to search for a teratoma. First line therapies are often corticosteroids，IVIG， or plasma exchange. Some patients may require immunotherapies such as rituximab or cyclophosphamide.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) encephalitis is a type of autoimmune encephalitis first described in 1997 in association with an ovarian teratoma； however， it was only recognized to be associated with NMDA antibodies in the mid-2000s 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Classically， this condition occurs in women and is associated with an ovarian teratoma， but this is less typical in the pediatric population. It is now known that NMDA encephalitis can occur in the absence of an autoantibody producing neoplasm， which is more commonly the case in younger children and males 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3-5]</u>. In this case we report on a young pediatric patient who developed a series of vague signs and symptoms early in the course of NMDA encephalitis.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A previously healthy three-year-old boy presented to the emergency department due to about two weeks of intermittent right leg jerking， increased clumsiness， and one brief unresponsive episode， and described as “zoning out.\" Parents had also noted behavioral changes including increased agitation and emotional outbursts as well as secondary enuresis during the day and night. During further questioning the parents also endorsed an unsteady gait and significant photophobia during this same time period. While in the emergency department， the patient had a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizure that lasted three minutes. He received lorazepam which aborted the seizure and he was subsequently admitted for further testing.\n\n【6】On the inpatient unit， an EEG was done which showed background slowing in the right posterior quadrant but did not reveal any electrographic seizures. A brain MRI was done and was normal. Labs drawn included Complete Blood Count (CBC)， Comprehensive Metabolic Panel(CMP)， and inflammatory markers which were all unremarkable. He was started on levetiracetam，删除1换行monitored for two days without any further seizure-like activity， and was discharged home. Within one week， he followed up with pediatric neurology and was noted in clinic to have worsening lower extremity weakness， lower extremity pain especially the left side， and two episodes of bilateral lower extremity jerking. The patient had worsening secondary enuresis and parents also reported the patient had decreased spontaneous speech. The patient was readmitted to the inpatient unit. On initial examination during this admission， he appeared veryagitated and was very resistant to exam. Approximately20 min later， his behavior was significantly changed and he was much more cooperative. Parents noted similar emotional lability at home. His vitals were within normal limits. Labs including CBC， CMP， and inflammatory markers were drawn and unremarkable. MRI of the C-spine， L-spine and T-spine were done and were normal. Additionally， a lumbar puncture was performed which ultimately revealed the diagnosis.\n\n【7】Initial spinal fluid tests were unremarkable including glucose， protein， and cell counts. However， spinal fluid NMDA Receptor antibodies returned positive with a titer of 1：2. This finding and the patient's symptoms were consistent with a diagnosis of NMDA encephalitis.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】This case helps to paint a broader image of the signs and symptoms of NMDA encephalitis in a younger pediatric population. The California Encephalitis Project was a study performed from1998 to 2005 which sought to investigate etiologies of encephalitis in patients. The project found that NMDA encephalitis was more common than any one type of viral encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，6，7]</u>. Although it is important to mention this study was not limited to the pediatric population and was likely influenced by the region in which it was performed. Also， NMDA encephalitis has been found to be the second most common cause of autoimmune encephalitis after Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)通用删除6(英):<u>[3，6]</u>.\n\n【10】Classically， adult and adolescent patients first present with psychiatric symptoms and later develop neurological findings 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，8，9]</u>. This pattern has also been reported in children under 10 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， but it is not a typical presentation in this age group. Younger children more frequently present with neurological signs or symptoms and subsequently develop psychiatric symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，6-8，10]</u>. The most common psychiatric symptoms often seen in children are personality or behavioral changes 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，8，10]</u>. Psychosis and catatonia have been reported as well 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，6，11]</u>.\n\n【11】The neurological symptoms that occur most often include seizures and movement disorders. Seizures are most commonly generalized tonic clonic and can be the initial symptom， or may present later 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. The vast majority of patients develop movement disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4，7-9]</u> and these typically continue during times of unresponsiveness通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. The movement disorders can appear in a variety of ways including abnormal postures， hypertonicity， ataxic gait， cranial nerve abnormalities， aphasias， athetosis， and tremors 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4，7，8，10]</u>. However， the most commonly observed movement disorders are orofacial dyskinesia and choreoathetosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. Frequently， children with NMDA encephalitis develop multiple different movement disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Weakness is not a frequent motor finding but this has been reported as well 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Other types of neurological complications include hypoventilation， decreased consciousness， and dysautonomia which can be severe and require admission to an intensive care unit\n\n【12】通用删除6(英):<u>[1，4，8，10]</u>.\n\n【13】Following admission the initial workup typically includes imaging and an EEG. MRI studies are often normal but can reveal some nonspecific signal changes in the gray and white matter 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6]</u>. EEG results are frequently abnormal but often nonspecific 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Staley et al. reported diffuse theta， delta， or anterior predominant slowing as the most common finding. Spinal fluid studies often reveal a pleocytosis with a lymphocytic predominance as well as elevated protein but this is not always present 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6]</u>. Diagnosis is ultimately made by finding NMDA receptor antibodies in the CSF. Serum testing can be done as well although this does not rule out disease if negative 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【14】At this time there are no specific guidelines regarding treatment of NMDA encephalitis but this is often done under the guidance of an experienced neurologist. Frequently initial treatment， sometimes started before diagnosis， is aimed at the acute symptoms such as seizures， psychosis， or catatonia. For this reason anti-epileptic medications or anti-psychotics may be used 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Following diagnosis， the first line of treatment is often corticosteroids or Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG)， although plasma exchange has been used as well 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，4，6，11]</u>. These initial treatments are intended to address the underlying autoantibody production. It is not uncommon for the initial treatment to fail and for patients to require immunotherapies aimed at suppressing the immune system， such as rituximab or cyclophosphamide 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6，10，11]</u>. Early treatment has been found to be critical in the recovery process 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> And intensive neuropsychiatric rehabilitation is required throughout the often prolonged recovery process 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6，10]</u>. Electroconvulsive therapy has also been used in cases of severe catatonia and has shown some benefit although this is not routinely used 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In those patients whose disease is found to be secondary to a neoplasm， classically an ovarian teratoma， the recommendation is that the mass be removed 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，9，10]</u>. Patients with paraneoplastic syndrome have a better prognosis after the neoplasm is removed when compared to patients who do not have a mass通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6，9]</u>. Relapse can also occur and is more common in patients who do not have a neoplasm associated with their encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7，9]</u>； however， neoplasms can occur after the acute phase as well 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6]</u>. Long term outcomes vary considerably from full recovery with proper treatment to lasting neurological deficits which has been seen in up to 20% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，8]</u>. Death can also occur if treatment is not begun promptly 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【15】Patient Course\n\n【16】The patient was initially treated with three doses of IVIG. He was discharged home and over the course of the following month， continued to have loss of motor coordination， expressive language regression， and seizures. He was evaluated by neurology at a second institution and the decision was made to admit him due to worsening symptoms and subclinical seizure activity seen on EEG.\n\n【17】On admission， he was placed on EEG and found to be in non-convulsive status epilepticus. He was transferred to the intensive care unit and placed on a continuous midazolam infusion which ultimately abated the seizures. He underwent four sessions of Plasma Exchange (PLEX) but during these sessions he experienced refractory status epilepticus. He was switched to rituximab and continued to receive weekly methylprednisolone injections.

The case of our patient is proof of this with a 5-year therapeutic errancy on chronic pain of the right shoulder for which medical treatments by rehabilitation and glenohumeral， subacromial and acromioclavicular infiltrations remained ineffective.\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】This is a 39-year-old female patient， with no history of upper limb trauma， followed up between2013 and 2018 for right scapular pain labeled \"tendinopathy and subacromial impingement\"\n\n【5】Medical treatments never relieved her pain： Physiotherapy，infiltrations of the acromioclavicular joint (very moderate effectiveness of xylocaine， ineffectiveness of corticoids) and scapulohumeral joint， analgesics， rest.\n\n【6】She was referred to the department for pain resistant to medical treatment： On examination， the shoulder was supple but painful， with normal active amplitudes， but with increased pain in anterior elevation. She had no long biceps pain or signs of frank subacromial impingement， but she had severe pain (VAS 7/10) on pressure of the distal part of clavicle. The cross arm test was inconclusive.\n\n【7】The shoulder X-rays showed a type 1 acromion with a CSA (Critical Shoulder Angle) of 31°， without reporting any coracoclavicular abnormality at first sight. The arthro-scanner performed on this patient found calcification of the trapezoid tendon at its clavicular insertion with an obvious coracoclavicular impingement.\n\n【8】A xylocaine infiltration test of this calcification was performed， which resulted in complete resolution of impingement pain. A resection of the sub-clavicular calcification was decided upon following a good response to the xylocaine test.\n\n【9】Under arthroscopy， using a lateral and anterior instrumental approach， a bursectomy of the subacromial joint was performed without going intra-articular： A preserved subacromial space was aW found. A dissection of the bursa was performed up to the inferior aspect ofthe distal 14 of the clavicle at the VAPR： evidence of a reduced coracoclavicular space (<5 mm). A per operative dynamic pressure operation on the clavicle confirmed a real coracoclavicular impingement.\n\n【10】Using a motorized cutter， abrasion of the sub-clavicular calcification located opposite the clavicular insertion of the trapezoid ligament was performed while preserving the conoid. A dynamic operation using postoperative clavicular pressure ensured that this conflict disappeared.\n\n【11】The postoperative follow-up was simple， with the arthroscopic entry points closed to the strips on Day 1. She was discharged on Day 1 with a rehabilitation protocol without any limitation of mobility. Force work was allowed after full recovery of the amplitudes joint.\n\n【12】She was seen in consultation at 3 weeks and 3 months with complete resolution of her pain， recovery of all passive and active range of motion without pain. The control radiographs did not reveal any acromioclavicular subluxation or dislocation and a disappearance of coracoclavicular删除1换行calcification.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】The coracoclavicular ligaments are remnants of the embryonic pro-coracoid cartilage 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In about 6% of normal subjects both ends of the pro-coracoid remain cartilaginous. The pro coracoid may ossify. When its clavicular portion undergoes this transformation， a tubercle is formed on the clavicle. If its lower portion ossifies， the two processes can form a joint (1% of shoulder X-rays).\n\n【15】Chen et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> report two most frequent causes of coracoclavicular calcification with trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， which has a rather punctiform appearance (36%) and chronic kidney disease， which has a rather tumors appearance (28%). Ankylosing spondylitis has also been reported as a cause of coracoclavicular calcification 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. The patient presented in this case report had no such history.\n\n【16】Three types of calcifications have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>： Punctate calcifications 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， ossifications with or without joint formation， and mass tumour calcifications.\n\n【17】In the literature， coracoclavicular pain is mostly reported and described in patients with a true \"coracoclavicular joint\"通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>， so the incidence varies between 0.04% and 27%. Like all joints，they could be affected by rheumatic arthritis or osteoarthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The case reported by Cheung et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> presents clinical characteristics like clinical case presented here. The pain was in front of the left clavicle on anterior rising of the arm.\n\n【18】As far as the treatment of this condition is concerned， the only cases described in the literature of this type of conflict have not been treated by arthroscopy. They were described at a time when arthroscopy was not very developed for shoulder. Treatment， when surgical， consisted of open resection 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3，6]</u>. The approach allowing access to the coracoclavicular space is difficult and invasive and does not allow good visualization of calcifications.\n\n【19】The current challenge is the early detection of these conflicts on clinical examination， as described in the literature， a painful and limited anterior elevation with normal glenohumeral abduction删除1换行seems to be a sign of coracoclavicular conflict because of a greater mobilization of the clavicle in these movements. X-rays， but especially CT scans with 3D reconstruction， are indispensable aids in the diagnostic process. The xylocaine test is also described as necessary in predicting a good surgical result.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】Coracoclavicular calcifications are rare conditions with very few cases described in the literature. This can lead to diagnostic difficulties and yet the sub-clavicular space is easily accessible by arthroscopy. The technique described in this article is simple and allows an efficient and rapid management. The functional and aesthetic damage remains intact compared to the open surgery described until now for this type of pathology.\n\n【22】Arthroscopy offers a real advantage in the management of symptomatic coracoclavicular calcification， but this clinical entity should not be overlooked in front of painful anterior elevation with normal glenohumeral joint on radiography.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Potential consequences of post-operative SIRS are delayed weaning off mechanical ventilation， delayed recovery of organic functions and a longer Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>.\n\n【5】Cytosorb'(Cytosorbents， NJ， USA) is a hemoadsorption device that removes many cytokines from the blood 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. Neonatal and pediatric patients in hyperinflammatory states have shown clear reductions in IL-6 and IL-10 concentration in plasma during hemoadsorption treatment， independent of eventual survival. In hyper inflammatory states， high plasma levels were reduced more efficiently than low plasma levels， in line with the known concentration-dependent clearance properties of the CytoSorb adsorber. From a safety perspective， the lack of significant cytokine removal at physiologically necessary concentrations is important， as the body is dependent on a certain concentration of cytokines to maintain an adequate immune response. Pediatric patients with exaggerated pre-operative SIRS might be good candidates for an assessment of Cytosorb’s usefulness.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】We present the case of a full-term newborn with a hypoplastic left heart syndrome， involving an absent mitral valve and exceedingly small aortic annulus， ascending aorta and aortic arch. Perfusion of the aortic arch was retrograde through a persistent patent ductus arteriosus. Right ventricular systolic function was normal. Shortly after birth， the neonate required continuous positive airway pressure and then invasive ventilation with permissive hypercapnia. He received levosimendan 12 h before surgery， and maintenance with a prostaglandin El infusion. Five days after birth， the patient underwent a Norwood stage I palliation with interatrial septum resection， aortic arch reconstruction and the creation of a Blalock-Taussig shunt. The cardioplegic solution used was Custodiol HTK. CPB duration was 227 min (median CPB time [MT] of 230 min， 通用删除6(英):<u>[226</u>.25-256.通用删除6(英):<u>5]</u>)， and aortic cross-clamping duration was 180 min (MT 119.5 min， 通用删除6(英):<u>[101</u>.5-132.通用删除6(英):<u>75]</u>). Selective cerebral perfusion was27 min at a central core temperature of 27.8°Celsius.\n\n【8】The Cytosorb' cartridge was inserted between the oxygenator outlet (QUADROX-i neonatal HMO 11000°MAQUET) and the venous line， assisted by a roller pump slave to the blood pump. The minimum flow rate through the cartridge was 100 ml/min， as per the manufacturer's data. The servo control was 14% of the patient's theoretical flow， indexed to 3.0 l/min/m²to compensate for the drop induced by the Cytosorb and to ensure a flow rate of 2.4l/min/m²to the patient. Priming was performed using \"ventilated reconstituted whole blood”to ensure homeostasic conditions at CPB initiation.\n\n【9】Surgery was uneventful， and correction was adequate， with unobstructed flow through the interatrial communication and inside the aortic arch， and with good ventricular function. The patient returned to the ICU intubated with infusions of norepinephrine， dopamine and milrinone.\n\n【10】Post-operative course was uneventful， without renal， digestive， or infectious complications. Hemodynamic adaptation was good， with rapid weaning off all amine infusions and definitive weaning off norepinephrine on post-operative day 5. The patient was extubated on post-operative day 6 (MT is 11.5 days 通用删除6(英):<u>[9</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>5-18]</u>)， left the ICU on day 22 (MT 39.5 days 通用删除6(英):<u>[29-80</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>5]</u>)， and was discharged home on day删除4-1:<u>45</u>.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】The rapid post-operative recovery with early extubation and weaning off catecholamine infusions was remarkable. ICU and删除1换行hospital stays were shortened due to an absence of complications. In our experience， similar cases have needed much longer ventilation support and ICU stay. Our case’s surgical， anesthetic， and medical care were comparable with similar cases in our institution. The only difference was the Cytosorb'cartridge's incorporation into the CPB circuit. Although cytokine levels were not assessed， removing them using the Cytosorb'is a plausible explanation for our patient's improved outcome.\n\n【13】To the best of our knowledge， this is the first description of Cytosorb's use during pediatric CPB. Priming of the CPB circuit in a newborn requires homologous blood. Our case required 385ml of blood， of which 120 ml were used for priming the Cytosorb. We believe the expected benefits to anti-inflammatory processes are worth the greater homologous blood use. A literature review indicated isolated pediatric reports of hemadsorption using the Cytosorb'adsorber， including one in a pediatric case 72 h after CBP 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】The present case represented a complex congenital cardiopathy with a patent ductus arteriosus and a long CPB duration for surgical palliation， which likely contributed to the pre-operative and intra-operative inflammatory process. By reducing cytokine levels， the Cytosorb may have significantly reduced catecholamine infusion time， intubation time， and ICU stay. Future studies should evaluate Cytosorb's effectiveness in selected pediatric cases.\n\n【16】References values with median and interquartile range [Q1-Q通用删除6(英):<u>3]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

A chest X-ray was performed to evaluate symptoms which depicted enlarged cardiac silhouette. This was followed by transthoracic echocardiography that showed huge posterolateral and basal LV pseudoaneurysm (7 cm x 10 cm)， LV systolic dysfunction (Ejection Fraction (EF)≤20%)， mild Mitral Regurgitation (MR) and Aortic Insufficiency (AI).

The pericardial adhesions were gently dissected. After initiating cardiopulmonary bypass， the heart was lifted upwards and contained rupture of a large posterolateral LV PsA was identified. The posterior wall of LV was opened over the PsA area and an organized thrombus， which was sealing off the rupture site， was removed. The diagnosis of LV PsA was confirmed by the absence of myocardial components in the wall (e.g. thinned necrotic myocardium)， formed by organized hematoma and pericardial adhesions. Inside the LV cavity， mitral valve was intact， while the posterior papillary muscle appeared normal with hyperemic borders suggestive of recent ischemia injury. Dacron patch was prepared.

The collected data were analyzed by SPSS.\n\n【3】Result： This study assessed the existing integration of sexual reproductive health services with HIV treatment for women living with HIV and attending ART in Oromia Region， Ethiopia. Such integration ranged from the provision of maternal， family planning， neonatal health services， and health education on sexual reproductive health combined with HIV services for women living with HIV. Almost all respondents (n=635， 97.1%) preferred integrated sexual reproductive health and HIV services at the same facility.

Accordingly， the WHO 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> highlighted that universal access to reproductive health was a necessary condition for achieving the SDGs. Meeting the unmet needs for family planning in sub-Saharan Africa could make an important contribution to improving maternal health through early studies or initiatives. Programs that have succeeded in promoting condom use and providing HIV prevention and treatment services in this region have largely missed the opportunity to address the contraceptive needs of the key populations they serve. Therefore， the research statement for this study is “What is the status of existing integration of sexual reproductive health services with HIV services for women of reproductive age living with HIV attending healthcare facilities in Oromia Region， Ethiopia?\n\n【12】Methods\n\n【13】Research settina\n\n【14】This study was conducted in the Oromia Region surroundings of Finfinne Oromia， Ethiopia.

This correlates with the observation made during the study where quite a high number of women showed up for integrated services. For example， 64.5% of ART clients were screened， counseled， and provided with injectable contraception， and 80.1% received counseling on informed decision-making and consent for permanent contraceptive methods from healthcare providers. Only 23.1% of respondents were counseled for an implant in the ART room. This finding was supported by other studies conducted in Lusaka which revealed that more than 80% of respondents accessed family planning services in ART clinics， and99% used modern contraception of which 60% used male condoms，15% used injectable contraception， and 11% used oral contraceptive pills 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. The study findings were supported by service providers who shared that all health facilities offered sexual reproductive health services as well as HIV services. The services such as PMTCT， ARTs， and contraceptive methods-including condoms-were all located in the same facility offered by the same provider on the same day. The proportion of services provided at each service-delivery point were as follows： 93.8% of health facilities provided sexual reproductive health services in PMTCT， 56.3% offered integrated essential sexual reproductive health services with HIV services， 56.3% offered HIV services within family planning services， and 62.5% of HIV services were provided within condom provision reflected in the study area.\n\n【91】Women of reproductive age attending ART/PMTCT in Oromia Region， Ethiopia revealed that 54.3% received family planning counseling from trained health professionals in the waiting room， and were referred to the family planning unit within the same facility for consultation for long-acting and permanent methods. The study revealed that 88.8% were referred for implants， 61.3% for IUDs，and29.1% were for tubal ligation. According to this study， 95% of women were satisfied with the utilization of integrated family planning/HIV services. This finding was supported by a study conducted in Tanzania 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>， which showed that 85% of clients were screened with at least one of the three questions on the screening job aid， of which75% discussed contraceptive methods. Method-specific discussions increased for condoms 52% to 63%， pills 26% to 62%， injectable 26%to 62%， implants 16% to 48%，IUDs 12% to 44%， female sterilization5% to 19%， and male sterilization 1% to 14% from pre-intervention to post-intervention. Therefore， in line with the findings of the current study， the largest multi-country studies demonstrate significant unmet sexual reproductive health service needs for people living with HIV attending HIV clinical care facilities. HIV care providers are uniquely placed to provide reproductive health information， given their frequent contact with patients over a long period 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【92】Conclusion\n\n【93】This study assessed the existing integration of family planning services with HIV treatments， guidelines， policy， protocols and healthcare managers. This study assessed the existing integration of sexual reproductive health services with HIV treatment for women living with HIV and attending ART in the Oromia Region， Ethiopia. Such integration ranged from the provision of maternal， family planning， neonatal health services， and health education on删除1换行sexual reproductive health combined with HIV services for women living with HIV. Almost all respondents (n=635， 97.1%) preferred integrated sexual reproductive health and HIV services at the same facility. Also， most of the providers (n=622， 95%)， were in favor of integrated family planning/HIV services.\n\n【94】This study indicated that the integration of family planning with HIV services includes counseling on available family planning methods in the ART room， to the provision of family planning methods such as condoms， pills，injectable methods， implants in the ART rooms， and referrals for long-acting and permanent methods.\n\n【95】These study findings showed considerable disparities between the availability of elements of integrated family planning/HIV services， and the actual delivery of sexual reproductive health services that are fully integrated； where both HIV- and family planning-related elements are actually incorporated into the visit.\n\n【96】Recommendation\n\n【97】The MOH， in collaboration with others stakeholders，should take the lead and responsibility for ensuring the implementation of integrated sexual reproductive health services-including family planning/HIV services-with chronic care of ART. The involvement of stakeholders and partners is imperative to guarantee universal access to the integrated family planning/HIV services (HIV prevention， therapy， and chronic care) at primary healthcare units.\n\n【98】The FMOH， the ORHB， and the researcher should organize and facilitate a workshop on the developed strategic plans for all service providers， supervisors， and healthcare managers to enhance and scale up integrated family planning/HIV services to different health facilities in order to ensure its accessibility and availability.\n\n【99】FMOH and ORHB should emphasize the integration of sexual reproductive health services-including family planning/HIV services-with chronic care of ART，and it should be included as a key performance indicator.

It is benign tumors that may occur in lungs， skin， heart， breast and other organs. Pulmonary hamartoma is the most common benign tumors in adults. It occurs more in male than females (1：4)， in the 5h and 6h decade， with an incidence of0.025% to 0.032%. Although， it is still an uncommon occurrence， it is the most common benign pulmonary tumor， about 77% of benign pulmonary nodules and 8% of Solitary Pulmonary Lesions (SPN). It occurs mainly in the peripheral parenchyma. However， it is very rare in pediatric population， and endo-bronchiallesion 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Most of pulmonary hamartomas area symptomatic， and often being incidental discovered. Depending on its site and size， patients may develop symptoms； persistent coughing， wheezing， dyspnea.

It is benign malformations of the lung and includes an abnormal mixture of tissue components； cartilage， epithelium， fat， and muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Surgical resection remains the curative option with excellent prognosis. Enucleation or wedge resections with preservation of lung parenchyma are the most common surgical choice.

When present， it usually arises from melanoma， lung cancer， breast cancer as well as mediastinal tumors and hematologic malignancies. Head and neck tumors rarely metastasize to the heart making the encountering of such a case worth publishing to the medical society. The rarity of this finding also makes it hard for clinicians to recognize， diagnose and treat patients who present with heart metastasis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Cardiac metastasis； Head and neck cancer； Squamous cell carcinoma\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Cardiac metastasis form head and neck tumors are an extremely rare presentation. Additionally， most cases of cardiac metastasis are diagnosed post-mortem due to the silent manifestation of this presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Clinicians should however suspect it whenever patients with head and neck cancer exhibit cardiac signs and symptoms such as chest pain； dyspnea， palpitations， cardiac failure or EKG changes 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>， although these symptoms are not specific. Multiple imaging modalities help in the diagnosis of cardiac metastasis and management depends on whether it is the only site of metastasis or a disseminated disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】T.K. is a 64-year-old female teacher， never smoker， with a past medical history significant for T2N0M0， left infiltrative ductal breast carcinoma in 2015， for which she underwent conservative breast surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy with six cycles of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide followed by aromatase inhibitors for 5 vears.\n\n【7】Three months after the end of adjuvant hormone therapy， she complained from painful ulceration of the left border of her tongue. A biopsy of the lesion was performed and revealed a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. A partial glossectomy with left cervical lymphadenectomy were performed in May 2021. Histology revealed a 2 cm ulcerative tumor with 15mm depth infiltration， with lymphatic and neural emboli and vascular invasion， and with 2 positive lymph nodes involvement out of 28 resected.\n\n【8】She received oral and cervical irradiation with 6600 cGy during 33 sessions with concomitant cisplatinum 100 mg/m’every 3 weeks for three cycles.\n\n【9】A follow-up PET-CT scan performed three months after the end of therapy confirmed the radiologic complete remission of the first primary of the breast as well as the second primary of the tongue. However， it showed an isolated bizarre radioactive uptake of 2.5 cm of diameter with SUV=14.5 at the apex ofthe right ventricle of the heart.\n\n【10】The cardiac ultrasound showed a hyperechogenic mass (2.4 cm x2.1 cm) attached to the apical and lateral wall of the right ventricle causing no obstruction with evidence of tissue vascularization on the color flow Doppler. There were signs of localized pericardial invasion as shown by its increased thickness facing the mass. A cardiac angioscan found a 35 mm x32 mm irregular mass infiltrating the myocardium at the right apex level and protruding through the ventricle cavity and through the pericardium. A multifocal pericardial thickening and thin pericardial effusion was also删除1换行identified .\n\n【11】In January the fourth， 2022， an open biopsy was performed via minimal thoracotomy. A third primary sarcoma in the field of previous breast radiotherapy was ruled out， and a confirmation of squamous cell localization ofthe tongue to the myocardium was done. Pericardial biopsy and pericardial liquid cytology were unremarkable.\n\n【12】According to our multidisciplinary team decision， the futility of surgical resection or irradiation was highlighted and the management will be restricted to systemic chemo-immunotherapy.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】The incidence of any cardiac metastasis varies greatly between1.23% to 18.3%通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>， with substantially variable incidence depending on the primary site. According to Bussani et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> postmortem cardiac metastasis occurred in 9% of patients， and of which only 5%corresponded to an oral cavity primary cancer， compared to 48.4%secondary to mesothelioma，27.8% secondaryto melanoma， and 21%to lung adenocarcinoma.\n\n【15】Head and neck cancers usually metastasize to thelungs，bones and liver. A cardiac metastasis is highly unusual and rare to find. A total of 34 cases of cardiac metastasis from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were reported， including 12 cases from a tongue primary， according to the literature review by Dewan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> between 1985and 2020.\n\n【16】The mechanisms underlying the occurrence of cardiac metastasis form head neck tumors is not yet fully understood but it is supposed to occur by hematogenous spread through the coronary arteries， lymphatic spread or contiguous spread through invasion of the pulmonary veins or the inferior vena cava 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-8]</u>.\n\n【17】Patients with cardiac metastasis are often asymptomatic， as the patient presented in this case report. Symptoms due to cardiac metastasis are exceedingly rare and are nonspecific and therefore most patients are diagnosed in postmortem or incidentally on routine删除1换行follow-upimaging done as surveillance for other previously diagnosed tumors. If present， symptoms include dyspnea due to pleural effusion， valvular obstruction or cardiac failure. Other symptoms include chest pain， arrhythmias， syncope， sudden death due to myocardial rupture and infarction. Rarely， pulmonary embolus due to cardiac metastasis can happen 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，4，9]</u>. Therefore， in patients with advanced head and neck cancers presenting with new onset cardiovascular symptoms， metastatic cardiac lesion should be suspected and ruled out.\n\n【18】When suspected， diagnoses could be done using several methods. Cardiac echography is the easiest and least invasive procedure used to diagnose cardiac metastasis. The sensitivity of echocardiography is80% which makes it an appropriate initial imaging method 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2，10]</u>. The gold standard for the diagnosis of myocardial metastasis remains the cardiac biopsy which was done in our case， however the biopsy is not often safe and doable 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Other helpful diagnostic testing may include electrocardiogram showing nonspecific ST-elevation changes or arrhythmias， and other imaging options such as computed tomography， PET-CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Cardiac MRI was correspondent to the cardiac histology in 78% of the cases as compared to 51% of concordance with echocardiography. MRI provides excellent resolution and allows evaluation of the surrounding tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. PET/CT may also help in diagnosing cardiac metastasis with the additional benefit of detecting distant metastasis通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【19】Management of cardiac metastasis is limited and remains a clinical challenge. When only one metastasis is present， treatment may be curative. Treatment options include surgical excision， mechanical coil embolization of the arterial supply of the mass， systemic chemotherapy， immunotherapy， chemoembolization， and radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，4，10，13]</u>. In addition， some patients may require specific cardiac tailored therapy depending on the present cardiovascular-related disease， such as medical management of cardiac failure， anti-arrhythmic drugs， pacemaker placement， etc 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. However， usually the patients are inoperable， the prognosis is fatal especially if the cardiac metastasis is part of a disseminated disease，删除1换行and the treatment aims in palliation of symptoms rather than curing the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，14，15]</u>.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】Cardiac metastasis from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is a rare entity and remains a challenging diagnosis. It is often asymptomatic but it should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a patient with a history of head and neck cancer presents with new onset cardiac symptoms. It has a poor prognosis when it occurs and the treatment options are limited. Therefore， it may be reasonable to considering adding routine EKG and/or echocardiography to the annual surveillance regimen for patients who have been treated for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Although the continuous development of modern diagnosis and treatment technology has greatly promoted the early reperfusion treatment of AMI and the maintenance of hemodynamics during the shock state， the case fatality rate of CS caused by AMI is still very high (≈50%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> and it may be as high as 80% if not treated in time 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Early implementation of coronary reperfusion therapy is the core strategy to reduce the incidence of CS in AMI patients. For AMI complicated with CS， vasoactive drugs， Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumps (IABP)， left ventricular assistance devices， extracorporeal membrane oxygenation systems， and other machines are increasingly used for hemodynamics maintenance. However， these approaches do not play a major role in reducing the case fatality rate 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Previous studies have shown that Traditional Chinese Herbs (TCHs) are potentially valuable in improving the clinical prognosis of AMI-induced CS 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. However， Chinese herbal medicines combined with acupuncture have not been reported as an intervention for CS. This paper introduces two medical cases where the combination of TCHs and acupuncture helped patients with AMI complicated with refractory CS to derive clinical benefits. The treatment modalities reflected in these successful cases mav lead to new opportunities for the effective treatment of CS. This report was published with the informed删除1换行consent of the two patients involved.\n\n【7】Case Series\n\n【8】Case 1\n\nPatient information and clinical findings： This was a 58-year-old male patient from Beijing who was brought to our emergency department by ambulance with persistent chest pain for one hour. The first electrocardiogram diagnosis of AMI was made in the ambulance ， and the chest pain center of our hospital was immediately notified. After arriving at the emergency department， the patient was quickly transferred to the catheterization room for emergency coronary angiography， and the angiography suggested that the left anterior descending branch was 100% occluded at the opening. No obvious obstructive lesion was observed in the left rotary branch and the right coronary artery. Thrombosis aspiration was performed in the anterior descending branch， and a 3.5 mm×23 mm Firehawk Drug-Eluting Stent (DES) (MicroPort， Shanghai， China) was implanted . The time from entry to guide Wire(Door to Wire) was 53 min. The lowest intraoperative blood pressure of the patient was reduced to about 70/40 mmHg. Cardiogenic shock was considered， and IABP was used to maintain hemodynamics by applying vasoactive drugs. The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) after surgery. Standardized diagnosis and treatment were carried out according to the Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction通用删除7(英):<u>(2019)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> published by the Cardiovascular Diseases Branch of the Chinese Medical Association. Postoperative ultrasonic cardiogram showed that the motion amplitude of the anterior wall of the left ventricle and the middle apical segment of the ventricular septum decreased， the Ejection Fraction (EF) was 50%， and the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 55 mm. Medication included aspirin|删除段之间换行|(100 mg Qd)， ticagrelor (90 mg Bid)， atorvastatin (40 mg Qn)， low molecular weight heparin (4000 IU Q12h)， and dopamine injection6 ug/min/kg combined with m-hydroxylamine injection 0.13 mg/min. Considering the hemodynamic instability of patients，B-receptor blockers and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACEI)/Angiotensin Receptor Antagonist (ARB) were not given. Using the above drug therapy and the application of IABP， arterial pressure was maintained at 90-110/50-70 mmHg， but hemodynamics could not be effectively maintained in patients with reduced vasoactive drug dosage or reduced IABP working intensity (adjusting the counter pulsation ratio to 1：3).\n\nChinese herbs and acupuncture intervention： On day 5 of those mentioned above standardized Western medicine treatment， we decided to give the patient a combination of TCHs and acupuncture combined with Western medicine based on our clinical experience to try to correct the patient's refractory CS state. At that time， the patient felt short of breath， had a dry mouth prompting a desire for a hot drink， drinking water did not quench thirst， limbs were wet and cold， poor appetite and sleep， and stool and stool urine were normal. He was weak-spirited， yellow in complexion， had a pale tongue with white coating， and a heavy and weak pulse. The diagnosis， according to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)， was\"true pain\" and the syndrome differentiation was\" exhaustion of Yang in heart and kidney combined with a loss of Qi Yin and floating of the mind with declining of stomach Qi (TCM terminology). The patient was prescribed hui jue jiu xin decoction， three doses， thickly decocted， 100 mL each time， twice a day. The specific composition of TCH prescriptions is shown in Table 1. Moreover， according to the acupuncture theory of TCM， acupuncture treatment was carried out every day. Acupoints were selected as follows： Bilateral hegu (LI4)， neiguan (PC6)， taichong (LR3)， gongsun (SP4)， tianshu|删除段之间换行|(ST25)， zusanli (ST36)， danzhong (CV17)， zhongwan (CV12)， and guanyuan (CV4). Acupuncture manipulations were carried out at hegu (LI4)， taichong (LR3)， and zusanli (ST36). During the 20-min wake-up period， an infrared therapy apparatus was used (Model 350， XINFENG Instruments Co. Ltd， Guangdong Sheng， China)， such that the temperature of the shengque (RN8) acupoint was maintained at about 40C .\n\n【11】Outcomes and follow up： Using integrative treatment， the hemodynamics of the patient was gradually stabilized. On day 3 of the combination therapy， we successfully removed the patient’s IABP device.After that， the above TCMtreatment regimens were continued， and the intensity of vasoactive drug treatment was gradually reduced. On day 6 of combined Chinese and Western medicine treatment， all vasoactive drugs were successfully withdrawn from the patient. In删除1换行addition， his previous clinical manifestations， such as shortness of breath，cold and damp limbs， and poorappetite and sleep， significantly improved. Reexamination of echocardiography showed the level of EF was back up to 65%， and the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter fell to 43 mm. After discharge， the patient continued treatment with integrated TCHs and Western medicine for more than six months Follow-up showed that the patient's vital signs were good and that he could resume normal daily activities.\n\n【12】Case 2\n\n【13】Patient information and clinical findings： This 69-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital due to paroxysmal chest pain for10 days. Ten days ago， the patient was admitted to the emergency department of a local hospital with chest pain， which persisted for13 h and was diagnosed as acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.\n\n【14】Table 1： Specific camposition of traditional Chinese herb prescriptions.\n\n| Chinese name  | Common name  | Dosage  | Amount  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hongshen  | Radix ginseng rubra  | 10g  | 4.0%  |\n| Maidong  | Radix ophiopogonis  | 15g  | 6.1%  |\n| Wuweizi  | Schisandra chinensis  | 12g  | 4.9%  |\n| Guizhi  | Cassia twig  | 45g  | 18.2%  |\n| Shaoyao  | Paeony  | 15g  | 6.1%  |\n| Zhigancao  | Honey-fried licorice root  | 10g  | 4.0%  |\n| Fuzi  | Radix aconiti carmichaeli  | 30g  | 12.1%  |\n| Ganjiang  | Rhizoma zingiberis  | 20g  | 8.1%  |\n| Mur  | Oyster shell  | 30g  | 12.1%  |\n| Longgu  | Keel  | 30g  | 12.1%  |\n| Shanzhuyu  | Dogwood  | 20g  | 8.1%  |\n| Jiaosanxian  | Charred triplet  | 10g  | 4.0%  |\n\n【16】删除10:<u>C</u>\n\n【17】Ventricular fibrillation occurred in the emergency room， sinus rhythm was restored after advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation， and he was transferred to the CCU. Based on the relatively stable vital signs， elective coronary angiography was performed on the ninth day of hospitalization， but coronary interventional therapy was not performed due to the difficulty of such surgery. The patient was transferred by ambulance to our center on May 29th， 2019， for further coronary revascularization. Echocardiography showed left ventricular enlargement， abnormal left ventricular wall movement(left ventricular end-diastolic diameter： 60 mm，EF：45%). The patient did not report a history of hypertension or diabetes.

Blood pressure： 110/69 mmHg (dopamine： 3 ug/min/kg， m-hydroxylamine： 0.2 mg/min)， HR： 69 times/min. He was weak-spirited， lacked energy， showed a darkpurple tongue with less coating， and his pulse appeared weak. The TCM diagnosis was true pain\" and the differential diagnosis was \"exhaustion of Yang in heart and kidney combined with the loss of Qi Yin， and floating in mind with declining of stomach Qi.\"We applied exactly the same TCM treatment regimen as in Case 1 to the patient， including TCHs and acupuncture therapy. On June 8h， 2020， the patient’s symptoms of chest tightness and poor appetite improved after taking the TCHs， and the patient experienced no particular discomfort. Nevertheless， the patient still felt short of breath and was fatigued， and his limbs were wet and cold. Based on these symptoms， the dosage of cassia twig in the original prescription was adjusted to 60 g， the prescription was one dose， and it was applied in the same manner as before. On June 09h，2020， the dampness and cold condition of the patient's extremities improved， with morning BP： 101/60 mmHg (dopamine： 2.6 ug/min/kg，m-hydroxyamine： 0.15mg/min)， HR： 81 times/min. The dosage of radix aconiti carmichaeli in the original prescription was adjusted to 40 g， and 3 doses were prescribed. The treatment plan of TCHs combined with acupuncture was continued.\n\n【21】Outcomes and follow up： After the above treatment， the patient’s mental state and the wet and cold condition of his extremities improved further， and the application intensity of the vasoactive drugs was gradually reduced. On day 6 (June 11h，2020) after TCHs combined with acupuncture， the patient was discharged successfully. After discharge， the patient received integrated TCHs and Western medicine treatment and was followed up 6 months after discharge. The patient's condition was stable， and he was able to resume normal daily activities.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】To the best of our knowledge， this is the first case report of TCHs combined with acupuncture in the treatment of refractory CS. The magnitude of the myocardial infarction may have led to CS in Case 1， despite prompt coronary reperfusion therapy. In Case 2， the opportunity of early reperfusion therapy was missed because the duration of chest pain exceeded the time window of emergency删除1换行treatment for early coronary reperfusion. The patient developed acute left heart failure after the successful completion of diseased vessel revascularization， and it was considered that myocardial reperfusion injury might have been an important cause of CS for him. The similarities between the two cases were as follows： The two AMI patients developed Cs while undergoing standard Western medicine treatment， including coronary revascularization， and both patients hemodynamics could be effectively maintained with the assistance of vasoactive drugs， even IABP. In this context， the implementation of similar TCHs and acupuncture therapy may help to effectively improve patients CS status and improve long-term clinical benefits. According to TCM， shock is a syndromic condition， a comprehensive manifestation of severe depletion in Yin， Yang Qi， \"blood，\" and \"body fluid\". The pathophysiological mechanisms according to Western medicine were different in the two patients， but the pathogenesis according to TCM theory was similar， both of which were characterized by \"exhaustion of Yang in heart and kidney combined with loss of Qi Yin and floating of the mind with declining of stomach Qi\". According to TCM， Yang is the foundation of human life. The importance of Yang was mentioned by the \"Inner Canon of Huangdi\"， the most famous classic text of Chinese medicine， over2，000 years ago. Two patients suffered from myocardial infarction leading to heart Yang loss and showed hemodynamics could not be effectively maintained. The loss of Heart Yang can result in being patients being weak-spirited and lacking in energy. According to TCM theory， Yin， Qi， \"blood， and \"body fluid\" tend to get damaged as a result of exhaustion of Yang. Therefore， while \"warming Yang\"， the emphasis of therapy is to \"nourish Qi and Yin and activate blood circulation\". When prescribing hui jue jiu xin decoction，large doses of radix aconiti carmichaeli， rhizoma zingiberis， and cassia twig were used to \"reverse back to Yang\"； radix ginseng rubra， radix ophiopogonis， schisandra chinensis， and dogwood were used to reinforce Qi and nourish Yin\"； and keel and oyster shell were used to\"restore Yang. Charred triplet was used to stimulate the appetite and protect the stomach. The TCH prescriptions in these cases included radix aconiti carmichaeli， radix ginseng rubra， schisandra chinensis， and other drugs. Modern studies have shown that ginsenosides can alleviate reperfusion injury of myocardial cells and inhibit apoptosis of ischemia-reperfusion cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Aconitoid alkaloids are important effective components of aconite， which have been shown to antagonize oxidative damage of myocardial cells and inhibit the expression of myocardial apoptotic proteins 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Shenfu injections， made from the extracts of red ginseng and aconite， are widely used in clinical practice and are potentially valuable for recovering cardiac删除1换行function in patients with CS 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Shengmai injection composed of ginseng， radix ophiopogonis， and schisandra chinensisis also widely used in the treatment of CS. Studies have shown that it has a variety of pharmacological effects such as increasing coronary blood flow， preventing myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury， and improving left ventricular remodeling 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Therefore， we speculated that the traditional Chinese herb prescriptions in these medical cases may have played a protective role in the myocardium by inhibiting cell apoptosis and alleviating reperfusion injury and other potential mechanisms and by promoting the recovery of cardiac function of the patients. Acupuncture is widely used to relieve and improve somatic symptoms. A recent multicentre， randomized controlled study showed that acupuncture can effectively relieve angina pectoris symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In the cases reported here hegu (LI4) was used together with taichong (LR3)， neiguan (PC6)， and gongsun (SP4)， aimed at \"regulating Qi and nourishing blood\"； guanyuan (CV4)， zhongwan (CV12) were used simultaneously with tianshu (ST25) and zusanli (ST36) to regulate digestive function and balance Qi； danzhong(CV17) was used for regulating Qi and\"blood\". When using needles， infrared treatment to warm the shenque (RN8) acupoints amplified the effects of acupuncture. After synergistic treatment with acupuncture， the hemodynamics of both patients were significantly improved. Basic studies have shown that acupuncture can regulate blood pressure in hypotensive model rats 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>. Of course， further exploration of the mechanism of TCH combined with acupuncture on CS blood pressure regulation still needs to be explored further. In terms of safety， radix aconiti carmichaeli is an important traditional Chinese herb used in CS treatment， which strengthens heart and addresses arrhythmia 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. In the 2015 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia， the dosage of radix aconiti carmichaeli is recommended to be 3 g/d to 15 g/d 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>， but in classic ancient books of TCM， the dosage of radix aconiti carmichaeli in the treatment of CS is often large. As one of the main components of radix aconiti carmichaeli， aconite alkaloid has a certain toxicity and its toxicity may increase with the increase of the dosage ofaconite. In view of the potential toxicity of radix aconiti carmichaeli， ancient books of TCM put forward some detoxification methods. For example，the toxicity of radix aconiti carmichaeli can be reduced by adding licorice root and peony into the prescription containing aconite. Modern studies show that glycyrrhizic acid and flavonoids in licorice can reduce aconitine and the content of toxic substances in radix aconiti carmichaeli 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. In addition， long-term decocting of radix aconiti carmichaeli can also destroy the components of aconitine and reduce drug toxicity. The dose of radix aconiti carmichaeli applied to the two patients in these case reports exceeded the recommended dose in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia， but after a long time of separate decocting and the\"detoxification\" method combined with licorice root and peony， neither of the two patients showed clinical manifestations of aconite poisoning. Of course， there is still much room for further exploration删除1换行and research on the safety of radix aconiti carmichaeli.\n\n【24】Summary\n\n【25】With the usage of TCH combined with acupuncture， the two patients with refractory CS improved significantly either in terms of their shock state or long-term clinical prognosis， especially in the context of the poor results of standardized Western medicine treatment. Given the high fatality rate of CS， TCH combined with acupuncture may offer new opportunities. However， due to the limitations of case reports， the efficacy and safety of our therapy need to be evaluated in studies with more patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

His physical exam showed a clearly palpable abdominal mass noted from the right subcostal region to 10 cm above the iliac crest. The laboratory works were significant for hemoglobin of 8 g/dL， for which he received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood and creatinine of 1，2 mg/dL. A EUS shows a renal mass of 8 cm x9 cm. The suprarenal IVC was occupied by a thrombus that protruded above the margin of the IV hepatic segment. A CT scan shows： Voluminous mass of the right kidney (12 cm x9 cmx8cm)， this formation infiltrated the parenchyma with focal alteration of about 35 mm at the level of the VI segment，  it also makes anterior contact with the head of the pancreas and with the second duodenal portion compared to which it does not show a secure cleavage plan . The right renal vein was thrombosed and infiltrated by the neoformated process， with extrinsecation also involving the|删除段之间换行|The patient was evaluated in a multidisciplinary tumor board and， based on the current literature and considering the intractable anemization， it was the consensus that surgical resection was attempted and followed by postoperative adjuvant immunotherapy.\n\n【11】Surgical technique\n\nIn supine position under general anesthesia， firstly the general surgeon proceeded to VI segment liver resection of the mass and exposure of the intrahepatic IVC until the thrombus free level. Hepatoduodenal ligament was encircled with a vessel tape to permit the Pringle maneuver. Diseased kidney was dissected and its renal artery divided and ligated. The suprahepatic IVC was dissected and surrounded by a vascular loop for potential posterior clamping. Veno-venous bypass was placed between the jugular vein and IVC bifurcation to restore hemodynamic stability and prevent massive|删除段之间换行|reduction venous return causing profound hypotension during liver maneuver. Also a recup of blood machine was placed. With the patient in Trendelenburg position we proceed to clamp the infrarenal IVC below the thrombus， the renal veins and the IVC above the thrombus of the cava (At suprahepatic level supplemented with a Pringle maneuver). Longitudinal incision of the IVC started from the tumor adhesion-free point at the level of the renal vein keeping5 mm tumor- free margin. The thrombus showed strong adhesion to the IVC walls in the first extrahepatic part， while it was possible to mobilize from the IVC in the intrahepatic fraction. Oval shaped xeno-pericardial patch was used to repair the incised IVC by running suture using polypropylene 5-0. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed intraoperatively to monitor cardiac function and possible pulmonary artery thrombus by manipulation of the tumor thrombus in the IVC. After accurately evaluating the invasion of the duodenum and the surgical risk of a partial pancreatic resection， the dissection along with a complete duodenopancreatectomy followed by splenectomy was completed.\n\n【13】At 9 months follow up the patient is in good condition and is completing the third cycle of chemotherapy with sunitinib.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Venous invasion is associated with Stage T3 of the TNM classification.Patients with untreated stage T3 RCC with intravascular IVC thrombus have a median life expectancy of 5 months and 1year disease-specific survival of 29% 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Successful resections of a RCC with removal of associated intravascular thrombus have been associated with a good long term control of the tumor in nearly50% of cases that present with T3 disease. Most of the studies that analyzed retrospectively the outcomes between RCC patient with IVC thrombus who received surgical management and the patients who underwent straight to systemic therapy found that patient who underwent surgery have longer survival rate； however the significance of those retrospective studies are limited by selection bias. In fact， most of the patients who did not receive surgical management had higher ECOG-PS and greater tumor burden， including unresectable disease and metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[71</u>.\n\n【16】The presence of distant metastasis has been reported to be a very powerful prognostic factor in RCC patients with venous tumor thrombus 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>； another study showed that RCC patients with distant metastasis venous tumors had a cancer-specific survival rate of 10%and 60% in those without distant metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[91</u>.\n\nFurthermore，patients with metastatic RCC itself have historically poor prognosis， with an average survival term of 8 months. Patients|删除段之间换行|with survival term of two years only account for 10% to 20% of patients.Another study confirms that the mean survival ofT4patients who are not treated surgically is 5 months.\n\n【18】Comparing with T3 patient management， patients who are diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (T4) or patient who develops metastasis or recurrent disease following prior treatment are generally treatedwithsystemic therapy， primarily using immunotherapy or agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor pathways.\n\n【19】There are currently eight US FDA approved agents available for the treatment of mRCC. Five of these agents target VEGF of its receptors， two inhibit activity of mTOR， and one is a recombinant form of endogenous cytokine IL-2 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【20】Despite new and effective conservative therapy， nephrectomy continues to have an important role in T4 patient when is performed prior to systemic therapy in attempts to decrease the bulk of the tumor (Citoreductive surgery) and when is performed to control severe symptoms caused by the primary tumor (Palliative surgery).\n\n【21】Regression of metastatic disease following nephrectomy are described， but very rarely 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>.\n\n【22】Two randomized controlled trials have been completed in the era of Interferon (IFN) immunotherapy (SWOG demonstrates that nephrectomy before treatment resulted in a statistically significant improvement in overall survival and EORTC demonstrates that both times to progression and overall survival duration significantly favored cytoreductive nephrectomy prior to immunotherapy)通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14]</u>. The available data derived from the EORTC and SWOG study shows that approximately 20% of the patients will not benefit from the additional nephrectomy and deteriorate rapidly， despite the combined approach， and ultimately meaning that they have undergone an unnecessary and morbid treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【23】Therefore patient selection for cytoreductive nephrectomy should be done carefully so that patient can proceed with immune-based therapy following surgery， considering the following criteria：possibility to debulk > than 74% of the tumor， ECOG PSperformance status of 0 or 1  and adequate organ function with no evidence of extensive liver or bone metastasis or central nervous system involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【24】The results of nephrectomy prior to therapy with molecularly targeted agents as opposed to molecularly targeted agent alone are删除1换行still debated. While two retrospective studies (with patient from IMDC and National Cancer Database) suggest that cytoreductive nephrectomy prior to targeted therapy provides significantly longer overall survival 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u>； in CARMENA Trial results with Sunitinib alone met the criteria for no inferiority compared with those with nephrectomy followed by Sunitinib.\n\n【25】Surgical therapy for stage IV RCC with massive neoplastic venous thrombosis is still debated and it should only be performed on carefully selected patient with the intent of oncologic debulking and prophylaxis of massive embolisms which requires a multidisciplinary approach.\n\n【26】Large renal masses frequently induce a significant amount of reactive desmoplasia， obliterating surgical tissue planes and mimicking pT4 disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. The majority of patients in whom involvement of adjacent organ is suspected clinically are over staged(60%)通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Colon， pancreas and diaphragm are the most frequently involved structures， followed by liver， spleen and bowel mesentery.\n\n【27】For patient who has radical nephrectomy with adjacent organ resection， surgical margin status is the most important variable in determining overall survival. These patients’ survival outcomes are often similar to patient with metastatic disease and should be considered for neoadjuvant or adjuvant clinical trials 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\n\n【28】Surgical strategies discussion\n\n【29】The traditional classification of RCC caval thrombus is as follows：\n\n【30】I. Venous thrombus in the renal vein not reaching IVC\n\n【31】II. Infra-hepatic IVC thrombus.\n\n【32】III. a： Intrahepatic： A thrombus extending into the retrohepatic IVC but below the Ostia of major hepatic veins .删除2换行b： Hepatic： a thrombus extending into the retrohepatic IVC reaching the Ostia of the major hepatic veins and may extend into them causing Budd-Chiari syndrome删除1换行c： Suprahepatic， infradiaphragmatic： A thrombus extending into the retrohepatic IVC above the major hepatic veins but below the diaphragm.删除2换行d： Suprahepatic， supradiaphragmatic and infra-atrial： A thrombus extending into the supradiaphragmatic， intrapericardial IVC but not into the right atrium\n\n【33】IV. Right atrial thrombus.\n\n【34】Depending on the extent of the IVC thrombus many different surgical techniques can be used： veno-venous bypass (for stage I and II)， pump-driven Veno-Venous Bypass (VVB) in which the IVC and the IMV are connected to the right atrium (stage IIIa to IIIc) and Cardio Pulmonary Bypass with or without Deep Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest (DHCA) (stage IIId to IV).\n\n【35】Level I or II IVC thrombi are treated by dissection of the IVC， without the need for a complete piggy-back， with clamping of the contralateral renal vein and the IVC above and below the thrombus， followed by cavotomy and thrombectomy. It is not necessary to perform a complete piggy-back if Pringle maneuver with hepatic clamp is performed in association with clamping of the suprahepatic IVC for less than 20 min.\n\n【36】In group III a hepatic mobilization using liver transplantation(piggyback) technique is usually done to allow adequate exposure of the retrohepatic IVC. If the ligation and division of all retrohepatic veins (complete piggy-back) is completed then it is not necessary to clamp the hepatic hilum in level III thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>.\n\n【37】Ciancio et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> described a successful technique in removing stage IIId thrombi without intraoperative bypass maneuvers while avoiding median sternotomy depending on milking of the tumor thrombus below the level of the major hepatic veins. This is facilitated by IVC dissection from the posterior abdominal wall， thus allowing the surgeon fingers to wrap circumferential around the IVC and avoiding letting loose a thrombus fragment 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>.\n\n【38】If the lumen of the IVC is reduced by >50% after vascular resection， patch angioplasty of the IVC with biologic， autologous or synthetic material can be used to reconstruct the IVC and to maintain satisfactory luminal domain and latency 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. In those cases in which a segmental resection of the IVC wall is necessary to ensure negative margins， the IVC can be replaced with a tube graft. However， in cases in which the IVC is totally occluded by either tumor or no tumor thrombus，segmental resection ofthe IVC can be performed to ensure negative margins， but there is no need to perform IVC reconstruction and it can be ligated and left in discontinuity 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. If resection with reconstruction or replacement of an occluded IVC is planned， preservation of uninvolved venous collaterals and lumbar veins during IVC mobilization is important to ensure pathways for venous return and avoidance of postoperative lower extremity swelling 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>.\n\n【39】Concomitant partial or total cross-clamping of the abdominal aorta will maintain systemic blood pressure above 100mmHg. The clamping should not be continued for more than 30 minutes to avoid renal dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>.\n\n【40】Conclusion\n\n【41】For those patients showing a good PS and presenting with locally advanced metastatic RCC invasion to neighboring viscera， surgical resection is a viable option that should be comprehensively discussed. Further studies to evaluate the survival benefit in combination with targeted therapies are anticipated.\n\n【42】Complete surgical extirpation is possible in cases of RCC is invading other organs such aspancreas， duodenum， liver and retroperitoneum. In this scenario， to narrow the possible intraoperative and post-operative complication， a multidisciplinary approach and equipe is recommended.\n\n【43】A contemporary， multi institutional cohort is needed1to删除1换行determine which patients may benefit from such aggressive surgical interventions.

The patient recovered on the pediatric floor after supportive management and was then transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility for further care. She was discharged in good condition after 15 days with outpatient cardiology follow up. This patient's case reveals the importance of including toxidromes in the differential for pediatric heart failure and highlights how co-ingestions maylead to a misleading initial clinical picture.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Heart failure is a relatively uncommon occurrence in the pediatric population that requires careful attention to detail， evaluation， and management. When determining the etiology of a pediatric patient’s heart failure， the differential is broad and includes congenital heart disease， cardiomyopathies， arrhythmias， ischemia， infection， and high output state 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Initial evaluation should include electrocardiogram， echocardiogram， chest radiography， and basic lab work including cardiac enzymes and markers 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. While cardiac injury is often a result of infection， it is important to consider other inciting causes in cases in which the case progression does not follow a traditional course， regardless of presumed likelihood. As such， cardiac failure secondary to toxic ingestion should always be considered. Evaluation for ingestion includes thorough past medical history， detailed inquiry regarding access to medications， urine drug screen， and serum ingestion labs. Common toxic ingestions that lead to cardiomyopathy include chemotherapeutic medications， alcohol， cocaine，anti-retroviral agents， carbon monoxide， amphetamines， and heavy metal exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The consideration of this etiology is often compounded by the fact that accurate diagnosis of this condition relies on the accuracy and cooperation of the patient. This case highlights a mixed ingestion leading to cardiac failure in a pediatric patient and the importance ofan accurate and thorough history.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】The patient in this case is an 11-year-old female with history of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) controlledwithguanfacine and.extended release dextroamphetamine-amphetamine who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaint of abrupt-onset， severe chest pain and shortness of breath. Prior to presentation， the patient reported she was in her usual state of health. Associated symptoms included dizziness， fatigue， and intermittent somnolence. In the ED， she was hypoxemic with oxygen saturation of 77% on room air， tachypneic， and hypertensive without tachycardia. She was placed on a non-rebreather which initially yielded删除1换行improvements in her oxygen saturation. Chest X-ray was obtained and showed hazy and patchy airspace opacity at the bilateral lung bases . Initial labs revealed elevated high sensitivity troponin I (695 ng/L， nl <18)， elevated D-dimer (1.45 ug/mL)， polycythemia (hemoglobin 19.7 g/dL， Hct 58%)， leukocytosis (20.7K/uL)， normal coagulation factors， normal ferritin， normal CRP(<0.5 mg/dL)，and normal BNP (55.1 pg/mL). In light of her overall clinical status and lab work， the patient was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Poison Control was contacted on admission and did not， at that time， think her presentation was consistent with a toxidrome. Despite being on a non-rebreather， the patient developed worsening hypoxemia and required transition to high-flow nasal cannula. The patient continued to require increases in respiratory support with worsening hypoxemia andWas ultimately intubated to better manage her respiratory status. Echocardiogram was obtained in response to her abnormal cardiac labs and demonstrated moderately decreased systolic function with ejection fraction of 36%. Repeat troponin increased to 1636 ng/L. At that time， she was started on milrinone and dobutamine infusions and transferred to a quaternary care center PICU for consideration of Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS) given her severe degree of cardiac dysfunction . Following transfer， the patient remained hypotensive and hypoxemic despite multiple pressors， stress-dose hydrocortisone， and mechanical ventilation. While ECLS was initially considered， clinical improvement was noted following inotropic medication titration and ongoing volume resuscitation. Over the following day， the patient was weaned off pressor support and extubated on hospital day two. On day three， she no longer required respiratory support and left ventricular systolic ejection fraction had returned to normal on echocardiogram. Troponin 删除2换行and pro-BNP gradually decreased throughout her hospitalization. After transfer to the floor， further chart review revealed that the patient was recently seen twice by her primary care provider for depression. Poison Control was contacted and it was discerned that a guanfacine ingestion combined with dextroamphetamine-amphetamine could explain her initial presentation. The patient initially denied any intentional ingestion or self-harm， but further questioning revealed an intentional attempt to take guanfacine and dextroamphetamine-amphetamine as an attempt to end her life. It was estimated she took about two weeks’ worth of each medication， as no pills were found at home. Once medically stabilized， the patient required a ten-day psychiatric admission. During the hospital stay， she was started on fluoxetine for depression and methylphenidate in place of guanfacine and dextroamphetamine-amphetamine for ADHD. Since discharge， she has continued outpatient mental health follow up for ADHD and depression. The patient was seen in follow up by pediatric cardiology approximately one month after discharge from the inpatient pediatric cardiology service； at that time， her echocardiogram and EKG were both reassuringly normal . During that visit， the plan for six month follows up with repeat echocardiogram and EKG was made. If studies remain normal at her six month follow up， she will no longer need to follow with pediatric cardiology.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Toxidromes of ADHDmedications 删除8:<u>上 </u>have been studied throughout the years and are well-documented in pediatric literature. While there is abundant data regarding individual toxicities， data surrounding overdoses of multiple ADHD medications have not been as thoroughly documented. Amphetamine toxicity has been described as a primarily sympathomimetic syndrome with some psychiatric symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The cardiac symptoms associated with amphetamine overdose include dysrhythmia， tachycardia， and hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Guanfacine overdose has been shown to lead to multiple cardiac adverse events， including cardiogenic pulmonary edema 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， hypotension and bradycardia 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， as well as the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. With our patient’s mixed initial presentation of hypertension， bradycardia， severely depressed ejection fraction， and elevated cardiac markers， her symptoms and work up did not seem to be consistent with a known toxidrome， which led to a more dedicated pursuit of other causes for her presentation. The lab and imaging abnormalities of markedly elevated troponin， leukocytosis， and echocardiographic findings\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】This case highlights the profound cardiac effects of combined guanfacine anddextroamphetamine-amphetamine toxidromes， which has not been well-documented in the current pediatric literature. Additionally， our case serves as an important reminder to maintain a broad differential diagnosis for pediatric heart failure， including intentional ingestion， especially in critically ill patients删除1换行when a thorough history is not always available. Future studies may look into the benefits of hydrocortisone use in patients who are critically ill secondary to a toxidrome of this nature. While steroids were used in the setting of multiple pressor-resistant hypotension，the patient improved quickly after initiation of the steroids； however， it is difficult to know if our patient’s rapid improvement was directly linked to the steroid administration or if it was a combination of an additional pressor， fluid resuscitation， and the natural course of the ingested medications. Overall， this case illustrates the potential life-threatening complications of combined ADHD medication overdoses as well as the importance of thorough history taking and differential diagnoses development.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Significant alterations in fecal microbiomes were found in COVID-19 patients， characterized by enrichment ofopportunistic pathogens and depletion of beneficial commensal， at time of admission to hospital and at all stages during hospitalization. Depleted symbionts and gut dysbiosis persisted even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 (determined from throat swabs) and resolution of respiratory symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.

Studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 virus in anal swabs and stool samples in almost 50% of patients with COVID-19， suggesting that the digestive tract might be an extra-pulmonary site for virus replication and activity 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. Moreover， fecal calprotectin was found to be elevated in patients with COVID-19， with diarrhea an indicator of inflammatory responses in the gut 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【8】In addition to the potential direct effects ofCOVID-19 on the composition of the gut microbiota， broad-spectrum antibiotics administered to COVID-19 patients are also affecting the bacterial删除1换行colonization of the gut.

In patients who are (symptomatic or non-symptomatic) carriers of certain multi-drug resistant bacterial pathogens， e.g. Clostridioides (C.) difficile，Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae， or Enterococcus (E.) faecium， this loss of colonization resistance can result in overgrowth of the gut by the respective bacterial pathogen， followed by disease manifestation. China's National Health Commission already recommended in early (and also in their latest) versions of their guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19patients， to avoid the unselective and inappropriate use of antibiotics， especially the usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 74 year old female patient was admitted to the District Hospital of Jarocin， Poland with severe epigastric pain， loss of appetite and body weight due to acute renal failure. A SARS-CoV-2test (Panbio Antigen Test， Abbott Laboratories Poland Sp. Z o.o.， Warsaw， Poland)， performed as part of the admission diagnostics， was found to be negative. Routine laboratory tests performed at admission showed hemoglobin： 9.8 mg/dl， creatinine 27.06 mg/dl， hyperkalemia： 7.24 mmol/l. Abdominal ultrasound examination revealedlivernotenlarged， homogeneous， withincreased echogenicity； thin-walled gall bladder， with an echo of calculus； kidneysbilaterallywithhydronephrosisand narrowed parenchyma layer， visible echoes of deposits in the calyxes； with no other significant deviations. Chest X-rays showed pulmonary fields without focal changes and a normal heart.\n\n【11】The patient was treated with omeprazole 20 mg(b.i.d.，p.o.)，500 ml5% glucose plus insulin (Gensulin\" R) 100 IU (b.i.d.， i.v.)， furosemide2 amp. (b.i.d， i.v.)， 500 ml 0.9% NaCl (b.i.d，i.v.)， potassium 391 mg(b.i.d.，p.o.). A noticeable normalization of laboratory parameters was observed. After 16 days of therapy， creatinine levels leveled at 4.23mg/dl.\n\nOn day 16 of her hospital stay， a second SARS-CoV-2 test was performed and was found to be positive. The patient didn’t report symptoms of respiratory tract infection， was respiratory efficient， had no fever and was in fairly good general condition. As per the standard process for all COVID-19 patients of the District Hospital in Jarocin， the patient was transferred to the Multispecialist City Hospital in Poznan， Poland， some 75 km away from Jarocin. At admission the patient suffered from diarrhea， which was considered to be related to the COVID-19 infection. The patient was treated with Clexane(s.c) for thromboprophylaxis， empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone 1 g (b.i.d.，i.v.)， and oxygen therapy to reach an O2 saturation ≥ 95%. On the third day of hospitalization two units of red cell concentrate were transfused to address the patient’s anemia. Dexamethasone was not administered to the patient. The patient's hyperkalemia was treated by administration of Resonium A30 g ， glucose 10% plus insulin (i.v.) 500 ml， furosemide 20 mg(t.i.d.， i.v.). Due to significant diuresis and the lowering of creatinine concentration， the intervention was abandoned in favor of forcing diuresis with furosemide only. As diarrhea persisted， administration of a multi-strain probiotic (Lakcidforte， containing a total of 1×109colony forming units as a mixture of the Lacticaseibacillus (L.) rhamnosus strains E/N (40%)， Oxy (20%) and Pen (40%)) was initiated on day three of the antibiotic therapy. Administration of|删除段之间换行|After 30 days at home， the patient was re-admitted to the District Hospital in Jarocin due to diarrhea and abdominal pain. Presence of C. dificile toxin was confirmed in a stool sample and a new cycle of treatment with vancomycin 250 mg (q.i.d.，p.o.) and metronidazole500 mg (t.i.d.， i.v.) was initiated. As several days of treatment showed no improvement of the patient’s condition， a stool sample was collected for culture of pathological bacteria. Presence of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) producing K. pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was confirmed in the sample， while C. difficile couldn’t be cultivated from the sample. Despite intensive treatment of the patient， renal function deteriorated and symptoms of circulatory failure worsened. The patient died 18 days after her second admission to the District Hospital in Jarocin due to multi-organ failure resulting from infection with pathological bacteria.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to COVID-19patients is part ofthe established pharmacological treatment standard. All broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy carries the intrinsic risk of triggering the uncontrolled proliferation of multi-drug resistant bacterial pathogens in patients. The patient in this case report was not tested for the presence of multi-drug resistant bacterial pathogens before the antibiotic therapy was initiated， as this is not an established routine in the Polish (and most other) healthcare system(S). Therefore it is not known if the bacterial pathogens which finally killed the patient originated from the patient herself， being a carrier of these pathogens， or had been acquired during her hospital stay.\n\n【15】The likely reason for triggering the proliferation of pathogenic multi-drug resistant bacteria by broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is the destruction of the protective gut-microbiota (colonization resistance) as shown in Figure 1 as point no. 5 in the graphical representation of the chain of events of this case report 通用删除6(英):<u>[9-111</u>.\n\n【16】The majority of bacteria in the gut are susceptible to antibiotics. However， the gut microbiota may also comprise bacterial pathogens in low amounts (e.g. C. difficile strains 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>， K. pneumoniae strains通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> and E. faecium 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>)， which are resistant against a broad range of commonly used antibiotics. While the commensal bacteria of the gut normally keep proliferation of these pathogens at bay， treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics can destroy this control function of the gut microbiota (loss of colonization resistance). Culturing pathogenic bacteria from a stool sample taken from the patient revealed the presence of ESBL-K. pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Despite earlier findings of fecal C. difficile toxin， cultivation of C. difficile from the stool sample was not possible. The reasons for failing to cultivate C. difficile could be (i) that vancomycin treatment had already successfully eliminated the pathogen from the gut of the patient or (ii) that the sample taken contained an amount of vancomycin， which made in-vitro cultivation of the(vancomycin-sensitive) C. difficile impossible. The proliferation of pathogenic bacteria finally resulted in disease manifestation with fatal consequences for the patient. To strengthen the colonization resistance of the patient's gut microbiota a probiotic containing three different strains of L. rhamnosushad been administered. The potential of products containing probiotic microorganisms to support the colonization resistance of the gut has been discussed in-depth in a recent review 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Unfortunately， the administration of the probiotic had no long-lasting protective effect in the presented patient case. Potential reasons for this failure could be that the administration of the product had been initiated only 3 days after the initiation of the antibiotic therapy or that the administered product failed to inhibit the proliferation of the specific bacterial pathogens causing the patient’s problems 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. It is important to note that there is growing evidence that complex multi-strain synbiotics are more effective in inhibiting pathogenic bacteria than less complex probiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>[171</u>.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】The awareness of the risk associated d with1tthe empiric administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to COVID-19 patients has to be increased， as in some patients this can result in fatal bacterial infections. The potential benefits of products containing probiotic microorganisms in these patients should be investigated in more detail in clinical studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We present the case of a patient with somatic dMMR (loss of MLH1 and PMS2)， MSI-H and BRAF V-600E mutated metastatic right-sided colon cancer treated with an Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI)， who had radiological signs of Hyperprogressive Disease (HPD) with also an increase in tumour marker levels， followed by a Complete Remission (CR).\n\n【2】Keywords： Colorectal cancer； Hyperprogression； Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy； Microsatellite instability； Pseudoprogression\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】In patients with MSI-H CRC， Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) therapy can be an effective treatment option 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. New patterns of tumour response have been seen on ICI treatment. The concept of HPD is based on a faster than expected tumour growth on ICI compared to the rate of progression on standard chemotherapy. HPD was reported in 4% to 29% of patients treated with immunotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. It can be hard to distinguish HPD from pseudoprogression， which is a rare condition also occurring in patients treated with ICI. After an initial radiologic evaluable progressive disease， a late tumour response occurs 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. The rate of pseudoprogression is ≤ 10% of patients， independent of tumour type 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】The patient was initially diagnosed with stage IIIC (pT3， pN2b (8/22)， cM0) disease， treated with a right hemicolectomy and received adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin(XELOX).Due to sensory neuropathy， oxaliplatin was stopped after 4 cycles. Adjuvanttreatment was completed for total duration of 6 months with capecitabine monotherapy until September 2018. At the end ofadjuvant chemotherapy， a PET-CT showed new development ofperitoneal carcinomatosis and hepatic metastases . A first line PD-1-inhibitor therapy with pembrolizumab was initiated in the light of MSI-H metastatic CRC. After three doses of pembrolizumab， an early PET-CT scan was initiated due to clinical signs of disease progression with beginning bowel obstruction. At this time the tumour marker Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) had increased from 8.42 ug/l (at start of pembrolizumab) to 52.9 ug/l. The PET-CT showed metabolic and morphologic progression of peritoneal carcinomatosis， in contrast to metabolic regression but morphologic progression of hepatic metastases. At the time， we interpreted the combination of clinical findings， imaging and increasing tumour marker levels， as signs of rapid tumour progression and started a second line palliative therapy with 5-Fluoruracil， Leucovorin and Irinotecan (FOLFIRI). Treatment was stopped after two courses due to patient wish. The PET-CT after treatment stop showed minor metabolic and morphologic residuals ofthe peritoneal carcinomatosis and no evidence ofhepatic metastases， corresponding to a near Complete Remission (nCR). Tumour marker CEA had decreased to 3.25ug/l and subsequently normalized. The latest PET-CT in April 2021 showed continued CR .\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】A possible explanation for the rapid disease progression on the first restaging PET-CT after3 pembrolizumab doses is HPD on ICI therapy. It has been shown that patients with HPD had a lower frequency of new lesions compared to patients with disease progression without HPD 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【9】In our case， the patient had progression of peritoneal carcinomatosis on PET-CT. However， there was no clear evidence of new lesions. Another explanation for the rapid disease progression is an initial response to pembrolizumab in terms of pseudoprogression. The hypothesis is that pseudoprogression is associated with immune cells infiltrating in tumour tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. It remains unclear whether pseudoprogression is a result of natural tumour growth before response to ICI 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. As our patient continues to be in CR， it seems plausible that pseudoprogression led to a durable response， which resolved in CR. The role of FOLFIRI remains unclear： Whether the chemotherapy induced a tumour response by itself or in combination with the previous immunotherapy. First line chemotherapy with FOLFIRI has a CR rate of about 5%通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Recently， the second interim analysis of the KEYNOTE-177 study was published. The open-label phase III trial enrolled 307 previously untreated patients with MSI-H/dMMR metastatic CRC. The patients were randomized 1：1 to first-line pembrolizumab for up to 2 years or investigator’s choice of FOLFIRI or modified FOLFOX6 (5-Fluorouracil， Leucovorin and Oxaliplatin) with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab. The median PFS was 16.5 months for the pembrolizumab group vs. 8.2months for the chemotherapy group (Hazard Ratio [HR]， 0.60； 95%\n\n【10】CI， 0.45 to 0.80； P=0.0002)， OS data are not available yet. Overall response rate was 43.8% for the pembrolizumab group vs. 33.1% in the chemotherapy group， with CR as best response in 11.1% vs. 3.9%of patients， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. In an update of the CheckMate 142 trial， comparing the combination of nivolumab and low-dose ipilimumab with nivolumab monotherapy as first line treatment in patients with MSI-H/dMMR metastatic CRC， the combination treatment achieved an objective response rate of 64% by investigator assessment and a disease control rate of 84%. OS and PFS is not reached yet 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. Final results from CheckMate 142 and KEYNOTE-177 are still pending， suggesting possibly durable responses in a subgroup of patients通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8，10]</u>. In our case， CEA levels increased during treatment with pembrolizumab， CEA levels dropped from 52.9 ug/l to 23.2 ug/l two weeks after starting FOLFIRI， and continued to decrease until normalization in March 2019 and continue to be in the normal range as of April 2021. The rising tumour marker CEA remains unclear. It has been demonstrated in a small group of patients with dMMR/MSI-H CRC that the degree of CEA decline after one dose of pembrolizumab was predictive of PFS and OS， the CEA response occurred prior to radiographic confirmation of disease control(range， 10 to 35 weeks)通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】We think that the clinical course and ongoing response in our patient is more likely the result of PD1-inhibitor therapy with pembrolizumab and not of chemotherapy with FOLFIRI. This hypothesis is supported byhigher CR rates in patients with metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC treated with PD1-inhibitor therapy and the unique patterns of response resulting from immunotherapy. We believe that the scenario described in our case is relevant and that physicians should be aware of the possibility of misleading early signs for disease progression. Importantly， ICI treatment should only be continued in case the patient is clinically well， because pseudoprogression generally is not very common. Distinction between pseudoprogression and HPD remains a challenge and we envision that data from large trials will help to further characterize these events.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Hepatic Portal Venous Gas (HPVG) is even rarer and has been historically associated with dismal outcome. In this brief report， we evoke this entity emphasizing its etiology， the role of Computerized Tomography (CT) in establishing the diagnosis， and treatment orientations.\n\n【2】Keywords： Portal； Gas； Sepsis； Surgery\n\n【3】Case Summary\n\n【4】A 66-year-old woman with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis， presented with a 2-hour history of severe abdominal pain. Upon initial physical examination， the patient was conscious， oriented， with diffuse abdominal guarding. She had tachycardia (120 beats/min) and preserved blood pressure(110/80 mmHg). Blood tests revealed a White Blood Count (WBC) of 20，700/mm’， a C Reactive Protein (CRP) of 137 mg/dl， a serum Lipase of 91 UI/ml， and normal liver function tests. The IV-enhanced abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed diffuse Hepatic Portal Venous Gas(HPVG) . Additionally， gas was detected in both femoral veins . The patient was taken rapidly to the operating room. Laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis of extensive intestinal necrosis from the duodenum to the transverse colon， rendering any surgical resection useless. Supportive care measures were implemented. The patient died four hours later.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】HPVG is a rare condition secondary to numerous causes， including mainly mesenteric ischemic disease， colonic diverticulitis， inflammatory bowel disease， trauma， or iatrogenic (i.e.，post endoscopic procedures) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Historically， HPVG was first observed in neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The most common cause of HPVG in adults is Acute Mesenteric Ischemia (AMI) which represents upto 70% of cases in the literature with a morality rate of up to 80% 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Table 1summarizes the most commonly reported etiologies of HPVG.\n\n【7】The intraportal gas is usually produced by microorganisms in the intestinal lumen itself or in an cllr underlying abscess. Continuous advances in the accuracy of current imaging techniques have led to less rare diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. CT scan is the mainstay of the diagnostic approach to HVPG. Pre contrast phase may be sufficient to reach diagnosis. The use of lung window is recommended for its high sensitivity in detecting small amounts of gas 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>. Usually located in the central part of the liver， pneumobilia is the main differential diagnosis of HVPG which can reach the periphery 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>.\n\n【8】Table 1： Summary of the reported underlying causes of Hepatic Portal Vein Gas (HPVG).\n\n| Etiologies of Hepatic Portal Vein Gas (HPVG)  |\n| --- |\n| Infectious  |\n| Acute cholecystitis  |\n| Acute appendicitis  |\n| Rotavirus  |\n| latrogenic  |\n| Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography  |\n| Intra gastric balloon  |\n| Colonoscopy  |\n| Pyloric balloon dilation  |\n| Hemodialysis  |\n| MiscellaneoUS  |\n| Colon cancer  |\n| Crohn disease  |\n| Acute pancreatitis  |\n| Abdominal blunt trauma  |\n\n【10】Direct signs of AMI on CT scan include abrupt termination of the mesenteric vessels or even the presence of filling defects in the vessel lumen itself. They are visualized with multi-detector angiography CT scan 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. In case ofabsence ofIV contrast， one should look for indirect signs including bowel dilation， wall thickening or attenuation， fat standing and ascites 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【11】The second most commonly reported etiology of HPVG is sigmoid diverticulitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Colonic diverticulosis， fat standing or abscess adherent to the colonic wall are commonly disclosed.\n\n【12】The prognosis of HPVG is related to the underlying etiology通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In opposition to early studies where mortality rate was nearly75% 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>， latest reports have showed an overall mortality less than40%通用删除6(英):<u>[7，11]</u>. The obvious decrease in mortality is mainly due to the increased usage and sensitivity of CT scan， which facilitated earlier detection and treatment of HPVG通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【13】Many authors have reported that the volume of HPVG is prognostic 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. However， the presence of gas 3 or more hepatic segments has the poorest prognosis. Urgent surgery may be avoided when 2 or less hepatic segments are concerned. In our case， HPVG was very extensive， spreading in the entire liver. Moreover， gas reached the caval system and flooded back to both femoral veins.\n\n【14】To conclude， CT scan has profoundly transformed the outcome of patients with HPVG. However， it remains a serious radiologic finding that needs to be closely evaluated.

Poorly controlled diabetes is one of the major risk factors. We present the case of a 60-year-old male with uncontrolled diabetes who presented at a community hospital with right facial swelling， sudden vision loss in left eye and recent outpatient treatment of bacterial sinusitis. Physical examination and imaging were consistent with rhinocerebral and pulmonary mucormycosis. Patient received broad spectrum antimicrobials.Ophthalmologist，ENT and ID specialists were consulted. Transfer process to Higher Level of Care (HLOC) was initiated however it was delayed due to lack of bed availability. Following transfer to HLOC and after undergoing continued medical treatment and multiple surgical debridements， patient subsequently was transitioned to comfort-care and on day 37， patient expired. These findings demonstrate the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment of mucormycosis to improve associated high morbidity and mortality.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Mucormycosis (zygomycosis) is a type of infection in humans that is caused by fungi of the class zygomycetes (orders Mucorales and Entomophthorales) and has a high mortality rate 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Cases of mucormycosis infections are rarely reported in community hospitals in the United States. Mucormycosis infection is contracted through inhaling sporangiospores， ingesting contaminated foods or invasion of the organism via trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. Most common clinical manifestation of mucormycosis is angioinvasion leading to thrombosis and ultimately tissue necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Invasive mucormycosis is categorized as one of the following： Rhinocerebral， pulmonary， cutaneous， gastrointestinal， disseminated and uncommon rare forms 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>. Major risk factors include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus， diabetic ketoacidosis， glucocorticoid dependence， blood related malignancies，hematopoietic cell as well as solid transplantations， iron overload，intravenous drug use， immunocompromised status， major trauma such as burn injuries and malnutrition status 通用删除6(英):<u>[8-10]</u>. Mucormycosis can be rapidly progressive and thus it is important to correctly recognize the symptoms and diagnose at early stage to ensure timely medical treatment. In this case report， we will discuss rhinocerebral and pulmonary mucormycosis in a patient with poorly controlled Type II Diabetes.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 60-year old Caucasian male with a past medical history of uncontrolled type II diabetes mellitus， atrial fibrillation presented to the emergency department for a month history of right facial swelling and pain. The patient also endorsed left eye blindness and epistaxis. The patient initially was seen by his primary care physician two-week prior to the admission where he was treated with a two-week course of augment in for acute sinusitis， however， the symptoms had progressively worsened. The pain was mainly located in the bilateral frontal and maxillary sinus regions. Patient denied fever， chills， chest pain， shortness of breath， or palpitation. On examination， vital signs were significant for hypertension with blood pressure of 155/85， otherwise unremarkable. The patient was in acute distress. He had blindness in the left eye with ptosis， and normal vision in the right eye. Pupils were reactive. Eye movements were intact. There was no extraocular motion tenderness. Conjunctivae were normal. Patient had swelling， erythema， and tenderness over the right maxillary sinus region. Examination of the oral cavity showed a 2 cm x1 cm dark black mucosa over the hard palate， posterior to the incisors. A complete blood cell count was within normal limits. The results of basic metabolic panel were significant for glucose of 265 and Hemoglobin Alc of 14. Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the maxillofacial area showed mild soft tissue swelling and subcutaneous删除1换行stranding right facial soft tissues compatible with cellulitis. CT head showed extensive fluid and mucosal thickening seen in the paranasal sinuses. MRI orbits was concerning for mild enhancement of the inferior right orbit and clinoid segment of the left ophthalmic nerve. MRA confirmed no flow signal in left ophthalmic artery， consistent with ophthalmic artery occlusion. CT chest showed lingula nodule and a dense rim with a central ground-glass opacity in the reverse halo sign consistent with pulmonary mucormycosis. Amphotericin B was empirically started for suspected pulmonary and rhinocerebral mucormycosis. Urgent bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery with image guidance， tubectomy， and septectomy followed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery left upper lobectomy were performed. Nasal endoscopy showed diffuse left sided edema with extensive secretions obscuring full visualization and right nasal cavity with necrosis of side wall extending up to middle turbinate. Pathology from sinuses and pulmonary lesion were consistent with mucormycosis. Culture from palata and left sinus sphenoid lesion was positive for Rhizopus， Candida glabrata， Acinetobacter baumannii， and Aspergillus niger. Micafungin was added to amphotericin B for Aspergillus and Candida glabrata. Despite the treatment， patient developed septic shock and acute respiratory failure， and eventually deceased.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】The true incidence of mucormycosis infections is not known as it is not a reportable disease； however，approximately 500 cases occur in the Unites States every year 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. The incidence of mucormycosis has been rising due to increase in the number of patients with immunocompromised status 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>. It is also alarming that in 2021， mucormycosis or“black fungus” infections have been increasingly reportedamongdiabeticandimmunocompromised patients recovering from COVID-19 infections in countries including India， Pakistan and Russia 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Among diabetics， such as our patient， rhinocerebral mucormycosis is the most common form 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. It manifests in a susceptible host when inhaled spores germinate in the nasal sinuses and rapidly multiply as a septate or with few septate hypha leading to invasion of blood vessels， tissue， cartilage and bones and eventually leading its way up to the eye orbits or ethmoid sinuses then to the meninges and brain 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. This can eventually lead to hemorrhage， thrombosis and infarcts as was evident in this patient. In early stage of the disease， physical examination may reveal facial/ocular pain and nasal blockage with or without discharge whereas later manifestations of the disease often include proptosis and necrotic lesions or eschar on the hard palate， nasal mucosa and/or nasal turbinates as well as ophthalmoplegia， vision loss and even hemiparesis if carotid artery or jugular vein is thrombosed 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Differential diagnosis includes periorbital or orbital cellulitis， orbital tumor， cavernous sinus thrombosis， aspergillosis， Anthrax and Wegener granulomatosis. Suspicion of rhinocerebral mucormycosis should initially prompt obtaining biopsy and culture of the necrotic tissue and diagnostic imaging such as CT or MRI imaging with contrast of the paranasal sinuses to evaluate extension into orbit， cavernous sinus and central nervous system 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Tissue biopsy may showhypha with right angle branching， commonlyirregularly shaped near blood vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Cultures may remain negative even with microscopic evidence of the fungus 通用删除6(英):<u>[16，18]</u>.

Pulmonary mucormycosis is more common among neutropenic patients with malignancy undergoing chemotherapy treatmentand patients who underwent Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) and developed graft versus host disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Clinical features of pulmonary mucormycosis are often unclear and similar to that of pulmonary aspergillosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.

Despite initiation of appropriate treatment at the community hospital setting， transfer to higher level of care and multiple surgeries， patient eventually expired. It is thus important to timely diagnose rhinocerebral and pulmonary mucormycosis. Sinusitis symptoms in a poorly controlled diabetic patient should raise strong suspicion for possible mucormycosis and requires thorough history and physical examination and if diagnosed， prompt hospitalization. In conclusion， it is important for health care providers to educate patients about complications of uncontrolled diabetes and optimize diabetes treatment to avoid this devastating disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Mutation in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene is one of the principal mechanisms leading to tumorigenesis of NSCLC and was found in up to 50% of Asian， female patients who never smoked 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. EGFR mutation occurs mainly in exons 18 to 21， especially exon 19 deletion and exon21 L858R covering about 85% of all EGFR mutations and resulting in a generally favorable response to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The remaining 10% to 15% of EGFR mutations are regarded as \"non-classical”or “uncommon”mutations and composed of a heterogeneous group of single or compound gene alterations within exons 18 to 21 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. However， the clinical significance and implications of uncommon mutations in EGFR are still unclear. Approximately 5% to 10% of TKI-treated patients exhibit primary resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Here， we report a case of lung adenocarcinoma in which primary resistance to gefitinib treatment was caused by a novel G735R point mutation of EGFR exon 19.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 74-year-old man was admitted to our hospital in January 2019 due to a chronic cough. Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed a mass in the left upper lobe and enlarged multiple lymph nodes in the ipsilateral mediastinum and hilum . An Endobronchial Ultrasound Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) biopsy from the left principal bronchus was performed. The results of Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining showed adenocarcinoma infiltration in the lung tissue， and poorly differentiated carcinoma was the dominant type. The删除表格换行immunohistochemical markers were as follows： ALK-Lung通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>，CD56通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>， CK (pan) (+)， CK7 (+)， TTF-1 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>， Napsin A (+)， P63 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>， CK5/6通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>， Syn 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>. Thus， the patient was diagnosed of stage IV (T4N3M1b) central lung adenocarcinoma with metastasis to mediastinal lymph node and right adrenal gland. The patients received one cycle of chemotherapy and subsequent standard follow-up. In February 2019， a follow-up thoracic CT performed after one month of chemotherapy， revealed the increase of lung lesions. A biopsy sample was subjected to 13-gene Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. Genomic sequencing showed novel mutation of EGFR p.G735R in exon 19， ERBB2 copy number gain and TP53 p.H179Q mutation . According to the result of EGFR G735R mutation， the oral administration of gefitinib was initiated on February 25h， 2019. Follow-up clinical and imaging examinations at 6 weeks of treatment showed rapid disease progression with enlargement of lung tumor. Then the patient died in one month later， indicating a pattern of primary resistance.\n\n【11】Table 1： Gene mutation lists for the NGS analysis.\n\n| Gene name  | Mutation  | Mutation abundance (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| EGFR  | NM005228 exon19 c.2203G> Cp.G735R  | 17.62  |\n| TP53  | NM000546 exon5 c.537T>Ap.H179Q  | 81.16  |\n| ERBB2  | Copy number gain  | 4.78  |\n\n【13】Discussion\n\nResistance to EGFR-TKIs can be divided into primary or acquired resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.Primary resistance refers to the immediate inefficacy of EGFR-TKI in three months， while acquired resistance is progression of the disease after duration of clinical benefit 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Acquired resistance to TKI in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring sensitive EGFR mutations has been well documented， such as somatic T790M mutation and germline T790M polymorphism， or germline EGFR V843I mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. However，knowledge of primary TKI resistance is limited. In our case， the patient showed rapid resistance to gefitinib. None of the existing mechanisms for primary resistance was found. Instead， NGS revealed a rareprimary EGFR mutation，G735R in exon19 within the pretreatment tumor， implying close correlation with the rapid resistance to gefitinib. EGFR G735R point mutation in exon 19in lung cancer has not been reported in the literature or databases and clinical significance is unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. However， a transition exon 19c.2203G>A，p.G735 Smutation at the same position has been observed通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>. This mutation has been described seven times in lung cancer|删除段之间换行|(COSMIC databank accessed 31.10.2019) with no data on response to EGFR-TKI therapy given in the literature. One research on prostate cancer in vitro revealed that 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>， EGFRG735S may be a pathogenic mutation and is related to the occurrence and development of tumors. Western blot analysis showed that the EGFRG735S mutation enhanced cell growth and invasion via constitutive and hyperactive tyrosine phosphorylation and led to the activation of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK)， Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) and Akt pathways. In addition， a recent study has reported a case carrying G735S mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. The patient with adenocarcinoma stage IV showed progressive disease on 2nd line EGFR-TKI therapy with gefitinib， suggesting that this G735S mutation is associated with resistance toEGFRTKI. The same finding in our case is that the EGFR G735R mutation was primary resistant to gefitinib treatment. To our knowledge， this is the first case to report the efficacy of the first generation TKI in an NSCLC patient harboring this rare mutation. The second-generation irreversible EGFR-TKI， afatinib， exhibits more convincing efficacy against non-classical EGFR mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，16]</u>. In addition to EGFR mutation， the patient in our case also harbored EBRR2 copy number variants and TP53mutation. Genomic data suggest that afatinib combined with ERBB2monoclonal antibody may be effective. Upon a comprehensive literature review， a recent case report from China presented a patient with advanced NSCLC harboring a rare EGFR L747P mutations in exon 19， who failed fist-line gefitinib and the third generation TKI osimertinib but achieved sustained disease control to bevacizumab and erlotinib 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. The possible reason is that the upregulation of the EGFR signaling pathway enhances the production of angiogenic factors， including VEGF， and dual blockade of VEGF and EGFR， resulting in additive anti-tumor activity， and may prove to be an alternative treatment in advanced NSCLC with resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>[18，19]</u>.In our case， the patient died before being treated for gefitinib resistance and the efficacy of subsequent second generation TKI cannot be evaluated. Based on in vitro testing， we wondered whether afatinib or bevacizumab were a clinically beneficial regimen for NSCLC patients with the EGFR G735R mutation， but to date， no case reports have been verified.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】In conclusion， the results of this case suggest that the rare EGFR G735R mutation in exon 19 confers primary resistance to the first generation TKI gefitinib. Because of the rarity of this mutation， the relationship between G735R mutation and gefitinib resistance删除1换行requires further study. Moreover， it is necessary to seek strategies to overcome G735R associated TKI resistance.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Clinical data on the effectiveness of treatment and prognosis of the disease are lacking.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 69-year-old man was admitted to hospital on June 29h， 2021 because of abnormal renal function. The patient underwent routine physical examination 2 weeks before admission and was found to have abnormal renal function with a blood creatinine of 521 mol/L and urine protein 2+， which was re-examined at a local hospital. The patient had no previous history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus but had undergone internal fixation of left clavicle fracture 7 years ago. The family history was not specific either. The patient's physical examination showed the following：blood pressure 140/70 mmHg， clear consciousness， normal development， good nutrition， no cardiopulmonary abnormalities， soft abdomen， no pressure and rebound pain， and normal muscle strength and tone of the extremities.\n\n【7】Laboratory test results\n\n【8】Hematology results： Hemoglobin was 76 g/L. Urinalysis showed urine protein 1+； 24-h urine protein quantification， 1.96 g/day； renal osmolality， 225 mOsm (freezing point method).

Interferon release assay was positive.\n\n【9】Examination results\n\n【10】Ultrasonography was as follows： Right kidney size， 142 mm x79mm x 70 mm； left kidney\n\n【11】There were multiple lymph nodes in the hilar region， retroperitoneum， and bilateral groin. Cystic foci were found in the liver， complex cysts in both kidneys， and enlarged prostate with calcification were observed. Chest findings showed limited emphysema in the right lung， bronchial dilatation in the lower lobe of the right lung， and focal fibrous sclerosis in both lungs. Enlarged cardiac shadow with pericardial effusion was noted. Calcification of aorta and coronary arteries were also observed. Multiple old rib fractures on both sides， as seen after internal fixation of the left clavicle were noted. Both axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes showed cystic foci in the right lobe of the liver， and large complex cysts in the right kidney. Positron emission tomography-CT results were：通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> both kidneys were enlarged with uneven density and diffusely increasedFluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) metabolism， considering possible inflammation of both kidneys and lymphoma to be excluded.通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Increased FDG metabolism of prostate lamina， considering inflammation of prostate was observed. 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Large 2.3 cm diameter lymph nodes in bilateral submandibular， axillary， hilar， mediastinal， retroperitoneal， pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes with increased FDG删除2换行metabolism， considering the possibility of inflammatory hyperplastic lymph nodes were found. 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Right middle lobe soft tissue shadow with increased FDG metabolism， considering right middle lobe inflammation； right upper lung alveoli， both middle and lower lungs， and chronic interstitial inflammation under the pleura were noted.通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> A small cyst in the right posterior lobe of the liver was noted.通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> Cervical and lumbar vertebral marginal osteophytes were seen after left internal clavicle fixation.\n\n【12】Renal pathology light microscopy results were as follows：The glomerular lesion was mild， the interstitium was infiltrated by diffuse single nucleated cells and multifocal plasma cells， and matted fibrosis was seen， accounting for 70% of the total area. The walls of small renal vessels were thickened with hyaline degeneration. Immunohistochemistry showed IgG4-positive plasma cells >10/field at high magnification， and immunofluorescence staining for C3c (+).\n\n【13】The treatment regimen was 24 mg methylprednisolone tablets given orally， and the dose was gradually reduced after 4 weeks. At the same time， isoniazid at 0.3g qd and rifampicin 0.6g qd were given for anti-TB treatment， and supportive treatment such as stomach protection and calcium supplementation were given.\n\n【14】Follow-up of clinical indicators\n\n【15】At present， we have followed the patient for nearly 6 months，and all the indicators have improved. The 24h urine protein quantification has decreased significantly， while plasma albumin has increased to normal levels. After treatment， renal function recovered well， and blood creatinine decreased from the highest value of 627 mol/L to 179 mol/L. The hemoglobin level also increased significantly，删除1换行blood creatininelevel gradually decreased， and the long axis of the enlarged kidney was significantly reduced. Hemaglabin increased significantly， plasma glabulin decreased， and blood IgG and IgG4 both decreased significantly).删除2换行globulin level decreased significantly， and IgG and IgG4 decreased significantly. Repeat ultrasound showed that the enlarged kidney had recovered .\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】In 2003， Kamisawa et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> first introduced the concept of IgG4systemic disease and suggested that it was closely associated with IgG4-positive plasma cells. In 2010， Takahashi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> officially named suchlesions as IgG4-associated diseases. It is now considered that the diseases are immune-mediated fibroinflammatory diseases that can accumulate in multiple organs 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-9]</u>. The common types of presentation are： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> type 1 (IgG4-associated) Autoimmune Pancreatitis (AIP)； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> IgG4-associated sclerosing cholangitis， which usually occurs in conjunction with type 1 AIP； 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> massive salivary gland enlargement or sclerosing salpingitis， accompanied by lacrimal gland， parotid gland and submandibular gland enlargement； 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>\n\n【18】IgG4-associated Mikulicz orbital disease， often with protrusion of the eyeball； and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> retroperitoneal fibrosis， often with chronic periaortitis， usually involving the ureters， leading to hydronephrosis and renal injury.\n\n【19】The affected organs share a number of key pathological features anddprominent clinical and serological similarities， including swelling of the affected organs， massive infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells， and characteristic matted fibrotic changes of varying degrees on histological examination 通用删除6(英):<u>[10-12]</u>.\n\n【20】The exact prevalence of IgG4-related diseases is currently unknown. This may be related to the late recognition of the diseases by the medical community. The first international expert consensus on the treatment of the diseases was not available until 2015. The disease was first proposed by Japanese experts， so it is more studied in Japan than in other countries. However， the current epidemiological删除1换行research data are mainly from the Japanese AIP data. A 2012 study In Japan showed that about 8，000 people suffered from this disease， which is about 6.27 per 100，000 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Currently， no exact data are available for China. Small clinical samples have been reported subsequently. Raissian et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> studied 35 patients with this disease， with a mean renal creatinine of 309.4 umol/L before treatment and a mean reduction to 150.3 umol/L after 6 months of drug treatment， giving a total effective rate of 90.5%. Nineteen of these 35 patients were treated with glucocorticoids and 17 showed effectiveness， but two of them relapsed during hormone reduction. Kawano et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> reported that 38 of 41 patients were treated with hormones， 35 of whom showed effective results， while only three had insignificant results and continued progression of renal function. Of these three cases， one patient reached end-stage renal disease and required long-term maintenance hemodialysis， and the other two showed persistent elevation of blood creatinine. In a study by Saeki et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>， 19 of 23patients were treated with prednisone at doses ranging from 10 mg/day to 60 mg/day， and 18 of them showed significant improvement in renal function， complement levels， and imaging abnormalities after4 weeks of dosing. All these studies suggest that early diagnosis and treatment with glucocorticoids are effective， but there is a possibility of recurrence during the process of hormone reduction.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Japanese Society of Nephrology IgG4-RKD diagnostic criteria and the 2019 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for IgG4-related disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>， the features of the present patient's medical history include the following： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Significantly elevated serum IgG4levels； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> renal damage with urinary protein and decreased renal function； 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> renal CT showing bilateral renal enlargement and hypertrophic soft tissue shadow of both renal pelvises； and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> renal biopsy histological changes-interstitial nephritis changes， such as high infiltration of lymphoplasmacytes， IgG4-positive plasma cells>10/field of view at high magnification， and fibrotic changes|删除段之间换行|Therefore， the diagnosis of IgG4-associated nephropathy in our patient was clear. The patient was given 24 mg methylprednisolone orally according to the treatment guidelines. Because the patient had two positive T-SPOT tests with high titers， and although the patient had no TB-related symptoms and no significant abnormalities were seen on chest CT， the possibility of latent TB infection could not be ruled-out， so we also gave him anti-TB treatment. The patient was given isoniazid 0.3 gqd， rifampicin 0.6 gqd [The dosage units are missing.] and received symptomatic supportive treatment. After discharge， the patient was followed up in the outpatient clinic. After treatment， the patient showed a significant reduction in urinary protein， a significant decrease in serum creatinine level， improvement in anemia， and a significant increase in hemoglobin. Immunological indexes such as IgG and IgG4 were significantly decreased， and ultrasound showed that the enlarged kidney was significantly improved. The glucocorticoid dose is being gradually reduced and the chest CT did not show any TB-related infection. The patient is still being followed up 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u>.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】In conclusion， IgG4-related diseases have progressive fibrotic lesions that involve multiple organs and tissues throughout the body. Early diagnosis and treatment are important for prognosis. Early application of glucocorticoid therapy can significantly improve the condition of IgG4-related disease， improve the quality of life of删除1换行patients and delay their progression to end-stage renal failure.

The presentation can be insidious， which often undermines and delays the correct diagnosis.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\nA 21-year-old woman， with no relevant previous medical history， reported loss of strength and sensation in the lower limbs that slowly progressed to the upper extremities over a period of 2 years. The patient also reported neuropathic pain in the cervical region， anorexia， asthenia and a vespertine fever. She had been living in Guinea-Bissau and was sent to Portugal to seek further medical care. There， she presented to the emergency department and was subsequently admitted for further investigation. The neurological examination revealed a spastic paraplegia， with only mild decrease in muscular strength in the upper extremities (4/5) and loss of pain and light-touch sensation as well as deep sensation in the lower limbs. Deep anal pressure and voluntary anal contraction were preserved. Increased stretch reflexes in the lower extremities and a positive bilateral Babinsky sign were present.

In the dorso-lumbar region， a severe deformity of the body of D7 was apparent. In addition， a pre- and paravertebral abscess between D6-D8 was found， extending to the anterior epidural space and into the left intra-thoracic region . Bone scintigraphy was suggestive of multifocal spondylodiscitis at the dorso-lumbar region as well as osteoblastic activity in the 84left costal arch and right iliac bone.\n\n【12】Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) analysis showed an elevated protein level (185 mg/dL)， with normal white blood cell count (>1 cell/uL) and glucose level. CSF smear looking for acid-fast bacilli and culture was negative.\n\n【13】Biopsies of the cervical lymph node， retropharyngeal and intra-thoracic abscesses were performed. Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative in all， but Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-\n\n【14】The patient was thus started on isoniazid (300 mg)， rifampin (600mg)， pyrazinamide (1500 mg) and ethambutol (1200 mg) (HRZE).

Finally， after 3 months of therapy with HRZE and 8 weeks ofprednisone (2 weeks full dose with tapering over a period of 6 weeks) the patient began to recover. Control MRI at 4 and 8 weeks revealed a significant reduction in size of the large abscesses in the dorso-lumbar region and an improvement in cord compression at C4-C5. In view of the considerable outspread of the infection，treatment with isoniazid and rifampin was extended for 12months.\n\n【16】Around this time， the patient continued her rehabilitation program in a Rehabilitation Center.

Neurologic abnormalities appear in 10%to 27% of cases and are associated with the level of spinal injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Injury to the thoracic spine is the most common， followed by lumbar and， less frequently， the cervical spine. Multisegmental spondylitis occurs in 50% of the patients. Progressive bone destruction leads to fractures and deformity of the spine. Abscesses in the spinal canal can lead to compression of the spinal cord or reach soft tissue structures， like the psoas muscle.\n\n【19】In our case， there was extensive involvement， which included the lungs， the lymphatic system， multiple segments of the spinal column and other bones (costal grid and right iliac bone). That type of extension is unusual for a non-immunocompromised patient and is probably best explained by the long time period over which the disease was allowed to progress (2 years).\n\n【20】Patients with bone TB should be treated with combination chemotherapy for 6 months， during which isoniazid and rifampin should always be administered. During the first 2 months， additional first line drugs should be given (pyrazinamide， ethambutol and streptomycin) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3]</u>. Currently， there is no evidence that longer treatmentregimens result in added benefits and therapy for 12 months is only recommended for meningeal TB. However， the studies on which the guidelines are based did not include patients with multiple vertebral involvement， cervical lesions or major neurologic deficits. Faced with these limitations， some experts recommend therapy for9 to 12 months in selected cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. With that in mind and given the extensive neurological compromise in our case， it was decided to prolong treatment for 12 months， even though there was no evidence of meningeal involvement.\n\n【21】Adjunct corticotherapy in TB remains a point of debate in the scientific community. On the one hand， it inhibits the inflammatory process and reduces its side effects， but on the other it can hinder an appropriate immune response， promoting bacillary proliferation， delaying the resolution of the infectious process or increasing the susceptibility to other unwanted infections 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. There is also concern about its potential to interact with other anti-tuberculous agents and interfere with its tissue distribution， possibly reducing its effects 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【22】Corticotherapy should be initiated concurrently with anti-tuberculous agents and continued for 6 to 8 weeks. At the moment， it's only recommended in meningeal TB， but could also be considered when there is pericardial involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>. In pulmonary and pleural TB， its use was associated with an earlier symptomatic improvement but showed no additional benefit in the long term通用删除6(英):<u>[7-9]</u>. There are currently no recommendations for its use in bone tuberculosis because there aren’t enough studies from which to draw conclusions from. According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Guidelines， spinal TB with associated meningitis should be treated with adjunct corticotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Even though our patient didn't present with signs of meningitis， by again taking into account the evidence of cord compression and serious neurologic compromise， corticotherapy was instituted for 8 weeks.\n\n【23】Surgery in these cases is also controversial. A Cochrane systematic revision comparing surgical intervention alongside treatment with anti-tuberculous agents and an exclusive conservative approach found no significant statistical difference in respect to degree of kyphosis， neurologic deficits， vertebral fusion or mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>. The commonly held opinion amongst experts is that surgery should be considered in the following situations： absence of response to conservative treatment with persistence or exacerbation of the infection， no improvement or recurrence of neurologic abnormalities and spinal instability 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.Other situations where it could be considered are drainage of abscesses that might compromise oropharyngeal and respiratory function or paravertebral abscesses which have not responded to a 3 to 6 months course of therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】Even patients with severe spinal TB may achieve a good clinical and functional outcome. In our case， given the severe neurological compromise， not only was combination chemotherapy extended for a longer period of time， but adjunct corticotherapy was also administered (both decisions stepping outside currently available guidelines). It is impossible to know for sure to what extent these decisions influenced the observed outcome， but it is fair to say that further studies should be held to better understand the role of such therapies in severe T'B with spinal or bone involvement.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In addition to this， the objective was to assess their simplicity， time consumption， ease of clinical application and suitability for clinical trial and/or epidemiological purpose.\n\n【3】Materials and Methods： Two examiners examined 50 randomly selected patients， to evaluate six different calculus indices， viz. Oral hygiene index， Sign grading system， periodontal disease index， Calculus surface severity index， Volpe-Manhold index and Marginal line calculus index. Few patients were reassessed by the same examiner to detect the reproducibility. Raw data thus obtained was filtered，tabulated and subjected to statistical calculations.\n\n【4】Conclusion： There was no single index which completely fulfils all the ideal requisites to the score10 on a VAS scale. However， within the limits the study it could be said that Sign Grading System has combined advantages of OHI andPDI and can be included in other basic and/or clinical studies.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】An index has been defined as \"a numerical value describing the relative status of a population on a graduated scale with definite upper and lower limits， which is designed to permit and facilitate comparison with other populations classified by the same criteria and methods\". Significance of an index is well-known to the scientific community. However the choice of a best index among multiple similar indices is a challenge. Considering the differences in scoring criteria， number of teeth examined， clinical applications， etc. The need to compare different calculus indices on similar set of teeth was desirable.\n\n【7】Some of the indices proposed earlier are still useful because their use enables a comparison to be made with epidemiological findings of an earlier period 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-6]</u>. However， most of the earlier known indices do not fulfill the ideal requirements of an index， which should be simple， reproducible， sensitive， acceptable，economical and amenable to statistical evaluation， as proposed by Davies et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【8】Majority of indices 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-4]</u> for assessment of calculus considered only 4 to 6 mandibular anterior teeth. In this area， there are highest chances of calculus formation. Even a person having good manual dexterity would have difficulty in cleaning the lingual surface of the mandibular anterior region. Then， assessing the overall oral hygiene based on examination of mandibular anterior teeth only would give false positive results. Secondly， for calculus surface severity index， detection of 0.5mm to 1 mm difference is clinically difficult. Calculus surface index 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> has scores 0 and 1； thus， this index is not sensitive enough to explain small changes between sites/patients.\n\n【9】Significance of indices\n\n【10】For individual patients an index can provide individual assessment to help a patient recognize an oral problem. Reveal the degree of effectiveness of present oral hygiene practices. Motivate删除1换行the person in preventive and professional care for the elimination and control of oral disease. Evaluate the success of treatment by comparing index scores 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【11】In research an index is used to determine baseline data before experimental factor are introduced. Measure the effectiveness of specific agents for the prevention， control or treatment of oral conditions. Measure the effectiveness of mechanical devices for personal care， such as toothbrush， interdental devices， or water irrigators. In epidemiologic purpose show the prevalence and trends of incidence of a particular condition occurring within the given population. Compare the effects of a community program and evaluate the results.\n\n【12】The aim ofthis study was to compare 6 different calculus in dices to assess their inter- and intra-examiner reliability and reproducibility. In addition to this， the objectives were to assess their simplicity in understanding scoring criteria， flexibility of an index to fit different clinical situations， time required， ease of clinicalapplication， suitability for clinical trial or epidemiological purpose， acceptability by the patient.\n\n【13】Materialand Methods\n\n【14】It is a randomized cross-sectional clinical study. The study population (N=30) was randomly selected from the Department of Periodontology， MGV’s KBH Dental College and Hospital， Nashik. Approval from Research and Ethics Committee of the institution was obtained before the start of the study. Informed consent was obtained from all the study participants before their enrolment in the research.\n\n【15】Patients having at least 6 mandibular anterior teeth and presence of supra/subgingival calculus and those patients who were ready to spare some time for the study and come for a recall in case a repeat examination is planned was including the study.\n\n【16】Indices used for study\n\n11 Oral Hygiene Index (OHI) (JC Green， j vermillion 1960)通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>|删除段之间换行|2) Sign Grading System (SGS) (Agrawal AA 2011) 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>|删除段之间换行|31 Periodontal Disease Index (PDI) (Ramford 1959)通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>|删除段之间换行|4) Calculus Surface Severity Index (CSSI) (Ennever， Sturzenberger， Radike Aw 1961)通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>|删除段之间换行|51 Marginal line calculus index (MLCI)(Muhlemann HR， Villa P1967)通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>|删除段之间换行|6) Volpman， Manhold index (VMI)(Volpe AR， Manhold JH 1962)通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>\n\n【18】Method\n\n【19】To assess the reliability of the index， each investigator examined a total of 30 patients and scored for all calculus indices individually. Every investigator re-examined randomly selected 10 patients out of 30 (33.33%) to assess the reproducibility of the index. There was at least 30 min gap between two examinations on a particular patient by the same investigator to reduce/eliminate the memory effect. Participants were preferably re-examined on the same day to eliminate Hawthorne effect 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>， as they would tend to clean their teeth knowing that a dentist would examine them. Checking the patients on the same dav also eliminated the attrition/mortality effect on the results.\n\n【20】In 10 randomly selected patients， time was measured (rounded删除1换行up to seconds) to evaluate time required for each index for grading the particular segment. For 5 patient， time was measure sequentially from (1 to 6) 1\" index (OHI) to last index (VMI). While for another5 patient time measured in reverse order from 通用删除7(英):<u>(6-1)</u> last index (VMI) to 15 index (OHI). Time was measured for all 10 patients， for each examiner.\n\n【21】Grading of indices\n\n【22】CSSI， MLCI， VMI these indices are originally designed for2 sessment of only mandibular anterior， so to reduce the bias related to time required to assess a particular segment， only mandibular anteriors were decided to be scored for all the 6 indices. Scoring requires adequate light， mouth mirror， explorer， UNC 15 probe， and three-way syringes for marginal line calculus index， and Volpe Manhold index.\n\n【23】Statistical Analysis\n\n【24】Intra-examiner reproducibility and inter-examiner reliability was assessedbychisquaretest. Simplicityand ease of clinical application of an index are subjective criteria， and were evaluated by each examiner on VAS scored from 1 to 10. Time： Average time for each index in 9patients was assessed up to closest second. Flexibility， quantifiability and suitability based on the design of index， was evaluated by mutual discussion between examiners. Acceptability based on judging patient comfort level.\n\n【25】Results\n\n【26】Reproducibility\n\n【27】Rechecked of the patient： Examiner 1： Examiner no. 1 when recorded SGS index twice， scored it as 1.55 and 1.62 suggesting the index is reproducible. Similar results were found for OHI and PDI index. But the scores were significantly different for CSSI， MLCI， VMI (p<0.05). Suggesting the index is not reproducible .\n\n【28】Rechecked of the patient： Examiner 2： Examiner no. 2 when recorded SGS index twice scored it as 2.12 and 2 (chi square p>0.05) suggesting the difference in scores is statistically non-significant and that the index is reproducible. Similar results were found for OHI and PDI index. But the difference in scores were statistically significant for CSSI， MLCI， VMI (p<0.05).

Similar results were found for OHI and PDI index， But the scores were significant for CSSI， MLCI， VMI (p<0.05) Suggesting the index is not reliable .\n\n【37】Simplicity in understanding the scores： According to Visual Analytic Scale (VAS)， Oral hygiene index is the simplest index and sign grading system was second simplest index. While Calculus surface severity index was the most difficult index to measure .\n\n【38】Ease of applying the score in clinical scenario： According to\n\n【39】Visual Analytic Scale (VAS)， Oral hygiene index is the easiest index and sign grading system was second easiest index. While Calculus surface severity index was the most difficult index to measure .\n\n【40】Timeconsumption： Examiner no.1 and 2 recorded time required for all six indices. For OHI index examiners took 9.77 ±2 sec and 10.2±2.7 sec respectively； for SGS index 37.77 sec ± 9.98 and 20.7 sec ±6.89， for PDI 44.22 sec ± 13.8 and 28 sec ±10， for MLCI 71.77 sec ±2.33 and 59.1 sec， time required for CSSI 74.44 sec ± 13.91 and 64±14.38， for VMI 81 ±43.93 and 65.4 sec±29.12. These values suggest that OHI requires less time than any other index .\n\n【41】Flexibility： Is the ability of the specific criteria specified in an index to meet different clinical situations， such as erupting teeth， presence of orthodontic brackets， fractured tooth etc. Depending of the criteria specified (rules)， all indices can be scored on VAS， according to visual analytic scale， and Sign grading system was the most flexible index. Oral hygiene index was the second most flexible index after Sign grading system. Calculus surface severity index and Marginal line calculus index was non flexible indices .\n\n【42】Suitability： Based on information in their original articles， design of the scoring criteria and time required to assess a particular segment.SGS，OHI， PDI can use for Clinical trials & epidemiological or research purpose while CSSI， MLCI， VMI only useful for clinical trials as they are time consuming too.\n\n【43】Quantifiability and Acceptability： The all indices are amenable to statistical analysis and were well accepted by patients.\n\n【44】Discussion\n\n【45】Dental indices or index can be considered as the main tool of epidemiological studies in the dental diseases to find out the incidence， prevalence and severity of the diseases， based on which preventive programs are adopted for their control and prevention. Epidemiological indices are attempts to quantify clinical conditions on a graduated scale， thereby facilitating comparison among populations examined by the same criteria and methods 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【46】The purpose of this study was to assess ideal requisites of the six different calculus indices. Testing the intra or inter-examiner reproducibility and reliability of calculus indices is important as they reflect the reliability of such indices when used in clinical trials and in research purpose. Any classification system or grading system is introduced so that the information can be recorded easily and accurately and can be communicated effectively among professionals around the world. In this study six different calculus indices were删除表格换行compared on the basis of clarity， objectivity， sensitivity， acceptability and suitability， reproducibility and reliability.\n\n【47】Table 5： Quantifiability & acceptability.\n\n| VAS  |  | VAS  | VAS  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Simplicity  | Ease of application  | Time  | Flexibility  | Quantifiability & Acceptability  | Reliability  | Reproducibility  |\n| OHI  | 10  | 10  | 9.9 sec  | 4  | √  | >0.05  | >0.05  |\n| SGS  | 8  | 8  | 29.2 Sec  | 5  | √  | >0.05  | >0.05  |\n| PDOI  | 9  |  | 36.1 sec  | 2  | √  | >0.05  | >0.05  |\n\n【49】So on the basis of statistical analysis oral hygiene index， sign grading system and periodontal disease index fulfill all ideal requisites simplicity， flexibility， ease of application on the basis of VAS scale， suitability as this three index are able to use clinical or epidemiologic or research purpose. The scoring criteria were not time consuming as it required approximately 9 sec to 10 sec for assessing oral hygiene index， 20.7 sec for sign grading system， 28 sec for periodontal index. While other three indices are time consuming as they required more than a minute to score. All six indices OHI， SGS， PDI， CSSI， MLCI， and VMI were accepted by patients； also all indices are amenable to statistical analysis. To judge the reliability of the index， all three investigators examined 30 patients and 10% of patients were reassessed to evaluate the reproducibility. All necessary measures were taken to reduce or eliminate the bias and confounding variables which could have affected the outcome of this study.\n\n【50】Strong agreement between raters is considered a necessary prerequisite for the effectiveness ofany subjective procedure intended for diagnostic or classification purposes. Yet， it is well acknowledged that wide variability between raters is commonly observed. To date， methods for modeling agreement data are categorized as summary statistics and model-based approaches. In particular， Chi square test is very popular among biomedical professionals due to its appealingly simple calculation and interpretation. Typically， it is used in assessing the degree to which two or more raters， examining the same data， agree when it comes to assigning the data to categories\n\n【51】Conclusion\n\n【52】Although OHI is simpler and faster to assess， but SGS is more specific in analyzing each tooth and can be applicable in clinical trials also. Similarly， although PDI scores are simpler to understand， but SGS scoring criteria are more flexible， requires less time and has better clinical application.\n\n【53】To conclude， there was no single index which completely fulfills all the ideal requisites to the score 10 on a VAS scale. However， within删除1换行the limits the study it could be said that Sign Grading System has combined advantages of OHI and PDI and can be included in other basic and/or clinical studies.\n\n【54】Limitations\n\n【55】1.

Detection of the mechanism of restenosis by Intracoronary Imaging Techniques(IVUS/OCT) is essential in order to choose the appropriate treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Restenosis due to stent under expansion in a calcified lesion is hard to treat because calcium deposits do not allow stent expansion. It isimportanttotry all the available techniques in order to achieve the best possible lesion preparation before in stent drug eluting balloon angioplasty or new drug eluting stent implantation. In cases of In Stent Restenosis (ISR) if high pressure non-compliant balloon， scoring and cutting balloon fail to achieve adequate stent expansion， excimer laser coronary angioplasty with contrast injection and Rotational Atherectomy (RA) are the two treatment options that could theoretically lead to fragmentation of calcified tissue surrounding the stent and final good stent expansion 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. However， excimer laser is not widely used and there are some concerns regarding the risk of no reflow，burr entrapment or coronary perforation with RA. While there are series where RA was used for “undilatable” ISR due to under expanded stents in calcified lesions with favorable procedural outcome， there is also data who demonstrated a high rate of target lesion revascularization within one year 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>.RA is less effective in deep and concentric calcium deposits. In contrast with RA，IVL balloon is a new device that breaks both superficial and deep calcium deposits with minimal vessel injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. We describe a case of using IVL balloon in a patient which enabled us to achieve final optimal stent expansion after failure of current techniques.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 71-year-old man with a history of ischemic heart disease， hypertension， dyslipidemia， permanent atrial fibrillation and chronic renal disease (eGFR： 30 ml/min) admitted to our hospital because of decompensated heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. His ischemic heart disease included previous Myocardial Infarction (MI) 23 years ago with failed thrombolysis， treated with Bare Metal Stent (BMS) implantation in proximal LAD four days post MI and complementary stenting of middle RCA and distal circumflex few days later. Three months post angioplasty； he presented an ISR at the edge of the previously implanted stent in the RCA that was treated with a new BMS implantation. During the following years he underwent two Coronary Angiograms (CA) the last one in 2003， showing neointimal hyperplasia in LAD and RCA without significant ISR.\n\n【4】During his current hospitalization， he underwent a Coronary Angiogram (CA)， which revealed critical left main coronary artery stenosis， critical LAD and RCA in-stent restenosis (in the site of two layers of stent). We performed a PCI with Drug Eluting Balloon (DEB) in LAD restenosis and stent (DES) implantation in left main. Multiple high-pressure inflations with noncompliant balloons， scoring balloon and ultra-high-pressure balloon at 35 atm failed to dilate the RCA lesion. We decided to evaluate the lesion with OCT.\n\n【5】OCT imaging (OPTIS\" Integrated Imaging System， Abbott) revealed severe ISR in the two layers of struts due to under expansion of the last stent implanted secondary to circumferential calcification and an estimated minimal lumen area at 1.3 mm . Considering the reduced efficiency of RA in deep and concentric calcium deposits as well as the risk of peri-procedural complications， we decided to use shockwave balloon.\n\n【6】In detail， AL 0.75 6Fr Launcher (Medronic) guiding catheter was advanced to RCA and a 0.014 BMW J (Abbott) was passed through the lesion. A 3.0 mm×12 mm IVL balloon was placed at the level of the lesion and was inflated at 4 atm . We applied eight cycles of ultrasound energy， lasting10 sec each one.\n\n【7】Once finished the IVL balloon dilatation， the angiographic result was optimal and OCT showed optimal expansion of stent with MLA删除2换行more than 6 mm. There was no procedural complication such as perforation， edge dissection， slow or no reflow. We completed our angioplasty with a paclitaxel coated balloon SeQuent Please NEO (B. Braun Melsungen AG) 3.5 mm x10 mm， inflated at 12 atm for 90 sec. At 9-month follow-up， the patient was free of symptoms.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】IVL is a new， safe and effective method to treat severely删除1换行calcified coronary lesions， as demonstrated in the multinational trial Distrupt CAD III 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. It is effective with high success rate and low risk of procedural complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. IVL delivers ultrasonic waves to modify calcium， improve plaque compliance and facilitates angioplasty. In contrast to other techniques to disrupt calcium，IVL therapy provokes minimal vessel injury and it is less likely to result in distal embolization because the calcium fragments remain in situ 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In 2021， FDA approved the use of IVL for the angioplasty of severely calcified， stenotic arteries when used prior to stenting. In literature there are reports that suggest the use of IVL as a therapeutic option for the treatment of under-expanded stents 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>.\n\n【10】Tn011rpatient， multiple high-pressure inflations with noncompliant balloons， scoring balloon and ultra-high-pressure balloon at 35 atm failed to dilate the lesion. Rotational atherectomy could be an effective treatment， presenting the peri-procedural risk of no reflow， burr entrapment， coronary perforation. We chose to try IVL and it was able to disrupt calcium depots beyond stent struts and obtain complete stent expansion. Similarly， IVL was reported to successfully treat a severe calcific stenosis due to two lavers of under-expanded stents treated after failure of only one noncompliant balloon inflated at 20 atm. IVL could be a useful tool for angioplasty of under expanded stent even in lesions with two-layers of stent struts通用删除6(英):<u>9]</u>.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】We present a case of IVL balloon treatment of ISR due to stent under expansion at the site of two-lavers of stent struts secondary to heavy circumferential calcification treated with IVL balloon， after failure of multiple high-pressure inflations with noncompliant balloons， scoring balloon and ultra-high-pressure balloon. OCT allowed us to determine calcium distribution， localization and thickness in order to choose the appropriate therapy.

The solid nodule (SUVmax3.6)， group 4 and 11R lymph nodes (SUVmax 5.1)，liver and multiply bone lesion with increased radioactivity (SUVmax 8.0) was significant obvious shown on the PET-CT . CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy for three lesions (solid nodule， pGGN and intrahepatic nodule) was performed on March 24h， 2019 . The results of histopathological were that no malignant cell was seen in pGGN on the left upper lung， malignant cell was seen both in solid nodule and liver lesion with CK(+)， CK19(+)， Ki-67 20%(+)， CK7(+)， CK8(+)， CK18(+) . Molecular genetics detection result of solid nodule was KRAS， p.Gly12Val， abundance 9.57%； IDH1， p.Arg132Leu abundance 8.38%； SMARCA4， p.Gly11Val， abundance 3.56%； STK11， p.Asp194Tyr，7.78%； TMB 20.6； MSS； and the result of liver lesion was KRAS， p.Gly12Val， abundance 16.54%； IDH1， p.Arg132Leu abundance 17.80%； SMARTA4， p.Gly1128 abundance 26.29%； MDM4 copy numberamplification；TMB 17.5； MSS. In summary， he was diagnosed as right lung adenocarcinoma with metastases of hilar and mediastina lymph nodes， bilateral lungs， liver and multiple bones， IV stage， EGFR/ALK通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>， STK11(+)， MDM4(+). After the first-time chemotherapy with pemetrexed and Nedaplat， he refused to therapy again due to serious gastrointestinal reactions. Anlotinib was prescribed only for one week due to intolerance. Finally， he did not underwent any more treatment and eventually died of respiratory failure on July 21 ，2019.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】According to the Fleischner Society 2017 guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>， mGGN ≥ 6 mm will be reexamined 3\n\n【6】to 6 months after the first CT scan. If stable， repeated CT should be done annually for at least 5 years. This patient didn’t do any following up CT scans until symptoms appeared. But in another aspect， it is known that persistent GGN exhibit very indolent growth features通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Based on the reports， for 16 AIS， the median VDT was 1240.3days； for 3 MIAs， the median VDT was 1328.3 days； and for seven删除1换行invasive adenocarcinomas， the median VDT was 941.5 days 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>. But the mGGN in this patient enlarged， became solid， progressed to advanced lung cancer less and to die only in 39 months. It’s belongs to uncommonly rapidly progression. Why does his pGGN develop relatively quickly? Is it related to driver genes negative， intolerant to chemotherapy and the expression of immunotherapy super\n\n【7】Conclusion\n\n【8】According to the management guideline of Ground Glass Nodule(GGN)， regularly repeated CT scan is extremely important to achieve early detection， diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Endoscopic biopsies of the gastric lesion revealed glandular foveolar hyperplasia and ulceration， with focal severe cytological atypical in sparse glands. Total gastrectomy showed the presence of a polyp histologically characterized by hyperplastic glands and the presence of signet-ring cell carcinoma within the stroma. Cancer was limited to the polyp lesion. Extensive sampling of other regions of the stomach was negative for neoplasia. From a review of the literature， only 4 cases of signet ring carcinoma within a gastric hyperplastic polyp were reported. Our case points the focus on the relevance of extensive endoscopic sampling of hyperplastic polyps in order to rule out underlying neoplasia\n\n【2】Keywords： Gastric polyps； Gastric carcinoma\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Gastric polyps account for 2% to 3% of gastric examinations， usually as incidental findings通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Hyperplastic polyps typically arise in stomach in a background of chronic gastritis and are the second most common gastric polyps通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Large polyps can have superficial ulceration orhemorrhage. Hyperplastic polyps usually develop within the body or antrum. It is believed that they represent an exuberant regenerative response of the gastric foveolar cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Hyperplastic polyps rarely progress to gastric carcinomas； malignant transformation however， although rare is well documented 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A75-year-oldwoman with a recent cardiac ischemia was admittedinourhospital for a cardiologic check-up； clinical and laboratory examination detected a severe normocytic normochromic anemia(Hb 5.6g/dl). The patient reported recent hematochezia. A colonoscopy and an upper endoscopy were performed， the latter showing a bleeding protruding lesion in the gastric fundus， measuring about 2.5 cm in diameter. Thelesion appeared soft， partly ulcerated with fibrin deposition consistent with bleeding . Biopsies of the lesion were submitted to the department of pathology for histologic evaluation. Colonoscopy didn’t show relevant alterations.\n\n【7】Histological examination of the gastric biopsies showed hyperplastic polyp mucosae with heavy inflammatory infiltrate. Foveolar hyperplastic pits showed isolated foci of high grade epithelial dysplasia characterized by globet cells with depolarized and hyperchromatic nuclei within the basal membrane.\n\n【8】Although there was no evidence of infiltrative cancer， considering the severe anemia， the hemodynamic instability， the endoscopic appearance and size of the lesion， the patient was submitted， prior informed consent， to total gastrectomy. Before the gastrectomy procedure， the patient was submitted to CT scan resulted negative for other pathologies or distant metastasis. After surgical procedure the patient was discharged on the 10h post-operative day in good general clinical condition.\n\n【9】Definitive histology was performed on the surgical specimen. The stomach showed a 2.5 cm in diameter reddish protruding lesion in the fundus， at 1 cm from the proximal resection margin. The lesion was totally sampled according to the Japanese rules for gastric cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> embedded in paraffin. 3 um thick sections were cut for standard histology and immunohistochemical studies.\n\nHistologically， the polypoid lesion was characterized by a proliferation of the surface foveolar|删除段之间换行|cells lining exaggerated，elongated， and distorted pits that extend from the surface deep into the lamina propria with mucosal expansion. The glands developed extensive infoldings， branching in bizarre ways producing either a serrated appearance or dilated cysts，occasionally quite prominent. Smooth muscle fibers arborized in the lamina propria. Mucosa appeared edematous， infiltrated by single atypical discohesive epithelial elements， and characterized irregular and pleomorphic nuclei， eccentrically placed， with evident nucleolus， and ample eosinophilic cytoplasm and sporadically with classical signet-ring morphology. Plasma cells，lymphocytes and eosinophils were also present . Neutrophils were especially prominent in surface ulcerated areas； vascular proliferations resembling granulation tissue developed superficially near areas of inflammation. Within the foveolar hyperplastic lining there were areas of dysplastic changes as seen in the bioptic samples， with low and high grade intraepithelial neoplasia with features of signet ring cell .\n\n【11】Immunohistochemistry was performed by the streptavidinbiotin method. The antibodies used were mouse monoclonal antibodies against Pan-cytokeratins (clone MNF116) and CD68 (clone PG-M1) all from Dakocytomation， Denmark. Sections were treated with LSAB2 (Dakocytomation) and reaction product was revealed by3-3-Diaminobenzidine (DAB). Sections were counterstained with haematoxylinDiscohesive atypicalepithelial elements resulted positive for Pan-CK and negative for CD68 at the immunohistochemical删除1换行analys .\n\n【12】Diagnosis of gastric carcinoma， poorly cohesive type， arising in hyperplastic polyp was made. Extensive sampling of other regions of the stomach showed atrophic， follicular， active and micro-erosive chronic gastritis of severe grade， associated to extensive type I and II intestinal metaplasia.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Hyperplasticpolyps are a quite common form of gastricpolyps通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. They develop around gastric remnants， ulcers， or gastroenterostomy stomas. It is believed that they represent an exuberant regenerative response of the gastric foveolar cells. Rare polyps are large and simulate carcinoma. Most hyperplastic polyps arise on a background of chronic gastritis. Atypia is either absent or minimal and if present is of regenerative in nature. Neutrophils are especially prominent in ulcerated areas. Vascular proliferations resembling granulation tissue develop superficially near areas of inflammation. These reparative changes may resemble low-grade dysplasia or adenomas.\n\n【15】Hyperplastic polyps rarely progress to gastric carcinomas with an incidence of no more than 2% 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. It is generally acknowledged that hyperplasticpolyps do not transform in carcinoma， although they may occasionally be associated with gastric cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-9]</u>. The appearing of adenomatous and dysplastic foci， followed by the cancerous lesion is considered to be related to the size and macroscopic type of the hyperplastic polyp 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Anyways， an association of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or signet ring carcinoma with hyperplastic polyp is reported， with particular regard to familiar form通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8，10-16]</u>. From a review of the literature， only 4 cases of signet ring carcinoma arising within a gastric hyperplastic polyp were reported通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13，15，16]</u>. One of them describes a case of multifocal signet-ring carcinoma in an inverted hyperplastic polyp 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【16】Our case report a poorly cohesive gastric carcinoma with combined signet ring cells and pleomorphic eosinophilic cells， raised in a gastric hyperplastic polyp and associated with foci of foveolar high grade dysplasia in the surface epithelium. The latter was the only worrying feature observed at the time of endoscopic sampling of the lesion. Accuracy in endoscopic sampling and histological examination are critical points to reveal pre-neoplastic changes and allow do not miss underling invasive carcinoma.\n\n【17】This case emphasizes the importance for endoscopists to obtain extensive bioptic sampling from gastric polyps，especially ifassociated with chronic gastritis， in order to allow an adequate histological examination. Reactive hyperplasia need to be accurately screened to rule out foveolar dysplasia. The microscopic evidence of foveolar dysplasia (type 2 gastritis associated dysplasia) strongly suggests a close observation of the patient being the finding a precursor lesion of invasive neoplasia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Therefore， an increasing number of patients receive heart transplantations from this device. As is common for re-do procedures， numerous tissue adhesions are found and the operative procedure for the heart transplantation becomes more challenging. The time-consuming approach often leads to an incomplete removal of driveline and outflow graft material.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： We report about a 49-year old male patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy who underwent implantation of a left ventricular assist device in 2013 and orthotopic heart transplantation in 2014. Twelve months after transplantation， the patient was admitted to the hospital with painful swelling and left-sided chest pain. Laboratory results showed a slight increase of inflammatory markers. Multiple blood culture sets remained negative. Computer tomography(CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed signs of osteomyelitis of the left fourth rib. After operative rib excision， microbiological testing revealed colonization of osteoid tissue with C. albicansand S. epidermidis. An antibiotic and antifungal therapy was initiated， followed bywound treatment with vacuum assisted closure (VAC) therapy. Due to persistent pain despite opioids， the thoracic images were reevaluated. A 20 cm long piece of remaining driveline was identified，located in the area of left sided 4h to 5\"h intercostal space. After operative removal of the driveline， a sudden pain relief and decrease of inflammatory markers was seen.\n\n【3】Conclusion： In long-term support with ventricular assist devices， driveline infections are still one of the key problems. Whether this also affects remaining driveline after heart transplantation is still not known. Due to the obligatory immunosuppression， the general risk for infection is increased. Therefore the complete excision of the ventricular assist device， including the removal of all foreign material， seems to be the most appropriate approach.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Although heart transplantation remains the gold standard in treatment of advanced or end-stage heart failure， it is limited by the number of available donor organs. Implantable ventricular assist devices (VADs) have been developed to work as tools for long-term therapy in patients with advanced heart failure， or as bridges to transplant. Their development might be one of the key tools to counter organ scarcity. Nevertheless， it is known that despite the technological improvements， VAD therapy is still related to a large number of side effects. Complications such as bleeding， driveline infection， pump thrombosis， and stroke are causing an increasing number of patients receiving heart transplantation from the device (VAD) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The 2015 annual INTERMACS report revealed that approximately one third of patients with a VAD received heart transplantation within twelve months 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. As common for re-do procedures， numerous tissue adhesions are found and the operative procedure of transplantation becomes more challenging. Due to oral anticoagulation during VAD therapy， surgeons have to deal with increased bleeding and prolonged hemostasis. Despite the fact that short ischemia and cardiopulmonary bypass time remain key goals to improve outcome，operative strategies for how to deal with the remaining driveline after VAD explantation are necessary.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\nWe report about a 49-year old male Caucasian patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The risk factors for cardiovascular disease included arterial hypertension， hyperlipidemia， and smoking (30pack-years) but no diabetes. The patient’s past medical history includes two ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) in 2009and 2011 with percutaneous coronary intervention. This was followed by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac bypass surgery (LIMA to LAD and RIM) in 2012. Duetoprogressive leftheart failure， the patient underwent implantation of a continuous flow left ventricular assist device (HeartWare) in 2013. After thromboembolic complication (right cerebral infarction) during device support， the patient was listed for heart transplantation and got transplanted in删除4-1:<u>2014</u>. Twelve months after transplantation the patient was admitted to the hospital with painful swelling and left-sided chest pain. Apart from mild left pectoral swelling and tenderness on palpation， local findings did not reveal further signs of inflammation. Laboratory results showed only a slight increase of inflammatory markers， such as C-reactive protein or white blood cell count. Multiple blood culture sets remained negative. Because of persistent and progressive pain， further imaging was used. Computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed signs of osteomyelitis in the ventral parts of the left fourth rib， in close proximity to the right ventricle. Therefore， operative excision of the ventral parts of the fourth rib was performed and osteoid material was sent for microbiological testing. A colonization of osteoid tissue with C. albicans as well as S. epidermidis was revealed. The antifungal sensitivity profile showed a Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of 0.032 ug/ml for amphotericin and a MIC of 0.25 ug/ml for fluconazole. The antibiotic|删除段之间换行|sensitivity profile for S. epidermidis proved sensitivity to second and fourth generation fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin)， narrow-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics (flucloxacillin) as well as reserve antibiotics such as linezolid， teicoplanin， vancomycin， or rifampicin. According to the anti-biogram， an anti-infective therapy with ciprofloxacin and flucloxacillin was initiated， as well as an antifungal therapy with fluconazole. The wound was treated with vacuum assisted closure (VAC) therapy. Wound debridement and changes of dressing were performed every 3-4 days. After three negative microbiological results， VAC treatment was terminated and secondary wound closure was performed. Due to persistent pain despite chronic opioid pain medicine， the thoracic images (CT and MRI scans) were re-evaluated. An approximately 20 cm long piece of remaining driveline was identified， located in the area ofleft-sided4h to 5h intercostal space. Indication for operative removal was set. Operative excision of the extra thoracic located piece of driveline was carried out. The perioperative and early postoperative follow-up did not show any abnormalities. Local wound findings were absent for signs of inflammation. Laboratory results showed a sudden decrease of white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. The patient was discharged home. The four-week follow-up in the outpatient clinic showed pain relief and a well-healing wound. Local findings showed a reduction of seroma.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Due to an increasing number of patients with ventricular assist devices， orthotopic heart transplantation is more and more performed as a re-do procedure， sometimes even after several previous cardiothoracic operations. In this case， previous to the heart transplantation， the patient already had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator(ICD)，receivedbypass surgery， and received implantation ofaleft ventricular assist device.Repeated and previous cardiothoracic operations cause heart transplantation to become more technically challenging and the approach via sternotomy often takes a lot of time due to massive adhesiolysis. The time-consuming approach frequently leads to an incomplete removal of driveline and outflow graft material. It is known that in patients with long-term VAD support， driveline infections are still one of the key problems. Zierer et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> described a rate of late-onset driveline infections occurring in almost all patients with support duration over one year. Despite the fact that infection control is improving， the seventh INTERMACS report still revealed an assist device-related infection in over thirty percent of patients during the first three years after implantation 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Whether this also affects remaining driveline after heart transplantation is still not known. But due to obligatory immunosuppression， the general risk for infection in patients after heart transplantation is increased.\n\n【10】The presence of chronic infection seems to be a significant risk factor for reoperation after assist device removal 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In the described case the immunosuppression regime was set with tacrolimus (Prograf； target blood concentration： 6-8 ng/ml)， mycophenolate sodium(Myfortic； dosage： 360 mg 1-1-1) and prednisolone (dosage： 7，5 mg 1-0-0). Apart from the immunosuppressive therapy listed above， the medical history was negative for other risk factors of infection. In detail， this middle-aged patient didn't suffer from obesity nor was he underweight. There was no history of diabetes， no known underlying disease affecting the immune system， and no history of cancer. Therefore one must consider that a chronic infection， caused by the remaining driveline material， led to osteomyelitis in this patient. Due to the risk of infectious complications， the complete VAD excision including the removal of all foreign material represents the most appropriate approach 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In the described case， remaining driveline caused persistent pain and several re-admissions to hospital. After heart transplantation in 2014， the patient spent over fifty percent of his time in the hospital， accompanied by social isolation， reduced quality oflife， and inability to work.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "301f2cd5-fb21-475e-a27d-888fd53334f8", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Tick borne diseases are frequently seen in tick endemic areas. Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness. However， co-infection with other pathogens is not uncommon and can present with nonspecific symptoms complicating the diagnosis. We present a case of triple infection with babesiosis， Lyme disease， and anaplasmosis treated with antibiotics and RBC exchange(Erythrocytapheresis).\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 74-year-old female with past medical history significant for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and hypertension， who was an avid gardener， presented with one week of progressive dyspnea， cough with mucoid expectoration， and fatigue. On presentation， she was hypotensive to 85/49 mm of Hg and tachycardia to 150 beats per minute without fever， requiring 6L of oxygen to maintain saturation. General examination was significant for altered mental status， dyspnea， pallor， and peripheral edema. Exam showed flat neck veins， an irregular heart rate with no audible murmurs or gallops， and bibasilar pulmonary crackles. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n\n【4】Pertinent laboratory findings were significant for hemolytic anemia (9.9 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (34 K/uL). A peripheral blood smear revealed the presence of intracytoplasmic parasites consistent with Babesia. The patient was started on azithromycin and atovaquone. Doxycycline was added empirically for Lyme disease which was later confirmed by serology. In addition， Anaplasma titers were positive. Further investigation revealed that the parasitic load of 9.04% and RBC exchange was performed for severe babesiosis. Repeat labs demonstrated an inadequate reduction in parasitic load (6.54%) requiring a second round of erythropheresis. Antimicrobials were changed to clindamycin and quinine with doxycycline for a total of fourteen days. The patient’s anemia and thrombocytopenia improved along with her clinical status.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Lyme disease is the most frequently diagnosed tick-borne disease； however， patients in endemic areas should be screened for co-infection in cases with nonspecific symptoms and lack of response to therapy within 48 hours. A 10-day course of doxycycline is usually sufficient for Lyme disease and anaplasmosis while babesiosis usually responds to atovaquone and azithromycin. Erythropheresis should be considered in severe babesiosis as it may prevent further complications including severe hemolytic anemia， DIC， respiratory failure， and renal failure.\n\n【7】A 74-year-old female with a past medical history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease(COPD)，Hypertension，Depression and Glaucoma and Retinal detachment presented to the hospital with one week of progressively worsening dyspnea and fatigue. The patient was asymptomatic until a week before the presentation when she started experiencing dyspnea on exertion with household tasks including gardening. She also endorsed a cough productive of yellowish mucoid sputum accompanied with fatigue impacting her daily activities. The patient denied any chest pain/discomfort， palpitations， pre-syncope， syncope， orthopnea or Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnea(PND). She also denied any fevers， arthralgia， myalgia， or rashes. Her social history was remarkable for active smoking， 75 pack year smoking history without any history of alcohol or other illicit drug iise.\n\n【8】In the Department of Emergency， the patient was a febrile， blood pressure of 85/49 mm of Hg with a heart rate of 150 and respiratory rate of 22 per minute with oxygen saturation of 94% on 6Liters of oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient was oriented to person but appeared lethargic， and删除1换行was using accessory muscles of respiration. General examination was remarkable for pallor with anicteric sclera， and no palpable lymph nodes were present in the cervical， axillary， or inguinal regions. Her right pupil was 3 mm reactive to light. Left pupil was noted to be chronically adducted and downward secondaryto retinal detachment. Oral mucosa appeared dry with thickly coated tongue. Neck veins were flat. Heart Examination was remarkable for fast， irregular heart rate， variable first heart sound， normal second heart sound without any murmurs or gallops. Lung examination was significant bilateral mid to late inspiratory crackles. The abdomen was soft， distended， non-tender with normal bowel sounds. Extremities were noted to be cold and clammy， with 1+ pitting edema. The neurological examination had decreased muscle strength throughout with normal sensations. Deep tendon reflexes were noted to be symmetric.\n\n【9】Routine laboratory investigations revealed WBC count of7.5 (4.0 k/uL to 10.5 k/uL)， Hemoglobin of 9.9 (12.5 g/dL to 16 g/dL) and hematocrit 32.3 (37% to 47%). Her baseline hemoglobin concentration was around 15 g/dL. Platelet count was 34 (150 K/uL to 450 K/uL) with elevated Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) of 12.4 (7.4fL to 11.4 fL). A peripheral blood smear showed intracytoplasmic parasites suspicious for Babesia along with reduced platelets . The parasiticlevel was found to be at 9.04%.Lactate Dehydrogenase(LDH) was 1，544 U/L(125 U/L to 220 U/L)， Haptoglobin was <6 mg/dL (27 mg/dL to 139 mg/dL)， Total bilirubin 5.4 mg/dL (0.3 mg/dL to 1.0 mg/dL) with direct fraction 3.5 mg/dL (0.0 mg/dL to 0.2 mg/dL). AST was 202 U/L (5 U/L to 40 U/L)， ALT 90 U/L (7 U/L to 52U/L)， with albumin of 2.3 g/dL (3.5 g/dL to 5.0 g/dL). BUN was 51mg/dL (7 mg/dL to 17 mg/dL) with normal Creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL， Sodium 129 (135 mmol/L to 145 mmol/L)， Potassium 4 (3.5 mmol/L to 5.1 mmol/L)， Chloride 103 (98 mmol/L to 107 mmol/L)， serum Bicarbonate 19 (24 mmol/L to 32 mmol/L)and calcium of 7 (8.4 mg/dL to 102 mg/dL). Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.\n\n【10】Chest x-ray was remarkable for cardiomegaly with small right pleural effusion and small airspace opacity within the right lower lobe. Given her presentation， we started intravenous fluids along with empiric antibiotic coverage for community-acquired pneumonia with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin. We also started doxycycline and atovaquone as Babesia on peripheral smear raised the suspicion of co-infection with Lyme. She received around 100Liters of intravenous fluids with a downtrend in lactic acid from 2.8 mmol/L to 2.0 mmol/L. However， she continued to remain hypotensive and required Norepinephrine to maintain her blood pressure. Given her severe disease and parasitic load， erythropheresis was done. Following删除1换行erythropheresis， on day three there was a mild improvement in her parasitic load to 5.54%， and due to her continued septic shock state， we added Clindamycin to the regimen. Her renal function worsened secondary to pigment induced nephropathy from hemolysis. Given inadequate response and development of Acute Kidney Injury， we repeated erythropheresis resulting in a reduction in parasite load to 1.75%. At this point， Lyme IgM immunoblot was found to be positive， with IgG being negative. Anaplasma titers also showed recent/current infection， with IgG >1：1，024 (reference <1：64) and IgM 1：80 (reference <1：20). These results prompted discontinuation of Atovaquone and Azithromycin and addition of quinine. Her hemodynamic status improved and she came off of pressor support along with improvement in respiratory status. Her Hemoglobin reached a nadir of 9.1 g/dL， but platelets improved to 35 cells/L109 cells/L and creatinine returned to baseline. She received a total of14 days of antibiotic therapy. Her liver enzymes trended down， with improvement in her hemoglobin and platelet count throughout her inpatient stay.\n\n【11】Lyme Borreliosis (LB) is the most common tick-borne disease in the United States. It is caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi spread by the tick Ixodes scapularis. This tick is known to carry at least seven human pathogens in the United States and Europe， including Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia spp. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. It is common for patients to have co-infection with two pathogens but the incidence of three pathogen infection is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3，4]</u>. Individuals staving in endemic tick areas such as the North-Eastern United States are at increased risk. This risk is higher in certain professions such as farmers， gardeners or foresters. Our patient lived in an endemic tick area and spent most of the time outside her home doing gardening.\n\n【12】Typical clinical presentation 01 Lyme disease includes characteristic rash known as Erythema migrans， intermittent or persistent arthritis and certain neurologic manifestations such as subtle encephalopathy or polyneuropathy. Also， individuals may have evidence of meningeal irritation， migratory musculoskeletal pain， hepatitis， generalized lymphadenopathy， splenomegaly， sore throat， nonproductive cough， or testicular swelling 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Anaplasma and Babesia usually have nonspecific symptoms such as fever， malaise， myalgia， headache， and chills. Some patients may develop nausea， vomiting， cough， and arthralgia. Clinical manifestations of Babesia are mainly due to hemolysis because of parasite-mediated lysis of erythrocytes. Mild hepatosplenomegaly may be present， but thrombocytopenia， leukopenia， and anemia are frequently detected.\n\n【13】Cases with severe anemia (Hemoglobin <10) and high parasitic load (>10%) are classified as severe babesiosis and are at increased risk of complications such as acute respiratory failure， disseminated intravascular coagulation， congestive heart failure， and renal failure通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Low threshold for suspicion should be held for co-infection when patients present with a presentation which would be atypical for single pathogen exposure. Delay in diagnosis can lead to prolonged disease duration and increases the comorbidities associated with the infectious state 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4，6]</u>. Our patient presented with non-specific symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue without typical signs and symptoms of any of the tick-borne diseases but had a Babesia parasitemia level of 9% with hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL， as well as evidence of acute respiratory and renal failure. These all subsequently improved with antibiotics and erythropheresis.\n\n【14】Various methods are available for diagnosis such as blood smear， Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay， and serological删除1换行examinations but， none of these methods have 100% sensitivity or specificity. Lyme is diagnosed by a Two-step testing with Enzyme Immune-Assay (EIA) and western blot testing； If the EIA is reactive， separate IgM and IgG western blot can be obtained for confirmatory testing. Ifsymptom duration is morethan four weeks， IgG western blot alone is highly sensitive 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In our patient， Lyme IgM immunoblot was positive with negative IgG consistent with duration of illness less than four weeks. Anaplasmosis can easily be diagnosed by presence of morulae in neutrophils on thin smear. PCR and serological testing is also available， which are more sensitive than thin smear. Our patient had anaplasma titers of IgG>1：1，024 (reference <1：64) and IgM 1：80(reference<1：20). Titers >1：640 are diagnostic of acute infection with culture as the most sensitive method 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.

We obtained multiple blood smears to assess the response to therapy by trending parasitic load. Serological detection of antibodies is also an option， however， is not employed routinely. IgG titers more than 1：1，024 suggests active or recent infection. Positive IgM titers suggest infection and must be accompanied by positive IgG titers for diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Blood smear may be negative if the patient has a low level of parasitic load.

In contrast Mild to moderate babesiosis effectively respond to a 7 to 10 day course of oral azithromycin and atovaquone which has been found to be superior to clindamycin and quinine due to the tolerability profile 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Various other drug combinations have also been used for treatment such as atovaquone， azithromycin， and clindamycin or atovaquone， clindamycin and artemisinin although none of these regimens have been shown to be superior in comparison to each other 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. In the case of immunocompromised individuals who are at risk relapsing Babesia-treatment for a total of six weeks is preferred including a period of two weeks after parasites are nolonger visible on thin smear 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【18】Partial or complete Erythropheresis (red blood cell exchange) should be considered in patients with high-grade parasitemia (>10%) with active hemolysis (Hb<10). 90% reduction should be targeted by exchanging 2.5 times the patient red blood cell volume. Cases with severely complicated babesiosis such as pulmonary， renal or hepatic dysfunction should also receive early erythropheresis as it may prevent further complications such as DIC， acute renal failure or acute respiratory failure 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. After initial erythropheresis， our patient did not have an adequate response with only a 40% reduction in parasitic load， therefore， requiring a second session with significant improvement in her parasitic load as well as her symptoms. Patients删除1换行diagnosed with any one of the tick-borne pathogens should always be screened for other tick-borne illness especially if there is no significant response to treatment within 48 hours or if cases have unexplained leukopenia， thrombocytopenia， and anemia. Early treatment should include doxycycline to cover Lyme and anaplasmosis empirically. Atovaquone and azithromycin can be added if the patient has mild to moderate uncomplicated babesiosis. Early erythropheresis should be considered for individuals with severe babesiosis or concomitant pulmonary， renal or hepatic dysfunction.删除2换行l. SkotarczakB，Rymaszewska A.

Due to tumor anatomical localization many patients do not have any specific symptoms until tumor size increases. Right diaphragm tumors can mimic liver lesions -solid as well as cystic. Surgical resection is the only curative option. This case report aims to provide clinical experience and diagnostic challenges of one of the rarest benign diaphragmatic tumors -leiomyoma.\n\n【2】Keywords： Diaphragm； Diaphragmatic tumor； Diaphragmatic leiomyoma\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Diaphragmatic tumors are rare entity. Due to rarity no systematic analysis is possible and the researches on these tumors are limited to case reports and case series. Little over 200 cases are reported in literature with histological variance being very diverse 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The incidence of malignant and benign diaphragmatic tumors is relatively similar， with most common being cysts and lipomas in benign group versus sarcomas in malignant group 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Because ofthe rarity most ofthe tumors are diagnosed relatively late and have latent clinical presentation. It also presents a diagnostic challenge in differentiating diaphragmatic lesions from liver lesions or from other organ tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The extent of surgical resection and reconstruction is also controversial， since the radical resection may lead in need of diaphragmatic prosthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. This case report aims to provide clinical experience and diagnostic challenges of one ofthe rarest benign diaphragmatic tumors -leiomyoma.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nA 48-year-old patient received left laparoscopic oophorectomy due to serosal proliferative tumor in gynecological department. This procedure was followed by right laparoscopic oophorectomy， omentectomy and biopsies with negative histological findings. In postoperative period patient started complaining with abdominal distress. Ultrasound was performed， which revealed 8.3cm x 14 cm solid mass in liver S6/7 segment Figure 1. Abdominal MRI was recommended for differential diagnosis during follow-up period. Following tumor markers - alpha fetoprotein， carcinoembryogenic antigen and Ca 19.9 were in normal range. Abdominal MRI revealed 95mm x 120 mm x96 mm solid mass in liver S7/8 segment and right sub diaphragmatic space with cystic degeneration Figure 2. Multidisciplinary team， including multiple surgeons， radiologist， thoracic surgeons， and oncologists， reviewed clinical case and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images prior to hospitalization and surgery and consensus was made that tumor was not of liver but diaphragmatic origin. Patient was prepared for surgery. Right subcostal incision was made. Following intraoperative examination confirmed that tumor was originating from right diaphragm and pressing on to liver S7/8 segment. The tumor was mobilized by blunt dissection from liver surface followed by mobilization of right liver lobe. Right diaphragm was exposed. The base of the tumor together with surrounding diaphragm was resected using ultrasound knife. The defect in diaphragm was repaired with continuous prolene suture Figure 3. Postoperative period was uneventful. Patient was discharged at eighth post-operative day. Pathological examination showed grayish in capsulated solid 17.5 cmx10.5 cm x7 cm tumor with positive expression of estrogen and progesterone reaction. Following protein expression was investigated： SMA： 100%(+++)， Desmin：|删除段之间换行|100% (+++)， H-caldesmon： 100% (+++)， Estrogen receptors： 90%positive tumor cells (+/+++)， Progesterone receptors： 20% positive tumor cells (+/+++)， Ki67： 1% of positive tumor cells (++/+++). HMB45， Melan A， Myogenin， MyoD1， DOG1 - was negative Figure 4.\n\nDiscussion删除1换行with very low malignancy potential， which is around 0.1% 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Most common place of origin of leiomyomas is uterus followed by gastrointestinal tract. Clinicopathological presentation usually depends on place of origin and is often occult， resulting in clinical manifestation when tumor grows to extreme sizes. Primary diaphragmatic leiomyoma is extremely rare， to our knowledge only one published case report exists 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. One of the common pitfalls in interpretation of diaphragmatic tumors is related to anatomical删除1换行position. Tumors of right diaphragm can often be mistaken with liver lesions， especially if diaphragmatic cysts are considered 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Most common radiological method for differential diagnosis is abdominal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. In our case， MRI was used to specify origin of lesion， however only during multidisciplinary team meeting correct diagnosis was achieved. Thus， emphasizing the necessity of multiple evaluations of imaging. In the era of minimally invasive surgery， there are several diaphragmatic resection techniques to consider. Depending on the tumor involvement and differentiation，partial or complete resection of diaphragm may be needed， following simple suture closure or prosthetic mesh reconstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Open or minimally invasive approach can be considered. The main aspect to consider choosing surgical approach is tumor size， integrity， cystic vs. solid， and most important - the radicality of resection， because surgical resection is the only curative option 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Minimally invasive approach is usually better suited for patients with small lesions， whereas with big tumors may require extensive liver mobilization or retroperitoneal dissection通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>. Since benign tumors usually do not involve large area of diaphragm resulting in smaller resection defect， simple closure with interrupted or continuous suture is sufficient， as was done in our case， where diaphragmatic involvement was around 2 cm in diameter and was closed with unobservable continuous suture 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Several case reports have reported that the higher expression of Ki67 is associated with malignancy potential in benign diaphragmatic tumors， whereas in our case， Ki67 expression was positive in 1% of tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14]</u>. Recurrence rate and survival rate varies greatlyand depends on tumor histological type， especially malignant ones， and can range from 54%to 89% in long term survival|15，16.\n\n【8】In conclusion， diaphragmatic tumors pose a diagnostic， clinical and surgical challenge due to their latent clinical presentation and anatomical localization， since the resection is the only curative way. Our experience showed that multiple evaluations of radiological images in multidisciplinary team is paramount in choosing correct treatment modality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However， the term \"epidermolysis\" is not correct as epidermal disruption is not the primary change in two of the main categories of EB. Currently，there is no definitive and curative treatment for EB. Hence， the mainstay of treatment is symptomatic， supportive and preventive. The maior challenge encountered in the care of a neonate with EB is optimum skin care and expert nursing care.\n\n【2】Keywords： Epidermolysis bullosa； Optimum skin care\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a heterogeneous group of inherited， mechanobullous disorders characterized by extreme fragility of the skin and mucous membranes which gives rise to the formation of blisters and ulcers following minor trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【5】However， the term \"epidermolysis\" is not correct as epidermal disruption is not the primary change in two of the main categories of EB 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. According to the recent data， the prevalence of EB has estimated to 8 to 10 million per live birth. The pathophysiology is mutations in various structural proteins in the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex (EBS)， functional epidermolysis bullosa and dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa are the three major types. EBS is the most common among them 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. EBS may manifest either at birth or during the neonatal period.\n\n【6】These 3 subtypes are differentiated according to the level at which the tissue separates and the blisters form， that is， depending on whether this happens above， within， or below the epidermal basement membrane 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【7】The disease is always painful， is often pervasive and debilitating. It affects 1 out of every 50，000live births and those born with it are often called Butterfly Children because as the analogy goes their skin is as fragile as the wings of the butterfly 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. There is no treatment or cure 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 2.1 kg， single term male， small for gestation age was born to third degree consanguin ity to a second gravida mother. The mother was booked at 31 weeks of gestation； subsequently she had regular antenatal visits. There was history of previous sibling death at day 12 of life due to bullous lesions. The present baby did not require any resuscitation at birth and cried immediately after birth with Apgar score of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 54 minute. Baby had bullous lesions at legs at birth. He was started on IV antibiotics (Inj Vancomycin) as blood culture grew Methicillin-Susceptible Staphylococcus Aureus (MSSA). Lumbar puncture was not done. Dermatologist opinioned that bullae could be Epidermolysis bullosa . In view of reappearing bullous lesions， baby was sent to higher center on day 9 of life for further management. The baby was referred and admitted in neonatal intensive care unit of our tertiary care facility. There was appearance of new lesions and healing of older one on friction sites. There was no history of poor feeding/recurrent vomiting/decrease urine output/top milk feeding/umbilical discharge\n\n【10】Skin lesions\n\n【11】Epidermolysis Bullosa (Junctional type)： In view of waxing and waning course of bullae， skin删除1换行consultation was taken and same diagnosis of EB (Junctional type most likely severe form) was made. Genetic consultation was taken and sample for molecular diagnosis was sent. Parents were counseled regarding skin care， prognosis. Gradually， there was worsening of dermatological status in form of new appearance of bullae leaving denuded skin behind. There was bleeding from denuded skin area and oral mucosa on minimal handling.\n\n【12】Respiratory\n\n【13】On day 14 of life， baby had respiratory distress in the form of increased respiratory rate， new appearance of crepitation in bilateral lung field and frequent desaturation. So， the baby was intubated on day 17 and started on SIMV mode of ventilation.\n\n【14】删除10:<u>Renal</u>\n\n【15】On day 14 of life， baby had abdominal distension along with decreased urine output (0.5 ml/kr/hr) with increment in serum urea. NS bolus was given and dehydration correction @75 ml/kg was started. Fluid was continued @150 ml/kg/day. Baby also developed metabolic acidosis with pH of 6.9 and BE-18 for which sodium bicarbonate was given after discussing with Pediatric nephrology team. There was further worsening of renal status in the form of decreased urine output and deranged RFT. Peritoneal dialysis was started.\n\n【16】Hemodynamic\n\n【17】On day 18 of life， baby was having feeble pulse and increased tachycardia. So， NS bolus (10 ml/kg) was given and later dopamine and dobutamine was added. In view of poor pulses， adrenaline was added.\n\n【18】Feeding and nutrition\n\n【19】Baby had abdominal distension on day 14 of life， so baby was kept NPO. Earlier OG feeds and Katori spoon feed was given.\n\n【20】Lethargy/Late onset sepsis\n\n【21】In view oflethargy and abdominal distension， baby was evaluated for sepsis. CBC revealed leucopenia with thrombocytopenia. Inj Piperacillin-Tazobactam， Amikacin and Vancomycin were started in renal modified doses. Child was having persistent thrombocytopenia and required multiple platelets transfusion. Blood culture grew klebsiella (blood culture reported after the demise of baby).\n\n【22】Hyperkalemia\n\n【23】On Day 15， baby had high potassium， so potassium was omitted from IV fluid and NaHCO3 was given. Repeat value was 4.8 mEq/l.\n\n【24】Anemia with thrombocytopenia\n\n【25】Baby was transfused with PRBC and PRP as Hb was 7.7 gm% and Platelets were 13000/mm.\n\n【26】Terminal Events\n\n【27】Baby had refractory shock and had sudden cardiac arrest at 2pm of day. CPR was started and child received 3 doses of adrenaline， but baby could not be revived and expired at 2：15 pm. Parents were counseled for autopsy but consent was not given.\n\n【28】Cause ofDeath\n\n【29】Immediate cause Septic shock.\n\n【30】Antecedent Cause\n\n【31】Sepsis with Acute renal failure with DIC with Epidermolysis bullosa.\n\n【32】Discussion\n\n【33】Epidermolysis bullosa has no gender， geographical or racial preponderance Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is the most prevalent phenotype whereas autosomal recessive dystrophic and junctional EB are rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-10]</u>. In families with EB or those at risk for having a child with EB， prenatal and preimplantation diagnosis is possible in order to appropriately guide the prospective parents. Prenatal diagnosis using DNA has 98% accuracy 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【34】Currently， there is no definitive and curative treatment for EB. Hence， the mainstay of treatment is symptomatic， supportive and preventive 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. The supportive management includes： Prevention of skin trauma to avoid new blister formation by gentle handling of the infant， use of loose-fitting clothing， padding bony prominences， and avoiding adhesives or direct rubbing of the skin， infant should be maintained in cool， air-conditioned environments as overheating can increase skin fragility. The major challenge encountered in the care of a neonate with EB is optimum skin care and expert nursing care， more so， with a preterm， low birth weight neonate who undergoes many invasive skin procedures as in the index case 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【35】EB is not a contraindication for any vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. A key to successful management is expert nursing care. Special precautions need to be taken for older children in the use of adhesive tapes， sphygmomanometer cuffs， tourniquets and other instruments that cause shearing of skin or mucous membranes 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. The erosions should be cleaned with sterile normal saline and covered with non-adherent dressings.Non-adhesive dressing pads or Vaseline impregnated gauze covered by soft， bulky dressings are ideal. The treatment plan must be individualized， and optimal communication among team members is a vital factor in obtaining good results. Nutritional support is important for adequate growth and development and to promote optimal wound healing. To families of affected children， prenatal diagnosis using molecular techniques offers genetic counseling 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【36】Diagnostically， EB remains a challenge. The definitive diagnosis of inherited EB is made with Transmission Electron Microscopy(TEM)， Immunofluorescence antigen mapping (IF)， and EB related monoclonal antibody testing as well as mutational analysis. In order to make a correct diagnosis， it is important that the skin biopsy should be performed properly， as described by Intong and Murell 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. In index case， skin biopsy was not done due to unwillingness of parents.\n\n【37】Conclusion\n\n【38】Epidermolysis bullosa， a genetically determined skin fragility disorder with variable degrees of extracutaneous involvement. The clinical spectrum ranges from localized skin disease to a life-删除1换行threatening and disabling disease with extensive extracutaneous involvement. All three major types of EB， namely EB simplex， Junctional EB， Dystrophic EB， can present with blistering and erosions at birth and cannot be distinguished clinically in the newborn period. The diagnosis of EB can be confirmed via a skin biopsy for immunofluorescence mapping. Although the clinical features are multiple and varied， treatment still remains a major challenge. There is still a long way to go， meticulous skin care and good nursing care， and gene therapy could possibly significantly alleviate the suffering of the neonates in the future.\n\n【39】Contribution\n\n【40】Dabas Heena has the prime responsibility of data acquisition and draft preparation and review of literature.

Repeat surgery for constrictive pericarditis is associated with higher thirty-day mortality than that of an initial pericarpdiectomy. Constrictive epicardial thickness might lead to the repeat surgery in some cases.

CP is observed in 0.2%-0.4% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. They generally have experienced pericardial trauma or inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Despite its poor prognosis when untreated， CP is potentially curable. Surgical pericardiectomy can be performed at low operative risk. Cardiologists should have a high index of suspicion for CP in patients presenting with predominant right-sided heart failure(HF)， particularly when accompanied by a history of cardiac surgery， pericarditis， and/or pericardial effusion. Transthoracic two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography are usually the first diagnostic tools in the evaluation of HF and can reliably identify CP in most patients by the characteristic real-time motion of the heart and hemodynamic features. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging provide incremental data for the diagnosis and management of CP and are especially helpful when clinical or echocardiographic findings are inconclusive. Cardiac catheterization has been the gold standard for the diagnosis of CP but may not be necessary if non-invasive tests demonstrate the diagnostic features of CP. Catheterization should then be reserved for selected cases or for assessing concomitant coronary disease. Although most patients with CP require pericardiectomy， anti-inflammatory therapy may be curative in patients presenting with subacute symptoms， especially when evidence of marked ongoing inflammation is seen.\n\n【5】Conventional Surgery\n\n【6】Surgical pericardiectomy is a potentially curative intervention. Gillaspie and colleagues reported a 20-year experience with isolated pericardiectomy performed at Mayo Clinic between January1993 and December 2013 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In that study， 355 patients had undergone pericardiectomy for CP. Radiation-related cases were excluded. Radical resection-defined as removal of anterior， inferior， and left lateral pericardium posterior to the left phrenic nerve-was most commonly performed， with an overall mortality of 2.5% among the 355 patients. The authors referred to specific patients who had constrictive pericardium and epicardium. They recommended that a tight epicardial peel should be left on non-contiguous islands. They did not indicate how many cases required the additional procedure. Certainly， though， some of those with thickened epicardium would have required additional attention. Repeat surgery for constrictive pericarditis is associated with 7%thirty-day mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Constrictive epicardial thickness might lead to the repeat surgery.\n\n【7】Waffle Procedure\n\n【8】The waffle procedure， performed by incising the tight fibrotic epicardium in a crosshatched manner， releases the epicardial constriction 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. A survey of the English-language literature since1983 for references to the waffle procedure applied to relieve constrictive pericarditis yielded 10articles and/or abstracts. Eight of the articles/abstracts originated in Japan 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-12]</u>. There is no clinical删除1换行evidence，however， that Japanese people with constrictive pericarditis tend to develop epicardial thickening. Nine of the articles/abstracts were published as case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-6，8，9，11-14]</u>.\n\n【9】The waffle procedure is performed with electric and/or sharp dissection. Matsuura and Kanda used an ultrasonic scalpel 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>. Three techniques are used in our institution and are chosen on a case-by-case basis. Yamamoto and Shiraish compared cases of isolated pericardiectomy with cases of pericardiectomy in conjunction with the epicardial waffle procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，10]</u>. The authors concluded that the waffle procedure improved diastolic function in patients with epicardial thickening and that it was effective in patients with persistent epicardial constriction. We have chosen to apply the waffle procedure in patients with constrictive pericarditis associated with thickened epicardium.\n\n【10】Conclusions\n\n【11】Constrictive pericarditis is sometimes associated with constrictive epicarditis. Extensive epicardiectomy is not easy， and the waffle procedure can be used to relieve the hemodynamic status produced by the constriction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

To our knowledge，this sort of abscess has never been described in a pediatric patient in the literature.\n\n【2】Keywords： Influenza； Abscess； Pyomyositis\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】A six-year-old female presented to the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) with complaint of a right-sided chest\"lump.\"Nine days earlier， she began having cough and fever， with a maximum temperature of 104°F. She went to an urgent care center， where a rapid flu test was positive， and was sent home with a prescription for oseltamivir. Despite treatment， the patient continued to have non-productive cough and fever and began to develop right shoulder pain. Four days later， she went to her pediatrician， who ordered an X-ray of her shoulder and clavicle to evaluate the pain， as well as a chest X-ray for the cough. X-ray of the shoulder and clavicle was reportedly normal， but the chest X-ray showed “fuzziness.”\n\n【5】The next day， the patient visited the PED on her pediatrician’s recommendations. Her fever， cough， and right chest wall and shoulder pain had persisted， and she had also developed diarrhea， occasional vomiting， and anorexia. At that time， the patient was febrile with a temperature of 100.7°F with a pulse of 110， respiratory rate of 50， blood pressure of 80/52， and oxygen saturation of 100%on room air. On exam， the patient was tender to palpation along the right pectoralis major with decreased range of motion in the right shoulder secondary to pain. The remainder of her physical exam was normal. CBC and CMP were normal. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was elevated at 12.6. Chest X-ray in the PED showed right middle lobe pneumonia and the patient was discharged home with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.\n\nFour days later， at our initial interaction with the patient， she returned complaining of a right-sided chest “lump\". While her fever was persistent， the fever curve and her cough had improved. The primary concern at this visit was that the diffuse chest wall swelling that was noted on her first PED visit had become much more consolidated， forming a “lump\"on the right side of her chest. Additionally， she experienced pain in this “lump”that radiated to her right shoulder， causing decreased range of motion. The patient's mother reported compliance with medications previously prescribed. The patient's vital signs on presentation were within normal limits. On physical exam， the patient was holding the right shoulder higher than the left and fullness was visible in the right supraclavicular area. A 3 cm ×3 cm area of edema was palpable in the right parasternal region， covering the third and fourth intercostal spaces . While the swelling was tender to palpation， there was neither discrete mass palpable nor erythema to the area. CBC was normal except for a mild thrombocytosis of 512. CMP was entirely within normal limits. CRP was improved from prior visit but still elevated at 6.5 and ESR was increased at 68. LDH， uric acid， and creatine kinase were all normal|删除段之间换行|Given the patient’s physical exam findings with worsening swelling and pain， a bedside ultrasound was obtained to evaluate the area， which revealed an abscess in the right anterior chest，WI wall . Subsequently， a CT of the chest was obtained， which showed a 6 cm x2 cm x4.3cm lobulated abscess in the right upper chest wall， extending from the tissue posterior to the clavicle to the level of the anterior second rib .\n\n【7】The patient was admitted to the pediatric surgical service. The day after admission， the abscess was drained in the operating room； wound cultures subsequently grew Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). After a two-day hospitalization， the patient was discharged home on oral clindamycin. She recovered without any complications. On surgery follow up， she had returned to her baseline state of health.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】While our patient ultimately developed a serious complication， her initial illness was infection with the influenza virus. The influenza virus is an orthomyxovirus that is primarily spread by droplet transmission， although contaminated surfaces can also cause contact transmission. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 4 days once a host is infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Once infected， viral shedding begins 24 h prior to fever onset and then correlates with fever severity 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. However， young children and immunocompromised children can have a prolonged shedding period. In temperate parts of the world， peak influenza season is typically in January or February； however， in equatorial locations， there is no clear influenza season as the virus tends to persist year-round删除4-1:<u>1</u>.\n\n【10】Influenza is， in addition to the name of the virus， also the syndrome caused by the virus. Classically， infection results in sudden fever， chills， and myalgia. The initial symptoms are followed by the development of severe cough， pharyngitis， and rhinorrhea. It is important to remember， however， that young children and particularly infants may not develop this typical presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Infants may only present with irritability and fever， while young children may present with pneumonia，croup，bronchiolitis， or a non-specific viral upper respiratory tract infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. While adults rarely have gastrointestinal symptoms， these may be a prominent feature of children's disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【11】Diagnosis ofinfluenza is most commonly done with rapid antigen testing， which measures reaction between the patient's influenza antigens in their secretions and influenza antibodies in the testing material 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Of note， nasopharyngeal samples are preferable to those删除1换行obtained from the patient’s throat. Main advantages of rapid antigen testing including swift results， being able to distinguish between types of influenza (A vs. B)， ease of bedside testing， and high specificity 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Despite these advantages， though， shortcomings of the test must also be considered-a sensitivity that varies between 20% and 90% and accuracy that depends on disease prevalence within the community通用删除6(英):<u>[11</u>.\n\n【12】While most cases of influenzaare relatively mild andself-resolving， some patients do go on to develop more serious complications. One study of nearly 7000 pediatric patients that were hospitalized due to influenza in 10 states between 2003 and 2010 evaluated the frequency of various complications. They found that the most common complication was sinorespiratory disease， which occurred in 40% of children 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Within this broad category， secondary pneumonia was the most common complication， occurring in 28% of all children， followed closely by asthma exacerbations， which developed in 18% of all children 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. S. aureus and S. pneumonia were the most common bacterial pathogens identified in patients with pneumonia， which is consistent with previous reports 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Of the two， infection with S. aureus is less common， but more serious， especially if caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Other， less common sinorespiratory complications included otitis media， croup， and acute bronchitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The second most common complication was dehydration and volume depletion， occurring in 22% of all children hospitalized with the flu通用删除6(英):<u>[21</u>.Other notable complications occurring in >1% of patients include seizures (both febrile and non-febrile)， bacteremia， and sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【13】While lung abscess and empyema are widely considered to be common complications of influenza， this multi-center study found them to be present in <2% of children hospitalized with the flu 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Similarly， myositis-a reportedly common complication-was found to be present in only 1% of hospitalized patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. However， this report may be falsely decreased as myositis is likely diagnosed in the outpatient or emergency room setting in patients that do not require hospitalization. There is no mention of extra-pulmonary abscesses in this study， suggesting that this is an extremely rare complication.\n\n【14】Three case reports do exist that describe similar cases of pustular accumulation outside the lung. In the adult literature， there is a report of a previously healthy 31-year-old male who developed multiple intramuscular abscesses in all four extremities following H1N1 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Another report exists that describes an immunocompromised 81-year-olddfemaleeonlong-term steroid therapy with development of intraperitoneal free air and a retroperitoneal abscess after Influenza B infection； the authors theorized that the insult of viral infection weakened her already damaged intestinal mucosa， leading to micro-perforations 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. To our knowledge， the only report of a pediatric patient with abscess formation following influenza describes a 5-year-old female with删除1换行acute osteomyelitis and subperiosteal abscess during an infection with Influenza A 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【15】In the patient we present here， the exact etiology of her symptoms is unclear. The relatively high prevalence of post-influenza MRSA pneumonia and location of this patient’s abscess raises the possibility of direct translocation of bacteria across already damaged pleura. A second possibility would be hematogenous spread in a patient whose immune system was already taxed by the influenza virus. Lastly， a completely unrelated process is possible； however，there was no history of trauma to the skin or superficial skin findings such as pustule or cellulitis to suggest a simple cutaneous abscess. Purulent collection was deep to muscle， suggesting a non-dermatologic source of bacteria.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】Influenza is a common virus that infects thousands of children annually. The majority of these children recover without any significant sequelae. Of those that do have further complications， pneumonia， asthma exacerbation， and dehydration are among the most common. Purulent infection in the form of empyema occurs in less than 2% of patients. To our knowledge， this is the first删除1换行intramuscular abscess following influenza infection that is described in the literature. Increased awareness of rare complications， like this case， may prompt providers to consider patients with recent influenza in a different light.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

About 2/3 of patients with solitary bone plasmacytoma will develop multiple myeloma at some point in life. Solitary spinal plasmacytomas are usually found in the thoracic and lumbar spines， more rarely at cervical levels. Like other vertebral masses， solitary plasmacytomas give rise to spinal cord compression， which causes irritative symptoms and deficits. With this case， our objective was to report a rare case of solitary plasmacytoma intraosseous with neurological manifestations neurological for medullary compression.\n\n【2】Keywords： Plasmacytoma； Monoclonal gammopathy； Medullary compression\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Plasma cell neoplasia may present as an isolated lesion (plasmacytoma) or multiple lesions(multiple myeloma) and is characterized by irreversible proliferation of a plasmocyte clone producing a monoclonal immunoglobulin 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Solitary plasmacytoma is a relatively uncommon tumor that， unlike multiple myeloma， has a single proliferative clone of monoclonal plasma cells. It may be extraosseous or intraosseous. Extramedullary plasmacytoma can be found in the airways， oral cavity， gastroenterology， lymphatic system， spleen， vagina， pancreas， parotid gland， thyroid， testis， or breast. The most common site of solitary plasmacytoma is in the spine (50% of cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. We report here a case of solitary spinal plasmacytoma with disabling neurological manifestations in which the diagnosis was made with blood electrophoresis correlated with bone biopsy and imaging.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 65-year-old woman admitted to the inpatient care facility for 4 months with sudden onset low back pain after physical exertion， with worsening low back pain from right lower limb radiating pain accompanied by paresthesia and disabling gait that improves with the supine position. On neurological examination， she was sensitive， attentive， oriented in time and space. Grade 4 muscle strength in the lower limbs and normal in the upper limbs. Deep and normal upper limb reflexes in lower limbs. Deep hypoesthesia with S1 level. Impaired balance and motor coordination in upper limbs， normal motor coordination in upper limbs， and cranial nerve semiology， including fundus without abnormalities. No stiff neck or other signs of meningeal irritation. During the course of the exams， he underwent a sacred lumbar spine CT scan that revealed “an aggressive behavioral lesion occupying soft tissue space eroding S1s body， extending to the left， with 71 mm x 44 mm largest lateral by longitudinal diameter 40 mm larger anterior-posterior diameter， extending to the anterior epidural space， with compression of the sacred roots in the sacred canal associated with partial collapse of the vertebral body S1， related to said osteolytic lesion”. By presenting signs of spinal cord compression due to aggressive single behavior injury， he initiates therapy with dexamethasone 12 mg IV at an initial dose， followed by 4 mg 8/8 h.\n\n【7】There were no abnormalities to be highlighted in the laboratory； notably， anemia and changes in renal or ionic function were absent. In the course of inpatient analysis， protein electrophoresis revealed an IgG Kappa monoconal gammopathy (Kappa Chains 906.2 mg/L) confirmed by immunofixation. The patient underwent bone biopsy and a myelogram that confirmed the presence ofsolid， reticular pattern neoplasia consisting of CD138 and CD56 positive monotonic small cells. In the study of immunoglobulin light chains， the restriction of kappa chains resulted in morphological findings compatible with plasmacytoma. In view of this result， he initiated antalgic radiotherapy(8 sessions of 50 cGy) to improve the motor and sensory deficit due to spinal cord compression associated with bortezomib 2.1 mg SC. A regular two-year follow-up showed the constant absence of neurological signs and symptoms and alaboratory response.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】A solitary bone plasmacytoma is rare tumor， representing 3% to 7% of myelomas.

No more than 5% of patients with plasmacytoma have a solitary bone plasmacytoma. This diagnosis requires criteria ranging from a single area of bone destruction by a plasma cell clone， such as bone marrow with no evidence of plasma cell proliferation， normal findings of other bone sites， the absence of anemia， hypercalcemia， or renal dysfunction attributed to myeloma 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. About 2/3 of patients with solitary bone plasmacytoma will develop multiple myeloma at some point in life， at different times of progression， and may occur even long after plasmacytoma treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\nThe initial age ranges from 33 to 70 years， with an average of46， lower than that of multiple myeloma (59 years). According to published evidence， 2% to 10% of multiple myeloma cases show the typical clinical signs and symptoms of solitary plasmacytoma通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>， and some authors believe that solitary myeloma is simply the first location of a progressing plasma cellular neoplasm， natural for the spread， and then for multiple myeloma. Although the clinical course of multiple myeloma is usually rapid and fatal， patients with plasmacytoma may have a 10-year survival rate of 68%， despite possible disease progression 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.

The diagnosis of solitary myeloma cannot be made with absolute certainty， as it must be distinguished from multiple occult myelomas and must be confirmed by foll ow-up. Solitary spinal plasmacytomas are usually found in the thoracic and lumbar spines and， more rarely， at cervical levels. Like other vertebral masses， solitary plasmacytomas give rise to spinal cord compression，删除1换行which causes irritative symptoms and deficits. Irritative symptoms are pain (root， if nuclear and vertebral) and paresthesias； deficits are motor (due to a peripheral neuron or pyramidal tract injury) and， more rarely， sensory.\n\n【15】The clinical case presented here begins with symptoms of a relapsing-remitting course that worsened with a disabling neurological symptom progression associated with somatic pain. It manifested by low back pain that was refractory to medical treatment， perhaps due to the slow growth of the neoplastic mass and compensatory characteristics of the spinal cord at the lumbar level. The most important part of this case is to define fundamental aspects that characterize the solitary bone plasmacytoma， a rare but well-known entity， considering its evolution in most cases to multiple myeloma， a prognostically dark disease. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis are essential for the diagnosis， as these laboratory parameters are the only ones that can be altered they are also reliable tools for disease monitoring and prognosis. The correct interdisciplinary approach， in this case， based on a clinical， radiological， and immunological examination， allowed operation with a suspected diagnosis of plasmacytoma.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】Solitary plasmacytoma， although rare， should be remembered as a differential diagnosis of other conditions so that the correct treatment can be instituted， with the aim being early disease control and a better survival rate.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In particular current bleeding-sensitive SWI sequences(susceptibility weighted imaging)， with high sensitivity for the magnetic properties of blood， iron and calcifications， have led to a marked increase in sensitivity for the detection of cerebral microbleeds. Radiology is now confronted with the task of providing evidence for the aetiology of these microbleeds on the basis of specific patterns. A common cause of cerebral microbleeds is， for example， hypertension left untreated for many years or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Here， MRI reveals typical patterns of hemorrhaging， with the basal ganglia and the thalamus predominantly being affected in the case of hypertensive microbleeds. The following case report describes the case of a young patient with multiple cerebral microbleeds that are not of the origins mentioned above通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】An 18-year-old male patient was admitted with severe respiratory insufficiency and evidence of pronounced bilateral infiltrates. An exogenous allergic alveolitis was surmised. Cortisone， high-intensity ventilation and repeated placement in the prone position ultimately led to stabilization of the condition. Weaning proved to be difficult. Oxygen denaturation down to 50% occurred， in reaction to which sedation and myorelaxation were induced and the patient had to be intubated. Over the further inpatient course， ventilation deteriorated repeatedly due to secretion obstruction and diffuses pulmonary hemorrhages. Permissive hypercapnia was tolerated. The patient was extubated after a total of 13 days .\n\n【11】Neurologically， flaccid tetraparesis and reduced algesia were seen after extubation， and suspicion of a mild critical illness polyneuropathy was confirmed. In addition， the patient was suffering from hyperreactive delirium. Three days after extubation，the patient’s mood was depressed and he was autonomically impaired， with a tendency to latent hypoventilation and a look of panic. Suspicion of a posttraumatic stress disorder was expressed， but cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cMRI) was performed to exclude a somatic cause. In SWI of the cMRI， multiple bihemispherical hemosiderin deposits were seen， with a predominance in the corpus callosum. The T2-weighted images  showed an accompanying vasogenic edema. In a subsequent neuropsychological examination， impairments in the areas of speech， linguistic divergent thinking， memory and briefly delayed recall were seen， so that a cognitive disorder resulting from a disease， injury or functional disorder of the brain according to ICD-10 [F07.通用删除6(英):<u>8]</u> was assumed.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Chronic hypertension and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are the two most common pathologies responsible for cerebral microbleeds in elderly patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【14】However， other causes should also be taken into consideration， particularly in younger patients. Cerebral microbleeds with a predominance for the corpus callosum have also been described in younger patients with diseases requiring intensive care， such as disseminated intravascular coagulopathy， respiratory failure and viral infections， and in this connection are classified as critical illness-删除1换行associated microbleeds 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>.\n\n【15】The young age of the patient is also to be stressed in the case reported here. Patients aged between 27 and 63 years with similar findings can be found in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【16】There are different theories regarding the aetiology of critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>：\n\n【17】Since hemorrhages caused by high altitudes show a similar distribution pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， it stands to reason that hypoxia might be the point of origin. In most of the cases described， the patients were suffering from respiratory insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-6]</u>， which means that an intermediate hypoxia is probable. Also in the patient described here， denaturation repeatedly occurred over the inpatient course. The hypoxia may， through hydrostatic or chemical effects， lead to a disturbance of the blood-brain barrier and thus enable the escape of erythrocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【18】A further attempt to explain the bleeding is Disseminated Intravascular Coagulopathy (DIC). In previously described cases， it was not always possible to provide information about a possible presence， but there were certainly signs pointing in this direction， such as a thrombocytopenia. However， this is not the case in our patient.\n\n【19】A true causal connection has vet to be established.\n\n【20】The clinical consequences of cerebral microbleeds often remain unnoticed. In a case control study， however， it was indeed shown that they are associated with cognitive dysfunctions 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】The present case presentation shows the diversity of cerebral microbleeds with regard to the distribution pattern and their underlying aetiology. The detection and classification of cerebral microbleeds is an integral part of radiological diagnostics， as therapeutic concepts regarding the aetiology， e.g. in the case of chronic hypertension， result for the patient.

It can involve any segment of the oesophagus， but most often involves the middle third because of its proximity to the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes surrounding the bifurcation of the trachea. Oesophageal tuberculosis is almost always associated with mediastinal lymphadenopathy with or without a trachea-oesophageal fistula 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The symptoms usually depend on the degree and type of oesophageal involvement. Dysphagia is the most common presenting symptom， which occurs in about 90% of the cases and was present in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Other symptoms incude odynophagia， retrosternal chest pain， fever， weight loss and anorexia. Complications include bleeding， perforation， fistula formation， aspiration pneumonia， fatal haematemesis and oesophageal strictures 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. The most common|删除段之间换行|macroscopic finding on gastroscopy is oesophageal ulcer. Other findings include hypertrophic growth as an oesophageal polyp， tumour like lesions， strictures and external compression. The differential diagnosis includes oesophageal carcinoma， crohn’s disease， syphilis and strictures due to ingestion of caustic material. Diagnosis is usually made by gastroscopywith cytological，histological， microbiological examination of tissue biopsy.

The disease progresses rapidly and may be life-threatening. Biologicalagents are essential to Ulcerative Colitis (UC) treatment，nevertheless， the combination of Infliximab (IFX) and Ustekinumab (UST) for ASUC treatment has been rarely reported. We report a case of ASUC complicated by DIC that was successfully treated with a multidisciplinary approach， including two biological agents. To the best of our knowledge， this case was the first reported case of UST combined with IFX for the treatment of ASUC complicated by DIC in China.\n\n【2】Keywords： Ustekinumab； Infliximab； Combined therapy； Acute severe ulcerative colitis； Disseminated intravascular coagulation\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a chronic intestinal inflammatory disease， which typically presents with recurrent diarrhea， bloody stools， tenesmus and abdominal pain. Although UC limits to mild symptoms in the majority of patients， it may lead to life-threatening systemic complications that require urgent intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Around 25% of patients with UC require admission to hospital at some point during their disease course for severe flares of UC 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis(ASUC) is defined bythe modified Truelove and Wits criteria that combine presence ofbloody stools26 times a day with symptoms of systemic toxicity such as temperature≥37.8°C，hemoglobin <10°g/L， erythrocyte sedimentation rate <30 mm/h and/or a pulse rate of ≥ 90 bpm 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The mortality of Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis (ASUC) is about 1%通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation(DIC) is a rare complication in ASUC patients. As an acquired systemic thromboembolic syndrome， DIC is characterized by extensive microthrombosis and secondary fibrinolysis based on severe primary disease， including sepsis， major trauma， pathological obstetrics and others. Once DIC occurs， intestinal injury is aggravated by ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， which will make the condition worse. Clinical investigations have shown that DIC is an independent and controlling prognosticator of organ dysfunction and death 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Patients with ASUC are challenging to treat， especially when complicated by DIC， it is even more difficult for doctors to choose the optimal management. Here， we met an ASUC patient complicated by DIC， who was successfully treated and got through the dangerous period after a multidisciplinary approach， including Ustekinumab (UST) and Infliximab (IFX) combination therapy. To the best of our knowledge， this case was the first reported case of UST combined with IFX for the treatment of ASUC complicated by DIC in China.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nThe patient is a 27-year-old woman with a 12-year history of UC characterized by recurrent episodes of mucous， bloody stools. She had been treated with mesalazine， glucocorticoids， cyclosporine， azathioprine， leukocyte adsorption， and Chinese medicine (oral and suppositories)， nevertheless，her disease relapsed. The patient was admitted to our hospital with a chief complaint of increased bloody stool for 1 week. One week before admission， the patient developed hematochezia attributed to psychological stress. She reported copious hematochezia 6 to 8 times daily， without emesis， abdominal pain， abdominal distension， chest tightness， palpitation， dizziness， sweating， petechiae， or fever. After taking self-prescribed traditional Chinese medicine therapy (treatment unknown)， she presented to our emergency department and was diagnosed with UC and|删除段之间换行|hemorrhagic anemia. Emergency treatment was provided， including somatostatin injection to reduce gastrointestinal blood flow， levofloxacin for potential infections， 1.5 units of leukocyte-reduced red blood cells and nutritional support. An indwelling catheter was placed due to perineal swelling and dysuria. Within 5 h of admission to the emergency department， the patient experienced more than10 bloody stools without apparent abdominal pain， abdominal distension， palpitations， or fever. Hematuria was observed in the urinary drainage bag， accompanied by perineal edema，pain， and fever(maximum temperature 38°C) without chills. Physical examination suggested heart rate 112 times/min， respiratory rate 20 times/min， blood pressure 116/80 mmHg and weight 50.5 kg. There were ecchymoses around the navel， bilateral mid-abdomen and right wrist. The admission diagnoses were UC (chronic， relapsing， severe，active)， lower gastrointestinal bleeding， hematuria， skin ecchymosis， and perineal edema. Her physical examination on the ward was notable for a temperature of 37.2℃， heart rate 124 times/min， respiratory rate20 times/min， and blood pressure 134/92 mmHg. She was awake and alert with anemic， non-icteric skin and no scleral icterus. There was no enlargement of superficial lymph nodes， no filling of the jugular删除1换行vein， clear breath sounds in both lungs， no rales and no pathological murmur. The abdomen was slightly tense， with no tenderness or rebound pain. The liver and spleen were not palpable， and bowel sounds were slightly active. Ecchymosis was observed in the middle and lower abdomen and the right wrist ， with perineal swelling and mild edema of the lowerlimbs. Laboratory examinations from the emergency department were notable for C-Reactive Protein(CRP) 10.08 mg/L， Procalcitonin (PCT) 1.6 ng/ml， White Blood Cell count (WBC) 24.70×10/L， Hemoglobin (Hb) 65 g/L， Platelets(PLT) 666×10/L. Subsequent laboratory examinations revealed CRP 127.07 mg/L， WBC 21.14×10/L， neutrophil ratio 0.837， Hb at 64 g/L， and PLT 85 ×10/L. Serum biochemistries were notable for glutamic-pyruvate transaminase 19 IU/L， total protein 52.1 g/L， albumin 23.8 g/L， total bilirubin 21.5 umol/L， creatinine 58.9 umol/L， and potassium 4.22 mmol/L. Plasma prothrombin time was 21.70sec (normal value 12.70 sec)， international standardized ratio 1.82， activated partial thrombin was 59.20 sec (normal 36.00 sec)，thrombin time was 28.90 sec， fibrinogen was 0.88 g/L， D-dimer was >20， and there was a positive plasma protamine accessory coagulation test. Stool routine analysis revealed 4+ red blood cells and 2+ white blood|删除段之间换行|acute activity， visible crypt abscess， and clinical history consistent with ulcerative colitis.\n\n【7】cells. The day after admission， factor VIII activity was 156%， factor IX activity was 200%， factor XI activity was 84%， factor X activity was54%， antithrombin was 79%， plasminogen activity was 56.00%， von Willebrand factor was 351.00%， factor XII activity was 58%， factor II activity was 71%， factor V activity was 85%，and VII activity was 46%.\n\n【8】Clinical Course\n\nAfter transfer to the Department of Gastroenterology， the patient was treated with first-level nursing and electrocardiographic monitoring. Temporary fasting was recommended. She was given meropenem empirically， octreotide to reduce gastrointestinal blood flow， esomeprazole to inhibit acid reflux and protect the gastric mucosa， albumin and fluid supplementation， and other supportive treatments.The departments of hematology， intensive care， nephrology， cardiology， anesthesiology， and others were consulted. DIC was diagnosed based on signs， symptoms， and laboratory examinations， and the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit(ICU).OnICU admission，blood tumorindicators，autoimmune-related antibodies， Epstein-Barr virus， TROCH (Toxoplasma， Other pathogenic microorganisms， Rubella virus， Cytomegalovirus， Herpes virus)， HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)， HBV (Hepatitis|删除段之间换行|B Virus)， HCV (Hepatitis C Virus infection)， TPHA (Treponema Pallidum Hemagglutination Assay)， T-SPOT (T cell spot detection)， Clostridium difficile， immunoglobulins， complement series， and other indicators were negative. No pathogens were identified on three blood and stool cultures. A chest Computed Tomogram (CT)， echocardiogram，and B-ultrasound of both lower extremities revealed no abnormalities. The patient continued tohavebloody dark red stools about 7 to 8 times a day. ICU laboratories were notable for CRP 108mg/L， PCT 1.87 ng/ml， WBC 23.83×10/L，Hb 45 g/L， and PLT 104x10/L. A stool examination revealed flood， fluid， 3+ white blood cells，4+ red blood cells. The provisional diagnosis was ASUC complicated with intestinal infection. Therefore， the patient was treated with fasting， meropenem， suspended red blood cell transfusion， fresh frozen plasma， fibrinogen， dexamethasone， and other symptomatic treatments. Her coagulation functions returned to normal， her Hb increased to 80 g/L， and the frequency of hematochezia decreased to2 to 3 times a day. Stool quantity diminished， and the color became lighter. One week after admission， she produced bright red bloody stools， accompanied by abdominal pain and distension. Physical examination revealed slight distention of the abdomen and tympany on percussion. Abdominal CT showed dilation of the colon with|删除段之间换行|gas and fluid， and the widest dilation was about 5.5 cm， suggesting intestinal obstruction and toxic megacolon . The patient was treated with fasting， somatostatin， blood transfusion， dexamethasone， antibiotics， rehydration support， and other treatments. The ICU attendings convened a multidisciplinary team discussion. The gastrointestinal surgery department recommended total colectomy because of severe UC with a question of toxic megacolon. The gastroenterology department recommended colonoscopy to guide subsequent decision-making. The ICU department recommended aggressive treatment of ASUC and DIC (which was improving at the time of the meeting)， as per the hematology department， which suggested continuing plasma and fibrinogen infusions. The urology department recommended medical treatment because the patient had no urinary tract obstruction. The nephrology department suggested that the patient’s hematuria was related to a coagulation abnormality. The gynecology department suggested that the vulvar swelling was related to the primary disease and recommended perineal care. The conclusion of the multidisciplinary meeting was to transfer the patient to gastroenterology for colonoscopy， followed by surgery based on the findings. After communicating the meeting’s results with the patient’s family， the patient’s bowel was prepared for endoscopy. Considering the risks of endoscopy and patient tolerance， the endoscope was inserted until reaching 40cm from the anal margin. The intestinal cavity appeared swollen. Diffuse granular changes were observed in the intestinal mucosa， with hyperemia and erosion on the surface， purulent secretions， and blurred vascular texture . Pathological findings included删除1换行she received intravenous UST， a biological agent with high safety and low infection-related risk. The dose of dexamethasone was further reduced to 5 mg， and urinary tract infection was further reduced. Due to the recurrence of hematochezia and diarrhea during the steroid wean， she was deemed glucocorticoid-dependent. After the patient and her family members were informed of the related risks， she was treated with IFX and dexamethasone. The patient complained of no diarrhea， hematochezia， abdominal pain， abdominal distension， frequency of urination， the urgency of urination， pain of urination， and was discharged on medications.\n\n【10】After discharge， the patient was treated with IFX and UST通用删除1(英):<u>(drug records of ASUC treatment with dual biologics are shown in Figure 5)</u>. Repeat colonoscopy suggested UC E3， MES at one point. Pathological analysis revealed reduced crypt structures with moderate infiltration of lymphocytes， plasma cells， and a small number of eosinophils in the stroma. No crypt abscesses or granulomatous nodules were observed . The patient had no hematochezia or abdominal pain at this point. After that， she received injections of UST. Her symptoms were well controlled，and there was no hematochezia， abdominal pain， frequency of urination， urgency， or other complaints.ESR， CRP， WBC， stool routine， and coagulation functions were within the normal ranges. An abdominal CT revealed no abnormalities .\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】UC is a group of chronic non-specific intestinal inflammatory diseases caused by genetics， immunity，the environment，and intestinal flora. ASUC is characterized by rapid onset， rapid progression， and poor outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. ASUC is often accompanied by a rapid pulse， hypotension， diarrhea， hematochezia， abdominal distension， and other symptoms. ASUC-related inflammation often involves the删除1换行entire colon. Colonic dilation is a severe complication of ASUC， and toxic megacolon， intestinal perforation， and other emergencies may occur 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Our patient's condition was protracted and characterized by a long course. Hematochezia and abdominal distension were accompanied by fever， rapid pulse， and slight abdominal muscle tension. The trigger of mental stress was consistent with the characteristics of the ASUC disease. DIC， intestinal obstruction， and toxic megacolon often occur， and the disease progresses rapidly. DIC is an acquired systemic thrombotic hemorrhage syndrome characterized byy extensive I microthrombosis and secondary fibrinolysis based on severe primary diseases，including sepsis， major trauma or surgery， pathological obstetrics， and others. Most DIC cases are characterized by acute onset， complex diseases， and rapid progression. The precise etiology is challenging to diagnose， and poor outcomes include death. DIC is rare in UC patients. Currently， a few cases report on ASUC and DIC speculated that colon vascular endothelial injury might be an important cause of DIC in UC patients. Our patient had hematochezia， severe diarrhea， bruises， petechiae， and hematuria. Laboratory examinations suggested DIC， prompting her transfer to the ICU. Following appropriate treatment， her coagulation functions returned to normal. This case highlights the importance of timely coagulation and fibrinolytic tests in patients with active UC.\n\n【13】Patients with ASUC are challenging to treat， and improper treatment may be life-threatening. Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) recommend glucocorticoids as the first treatment choice for ASUC. However， conversion therapy should beconsideredwhen patients fail to respond72 h after intravenous therapy with adequate doses of intravenous glucocorticoids.Conversion therapy includes medications and surgery. In our patient’s case， ASUC was accompanied by colon删除1换行dilation and potential toxic megacolon； and the poor response to glucocorticoids prompted treatment with conversion biologic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Colonoscopy is not absolutely contraindicated in ASUC and is helpful to evaluate intestinal inflammation after weighing the advantages and disadvantages. In our patient’s case， the risk of endoscopy and patient tolerance after bowel preparation led us to perform endoscopy only 40 cm from the anal margin； nevertheless， the procedure was crucial for evaluating the patient’s intestinal inflammation. We were able to obtain several mucosal biopsies. The multidisciplinary joint diagnosis and treatment model integrates resources and helps ASUC patients obtain optimal treatment. Although surgery was recommended， the patient and her family refused in favor of medical treatment. The combination of UST and IFX was selected under the premise of sufficient guarantee from the patient and the IBD MDT team. The glucocorticoid was weaned off， and the patient’s condition was carefully monitored. The putative urinary tract infection was controlled， and hematochezia， diarrhea， and other symptoms were relieved. Colonoscopy and imaging findings significantly improved after treatment， which successfully preserving the patient's colon and significantly improving her quality of life. In recent years， biologics have played an essential role in the treatment of IBD， among which anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-a (anti-TNF-a) is the most critical biologic. Anti-TNF-amonoclonal antibodies such as IFX are traditional biological agents for IBD treatment， and they have outstanding efficacy for treating refractory Crohn’s Disease (CD) and severe UC 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. UST is a relatively new biological agent that is an antagonist of Interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 P40 subunit. IL-12 and IL-23 are involved in the pathogenesis of UC by activating innate immunity and adaptive immune proliferation. UST acts on the P40subunit shared by IL-12 and IL-23 to inhibit inflammatory responses通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Vedolizumab (VDZ) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that explicitly recognizes a4B7 integrin receptors on lymphocytes and blocks migration from blood to the intestinal mucosa， thereby reducing the inflow of white blood cells into inflammatory tissues. VDZ has a unique intestinal selection effect and few side effects通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. During ASUC treatment， it is necessary to control intestinal inflammation rapidly. The failure of single-drug therapy is a life-threatening event that constitutes an indication for surgery. Our patient developed glucocorticoid dependence during single-drug therapy with UST， and IFX was subsequently added. Although the safety and efficacy of biologics combined with immunomodulators have been confirmed， there are few reports of the combined use of dual biologics in treatable severe UC in China. There is no high-quality evidence regarding whether biologics can be used in tandem or which patients would benefit the most. Our case highlights the importance of exploring therapeutic strategies to control inflammation rapidly.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge， this case was the first reported case of UST combined with IFX for the treatment of ASUC complicated by DIC in China. There are only a few reported cases of dual biological agents combined with IBD in other countries. Clara et al. reported using UST combined with IFX in a 56-year-old patient with total colonic UC with psoriasis， whose intestinal inflammation was relieved after treatment； however， the psoriasis treatment was ineffective， and no significant adverse drug reactions were observed during 21 months of follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Afzali et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> reported VDZ combined with adalimumab to treat severe recurrent CD， which achieved an excellent therapeutic effect， and the patient's intestinal mucosa healed substantially. Olbjorn et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> reported that UST combined with VDZ and IFX combined with UST in children with|删除段之间换行|CD or UC had good clinical efficacy and no evident adverse drug reactions. The authors found that patients with moderate to severe IBD who failed to respond to anti-TNF agents or experienced side effects such as psoriasis may benefit from combining anti-TNF with another biologic agent with a different mode of action without severe adverse events. Studies showed that UST has good efficacy against TNF-induced psoriasis and psoriasis-like alopecia in patients with IBD， and biologic drug combination therapy is well tolerated 通用删除6(英):<u>[1618]</u>. When treating IBD with UST or VDZ， combination therapy with immunosuppressants is not recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Buer et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> found no significant adverse events in IBD patients treated with IFX and VDZ in combination with prospective follow-up for at least 12months， with good clinical efficacy. Eight of their patients achieved clinical remission， and anti-TNF-a therapy was discontinued. Two of four patients with CD required combination therapy during follow-up to achieve sustained remission. Biscaglia et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> suggested that VDZ combined with UST showed promising efficacy in treating CD with small bowel stenosis， and all patients achieved complete clinical remission， with an effectively reduced risk of surgery. Other studies found that UST combined with VDZ significantly benefited patients with severe ileocolonic CD 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. These studies suggest that biological agents can inhibit two or more inflammatory cytokines in IBD patients. The treatment of refractory IBD requires synergy， and combination therapy appears to be safe and well tolerated. Short-term double biological therapy may be a reasonable treatment option tor resistant UC.\n\n【15】In conclusion， ASUC with DIC is extremely rare and requires a multidisciplinary approach for diagnosis and treatment. Biological agents are essential for conversion therapy. In our case， UST with IFX was used to treat ASUC successfully. Nevertheless， data on the efficacy and safety of dual biologics combined with ASUC treatment remain limited， and specific findings need to be confirmed in future clinical trials.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Their annual incidence is less than 5 cases per100，000 inhabitants 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【4】NETs are classified as non-functional or functional tumors. The latter have a better prognosis and are associated to hormonal syndromes. Their clinical presentation can be characterized by non-specific symptoms， such as diarrhea， weight-loss， hypoglycemia， rectal bleeding， or can be related to the carcinoid syndrome， characterized by diarrhea， flushing and wheezing/asthma-like symptoms. Manifestations of non-functional tumors are mainly related to compression of neighboring anatomical structures 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. Because of their non-specific symptoms， NET's are initially misdiagnosed. In about 13% of patients diagnosed with GEP-NEN， the primary site is unknown and the 6BGallium-DOTATOC PET/CT represent the gold standard imaging test for the identification of tumor sites 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.

Infectious and malabsorption causes of diarrhea were excluded by microbiological examination， immunoassay for coeliac disease， elastase， chymotrypsin and chemical examination of feces. Because of RA， corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 4 mg daily) were administered and contributed partially to a reduction in the number of diarrheal discharges. While in treatment with steroids， a flushing was observed.\n\n【8】Table 1： Laboratory findings at the hospital admission.\n\n| Test  | Value  | Normal Value  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Red blood cell (106/uL)  | 4.17  | 4.2-5.5  |\n| Hb (g/dL)  | 11.8  | 12-18  |\n| Ht(%)  | 35.9  | 34.7  |\n| MCV (FI)  | 86.1  | 80-99  |\n| White blood cell (10/L)  | 8.79  | 04-11  |\n| Neutrophil (%)  | 42.8  | 40-74  |\n| Lymphocyte (%)  | 25.7  | 20-48  |\n| Monocyte(%)  | 17.9  | 03-11  |\n| Eosinophil(%)  | 12.3  | 0-8  |\n| Basophil (%)  | 1.3  | 0-1.5  |\n| Platelets (10/uL)  | 254  | 150-450  |\n| Urea (mg/dL)  | 71  | 10-71  |\n| Creatinine (mg/dL)  | 1.76  | 0.67-1.17  |\n| Sodium (mg/dL)  | 139  | 132-146  |\n| Potassium(mg/dL)  | 4.53  | 3.7-5.4  |\n| Calcium (mg/dL)  | 9.11  | 8.6-10.2  |\n| Aspartate-Aminotransferase (U/L)  | 20  | 0-37  |\n| Alanine transaminase (U/L)  | 12  | 0-41  |\n| Lipase (U/L)  | 37  | 13-60  |\n| Amylase(U/L)  | 89  | 28-10  |\n| Bilirubin (mg/dL)  | 0.81  | <1.2  |\n| Albumin (g/dL)  | 3.4  | 3.5-5.2  |\n| Alkaline Phosphatase (U/L)  | 90  | 40-129  |\n| GGT (U/L)  | 39  | 0-61  |\n| Iron (ug/dL)  | 49  | 59-150  |\n| Ferritin (ng/mL)  | 443  | 30-400  |\n| C-reactive protein (mg/L)  | 13.42  | c5  |\n| TSH (mlU/L)  | 0.65  | 0.27-4.2  |\n| Activated partial thromboplastin time (sec)  | 28  | 24-36  |\n| Prothrombin time (PT)/ PT ratio (INR) (sec)  | 1.22  | 0.8-1.2  |\n| Cromogranine A (mcg/L)  | 913  | <100  |\n\n【10】Laboratory findings at the hospital admission and during hospitalization\n\n【11】To investigate a possible Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)， colonoscopy with biopsy was performed： At the sigma level， eosinophilic infiltrate in the lamina propria was revealed， suggesting non-specific inactive colitis. An entero-CT didnt reveal an upper localization of IBD. Tumor markers (CA 19-9， CEA， CA 125， and NSE) were not significant for neoplastic disease. TSH， FT3-FT4 was within the normal range.\n\nRuled out the most common causes of chronic diarrhea， NETs were considered. Wetested theblood levels ofChromogranin A(CgA)， which was significantly increased (913 mcg/L， NV <101.9 mcg/L). A|删除段之间换行|CT abdomen without contrast medium at the hospital admission depicting micracalcification of the hooked-tail process of the pancreas (red square).

Calcitonin， anti-Thyroperoxidase (TPO)，anti- Thyrotropin Receptor(TSH-R)， anti-Thyroglobulin (Tg) were normal. The thyroid echo showed an uneven consistency and nodular architecture. The needle aspiration of the nodular lesions showed thyrocytes aggregated in flaps and nodules， excluding overt abnormalities.\n\n【13】Therefore， thesuspicion ofNETs couldn't be confirmed. Urinewas collected during 24 h after an amine-free diet to search for 5-Hydroxy Indolacetic Acid (5-HIIA)， metanephrines， normetanephrines， catecholamines， homovanillic and vanillylmandelic acids， but the results were within the normal range.\n\n【14】Despite inconclusive urine tests and imaging， the diarrhea features strongly made us suspect a GEP-NEN. We decided to proceed further in the diagnostic ITER with 5BGallium-DOTATOC PET/CT test. This exam reported a 9-mm nodule in the peripancreatic adipose tissue， with elevated receptor expression for SSTR2-5 . This finding allowed us to make diagnosis of\"Atypical Carcinoid Syndrome” given by NET 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【15】Once the diagnosis was defined， the patient started a treatment with the long-acting somatostatin analogue -Lanreotide- and he was admitted to evaluation for a surgical radical approach.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】NETs are a heterogeneous group of rare tumors， comprising less than 2% of all malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Neuroendocrine cells are distributed among multiple organs， so that the central nervou system， respiratory tract， Gastrointestinal (GI) tract， thyroid， and urogenital system may be involved. NET may be asymptomatic or may manifest themselves by secretion of either a peptide hormone or biogenic amine and， depending on that， they are classified in non-functional or functional NET， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. So， because of their non-specific clinical presentation， a diagnostic delay often leads to discover an already metastasizing disease， no longer susceptible to surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Commonly， first level investigations for NETs include imaging and biochemical tumor markers： Serum CgA and5-HIAA 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. According to the current guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， the presence of symptoms， high serum levels of CgA and urinary 5-HIAA define the “Typical Carcinoid Syndrome； on the contrary， symptoms， high serum levels of CgA， despite negative urinary 5-HIAA， define the“Atypical Carcinoid Syndrome.\n\n【18】Gallium-DOTATOC PET/CT showing a 9 mm tissue formation located in the adipose space between the body of the pancreas and the cardias， with elevated receptar expressian for SSTR2-5.

Albishi et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> described appendicitis and intestinal obstruction as acute manifestation of GEP-NEN.\n\n【19】Our case-report mentions watery diarrhea alone as apredominant clinical manifestation of GEP-NEN. Approximately 20% of patients with NETs develop carcinoid syndrome， characterized by flushing and diarrhea. In different cases， diarrhea has a multifactorial origin. In the review of Khan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>， analyzing 44 case series of GEP-NEN， diarrhea was due to both NETs both to pancreatic enzyme insufficiency and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.\n\n【20】In front of a suspicion of diarrhea caused by GEP-NEN， biochemical and first level-instrumental investigations (colonoscopy， abdominal-CT or RMI) allow to reach the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. When the primary site tumor remains unknown， the 6BGallium-DOTATOC PET/CT represents the gold standard imaging test 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【21】In our case-report the diagnosis was made by the 6Gallium-DOTATOC PET/CT， only performed on the basis of the clinical suspicious， despite the absence of first level investigations compatible with the diagnosis of GEP-NEN. Up to date， to the best of our knowledge， no other similar case-reports have been reported.\n\n【22】Our patient was affected by RA. This was the first confusing element in the diagnostic flow-chart： Diarrhea was initially referred to an inflammatory discomfort； the episodes of facial-neck flushing were adscripted to the steroidal therapy that also induced the remission of itching. The slight eosinophilia relieved spontaneously in three days. Moreover， the various instrumental investigations did not reveal the presence of nodules and/or masses together with the negativity of tumor markers. The hospitalization and the refractoriness to the different treatments led us to strongly suspect a neuroendocrine origin of the patient's syndrome.\n\n【23】The first diagnostic element was the CgA assay， found to be significantly increased (913 mcg/L， NV <101.9 mcg/L). CgA assay is considered as weak marker of NETs： It may be elevated in multiple conditions， such inflammatory diseases and can be increased by proton pump inhibitors. CgA usually correlates with tumor burden and its value over 200 pg/L is often associated to a bad prognosis通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Therefore， caution should be applied in making diagnosis of NETs only by the interpretation of CgA high serum level 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. On the contrary， urinary 5-HIAA is a highly specific marker， albeit with lower sensitivity compared to CgA. Recent studies demonstrate that urinary 5-HIAA becomes elevated only at late disease stages， when metastases have already occurred 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Since in our case it could have been an early stage of NET， the negativity of 5-HIAA didn't prevent us from continuing the investigation.\n\n【24】We focused only on the clinical elements exhibited by our patient， considering that probablythe intermittent diarrhea was due topushed releases of hormones and that the absence of specific NETs markers could be related to the temporary tumor inactivity 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. We made a definite diagnosis bythe 5-Gallium DOTATOC PET/CT scan， which reported a tissue nodule with elevated SSTR2-5 receptor expression.\n\n【25】Therefore， according with current guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， we made diagnosis of atypical carcinoid syndrome caused by a GEP-NEN， characterized by watery diarrhea， flushing and negativity for specific NET markers.\n\n【26】In our case report， an early diagnosis allowed our patient to be treated for his syndrome， achieving an improvement in his quality of life， allowing him to recover definitively by a surgery treatment.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】Making an early diagnosis of NET represents a challenge for the Internist. In front of a suspicion of diarrhea caused by NET，删除1换行biochemical and first level- instrumental investigations allow to discover the primary site of the tumor in most of the cases. When the primary tumor remains unknown， the 5-Gallium DOTATOC PET/CT represent the gold standard test. In the presence of a strong clinical suspicion and symptoms suggestive of NET， negative preliminary investigations should not stop the diagnostic process. Instead， the clinical work-up should continue by designing a second-line investigation approach.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

During the follow-up， a 31-year-old woman belonging to the 400 mg/m²Lomustine cohort evolved with neuromuscular complications 6 months after AHSCT. Initially， she experienced diffuse pain， mainly proximal weakness in thelower limbs； however， it got worse 10 days after vaccine protocol application. She evolved with rapidly ascending motor worsening， decreased ability to walk， foot paresthesia， binocular diplopia， areflexia， bulbar and dysautonomic symptoms such as sweating， tachycardia and postural hypotension. She experienced syncope episodes 72 h before being referred to intensive care unit at HU-UFJF.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Lymphoma is a prevalent lymphoid tissue malignancy type which is seldom associated with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). It is more prevalent in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases than in Hodgkin ones. The peripheral nervous system is mostlyaffected by GBS. Neurological manifestations overall do not often emerge until advanced disease stages. Neurological abnormalities are attributed to nerve invasion， radiotherapy and chemotherapy side effects， compression by mass or paraneoplastic syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【4】GBS is a rare autoimmune polyradiculopathy featured by acute areflexic motor paralysis， as well as by different sensory impairment degrees， according to which the immune system attacks Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. GBS is associated with previous infections in several cases； however， nowadays， most cases present other etiologies， such as vaccines and hematological malignancy通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【5】The Hematology Service at the University Hospital of Federal University of Juiz de Fora (HU UFJF)/Brazil carried out a research project focused on evaluating the effectiveness and toxicity of progressive Lomustine doses， applied in association with Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide， in an Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) conditioning regimen adopted for lymphoma patients. This phase-1 study was based on the traditional 3+3 design and focused on determining the maximum tolerated Lomustine dose administered at D-5. Etoposide was also administered (1 gr/m) at D-5 as part of the conditioning regimen； it was followed by Cyclophosphamide (2 g/m²) application for 3 days (D-4，-3 and-2)， along with the corresponding MESNA dose 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Federal University of Juiz de Fora-Brazil-under CAEE number： 16011019.7.0000.5133， in 2019.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】During the follow-up， a 31-year-old woman belonging to the 400 mg/m’Lomustine cohort evolved with neuromuscular complication 6 months after AHSCT. In 2018， the aforementioned patient was diagnosed with diffuse non-Hodgkin large B-cell lymphoma rich in T lymphocytes -stage IV B， which was associated with the following comorbidities： Grade-1 obesity，non-alcoholic fatty hepatitis， hypertension and generalized anxiety disorder. The first-line treatment comprised 8R-CHOP cycles； however， after relapse， the patient underwent salvage chemotherapy with DHAP in February 2020. Enhanced IF-FDG-PET/CT Deauville 3 has shown full remission， and AHSCT was performed in May 2020. During the hospitalization period， there were no grade 3 or 4 adverse events based on the CTCAE criteria version 5 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The patient only presented febrile neutropenia，删除表格换行which was treated by following the institutional protocol. Neutrophil engraftment took place at D+9， whereas platelet engraftment at D+11. In October 2020， she started experiencing diffuse pain， mainly proximal weakness in the lower limbs， with progressive worsening. She has subjected to electroneuromyography and results indicated myopathy without signs of cell membrane irritation and CPK dosage was 1.623 UI/L but went back to normal levels within 30 days. The post-transplant vaccine protocol was implemented on November20h； it comprised the following vaccines： Inactivated Polio Vaccine(IPV)， MMR-meningococcal type C (first dose)， Pneumococcal 13， Influenza and Hemophilus Influenza (first dose). Approximately 10days after taking the vaccines， she evolved with rapidly ascending motorworsening， decreased abilityto walk， foot paresthesia， binocular diplopia and bulbar symptoms (dysphagia for liquids， slurred speech and drooling) without fever. She presented dysautonomic symptoms such as sweating，tachycardia and postural hypotension with syncope episodes 72 h before hospitalization， which was followed to the intensive care unit at HU-UFJF. Two days later the patient presented with respiratory failure and was subjected to mechanical ventilation； vasoactive drugs were administered due to severe hypotension. Based on diagnostic criteria， Guillain-Barre Syndrome was the most likely diagnosis after the exclusion of other causes， such as recent viral illnesses. Lumbar puncture was performed， and her Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) presented normal results； other laboratory exams， such as SARS-CoV-2， did not show any factor capable of triggering an autoimmune response. Laboratory tests conducted at hospitalization time have evidencedcompromisedkidney function， mild hyponatremia， as well as elevated inflammatory markers and liver enzyme levels. Due to obesity and diabetes， as recently diagnosed， the patient presented changes in liver function before AHSCT . ECG has only shown sinus tachycardia， although echocardiogram results were normal. She underwent plasmapheresis and supportive therapies， which enabled motor symptoms remission.\n\n| Tests results (reference values  | Hospital Admission  | HospitalDischarge  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Creatinine (0.6-1.2 mg/dl)  | 1.9  | 0.83  |\n| Urea (16-40 mg/dl)  | 160  | 106  |\n| Glucose (60-99 mg/dl)  | 219  | 83  |\n| Sodium (135-145 mmol/L)  | 131  | 133  |\n| Potassium (3.5-5.5 mmol/L)  | 5.4  | 4.7  |\n| Magnesium(1.7-2.6mg/dl)  | 2.6  | 2.4  |\n| lonic Calcium (4.6-5.4mg/dl)  | 4.9  | 4.6  |\n| Troponin (<0.4 ng/ml)  | 0.013  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> |\n| Oxylacetic transaminase (5-40 UI/L)  | 157  | 63  |\n| Aspartate aminotransferase (7-56 UI/L)  | 152  | 67  |\n| Alkaline Phosphatase (35-104 UI/L)  | 1018  | 168  |\n| GGT (7-32 UI/L)  | 1131  | 690  |\n| Creatine phosphokinase (33-211 UI/L)  | 430  | 76  |\n| Lactate (10.8-18.9 mg/dl)  | 18  | -  |\n| Hemoglobin  | 9.59  | 10.7  |\n| Leucometry global/Metamyelocytes/ neutrophils  | 9440/94/7269  | 6500/0/2730  |\n| Platelet  | 160000  | 162000  |\n| Ultrasensitive PCR (VR<1 mg/dl)  | 16  | 5  |\n\nThe patient still presented with proximal muscle weakness (grade|删除段之间换行|2) and global areflexia at hospital discharge. She was reassessed in the outpatient clinic in March 2021 and presented gait recovery， although she complained about chronic fatigue and weight gain. Her muscle strength went back to the normal level (grade 5)， except for proximal grade 4 in the lower limbs and persistent global areflexia. The FACT/GOG-Ntx questionnaire version 4 (quality of life and functionality indicator including post-chemotherapy neurotoxicity)通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， duly licensed， was applied during outpatient assessment； the patient recorded a final score of 60% referring to impairment in physical， social， family， emotional and functional well-being. After the last 'F-FDG-PET/CT was performed， in August 2020， Deauville2 ruled out post-transplant recurrence as the likely cause of acute neuropathy.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】The patient had mild myopathy probably as a chemotherapy consequence. However， her evolution suggests the incidence of severe， although rare， complication after AHSCT， which may be associated with the reaction to the Influenza vaccine. It is known that lymphoma can trigger neurological manifestations and that it can emerge at any disease stage； however， F-FDG-PET/CT ruled out lymphoma recurrence. Increased protein concentrations in CSF， along with moderate cellularity increases， support the GBS， although it could be normal 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. No case of severe neurological toxicity caused by Lomustine， or even by Etoposide or Cyclophosphamide， was found in the literature， although it presented reports about neurotoxic effects of influenza vaccines， such as GBS and Giant Cell Arteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【12】GBS incidence after influenza vaccination was first reported in1976 during a national vaccination program against the swine flu pandemic in the United States. Approximately 40 million people were inoculated with influenza A vaccine (influenza A vaccine， in New Jersey) during the pandemic； GBS incidence has increased by8 times after this event (mainly at 2 to 3 weeks， or even more， after vaccination)通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Since then，studies have been conducted，and some of them have shown a small increase in the risk of GBS after inoculation with both the seasonal and 2009H1N1 monovalent influenza vaccines通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The biological mechanism of GBS after influenza vaccination may involve synergistic effects of endotoxins and vaccine-induced autoimmunity 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. Juurlink have investigated GBS association with influenza vaccines administered in Canada from 1992 to 2004； based on a self-controlled case series design， they found a small， although significantly increased， risk of GBS emergence within 6 weeks after influenza vaccination (Relative Risk [RR] 1.45； 95% Confidence Interval [CI]， 1.05-1.99). Based on this evidence， the estimated risk of1 additional GBS case per 1 million vaccinated persons was disclosed to the public and included in recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices， as well as in influenza vaccine Information Statements 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>， which was likely what happened in the case addressed herein.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The MR entography findings were several stenosis of the terminal ileum with up-stream dilatations and3 foreign bodies inside . Routine blood examination revealed chronic anemia and ipoalbuminemia.\n\n【15】A multidisciplinary evaluation suggested to surgically explore the patient. At laparotomy we found 4 stenosis in the distal ileus inside the Michelassi's strictureplasty (1 at the inlet， 2 in the middle and 1 at the outlet just beside the ileocecal anastomosis). Three foreign bodies were found between the stenosis. We performed 2 enterotomies to remove the bodies， which appeared to be bezoars， probably developed between the stenosis for the stasis due to the bowel obstruction . Through the same enterotomies we performed 2 strictureplasties according to Heineke-Mikulicz technique for the stenosis at the inlet and at the outlet of the stricturoplasty. The 2 stenosis in the middle were treated by a strictureplasty according to Finney technique. The Heineke-Mikulicz stricturoplasties were done by a 2 layer non-continuous suture (PDS 4/0).

Ewing's sarcoma typically involves the bony structures in adolescents and young adults. Extra skeletal sarcoma is a rare， aggressive， malignant soft tissue tumor with high recurrence rate. Ewing’s sarcoma Breast is a rare entity with less than 1% cases reported in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. To the best of our knowledge only 16 cases of extra skeletal Ewing's sarcoma has been reported in literature worldwide删除1换行india.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A fifty-five-year-old lady was referred to our institute with history of gradual onset painless breast lump for 1 year. Diagnostic ultrasound of bilateral breast identified a cystic lesion measuring1.8 cm ×1.5 cm in lower inner quadrant of right breast. She underwent diagnostic excisional biopsy outside which showed malignant small round cell tumor. Margins were not commented upon. Microscopic review was done which showed malignant round cell tumor with open chromatin with inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitosis was >10/10 hpf. Tumor cell showed focal positivity for CD99， Synaptophysin， S100， BCL2 FL1 and ki-67 (30% to 35%). Post-excisional biopsy whole body 18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography showed no residual uptake with no evidence of metastatic disease elsewhere. Blocks review showed a malignant round cell tumor in sheet and nodules with immunopositivity for NKX2.2 and MIC2 and features consistent with Ewing Sarcoma. Case was discussed in MDT and planned for breast conservation surgery (Rewide local excision) followed by adjuvant therapy in view of unknown margin status. Patient underwent a wide local excision of right breast and followed by adjuvant chemotherapy of 18 weekly VAC regimen.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Ewing's sarcoma or PNET belongs to a group of rare malignant neoplasm with blue round cell morphology commonly occurring in adolescent and younger age group. Primary PNETs have a predilection for the truncal and axial soft tissue， including the chest wall (Askin tumor)， extremities and the paravertebral region 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. More than 85% of Ewing's sarcoma is characterized删除1换行by the presence of the typical translocation t (11；22) (q24； q12) and immunophenotyping further establish the diagnosis of EWS/PNET which shows positivity for vimentin， Fli-1 and CD99 (Mic-2) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Majority of patients with ES/PNET belongs to age group of 10 to 20years. Several studies of adult EWS from Memorial Sloan Kettering， Royal Marsden have reported a median age of 24 to 27 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. However， our patient presented in the unusual age of 55 years. Ewing sarcoma presenting as a primary breast lesion in older age group删除1换行is very rare and poses a diagnostic dilemma. Differential diagnosis includes fibroadenoma， phyllodes tumor， carcinoma. Findings from ultra-sonography and mammography may vary. Similar cases in the literature have been reported and initially misdiagnosed as fibroadenoma， phylodes tumor and mammary carcinoma. This diagnostic dilemma delays the treatment. In our patient a cystic mass with iso to hyperechoic content was initially identified on USG and was misdiagnosed as cystic lesion and therefore considered as benign. Excisional biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of small round cell tumor. Immunohistochemistry results further supplemented the diagnosis. This collective unusual presentation of site， age delays the diagnosis and hence the treatment. ES/PNET are aggressive tumor with high incidence of local recurrence and distant metastasis. Multi-modality treatment including local control with R0 resection followed by adjuvant systemic treatment is advised. Systemic chemotherapy improves the 5-year survival rate in localized PNET from 10% to 65% by preventing micrometastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. EWS/PNET of the breast is extremely rare. Sixteen cases of Ewing’s sarcoma breast have been reported in literature to the best of our knowledge and had been managed by multimodality approach offering both breast conservation surgery and mastectomy. Out of 16 reported cases， three cases underwent mastectomy， followed by systemic chemotherapy in two cases. Seven cases underwent wide local excision/breast conservation surgery， followed by systemic chemotherapy in three\n\n【10】Table 1： Summary of previous reported cases.\n\n| S.NO  | CASE REPORT  | AGE  | PRESENTATION  | SIZE  | TREATMENT  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1.  | Tamura et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>  | 47  | LUMP  | 2.1x1.8  | MASTECTOMY  |\n| 2.  | Maxwell et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>  | 35  | LUMP  | 1.8  | LUMPECTOMY+ CHEMOTHERAPY  |\n| 3.  | da Silva et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>  | 35  | LUMP  | 12x7.5  | CT+RT  |\n| 4.  | Ko et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>  | 36  | LUMP  | 2.5×2  | LUMPECTOMY  |\n| 5.  | Vindal and Kakkar 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>  | 26  | LUMP  | 3x2  | WLE+CT  |\n| 6.  | Kwak et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>  | 49  | AXILLARY MASS  |  | CT  |\n| 7.  | Dhingra et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>  | 26  | LUMP  | 3.5x3  | WLE  |\n| 8.  | Suebwong et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>  | 46  | LUMP  | 4  | CT+RT  |\n| 9.  | Majid et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>  | 30  | LUMP  | 7-RIGHT， 5-LEFT  | CT  |\n| 10.  | Mahajan et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>  | 50  | LUMP  | 10x14  | MASTECTOMY+CT  |\n| 11.  | Ranade et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>  | 61  | LUMP  | 6x6  | CT+RT  |\n| 12.  | Meddeb et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>  | 43  | LUMP  | 3cm  | Breast Conservation Surgery +CT  |\n| 13  | Kim et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>  | 35  | Recurrent lump  | 2x2cm  | MRM+CT+RT  |\n| 14  | Popli et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>  | 14  | lump  | 9.5x7x5  | WLE  |\n| 15  | Srivastava et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>  | 25  | lump  | 11.6 cm x 9.2 cm x6 cm  | NACT+WLE  |\n| 16  | Ikhwan et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>  | 33  | Metastatic  |  | CTX  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【12】cases and NACT in one case.

So far in the literature no definite treatment of breast Ewing's sarcoma has been mentioned. Role of radiation therapy in the treatment of PNET is unclear， however it can combine with surgery to achieve local control. If a margin negative resection is achievable then breast conservation surgery (Wide local excision) is equivalent to mastectomy. Our reported case was managed with breast conservation surgery followed by adjuvant treatment. On follow-up patient remained disease free. Our case has shown that small tumors with good breast volume can be managed with breast conservation surgery and similar results can be achieved as mastectomy followed by adjuvant treatment.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Rarity of Primary breast Ewing's sarcoma poses a diagnostic dilemma and hence the treatment.

His blood culture came back positive for Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Urinalysis was unremarkable. His chest X-ray showed no infiltrates， with no cardiomegaly or pleural effusion. Electrocardiography (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm，QT/QRS/PRintervals were within normal limit， with no evidence ST segment changes. Splenic infarction was noted on Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of abdomen. A transthoracic echocardiography showed evidence of moderate to severe mitral valve insufficiency， with mitral valve vegetation on the mid leaflet， measured 1.9 cm x0.9 cm， and another vegetation noted on the mitral valve's posterior leaflet， measured 0.6 cm x 0.4 cm .\n\n| Laboratory data  | Values  | Normal values  | Laboratory data  | Value  | Normal values  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBC  | 8.2K/ul  | 4-10 k/ul  | Serum creatinine  | 0.77 mg/dl  | 0.6-1.1 mg/dl  |\n| HGB  | 12.6 gm/dl  | 14-17 gm/ul  | BUN  | 5 mg/dl  | 5-25 mg/dl  |\n| Platelet  | 584 k/ul  | 15-35k/ul  | ESR  | 74 mm/hr  | 0-22 mm/hr  |\n| AST  | 28 IUA  | 10-40U/  | CRP  | 18 mg/dl  | <3 mg/dl  |\n| ALT  | 82 IU/  | 10-60U/  | TSH  | 2.381u/Ml  | 0.5-5u/MI  |\n| Lactic acid  | 1.4 mmo/l  |  |  |  |  |\n| Procalcitonin  | 4.32 ng/ml  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【9】with mobile mass consistent with vegetation.\n\n【10】The patient was started on intravenous ceftriaxone. Afterward， he underwent emergent mechanical mitral valve replacement. The mitral valve cultures were positive for Haemophilus parainfluenzae. He finished six weeks course of intravenous ceftriaxone. Repeat blood cultures were negative. On follow up care after the surgery， patient was asymptomatic. Follow up 2-D echocardiogram showed ejection fraction 60%， with normal functioning of the mechanical mitral valve， with no evidence of vegetations.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Haemophilus parainfluenzae is a Gram negative coccobacillus that is found in the normal flora of the oropharynx. It is of part of multiple organisms collectively known as HACEK， including Haemophilus parainfluenzae， H. influenza， H. aphrophilus， H. paraphrophilus， Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans， Cardiobacterium hominis， Eikenella corrodens， and Kingella spp. Common features of the HACEK group are frequent colonization of the oropharynx， slow growth， and enhanced growth in the presence of carbon dioxide. Therefore， these organisms might not be detected in routine blood cultures 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【13】Overall， HACEK microorganisms responsible for 1% to 3% of all infective endocarditis cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>， usually found in patients with poor dentition， and in those with preexisting valvular lesions.

In Our case， the patient was found to have a vegetation of 1.9cmx0.9删除1换行cm at its largest point， with evidence of distant embolization noted as splenic infarct.\n\n【14】The typical clinical pattern of H. parainfluenzae is that of a subacute endocarditis， developing after dental procedures in patients with preexisting valvular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In our patient， the progression of infective endocarditis was over a week， with symptoms consistent with ill-defined malaise and feeling febrile. The patient was free of previous heart disease， and had not undergone any invasive， dental or other procedure.\n\n【15】The mitral valve is a common site of infection with H. parainfluenzae endocarditis， and vegetations tend to be large. The size of vegetation is adversely correlated with the patient’s clinical outcome， and it is correlated with the tendency of occurrence of occlusive diseases associated 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. In a comparative case- control study， the incidence of intracardiac vegetations was present in 68.8%of HACEK-IE and 77.1% in non-HACEK-IE.

The onset of the disease was most often sub acute in most of cases， median duration of disease before diagnosis was 19 days. Twenty-eight patients (66.7%) had extracardiac symptoms including petechiae purpura (10 patients)， Osler’s nodes(2 patients)， Janeway lesions (3 patients)， splenomegaly (9 patients)， Roth's spots (4 patients)， and one or more arterial embolic events(15 patients). One patient had mycotic aneurysm. In nine patients out of 15， emboli were present at the time of diagnosis. On the other hand， one patient had CNS emboli 12 days after the diagnosis， and one patient developed renal emboli 32 days after the diagnosis. Out of 25 patients with native valve disease， four had congenital heart disease. For 11 patients， atleast one vegetation was larger than 1 cm. Five underwent surgical valve replacement (two because of vegetation size and two because of uncontrolled infection) and five had embolic events. Haemiphilus was isolated from blood specimens of all patients except for one. Surgical valve replacement was done for 18 patients；16 of these surgeries were performed within the first 3 months. Of these 18 patients， 14 patients were infected with H. parainfluenzae； 3with H.aphrophilus； and 1 with H. paraphrophilus.

The main clinical manifestations of MDS are peripheral blood cell reduction， bone marrow morbid hematopoiesis with or without an increase in bone marrow primitive naive cells， and a high risk of transformation to acute leukemia. The prognosis of MDS in elderly people is relatively poorer. Mast cell hyperplasia is manifested as mast cell infiltration， accumulation， and damage to one or more organs of the human body， such as the bone marrow， skin， or digestive tract， is rare in MDS patients. In addition， it is unknown if gene mutations in MDS trigger the mast cell hyperplasia or whether mast cell hyperplasia affects MDS. Here， we reported a case of MDS with mast cell hyperplasia in an 87-year-old man and reviewed the related literature to discuss the underlying interactions.\n\n【2】Keywords： MDS； Mast cell hyperplasia； Elderly population\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【5】Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is a clonal malignant disease originating from multifunctional hematopoietic stem cells that usually affects elderly population， and the incidence gradually increases with the age. At the early stage， MDS is often manifested as excessive apoptosis of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells， ineffective hematopoiesis and differentiation， and maturation disorders. At the middle stage， malignant clonal primordial cells proliferate and increase in MDS， having an increased risk in transformation to leukemia routine blood test in MDS is usually shown as anemia， leukopenia， and/or thrombocytopenia while the clinical symptoms are often characterized by anemia， dizziness， fatigue and so on. However， due to the insidious onset， clinical missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis of MDS often occur which delays the disease treatment and affects the prognosis. Moreover， the elderly population was more likely to have various underlying medical conditions， and weak immunity， which makes them more vulnerable to MDS， and bring worse prognosis， and can lead to death 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Besides， MDS is more often complicated with immune disorders such as arthritis， vasculitis， and autoantibody defects， but its cause remains unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Mast cells，regarded as the effector cells of the allergic reaction， are also closely related to immune abnormalities， playing an important role in the early and acute stages of the allergic reaction. However， cases of MDS with mastocytosis are rare and the mechanism is obscure. In this paper， a case of senile MDS with mastocytosis was reported and literature reviewed.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】The patient， a male aged 87 years old， was hospitalized on September 17h， 2020， mainly due to leukopenia for four years， fatigue for more than one year， and precordial pain for two days. In August 2016， the patient had noticed a slight decrease in white blood cells (WBC， 3.46×10/L)，but without fever， chest pain， fatigue， or other discomforts. After oral administration ofleukopenia drug Diyushengbai tablets， the number of WBC increased to more than 4.0×10%/L. However， after the drug withdrawal， the number of decreased again. Since then， the patient visited doctors and orally take a variety of leukopenia drugs， such as burnet root leukopoietic tablets and Astragalus gum leukopoietic capsule. Which were effective at the beginning， but gradually became ineffective. In July\n\n【8】Fiqure 2： A gradual downward trend of hemoglobin Hb(g/).\n\n【9】2018， anemia emerged and the bone marrow morphology indicated that there were fewer nucleated cells with erythropoiesis and small cell hypochromic changes， cytochemical NAP通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>，HS通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>；MDS mutant genes were negative， while bone marrow biopsy suggested extremely low hyperplasia. Based on the above results， \"leukopenia， mild anemia was diagnosed， and recombinanthuman granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (150 ug for subcutaneous injection) was prescribed once a week. Consequently， the prescription sustained a WBC count of about 4.0 ×10/L. Therapy for anemia， including supplement iron and other hematopoietic raw materials， was nearly ineffective. In February 2019， the patient developed dizziness， fatigue. Routine blood test showed significantly low WBC (1.48×10/L， neutrophils0.68×10/L)， and moderate anemia (RBC 2.63 ×1012/L， Hb 70g/L). Subsequently， the patient had received long-term treatment of leukopenia drugs， infusion of red blood cells， and Erythropoietin(EPO). On September 154，2020， precardiac pain complicated with asthma， shortness of breath， and panic showed up and lasted for删除1换行about half an hour without obvious causes. Blood tests showed： WBC1.40×10/L， Hb 69 g/L， and PLT 32×10/L. The electrocardiogram examination showed sinus tachycardia， II， III， aVF qrs， qr type， and ST-T change， but there was no apparent abnormality in the myocardial enzyme spectrum. Then the patient was hospitalized with leukopenia. The admission physical examination indicated that the patient's body temperature was 36.3·C， pulse was 84/min，respiration was 18/min， and blood pressure was 143/62 mmHg. The patient was alert， cheerful， and had severe anemia. He had a bleeding point across his body， but his superficial lymph nodes were not swollen. His skin and mucous membranes were clear of vellow stains. There was no tenderness in the sternum， no anomalies in the heart or lungs， and no contact with the liver or spleen at the subcostal stage. The patient's blood test after admission showed WBC 2.53×10/L，PLT36×10/L， RBC 2.4×10'2/L， Hb 57 g/L， and MCV 82.9 fl. Anemia was corrected by infusion of red blood cells， while Thrombopoietin (TPO) was used to increase platelets. Cardiac dual-source CT examination only revealed mild stenotic lesions in multiple blood vessels. Paroxysmal precardiac pain was relieved when anemia was corrected. During hospitalization， the patient often developed paroxysmal asthmatic symptoms. A check at his medical history indicated that in the past two years， when leukocytopoiesis drugs and other medications were used simultaneously， the patient had developed asthma， shortness of breath， increased heart rate， and other asthma-related symptoms， including a longer period of headache. These symptoms were relieved by antispasmodic and antiasthmatic drugs. A pulmonary function test revealed mild obstructive ventilation dysfunction and a negative relaxation test， ruling out paroxysmal asthma as asthma and pointing to an allergic reaction as the cause of airway hyper-responsiveness. The above symptoms could be prevented by separatingthe leukocytopoiesis drug use from other medications. At the same time， the patient was experiencing severe skin itching symptoms with no visible rashes， and a variety of anti-allergic drugs were ineffective. After the above treatment， the patient's clinical symptoms were partly relieved， but the routine blood tests disappointing appeared progressing， from early leukopenia  to progressive anemia and then to thrombocytopenia . Bone marrow puncture and biopsy performed after admission revealed aggressive hyperplasia， degenerated cells， granulocyte accounted for 50.4%of total cells， primitive cell ratio of 8%， increased early and young granulocyte ratio， and a few middle and young granulocytes with development imbalance and degenerative changes in the nuclear pulp. Erythroid cell accounted for 40% of the cells， the proportion of middle and late-young red cells increased， and some cells were small and the edge of their cytoplasm was irregular. Binuclear young erythrocyte， basophilic stippling， Hao Zhou's corpuscles， megaloblastic changes， and metatypical erythrocytes (tears， target shape) could be observed. In total there were 34 megakaryocytes， with 20 of them being classified as 16 granular， two plates， and two bare karyotypes. Cellular chemistry shows NAP 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>， HS 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>. Bone marrow pathology indicated that bone marrow hyperplasia was active and the erythropoiesis was dominant， especially in the middle and late stages of the red blood cell cycle. Reduction of megakaryocyte and grain ratio without anomalies in distribution. Hyperplasia of mast cells， scattered or clustered， is diffused in some area . MDS-related genetic mutations of bone marrow cells were detected by flow cytometry， the result suggested mutations of BCORY156fs，STAG2S1058X，ASXL1Q778X， BCORY304fs， U2AF1S34F， DNMT3AR882C， and TET2Q1030R were positive， while Chromosome 46， XY， no abnormal karyotype； BCR/ABL detected by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)\n\n【10】A) CD45/SSC scatter map of the bone marrow cells： The immature cells in zone A accounted for 3.59%， the neutrophils in zone B accounted for 62.58%， the lymphocytes in zone C accounted for 5.26%， mononuclear cells in zone D accounted for 0.05%.\n\nB) CD38/CD34 scatter diagram shown after gating the naive cells in A.

No abnormal cell subsets immunophenotype had been detected by flow cytology . The mast cell hyperplasia-related genes were negative； therefore the patient was diagnosed as myelodysplastic syndrome with mast cell hyperplasia.\n\n【15】Due to poor physical condition and low willingness to treat， the patient did not receive demethylation therapy or other radical regimens except for blood transfusion， EPO， TPO， cyclosporine， thalidomide， ossification triol， and system supportive medication. After the treatment， the patient’s WBC was maintained at more than2.0×10/L， Hb maintained at around 80 g/L， PLT maintained at around 50 ×10/L， the general condition promoted and the blood transfusion intervals time was significantly prolonged.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】MDS diagnosis and treatment\n\n【18】The pathogenesis of MDS is still unknown， but recent research删除1换行had focused on the disease epigenetic changes， gene mutations， and heterozygosity deletion. In most patients， it is thus straightforward to diagnose MDS on the basis of WHO criteria. However， in many cases with cytopenia(s)， it may be quite difficult to establish (or exclude) the diagnosis MDS. These may be patients without a cytogenetic abnormality and only mild cytopenia， patients with a typical karyotype and cytopenia but only slight or absent dysplasia， or patients with transfusion-dependent macrocytic anemia without karyotype abnormalities and without diagnostic dysplasia. The most frequent somatic mutations driving age-related clonal expansions， and the biologic mechanism involved in the transition from clonal hematopoiesis to myeloid neoplasm， including clonal selection and evolution 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-4]</u>.On accounting ofthe recentadvances inepidemiology， genetics， molecular biology， new diagnostic methods， and the discovery of molecular markers have enhanced our understanding of MDS. The current classification approach adopted by the WHO is based on a combination of morphology， immunophenotype，删除1换行and genetic features to define distinct clinicopathologic disease entities， independently from the underlying causes that are often unknown. According to this principle， the diagnosis of MDS lies on2 hallmarks， the evidence of myelodysplasia and the proof of clonal hematopoiesis. Diagnostic and classification criteria of myeloid neoplasms with myelodysplasia. The diagnostic approach to MDS includes morphologic studies of peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate smears to evaluate abnormalities； bone marrow biopsy to assess marrow cellularity， topography and fibrosis； and cytogenetics to identify nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities. Additional investigations are also recommended， including flow cytometry immunophenotyping and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The patient in the current case met one of the prerequisites， which was the presence of persistent tricline hemocytopenia for at least one year. Bone marrow puncture showed that the blast cells were significantly increased but did not reach 20%. The pathological erythropoiesis was obvious， and blast cells were also found in bone marrow biopsy. Methylation gene mutations that closely related to MDS， such asBCORY156fs， STAG2S1058X， ASXL1Q778X， BCORY304fs， U2AF1S34F，DNMT3AR882C， and TET2Q1030R were found by using combined gene detection therefore the diagnostic MDS was established. MDS is a heterogeneous disease， and MDS patients are generally older with varying treatment intentions therefore the treatment should be individualized. At present，allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is still the only possible way to cure the disease， but due to the limited HLA matching donor sources， patient physical score， basic disease， age， prognostic risk， or other factors， the elderly patients are generaly not qualified for the transplantation. The treatment aim for most elderly patients is to improve cytopenia and the quality of life while delaying the progression of the disease. Treatment strategies， such as transfusion-supported symptomatic treatment， iron supplement and cytokines therapy， improvement of bone marrow hematopoietic microenvironment， and demethylation drug therapy， should be adapted to non-strengthening and risk assessment (IPSS/R score). Among those， demethylation therapy is important and beneficial， but due to the significant individual differences， bone marrow suppression time after treatment varies a lot， and there is a risk of severe infection and bleeding， which need to be concerned.\n\n【19】Mast cell hyperplasia\n\nMast Cells (Mast Cells： MCs) are essential immune cells in the human body， derived from CD34 precursor cells in the bone marrow. They are widely distributed in tissues， especially in the skin， respiratory mucosa or gastrointestinal tract， and are considered as effector cells of allergic reactions， especially in the early and acute stages of IgE- mediated allergic reactions. Mast cells are composed of heterogeneous cell groups that can secrete a variety of bioactive factors and affect many physiological processes. Their maturation and phenotypic function are influenced by their microenvironment， which releases a number of bioactive mediators that influence their uniquerecognition and reaction to various stimuli 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-7]</u>.In the current case， the patient developed anaphylaxis as the disease progressed. The hyperplasia of mast cells in the bone marrow was thought to be linked to MDS， abnormal hematopoietic stem cells differentiation and gene mutation， and changes in the hematopoietic microenvironment in the bone marrow. However， the specific mechanism requires further investigation. Mastocytosis is characterized by the hyperplasia of clonal， immature， or atypical mast cells. In addition to traditional mast cell markers， activation point mutations at codon KIT (c-KIT)|删除段之间换行|816 could be detected，and abnormal CD25 or CD2 could be expressed通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Mastocytosis can also cause multiple clinical symptoms. The most common manifestations are wind-like skin rash and itching， other symptoms such as fatigue， abdominal pain， headache， hypotension， weight loss， tachycardia， dyspnea and sore muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Severe cases can lead to multiple organ failure. Pathogenesis of mastocytosis is closely related to a mutation in the KIT gene 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In our case， bone marrow pathology showed that mast cells were proliferated，dispersed， or clustered， and diffused in some areas. Nonetheless， no KIT gene mutation was identified in the genetic detectation， and no obvious abnormal mast cell cloning was found in the flow cytology. Therefore， the case was not diagnosed as MDS complicated not with mastocytosis but with the mast cell hyperplasia， which is a rare case. Some studies retrospectively analyzed the mutation genes of MDS with systemic mastocytosis， and found that TET2 and ASXL1 genes mutation have nearly 50% Variant Allele Frequency (VAF)， which indicates that almost all bone marrow cells may co express these mutations in a heterozygous state， suggesting that MDS and mastocytosis may have a common pathogenesis and a common cell origin 通用删除6(英):<u>[11-12]</u>. However， in this case， further investigations are needed to determine whether MDS and mast cell hyperplasia are independent or have any potential relationship.\n\n【21】Treatment for MDS with mast cell hyperplasia\n\n【22】At present， there are no normative and specific treatment for the elderly MDS patients complicated with mast cell hyperplasia. However， demethylation therapy may play an important role in low-risk patients， and decitabine or azacytidine therapy can improve the prognosis and prolong the survival time of the patients. High-risk patients may be treated with a combination of other treatments depending on the physical fitness score of the patient and underlying diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Additional immunosuppressive regulatory treatments such as cyclosporine or lenalidomide/thalidomide may also be effective to relatively low-risk patients. There was a study suggesting that lenalidomide could improve the status of anemia and amend the molecular genetic abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Patients with mast cell hyperplasia have a high incidence of allergic reactions (up to 20~49percent) 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>， in which IgE is a major factor. The main inducers are Hymenoptera insects， some food， and drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Omalizumab is a drug usually used to treat stubbornness and can reduce the mast cell activity and reactivity therefore the IgE-mediated allergic reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Thus Omalizumab can be used in patients who have a poor response to the traditional treatment， but it cannot reduce the number of the mast cells. The patient failed to use demethylation drugs； he was therefore immunomodulated on the basis ofsupporting symptomatic therapy due to his old age and complex basic diseases. The WBC was maintained at more than 2.0×10/L，the Hb fluctuated around 80 g/L， the blood transfusion time was obviously prolonged， the PLT fluctuated around 50 ×10/L， the symptoms improved， and the patient was discharged. Continuous follow-up indicated that he was generally in good condition. In this complex case， we should avoid being too radical in treatment and instead choose an individualized treatment plan to enhance the quality of life and prolong survival time. Further research is needed on the progression， prognosis， and detailed pathogenesis of bone marrow. Due to the old age and complex underlying diseases， the patient could not be treated with demethylation drugs. On the basis of supporting symptomatic therapy， the patient was given immunomodulatory therapy and discharged after his condition was stabilized. Based on this case， we suggest that in order to improve the prognosis and the life quality of删除1换行elderly patients of this kind， we should avoid radical treatment but choose individualized treatment scheme concerning the pros and cons. Moreover， the progress，prognosis and detailed pathogenesis of bone marrow disease need further study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Often it is presented as enlarged lymphadenopathies. The postulated mechanism is intussusceptive lymphangiogenesis (with the development of pillars， interstitial tissue structures， folds， vessel loops and septa)， and it has been associated with efferent lymphatic and/or venous obstruction， due to tumor， thrombus， or as a result of surgery or radiotherapy. However， angiogenic factors produced locally by activated lymphoid cells seem to play a role， and can also produce VTS without lymphovascular obstruction. The diagnosis is histological.\n\n【2】Williams syndrome is a rare genetic and neurodevelopmental disorder， with autosomal dominant transmission， due to deletion at the chromosome band 7q11.23， that involves the elastin gene. After birth， infants often present with failure to thrive， short stature and supra-vascular aortic stenosis. Children also may have other elastin arteriopathies， due to stenosis of medium and large arteries owing to thickening of the vascular media from smooth muscle， as peripheral pulmonary stenosis， hypertension， mitral valve insufficiency and renal artery stenosis. Often， they have endocrine abnormalities， connective tissue abnormalities， global cognitive impairment and psychiatric disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. We describe a singular case ofassociation ofVTS and Williams syndrome.\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】A 24-year-old man presented to our outpatient consultation with a 2-month history of right axillary swelling， growing progressively. He was diagnosed with Williams syndrome without known structural cardiopathy in Argentina in childhood， and he had been living in Spain for a year. On physical examination there were multiple regional axillary hard lymph nodes in the right axilla， greater than 1 cm of diameter， freely movable in the subcutaneous space. No more lymphadenopathies were found.\n\n【5】An axillar ultrasound was performed， demonstrating various hypoechoic lymphadenopathies， greater than 1 cm of diameter (the largest was 3.2 cm)， with loss of vascular hilum， and moderate vascularization with Doppler technique. Computed Tomography showed the same findings. Hemogram， kidney and liver function tests， serum proteins， immunoglobulins and antinuclear antibodies were normal. Testing for Human Immunodeficiency Virus， C Hepatitis Virus， B Hepatitis Virus， Epstein Barr Virus， Cytomegalovirus， Syphilis and Tuberculosis was negative. A fine-needle biopsy was made， with no findings in cytology and cultures. Therefore， an ultrasound-guided thick needle biopsy was made， with histological findings of vascular and histiocytic proliferation， suggestive of vascular transformation oflymph node sinuses.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】We present a case of vascular transformation of lymph node sinuses in a patient with previous diagnosis of Williams syndrome in childhood. VTS is an infrequent benign alteration of the lymph nodes， that usually presents as swelling， and its diagnosis is histological， after lymphadenopathy biopsy. Despite its low incidence， it is important to know about its characteristics， and to take it into consideration within the differential diagnosis of enlarged lymph nodes.\n\n【8】We didn’t find any other case reported of VTS associated with Williams syndrome in the literature. VTS is considered to occur secondary to obstruction ofthelymph node venous or efferent vessels， but complete physiopathology is not fully understood. There have been findings demonstrative of intussusceptive lymphangiogenesis， and the participation of lymphatic channels (Podoplanin and CD34)， myofibroblasts， collagen and lymphodinamic conditions have been postulated 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Further， the presence of elastin has been demonstrated in the reticular network oflymph node cortex 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. On the other hand， elastin is located in the lymph node capsule-associated conduits， and is also involved in fluid and antigen distribution in the skin and lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Therefore， the concurrency of Williams syndrome and VTS raises the hypothesis that elastin deficiency may play a role int he pathophysiology of VT'S， further research to confirm this hypothesis is warranted.\n\n【9】In conclusion， we present a rare association ofaxillarlymph node enlargement due to VTS in a patient with Williams syndrome which， to the best of our knowledge， has not previously been reported. Elastin deficiency may play a role in this association.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Patient was started on1g1Haloperidol starting with 5 mg and increasing up to 20 mg over 3 weeks. There was symptomatic improvement of his psychotic symptoms， but in the 3rd week patient presented with jaundice， poor appetite， and yellowish discoloration of urine. On liver function test elevated AST， ALT， GGT， ALP and bilirubin were noted. At this point， patient was on Tablet Haloperidol 15 mg and Tablet Trihexiphenidyl 2 mg.

In Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) is a means of assigning points for clinical， biochemical， serologic and radio-logic features of liver injury which gives an overall assessment score that reflects the likelihood of injury is due to a drug.\n\n【2】Keywords： Haloperidol； Hepatotoxicity； RUACAM\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) is a common drug reaction that may lead to acute liver injury ranging in severity from mild， asymptomatic elevations in liver biochemistry to acute liver failure resulting in death or liver transplantation通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Liver is the major organ responsible for concentrating and metabolizing a majority of medications， therefore， it is a prime target for medication-induced damage.\n\n【5】Many pharmacological agents can cause liver damage， including anesthetics， anticancer drugs， antibiotics， antituberculosis agents， antiretrovirals etc. In addition， a range oftraditional and herbal remedies may also be hepatotoxic. Depending on the duration of injury and the histological location of damage， Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) is categorized as acute or chronic， and either as hepatitis， cholestatic， or a mixed pattern of injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【6】We present here a case of hepatotoxicity associated with Haloperidol use. Haloperidol is a psychotropic drug of the butyrophenone family.\n\n【7】Haloperidol as a first-generation antipsychotic has the potential to cause the Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)， which includes a group of movement disorders of dystonia， akathisia， tardive dyskinesia and Parkinsonism. Antipsychotic drug induced EPS is caused by the blockage of central dopamine Dreceptors.\n\n【8】Apart from such common side effects， antipsychotics are also known to cause asymptomatic alterations ofliver function. Liver injury of the hepatic (Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)， Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)， or Glutamate Dehydrogenase (GDH) elevations) or the Cholestatic(Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin elevations) type have both been described. Serious liver cell damage is well examined and described in Chlorpromazine treatment， occurring in approximately 1% of the patients.\n\n【9】Cholestatic icterus was described frequently (1% to 10%) with Chlorpromazine treatment and rarely with perphenazine， promazine， thioridazine， trifluoperazine， triflupromazine， and tiotixene treatment. The incidence is even lower under fluoridized phenothiazines such as fluphenazine or butyrophenones such as haloperidol. Here， cholestatic icterus may be accompanied by eosinophilia. Most authors agree that elevations of liver enzymes in neuroleptic treatment are a benign phenomenon， usually not requiring discontinuation of therapy. Therefore， further monitoring while continuing drug therapy is recommended if transaminases do not exceed a limit of 100 U/L 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】A 45-year-old male presented with psychotic symptoms with total duration of illness of 5years with poor compliance to medications. Upon admission， following diagnosis of paranoid删除表格换行schizophrenia， patient was started initially on Olanzapine. Following adequate trial， with no improvement in symptoms Risperidone was tried but poor response to it too.\n\n| Table 1： Dose of medications with chronological liver function test values.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Time  | Bilirubin  | SGOT  | SGPT  | ALP  | GGT  | haloperidol  | THP  |\n| 8 weeks before Haloperidol started  | 0.3  | 30  | 45  | 84  | 19  |  |  |\n| 0  | 0.2  | 34  | 49  | 91  | 23  | 5mg  | 2mg  |\n| 3wks  | 6  | 1230  | 1221  | 147  | 162  | 20mg  | 2mg  |\n| 3 wks 2days  | 7.6  | 1076  | 1166  | 153  | 143  | Withdrawn  | Withdrawn  |\n| 5 weeks  | 9.6  | 71  | 231  | 112  | 72  | None  | None  |\n| 8 weeks  | 2.1  | 84  | 82  | 84  | 36  | Restart  |  |\n| 9 weeks  | 1.5  | 79  | 93  | 82  | 35  | 10mg  | 2mg  |\n| 10 weeks  | 2.2  | 94  | 106  | 97  | 36  | 10mg  | 2 mg  |\n| 11 weeks  | 2.3  | 94  | 113  | 99  | 39  | 15mg  | 2mg  |\n| Next day  |  |  |  |  |  | withdrawn  | withdrawn  |\n\n【13】Patient was started on Haloperidol starting with 5 mg and increasing up to 20 mg over a period of 3 weeks. There was symptomatic improvement of his psychotic symptoms， but in the third week patient presented with jaundice， poor appetite， and vellowish discoloration of urine. On liver function test elevated AST， ALT， GGT， ALP and bilirubin were noted. At this point， patient was on Tablet Haloperidol 15 mgand Tablet Trihexiphenidyl2 mg. Patient had no diagnosis of chronic liver disease in the past， baseline Liver Function Test (LFT) was within normal limit. All his medications withdrawn over next 3 weeks and his LFT returned to normal， but during this period his psychotic symptoms again aggravated and at times was unmanageable in the ward. Owing to his good response to Haloperidol and poor response to both Olanzapine and Riperidone， patient was again started on Tablet Haloperidol， starting with 5 mg and increasing up to 10 mg over 2 weeks.Over next 2 weeks his LFT was estimated weekly， towards end of 2n week， his hepatic enzymes again started to rise forcing to stop Haloperidol， subsequently he was started on Tablet Aripiprazole and currently he is doing better.\n\n【14】In Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Roussel Udaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) is a means of assigning points for clinical， biochemical， serologic and radio-logic features of liver injury which gives an overall assessment score that reflects the likelihood that the hepatic injury is due to a specific medication. Introduced in 1993， RUCAM is now widely used in assessing causality of drug induced liver injury， both in the published literature and in support of regulatory decisions regarding medications implicated in causing hepatic injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Applying RUCAM in our patient， total score came out to be 7， (0 or less indicate that the drug is “excluded”as a cause；1 to 2 that it is “unlikely； 3 to 5 “possible； 6 to 8 “probable； and greater than 8， “highly probable\") which suggests Haloperidol as the probable cause for deranged Liver function in our patient .\n\n【15】Discussion\n\nMr. A had presented with clinical jaundice three weeks after Haloperidol was started. Any neuropleptic including haloperdiol is known to cause asymptomatic alterations in liver function. Liver injury of the hepatic Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)， Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)， or Glutamate Dehydrogenase(GDH) elevations) or the cholestatic Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)|删除段之间换行|and bilirubin elevations) type have both been described. GLDH is present in the liver cell mitochondria， and its elevation in the blood is quite specific for liver cell damage. Serious liver cell damage is well examined and described in Chlorpromazine treatment， occurring in approximately 1% of the patients. Incidence of such hepatic damage is very low with antipsychotics like Haloperidol， although few case reports have been published. In most cases it has been suggested that such elevation of liver enzymes is a benign phenomenon so that discontinuation of antipsychotic is rarely required with careful monitoring until transaminases exceed level of 100 U/L.\n\n【17】Bjornsson 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， put an effort to categorize medications based on their potentials to cause hepatic injury. This categorization is based on published case reports of individual drugs， with five categories(category A， 50； category B， 12-49； category C， 4-11； category D， 1-3； category E， none). Haloperidol comes under category B with 25 case reports till May， 2015 out of which there were no fatalities or in none of the cases re-challenge was done 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【18】In a case reported by Fuller et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> patient with diagnosis of schizophrenia had presented with symptoms of anorexia， nausea， vomiting， lethargy， fever and lower extremity rash 5 weeks after initiation of Haloperidol. His total bilirubin， 4.2 mgper 100 ml； SGOT100 IU per liter； and SGPT， 130 IU per liter. Following Haloperidol discontinuation，on examination a general red erythematous macular rash over the lower extremities and palms. On examination of the abdomen， mild right upper quadrant tenderness was noted， but no liver or splenic enlargement. On liver biopsy， pathological impression was that the changes represented a hypersensitivity reaction， predominantly cholestatic， but also hepatocellular. All symptoms resolved after few weeks and liver function test returned to normal通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【19】In another case Fuller et al described a 27-year-old female删除1换行presented with jaundice after four weeks of initiation of Haloperidol at a dose of 15 mg to 20 mg. After detailed evaluation drug Haloperidol induced intrahepatic cholestaisis was diagnosed. After four weeks of discontinuation of Haloperidol her liver function test returned to normal 通用删除6(英):<u>[51</u>.\n\n【20】In another case Dincsoy and Saelinger had reported in a15-year-old male malaise， fever， jaundice， generalized pruritus， vague abdominal pain， dark urine after 4 weeks of initiation of Haloperidol. Combination of hepatic dysfunction with jaundice and eosinophilia developing 4 weeks after administration of haloperidol and benztropine mesylate in this patient was highly suggestive of a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【21】In our case symptoms started after 3 weeks of initiation of Haloperidol which matches with the latent period described in previous case reports. Also， reduction in hepatic enzymes within 3weeks following discontinuation of Haloperidol is similar to previous case reports. Unique feature in our case is the upward trend of hepatic enzymes within one week following re-challenge， although continuation beyond that period is ethically unjustifiable， because of which re-challenge up-to previous dose and duration could not be achieved. Still， signs of positive re-challenge with objective evidence by RUCAM is sufficient to consider Haloperidol as the causative agent for deranged liver function test in our patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Known allergies or systemic problems to the child were not present. Patient’s behavior was definitely negative as per Frankl behavior rating scale. Dental trauma was caused by a fall on ground while playing about 4 months earlier. Lip or soft tissue lacerations or evidence of alveolar bone fracture was not found. Intraoral examination revealed fractured and carious 51 (maxillary right primary central incisor). Complete crown fracture of 51 with carious involvement and pulp polyp was observed. Teeth 52， 61 and 62were also involved by dental caries .\n\n【10】Since， child was 3 year old with low communication skills having definitely negative behavior and also required urgent attention for pulp polyp； after taking parent’s consent， diet analysis， counseling， and pediatrician's consultation the dental treatment under general anesthesia was planned. Pulp poly excised and pulpectomy procedure was performed for 51 using metapex . About 3mm of the metapex was removed from the coronal area of root canal and restorative glass ionomer cement was applied. Later， etching of tooth 51， 61 with 35% phosphoric acid for 20 seconds done and bonding agent was applied and cured for 20 seconds. Tooth 51， 61 were reconstructed with composite restoration employing strip crown. Tooth 52， 62 caries was excavated and composite restorations done.

We believe the introduction of this fortunately exceedingly rare condition of immunocompromised，and review of the too often undetected presentation of CM in non-HIV patients will be of value.\n\n【4】Keywords： Hyper IgE syndrome； Immunocompromised； Cryptococcal meningitis； Cognitive bias； Rare disease\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome，\"HIES\"， also known as Job syndrome， Buckley syndrome and STAT3 deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>， is a condition characterized by chronic eczema， distinctive facial features， retention of primary teeth， skeletal abnormalities leading both to fractures and to scoliosis. The syndrome predisposes to recurrent and chronic staphylococcal skin infections and abscesses， as well as recurrent pulmonary infections leading to pulmonary cysts and pneumatoceles 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The syndrome is a primary immunodeficiency syndrome which patients also share common facial， skeletal and cutaneous characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3]</u>. Most cases are transmitted in an Autosomal Dominant inheritance pattern (AD)， but it has been found to be sporadic as well as showing an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern in some patients. Seventy percent of AD-HIES cases are associated with a mutation in the STAT3 gene 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. This result in abnormalities in signal transduction causes a number of immunologic alterations which lead to an increased risk to bacterial and fungal infections. These infections can be sinopulmonary， cutaneous， and in rare cases gastrointestinal or CNS.\n\n【7】The syndrome is fortunately quite rare，presenting once in a million live births 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Presentations are therefore not commonly seen in the emergency department. Descriptions and cases do not， in fact， appear in any text-book of emergency medicine or emergency medicine journals we have found. Reviews have primarily been found in NIH sources 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> and Journals of Immunology， Allergy， Dermatology 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. The consequent unfamiliarity with this syndrome and its dangers can have devastating consequences， as fatal infections occur. The average life span of a patient with HIES is27 years， and the average age of fatal infections is 29 years， although some patients have been known to live into their fifties. This increases the need to be cognizant of the condition and its potentially deadly consequences.\n\n【8】The timely recognition of potentially lethal infections in this rare disorder is further delayed because HIES predisposes patients to subacute， indolent and initially subtle but potentially lethal删除1换行infections. These include invasive mycoses. Odio and others， in a letter to the editor of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， presented 5 cases of patients with HIES who were infected with endemic mycoses. As far as we have found， three patients have previouslybeen reported in the literature with HIES and Cryptococcal Neoformans meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>.\n\n【9】We report here a case of a young woman having Hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome， with a history of chronic epilepsy and migraine headaches who presented twice to the Emergency Department with headaches， seizures and anxiety. She was not initially admitted， and when admitted was not considered to have CNS infection. We believe the case worthy of consideration to raise consideration both for this very rare underlying condition and for the presentation in unusual circumstances of a subtle but dangerous CNS infection.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】A 26-year-old woman with a history of a prior resection of a frontal cavernoma and a history of seizures on Vimpat presented with one day of frontal headaches and with two weeks increased seizure frequency. She had no fever， chills， stiff neck， nausea or vomiting， or neurologic deficits， and a complete neurologic exam found no focal abnormalities. CT revealed focal encephalomalacia underlying the old craniotomy. Laboratory evaluation was normal. The patient was discussed with her neurologist who recommended medical management of her headache，and she felt improved after an injection of an antiemetic. She was discharged to follow up with her neurologist.\n\n【12】The patient returned the next day with complaints of tingling and numbness which she associated with anxiety. She was reported to be under emotional stress， and denied fever， chills or focal weakness. She was a febrile， her neck was supple with full range of motion，her neurologic exam was normal， as was laboratory evaluation including a repeat CT scan. She appeared \"anxious and ill\"， however， and after discussion with her neurologist， was recommended to stay for video-EEG and neurological evaluation. After discussion between herself and her family the patient decided against staying under observation in hospital and elected to leave against medical advice. She was advised to contact her neurologist.\n\n【13】Reportedly the patient continued to have headaches and was placed nine days later on Verapamil for headaches.\n\n【14】She returned the next week， now 11 days after her initial visit to the ED with complaints by the family of her having a “blank stare”and not responding appropriately to voice. She appeared to be slow to respond to questions. She was considered to appear post-ictal andwas placed in hospital for Video-Electroencephalographic Monitoring(VEEG). At this time， her past medical history was documented to include Hyper-IGE syndrome and seizures. She was noted to be chronically ill appearing and awake but minimally responsive to speech， with no focal neurological signs， and an otherwise unremarkable physical exam.\n\n【15】The patient remained confused for the next twenty four hours at which time she was noted to have a fever of 101. Blood cultures were drawn. A chest X-ray showed “pleural parenchymal disease”and antibiotics were started for possible pneumonia. At that time， she was noted to be awake， alert， oriented， and her neck noted to be supple.\n\n【16】Over the next twenty-four hours she remained intermittently\n\n【17】The MRI of the brain was performed and showed multiple small bilateral supratentorial and pontine infarcts suggestive of an embolic source see Figure 1.\n\n【18】Lumbar puncture and echocardiogram were recommended. Prompted by the concern for micro-embolization， a CT angiogram of the head and neck was also performed. It revealed no evidence for a flow-limiting stenosis or vasospasm. Small density foci in the cerebrum corresponded to the multifocal infarcts read on the prior MRI. It was noted that the relative loss of sulcation of the brain，stable， might be related to a leptomeningeal process given the conspicuity of sulcal FLAIR signal abnormality on the prior MRI.\n\n【19】Blood cultures then returnedpositive for a yeast species， which was subsequently identified as Cryptococcus Neoformans. She was started at that time on intravenous Caspofungin. A respiratory pathogen panel was negative. A transesophageal echo was recommended.\n\n【20】At that point an allergy-immunology consultation was obtained and the diagnosis of Hyper-IgE syndrome was further elucidated. A serum IgE was obtained， and she was shown to have a level of IgE of 2285 (n<233). She was noted to have a multiple year history of recurrent pneumonias， a prior pneumatocele， prior otitis， a prior psoas abscess and severe eczema. Further Immunologic work up was recommended. Rheumatology consultation was also obtained. The impression was there were no signs of a co-existent autoimmune inflammatory disorder.\n\n【21】The following daythe patient was scheduled for a lumbar puncture under interventional radiology. She seemed more responsive， more interactive and spoke with her mother. However， she was noted to have increasing hypoxia， and was considered to have aspiration and possible septic shock. Based on clinical worsening， Amphotericin was added to her anti-fungal coverage. She appeared increasingly dyspneic， was placed on non-invasive ventilation， and was admitted to the ICU.\n\n【22】Her lumbar puncture results included WBC 2， RBC 18， glucose<20 and a very high Cryptococcal titer. A diagnosis of Cryptococcal删除1换行meningitis was made. Antifungal agents were broadened to include Flucytosine.\n\n【23】Her mental status continued to deteriorate， and she was intubated.\n\n【24】Another head CT was obtained at that time and revealed significantly worsening diffuse brain swelling， with complete effacement ofthe suprasellar cistern and downward centralherniation， new caudal tonsillar herniation， and pronounced effacement of the prepontine cistern. There was new significant loss of grey white， suggestive of diffuse cerebral edema.\n\n【25】Mannitol and hypertonic saline were given， however n improvement was noted. She was judged to have no brainstem function and no chance of survival.\n\n【26】The patient was terminally extubated and pronounced dead on hospital day 8.\n\n【27】While Cryptococcal Meningitis has been traditionally recognized among HIV/AIDS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> and neurologic symptoms in AIDS patients generally lead clinicians to evaluate CSF of a patient with a headache 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>， it is not as often expected， but also seen in non-HIV patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Most cases， worldwide still occur in HIV AIDs， with 220，000 cases per year， mostly in Africa， and a very high， 70%mortality. In China however， for example， the majority of patients who present with cryptococcal meningitis are reported not to be HIV positive， but rather immunocompromised from other sources， including organ transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Their report cites another article as source for one million cases actually in patients with HIV通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【28】They see a high， nearly 70% mortality. These authors cite a“hidden onset and slow course\" for one reason of the high mortality.\n\n【29】For the HIV-seronegative patient 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> with Cryptococcus neoformans infection， often an underlying risk factor such as glucocorticoid use， hematologic malignancies or a history of solid organ transplantation and the use of immunosuppressive agents. Recently an apparently immunocompetent patient was reported to have cryptococcal meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【30】Reports have also shown a longer interval from presentation to diagnosis， especially in non-HIV patients. A 14-year study at Duke University Medical Center shows the duration of symptoms in HIV-seronegative non-organ transplant group is 44 days compared to 19days in HIV positive group， and 24 days in transplant patient group通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Non-HIV patients are diagnosed later， possibly because the disorder is not as readily anticipated. Another study at University of Alabama at Birmingham shows a significant difference between the mean time to diagnosis among three groups 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. The mean time to diagnosis among HIV-seronegative and non-organ transplant group is 68 days， which is longer in comparison to time to diagnosis of 22days in HIV positive patient and 26 days in organ transplant recipient通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【31】Symptoms of cryptococcal meningitis include an insidious onset， waxing and waning of the course， and non-specific findings， but also include headache， nausea， vomiting， ultimately disturbances of consciousness， hemiplegia， ataxia and seizures， although infrequently typical signs of meningeal irritation can be seen. Due to the insidious onset， average time from symptom onset to diagnosis as 30 days 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>， which was compatible with the timeline in this case， considering that删除1换行the patient had a vague increase in the frequency of her seizures and headache starting two weeks prior to her initial presentation， and about three before her hospitalization. On occasion the presentation can be so vague as to suggest psychiatric disease， which echoes our patient's chief complaint of anxiety and stress on her second visit 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>.\n\n【32】Prolonged interval from presentation to diagnosis， such as is more commonly seen in the non-HIV presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>， can increase the chances of a fatal outcome such as occurred in our case study. In addition， compared to patients with HIV， HIV-negative individuals with cryptococcal meningitis are at increased risk of having cryptococcal parenchymal lesions， inflammation and thus higher risk of herniation 通用删除6(英):<u>[20-22]</u>.\n\n【33】One case series of four cryptococcal meningitis cases cites cognitive bias and knowledge deficits as reasons for diagnostic error. As front-line providers， emergency medicine physicians can easily fall prey to “reasoning shortcuts”which include， but are not limited to， failure to recognize immunosuppression while assuming the common diagnosis is more likely. We believe the rarity of HIES syndrome and the lack of reports in emergency medicine literature may have contributed to an initial unfamiliarity with this being a syndrome of immunosuppression. Other reported cognitive biases include anchoring in the context of finding an alternative diagnostic answer. This may have occurred when a post-ictal state in a seizure patient was thought to account for a period of confusion. Such anchoring can result in closing prematurely one’s differential diagnosis for the case， especially when symptoms improve with medical management and framing where diagnostic conclusions are biased by the manner in which objective information had been presented 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>.\n\n【34】Our patient was initially started on fluconazole， but when the diagnosis was made her regimen was expanded to include amphotericin and flucytosine 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Induction therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> can be given for four weeks in patients with meningoencephalitis without neurologic complications. However for patients with neurological deficits this can be expanded to a six week course. Liposomal amphotericin 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> can be substituted if induction therapy is extended to prevent complications. After six weeks， consolidation treatment daily follows for eight weeks， and this is followed by maintenance therapy， or suppression， for a year or longer.\n\n【35】We believe that for our patient the combination of a rare and unfamiliar congenital disease of immune deficiency predisposed our patient to a slow， insidious but ultimately fatal illness which presented with headache and apparent increased frequency of her seizures. Because our patient was known to chronically suffer with both symptoms from other causes， meningitis was not considered on initial and early evaluations. Owing to the combination of the rarity of the disease， the existence of other similar presenting complaints in the patient’s history， and the gradual indolence of presentation of this disease， the ultimate diagnosis was not made until positive blood cultures prompted antifungal therapy and lumbar puncture.\n\n【36】We write this case in the hope that a raised awareness of this rare congenital condition， hitherto unreported in the emergency medicine literature the increased consideration of the potential for such causes of slowly progressive chronic neurologic conditions and chronic meningoencephalitis may have the potential to improve the possibilities of early recognition of this presentation for other， albeit very rare，patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Some factors have been reported to be closely related to DPPB， including cardiovascular disease， hypertension， polyp size， and polyp location. Risk factors for DPPB have been widely investigated， but primary hyper fibrinolysis was overlooked. Here we reported a routine Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) that resulted in long hospitalization and increased expenses. This report provides some clinical information and treatment options for some similar cases.\n\n【2】Keywords： Polypectomy； Delayed bleeding； Hyperfibrinolysis； Fg；Hg\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】DPPB is defined as bleeding that occurs between the end of the procedure and 30 days after polypectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Previous studies have shown that DPPB occurs in 0.3%~0.6% of polypectomies通用删除6(英):<u>[2-4]</u>. However， in a prospective study including only patients who underwent polypectomy with EMR，the incidence of DPPB was as high as 3.4%通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Most of the risk factors for DPPB are currently considered to be related to the patient， the polyp， and the surgeries 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>. The case we reported is a patient with unexpected and recurrent hemorrhage caused by primary hyperfibrinolysis after polypectomy. There is no standardized management of DPPB. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic process and therapy of unexpected DPPB.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 64-year-old female underwent endoscopic colon polypectomy in our department on July30h， 2018， with normal preoperative blood routine test， hepatic and renal function and coagulation function. Her medical history includes tubal tuberculosis in her youth， which has been cured，and she denied any history of chronic illnesses such as liver disease， hypertension or diabetes. The polyp was located at the junction of the rectum and sigmoid colon， about 1.5 cmx1.2 cm， and no pedicle on the base. It was removed by standard Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) and then the wound was clamped with two hemostatic clips and no bleeding was observed . After 24 h of postoperative observation， the patient was discharged without abdominal pain or hematochezia. At noon on the day， the patient presented with bloody stools， dark red and approximately 50 ml， and again in the evening， and came to our emergency department. According to emergent colonoscopy，“The EMR wound was located 15 cm above the anal verge， two metal clips were in situ， and a small amount of oozing blood was seen on the surface and edge of the wound ， so another 3 hemostasia clips were placed. She was readmitted to the gastroenterology department after emergent endoscopic treatment. Nutritional and hemostasis support were given promptly， including Suling (Hemocoagulase Agkistrodon for Injection) and Tranexamic Acid (TXA)， and the Hemoglobin (Hb， 133 g/L) and Platelet (Plt) were normal on readmission. However， bleeding recurred with an obvious drop of Hb to 107 g/L. The re-examination showed that Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) were within the normal range， while Fibrinogen (Fg) was significantly reduced to only 0.3 g/L. The urgent supplementation of the thrombin complex was performed and then the bloody stools stopped. But 2~3 days later， the bloody stools reappeared and the Fg was lower than 1.0 g/L again.\n\n【7】The effect of human fibrinogen onlylasted a short period. With the decrease in Fg， the bloody stools recurred every 3 days or so . Further examinations of coagulation factor activity were normal， including protein C activity， protein S activity， antithrombin III activity， lupus\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】It was a routine planned EMR procedure for this patient. The polyp was not very large and no bleeding occurred intraoperatively or 24 h postoperatively. There were no abnormalities in preoperative blood routine and coagulation function and the patient had no删除1换行history of liver diseases， hypertension， diabetes， or hematologic diseases， and no history of taking special drugs， such as aspirin， Clopidogrel， Ibuprofen or Indomethacin (NSAIDs). It was obvious that the patient had a low risk of bleeding complications. But her recurrent hematochezia happened and treatment lasted for nearly a month after the polypectomy， therefore the cause of her bleeding and treatment are worthy of concern and discussion. DPPB is thought to be due to the sloughing of the eschar of the cautery-induced ulcer that exposes and injures the underlying vessel 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. We observed that the occurrence of her hematochezia was accompanied by an obvious decrease in Fg (0.29 g/L~1.01 g/L). Hypofibrinogenemia is diagnosed when the fibrinogen level drops below 1.5 g/L~2g/L(2.0g/L~ 4.0 g/L in the healthy non-pregnant adults) 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， and fibrinogen replacement therapy should be implemented 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. When fibrinogen is less than 1.0 g /L， the patients may show signs of bleeding， severe visceral hemorrhage， and there is a high risk of death 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【10】Hyperfibrinolysis is a state of increased clot resolution. From a clinical point of view， it has been classified into two forms： Primary(qualitative or quantitative abnormalities of proteins directly involved in the fibrinolytic process) and secondary (conditions of imbalanced excessive activation of the otherwise normal fibrinolytic system) 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Primary hyperfibrinolysis is not associated with a hypercoagulable or prothrombotic state 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. The combined detection of fibrin degradation products and D-dimer can help to identify primary hyperfibrinolysis or secondary hyperfibrinolysis. Primary hyperfibrinolysis is divided into inherited， such as a2-plasmin inhibitor deficiency， PAI-1 deficiency， Quebec platelet syndrome， and acquired primary hyperfibrinolysis， such as chronic liver disease， acute promyelocytic leukemia， severe trauma， and post-partum hemorrhage， tumor， etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【11】In our case， repeated examination of the Plt， PT， and APTT was within the normal range， DIC-related indexes were normal， and there were no clinical symptoms of DIC， so secondary hyperfibrinolysis could be ruled out. Chronic liver disease was also excluded based on her medical history and related examinations. No evidence of malignant tumors was found based on imaging and tumor markers performed during hospitalization. Therefore， her recurrent bleeding删除1换行after the polypectomy was due to rare primary hyperfibrinolysis， and the specific cause for acquired primary hyperfibrinolysis is not clear.\n\n【12】Coagulation and fibrinolysis systems are highly regulated and interrelated mechanisms to ensure balanced hemostasis. Fibrinogen is converted into fibrin monomer during coagulation， and then a stable fibrin polymer is formed， which eventually binds to Plt and erythrocytes to provide structural integrity for the growing thrombus通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Fibrinolysis is readily considered as two consecutive steps：(i) The generation of plasmin by plasminogen activators， and(ii) The digestion of fibrin by plasmin 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. The central event of hyperfibrinolysis is the generation of plasmin in the blood circulatory system. The presence of high activity of the plasmin causes a pathological degradation of fibrin and fibrinogen， which furtherleads to rapid clot breakdown with consequent bleeding. The hemostatic capacity of a patient depends on the stability in the processes of formation and degradation of a blood clot. The clot strength increases linearly with the concentration of fibrinogen. Low fibrinogen concentrations form weaker clots that are more susceptible to lysis通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. There may be a mechanism that prevents the patient from forming stable fibrin polymers on the wound surface， where Fg is continuously consumed and the bleeding cannot effectively stop. In this case， the pathology of the polyp was villous adenoma with mild to moderate atypical hyperplasia of glandular epithelium. Besides， the complexity of rectal blood supply and the variability of blood vessels are likely to be the underlying factors. Plasminogen Activator(PA) mainly comes from the uterus， adrenal， lymph node， prostate， thyroid and so on. This case suggests that hyperfibrinolysis can also occur in non-PA-enriched intestines， which is rare indeed. Primary hyperfibrinolysis is often caused by primary diseases or inducing factors， mainly treated with antifibrinolytics and supplementation of fibrinogen and cryoprecipitate. Antifibrinolytics should be applied before fibrinogen is administered whenever hyperfibrinolysis is suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Tranexamic Acid (TXA) has been commonly used in the clinic for its betterhemostasis effect andlow risk of complications.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】This case highlights the importance of a close monitoring coagulation function in the clinical diagnosis and therapy of unexpected DPPB. Once hyperfibrinolysis is considered， Multi-Disciplinary Teams (MDT) working is of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Braches oftrigeminal and facial nerve serve as the most common conduit for the process to occur. However features of nerve involvement are not unique to tumor spread alone. Opportunistic infections， inflammatory disorders and primary nerve tumors also exhibit similar imaging feature.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Perineural tumor spread refers to spread of tumor to a distant location from its primary site using the nerve as a conduit. It is different from perineural nerve involvement which refers to nerve involvement at the site of disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Commonly vehicles for this process to occur are branches of facial and trigeminal nerve， however involvement of other cranial nerves have also been reported in past literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. MRI is the modality of choice to identify features of nerve involvement， which include nerve enlargement，enhancement， destruction of the foramina through which it spreads and secondary features， which occur as a result of muscle denervation. These features are however not unique to tumor spread alone. Pathologies such as opportunistic infections， inflammatory disorders and primary nerve tumors also exhibit similar findings 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Perineural spread of disease is associated with poor prognosis and high rates of recurrence in malignancies and refers to aggressive version of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.

Mention of perineural spread can impact management in head and neck pathologies especially in cases of malignancies， where treatment would change from surgery alone to include wide field radiation， surgical resection and neoadjuvant chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.

He was further referred to department of radiology for MRI and PET CT scan as part of staging workup.\n\n【6】Imaging findings\n\n【7】MRI brain with contrast examination findings： Axial T1 image reveals a hypointense abnormal signal intensity lesion involving the left nasopharyngeal soft tissues which appears heterogeneously hyperintense on T2 weighted axial image . The lesion shows heterogeneous post contrast enhancement on T1 post contrast axial image . There is extension of the enhancement along the dura along the course of branches of trigeminal nerve up to the region of cavernous sinus .\n\n【8】Coronal T1 pre and post contrast images reveal abnormal thickening and enhancement involving the maxilary and mandibular divisions of left trigeminal nerve. The lesion is extending anterioinferiorly to involve the hard palate . Over all findings are consistent with a neoplastic lesion involving the left nasopharyngeal soft tissues with perineural spread along branches of Vh nerve with intra dural extent， however no intra axial involvement.\n\nPET-CT scan findings： Coronal maximum intensity projection and coronal fused images  show abnormal FDG uptake in the lesion involving the nasopharyngeal soft tissue with|删除段之间换行|abnormal uptake along the course of maxillary and mandibular divisions of trigeminal nerve up to the region of Meckel's cave.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Perineural spread is a well recognized entity in surgical and imaging literature. Since squamous cell carcinoma is the most common head and neck tumor， it results in highest number of cases with perineural spread 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【12】Typical imaging features of perineural tumor spread are nerve enhancement and thickening which are well recognized on MR imaging along with abnormal uptake on FDG pet scan however these features are not unique to tumor spread alone and can be seen in infective， inflammatory and primary nerve pathologies as well 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.

Emergency test was notable for Hemoglobin(HGB) 97 g/L， Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) 12.89 mmol/L， Creatinine (Cr) 149 umol/L， Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) 769 U/L， Na+ 132.9 mmol/L . The C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level was elevated at 109.5 mg/L. A chest Computed Tomography (CT) scan taken on September 23，2019 was shown in Figure 1 (a). Vascular ultrasound revealed deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremity. The patient was treated with Lysine Acetylsalicylate， cefazoxime， ambroxol and Low删除表格换行(750 mg/day). After three days， the body temperature returned to normal， and the shortness was relieved. Due to warfarin treatment requires recurrent review， the patient decided to take rivaroxaban. He was discharged after 2 weeks of hospitalization. He reviewed at the outpatient clinic regularly. The blood routine of the patient showed leukopenia 2 months later after discharge. CTPA showed no signs of pulmonary embolism but no improvement of pulmonary lesions Figure 1(c). Chest CT appeared the absorption of pneumonia after8 months Figure 1(d). The ATT and rivaroxaban were discontinued. During treatment， the patient’s symptoms relieved and laboratory tests， including D-dimer was improved significantly and BUN fluctuated with days， although the white-cell count decreased and the RBC count did not change Figure 2.

We screened the articles in English from 2000 to2019， only 13 cases of tuberculosis complicated with pulmonary thromboembolism are reported totally，another 7 cases were reported as TB complicated with DVT. The average age was 35.10±15.33 years|删除段之间换行|In our report， the patient was the oldest among those mentioned above， 85-year-old.

TB， as a chronic inflammatory state， in the lung activates the coagulation cascade and leads to pulmonary and systemic thrombin generation 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>， it intervenes all the three parts of Virchow's triad， may play a role in pathogenesis of the disease. The presence of a hypercoagulable state in TB patients was considered as a consequence of elevated plasma fibrinogen with impaired fibrinolysis， along with a decrease in factor III， protein C， increased platelet aggregation， and direct endothelial damage promoted by the mycobacterium tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>. White et al. also demonstrated a possible association between DVT in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and the use of rifampicin with a relative risk of 4.74 in patients treated with rifampicin-containing regimens通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. In addition， the hypercoagulable state persists for 2 weeks after the initiation of anti-tuberculosis medication and improves while continuing the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，16]</u>. Our patient also chose rifampicin in the ATT regimen because it is used as a bactericidal agent and is often included in first-line anti-TB drug therapy. Rifampin not only increases the occurrence of thrombus， but also has a great influence on warfarin. The metabolism of warfarin increases in the presence of rifampicin， and the doses of warfarin sometimes have to be increased to more than double the recommended level 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u>. During warfarin is added for treating thromboembolism， bleeding is common and sometimes fatal. Novel Oral Anticoagulant (NOAC) agents are ideal choice for control of PTE/DVT in patients receiving anti tuberculosis medication. Our patient chose rivaroxaban for the treatment of PTE. Finally， he discharged successfully.\n\n【16】In conclusion， active TB has been considered as a risk factor for PTE.

Exact etiology of the disease is not known but prolonged sexual intercourse has been stated as the most common cause in the literature. A simple physical examination is sufficient for diagnosis but color doppler ultrasonography is often carried out as a further investigation. Proper diagnosis and consequent conservative treatment with reassurance can help the patients to relieve their anxiety. We describe the symptoms， the sonographic findings and treatment of a29-year-old male with superficial thrombophlebitis of the penis dorsal vein.\n\n【2】Keywords： Penile； Mondor’s disease； Thrombophlebitis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Mondor’s disease is thrombophlebitis of the superficial dorsal vein of the penis veins sometimes thrombophlebitis of the circumflex vein of the penis with sparing of the dorsal vein. It was first defined by Henri Mondor in the superficial veins of the chest wall in 1939 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In 1955， Braun-Falco defined dorsal phlebitis of the penis as a part of generalized phlebitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Isolated thrombosis of the dorsal superficial vein of the penis was first reported and Penile Mondor’s disease was defined by Helm and Hodge in 1958 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. PMD is a rare and under-recognized benign genital condition and only<100 cases have been reported in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Its real incidence is considered to be higher than reported. The true incidence of Mondor's disease is unknown，but one series showed an incidence of18 of 1296 (1.39%) patients in a sexually transmitted disease clinic over a 12-year period 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 29- year- old unmarried man presented to our hospital with a three days history of pain and swelling on the dorsal side of the penis. Pain was felt more severe at the time of penile erection. There was history of vigorous masturbation 5 days back. The patient otherwise denied trauma， dysuria， hematuria， difficulty with erection， multiple sexual partners， or attempted intercourse. He had no relevant past medical history. Physical examination revealed a well-developed male with no signs of lymphadenopathy in the groin region and without any palpable hernias. Genitourinary examination revealed an uncircumcised penis and a palpable cord on the right dorsal side of the penis . The overlying skin was completely intact with no erythema. Mild tenderness of the penile shaft was noted and testicular exam revealed no swelling or pain on palpation. Urine microscopy， full blood count， and coagulation studies were all within normal limits. On Doppler ultrasound a cord-like non-compressible lesion containing internal echogenicity with no color filling and flow spectrum around the coronal sulcus was detected . Doppler ultrasound of cavernosal arteries and veins were normal and the administration of vasoactive agent was thought to be unnecessary.\n\n【7】The patient was anxious and worried about his future sexual performance and fertility. Patient was managed conservatively with reassurance， oral anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant aspirin therapy and local application of heparin gel for a period of 2 weeks as a result of which the pain subsided and induration disappeared. Now after follow up of 3 months there is no residual induration and patient is totally assymptomatic with no erectile pain or dysfunction.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\nPenile Mondor’s Disease (PMD)， thrombophlebitis of the superficial dorsal vein of the penis is a rare， self-limiting， benign process having acute presentation with pain and induration of the dorsal part of the penis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Various causes of the disease that has been mentioned in theliteratures include|删除段之间换行|frequent， severe， and prolonged sexual intercourse， penile trauma， prolonged sexual abstinence， local (e.g. syphilis， candida infections) or distant infections， history of sexually transmitted diseases， thrombophilia，repair of inguinal hernia， orchiopexy，varicoselectomy， use of intracavernous drugs， use of vacuum， Behcet’s disease， body building exercises， cancer in the pelvic region， metastatic pancreas cancer and migratory phlebitides due to paraneoplastic syndromes， venous occlusion caused by filled bladder， abuse of intravenous drugs， and tendency to thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-5]</u>. Thus any of the components of Virchow's triad i.e. coagulation due to injury to vessel wall， stasis，and hyper-coagulation can lead to the development of thrombosis of the dorsal vein of the penis. But the main etiological cause is considered to be trauma due to sexual intercourse. In present case there was history of vigorous masturbation which might has caused injury to the vessel wall.\n\n【10】The patients usually present with hardness like a rope at dorsum of the penis. They complain of continuous pain and throbbing. Sometimes erythema and edema may be seen on the penile skin. Some patients feel distention on the site of thrombosis. There is usually pain typically exacerbated during erection 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. In present case， presentation was with pain and swelling on dorsum of penis with palpable cord. Important differential that should be considered in the diagnosis of a painful， fibrotic lesion of the penis includes sclerosing lymphangitis and Peyronie’s disease. However， sclerosing lymphangitis is characterized by thickened and dilated lymphatic vessels whose morphology is serpiginous. Peyronie’s disease results from a thickening of the tunica albugenia and presents as a well defined fibrotic plaque on the penis.\n\n【11】PMD can be diagnosed with medical history and physical examination. The role of imagining in PMD is to identify the intravascular thrombus. In case of doubt we may take the help of Doppler ultrasound. Doppler ultrasound findings include an increase in the diameter of superficial dorsal vein， non-compressibility and thrombus in the superficial dorsal vein 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. PMD is clinically divided in three stages as acute， subacute-chronic and recanalization stages. In this case report patient presented in acute phase. In the acute stage， sexual activity should be restricted in addition to the use of oral anti-inflammatory， anti-coagulant agents. This patient was also managed conservatively with oral anticoagulant aspirin， anti-inflammatory drug Diclofenac sodium orally and local application of anticoagulant heparin gel along with advice to avoid sexual activity.\n\n【12】Creams containing heparin and anti-inflammatory drugs are used in the subacute and chronic stages in addition to restriction of sexual activity. Most of the cases seen early respond well to conservative treatment such as anti-inflammatory agents and anticoagulant and antithrombotic drugs. These drugs reduce the recovery period. In cases of infection antibiotics must be used. Most cases resolve in four to six weeks and are recanalised by nine weeks. In persistent cases， surgical treatment is recommended which include stripping of the vein or thrombectomy.\n\n【13】In conclusion， PMD is a rare under-recognized benign genital condition that every attending physician should be aware of this， self resolving condition to prevent misdiagnosis and overaggressive treatment with its attendant physical and emotional trauma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

He suggested the designation《 low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma 》 for these tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. It’s very particular morphology， its biological evolution sometimes aggressive despite a benign histological appearance， the existence of remarkable删除1换行morphological variants， its association with specific genetic alterations and its immunophenotype make it a topic of interest to pathologists.\n\n【13】The Evans' tumor occurs most often among young adults (range20 to 50 years) but can affect people of any age， including children and elderly people.

Inclusion criteria were children diagnosed with RS (micrognathia， glossoptosis， and upper airway obstruction， with or without cleft palate) and cardiac anomalies (except patent foramen ovale). Admitted with a small mandible and no evidence of respiratory obstruction were excluded. Any evidence of respiratory compromise in the presence of a small jaw requiring at least supplemental oxygen or positioning changes was considered to be sufficient for a diagnosis ofRS. In contrast， a child with a small jaw and no breathing problems (not requiring supplemental oxygen， positioning changes， or other interventions) was not considered to删除表格换行have RS.

Three patients underwent cardiac surgery， were discharged from hospital and MDO after three months of recuperation. One patient underwent cardiac surgery 20 dayslater， followed by MDO. One patient underwent cardiac surgery， three days later， was given up treatment. Five patients underwent cardiac surgery and mandibular distraction at the same day， cardiac surgery first， mandibular distraction second. The patients with PDA were treated by thoracotomy through median thoracotomy. Repair of foramen ovale and ventricular septal defect by cardiopulmonary bypass and thoracotomy. Twenty III grade RS patients without cardiac anomalies were included\n\n【18】Statistical Analysis\n\n【19】Descriptive statistics are presented as mean ± SD and frequency\n\n【20】Outcome Measures\n\n【21】Identification\n\n【22】Identifications of the patient were as in Table 1. The birth weight， gestational weeks and gender of RS patient were similar with or without cardiac malformations， occur to males. And the number of gestation (2.7±1.6) and parturitions (1.6±0.91) was significantly higher than that of the children without cardiac malformations， gestation (1.7 ± 0.5)， parturitions (1.3±0.3). Pulmonary arterial hypertension was found in all children with cardiac malformation.\n\n【23】Clinical outcome\n\n【24】Hospitalization time and ventilator use time in RS patients without cardiac malformation (33.36 ± 18.71)，(7.18±1.47) was similar as in group of MDO and cardiac surgery at the same time， (27±6.7)，(6±2.19)，respectively.\n\n【25】Hospitalization time and ventilator use time for separate删除1换行operations was significantly longer than that for both operations. Patient 10 was hospitalized for 102 days， which was related to the duration of non-invasive ventilation and postural therapy. Patient 4was difficulty in evacuation of breath machine after heart operation for 20 days， then MDO was operated， the breath machine was withdrawn smoothly after 4 days. Average ventilator-carried time was6.8 days in simultaneous operation group； it is 17.3 days in the other group. After matching the two groups of patients， two patients were select； children underwent both operations at the same time gained more weight.\n\n【26】Discussion\n\n【27】Cardiac anomalies is a difficult problem in neonates with RS， mortality rate is high. The RS patients were dyspnea， feeding difficulties， with cardiac abnormalities caused by cardiac dysfunction， aggravating hypoxia， poor nutrition， increased surgical risk. It is difficult to make the decision which surgery was first. Cardiac surgery was performed first， prolonged ventilatory assist time； even it makes difficulties to evacuate the ventilator. However， if MDO first， the patient is at high risk， because of the unstable circulation. In our hospital， cardiac surgery and MDO were performed in the same day， cardiac surgery first， MDO second， average ventilator-carried time and hospitalization time was shorten， and the patient gained more weight.\n\n【28】Mortality rate was high in children untreated PAH 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. In RS patient， VSD with left ventricular to right atrial shunt， blood enters the right ventricle， increased blood to the lungs leads to increased pulmonary arterial pressure. The ratio of right to left shunt in patients with PAH is not low. The foramen ovale were reopened by most of the intracardiac shunts， and PDA aggravating hypoxia， hypoxia causes pulmonary artery contraction， influence pulmonary gas exchange aggravates PAH and hypoxia 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. In healthy people exposed to hypoxia， the potential arteriovenous branch in the lungs can be reopened. Therefore， it can be alleviates PAH to compensate for pulmonary vascular resistance， but aggravated hypoxia. RS patient suffered from hypoxia due to upper airway obstruction， potential arteriovenous branch maybe reopened， aggravated hypoxia. 71.4% of RS patients who died had cardiac disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Therefore， attention should be paid to PAH during the treatment.\n\n【29】So breaking hypoxia is the key to treat RS patients with cardiac malformation. In our department， nutritional support and oxygen inhalation were given several days before operation， improves internal environment. Cardiac surgery and MDO operated were performed on the same day， upper airway obstruction and cardiac structural abnormalities due to hypoxia， can simultaneously treated， RS patients gain the more weight， shorten the mechanical ventilation period as well as the hospital length of stay.\n\n【30】It is a safe and feasible way for neonatal RS patients to do cardiac surgeryand MDO on the same day. In the future， we will study this in a larger sample to evaluate safety and explore complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However 90% of these children catch up the deficit by 2 yrs but about 10% of these children fail to achieve this 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The SGA children who are below -2SDS at 4 yrs of age are highly unlikely to catch up and generally tend to remain short throughout the rest of their lives 通用删除6(英):<u>[21</u>.\n\n【16】The prevalence of SGA babies is about 41.5% in South Asia and is around 30% in India as compared to a 5% to 7% in the developed nations 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【17】Russell Silver Syndrome (RSS) is a genetic condition associated with prenatal and postnatal growth retardation. RSS has a prevalence of about 1：30，000 to 1：100，000 worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Short stature associated with RSS is one of the most severe categories of growth impairment in SGA children.

Children with RSS have abnormal growth hormone pulsatility which coupled with absent catch growth makes the child remain below the 3m centile for height 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【21】There are several studies of children with SGA and RSS from various parts of the world， however there are no studies about the use and effect of growth hormone in these children from India. The cost of long-term therapy has a key role in the duration of treatment in our country， as the entire cost of treatment is borne by the family of these children.\n\n【22】This study aims to evaluate the effect of growth hormone in children who are SGA and RSS， in the India population.\n\n【23】Patients and Methods\n\n【24】A retrospective study was planned from 2010 till 2017， where all the data was collected from the patient records.\n\n【25】Diagnostic criteria\n\n【26】SGA： Children with birth weight Z-scores <-2 for their gestational age included in the study (SGA)， with no evidence of catch up growth till 4 yrs ofage.\n\n【27】RSS： RSS was diagnosed by the Netchine-Harbison clinical scoring system.\n\n【28】All children less than 18 yrs were included in the study.\n\n【29】Children on growth hormone for 1 yr.\n\n【30】Results of growth hormone stimulation tests were not part of the exclusion criteria.\n\n【31】All the data of small for gestation children were retrospectively evaluated， those fulfilling the Netchine-Harbison clinical criteria were assigned as RSS and the rest were included in SGA.\n\n【32】Netchine-Harbison scoring system 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>\n\n【33】Prenatal growth retardation (birth weight and/or length-2SDS for gestational age).\n\n【34】Postnatal growth retardation (height SDS for calendar age，≤2.0 according to national reference).\n\n【35】删除8:<u>鼎 </u>Relative macrocephaly at birth (head circumference at birth at least 1.5 SDS above birth weight and/orlength SDS according to Usher and McLean).\n\n【36】Prominent forehead (defined as a forehead that projects beyond the facial plane on a side view as a toddler).\n\n【37】Body asymmetry (defined as leg length discrepancy of≥0.5cm or arm asymmetry orleg length discrepancy≤0.5 cm with at least two other asymmetrical body parts， with one being a nonface part).\n\n【38】Feeding difficulties during early childhood.

It is considered as a global public healthproblem and a deviant behavior. People of different ages are committing suicide COI every day around the world for different reasons. University students， who are supposed to be the future of a country， are also accepting this path of deaths. Bangladeshi undergraduate students are also becoming the victims of suicide every day. In recent times， suicide ideation among the university undergraduate students is increasing. This article reveals the prevalence of suicide among the university undergraduate students and the factors associated with suicide ideation among the university undergraduate students of Bangladesh. It also focuses on the impact of these suicides on the family and society. To overcome this grave situation， some precautionary steps have been recommended at the end of this article.\n\n【2】Keywords： Affected behavior； Behavioral health； Mental disorder； Psychology； Public health； Suicide\n\n【3】Introduction\n\nSuicide is a ninth leading cause of the death in America leading approximately 1.4% of the total deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Several studies over the world have observed that university students face multiple problems ranging from psychological to academic and financial to career and social concerns 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. It is also observed that these problems become harder with time and cannot be easily resolved resulting they need to seek some professional help. However， in developing countries like Pakistan， India and Bangladesh， this scenario is more often due to lack of social awareness. Accordingly， around6% to 8% of students suffer through emotional issues during the course of their university studies通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Though the exact number of students who suffer from emotional problems cannot be easily established， especially in developing countries. Researchers have provided evidences that these students are at greater risk for academic and social challenges in a university environment and later in their practical adult life 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Mental and behavioral disorders are estimated to account for 12% of the global burden of any disease. More than 40% of countries have no mental health policy and over30% have no mental health program 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. A number of factors are associated with suicidal ideation which includes depression， hopelessness， bullying， family divorce， parental psychopathology， parental death， low family income， interpersonal violence， psychiatric disorders， problematic technology use like Smartphone addiction， Facebook or internet addiction etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-9]</u>. In Bangladesh， the rate suicides among university students are increasing day by day. It has become a serious issue that is needed to be addressed. But there is lack ofawareness regarding this suicide ideation among university students. Some proper steps may decline this rate significantly. A study conducted among665 students of a university in Bangladesh by a classroom based convenience sampling method. The study of the result showed that the prevalence of suicidal ideation was 2.3% in the past 24 h，4.8% in the past 15 days， 6.9% in the past month， 14.7% in the past year， and 61.1% in the lifetime. The results also stated that being separated from partner， Facebook addiction， depression， anxiety and stress were the risk factors of past-year suicidal ideation 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In a retrospective study from Bangladeshi press report found that most of the suicide victims are from public university students|删除段之间换行|(30.4%). It found that 17 students were from public university in a total of 56 Bangladeshi students suicide cases reported from January2018 to June 2019 in the Bangladeshi print media 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. A study in Jahangirnagar University among 407 university students aged between 18 and 27 vears stated that the 13.8% of the students have suicidal ideation during the past 12 months. A number of reasons were found to be responsible behind this scenario. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was found more in the female than the male in the study 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Several studies show that the female suicidal ideation is more in percentage than the male. In a study of suicidal ideation among rural elderly in Shandong， China shows that the suicidal ideation varies gender wise. It is in fact found more in female than the male. The reason of finding more suicidal ideation in female was stated because of having lower life satisfaction and negativelife events which are more correlated with female than the male 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Other reasons that were found behind the suicidal ideation in the study conducted in Jahangirnagar University were being fifth year student， having a lower socioeconomic status， exposure to traumatic events， family suicide history and depression. Lower socioeconomic status of individual is more often influencing the university students to suicidal attempts. Most of the university students of Bangladesh belong to a lower or middle class family. They often struggle to manage their education costs. Besides they have to look after their families as well at a very early age. It often puts them under huge amount of pressure. A cross-sectional study from a rural community of Bangladesh stated that the parental lower socio-economic position enhances the suicidal ideation rate among the adolescents. Low monthly income and expenditure of the parents are associated with suicidal ideation of the adolescents and those who don't live with their parents are also found to have suicidal ideation 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. A cross-sectional study from the Korean Community Health Survey 2013 confirmed that the suicide rate is higher among the people associated with lower socioeconomic status 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. On the other hand， parental high expectations often put the university students under tremendous pressure. Parents always seem to expect more from their childrens. They want their children to have great academic results. Besides they often put their children's under pressure through expecting their bright and luxury future. The teachers also put a high load of academic pressure on them. Sometimes the university students do not find their teachers enough cooperative and helpful to share anything. This high expectation from their parents often puts so much stress and anxiety on them. That is how the depression takes place into them and results in suicidal ideation. However， the impact of these suicides on family and society is very shocking. It enhances the breakdown of family causing mental conflicts and depression among the family members. It creates a traumatic stress that induces other family members to commit suicide. Suicide is a social disorder and alarming situation for the society. It creates anarchy in the society and decreases the social status. That is why it is considered as a defame of the society通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Some of the suicide prevention steps includes raising awareness among university students regarding suicide， prevention program are needed to arrange besides raising awareness， prevention program should include student support centers， gatekeeper training towards mental health problems and suicide， screening， peer leadership training 通用删除6(英):<u>[17-19]</u>. Besides，curriculum based interventions and internet based interventions may be beneficial in the prevention of university students suicide 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Finally， the university administration should look after the mental conditions of each and every student alongside their financial crisis.\n\n【5】Conclusion\n\n【6】Students' suicide is really a tremendous shock for both the family and society. This study will help to find out the exact causes of the suicide of University students. This study finding will help to address the relation between suicide and student-teacher's relationship and other factors. It is believed that the suicidal ideations of university students can be declined by taking meaningful steps.

She was hospitalized after a suicide attempt and released few days after. In the two following months she was readmitted three times for other suicide attempts. Each time， emergency staff had the same defeated reaction： “Eventually， she’s going to succeed in killing herself.\" This attitude is more common than we would think among caregivers. But if caregivers themselves do not hope for better， who will? It was vital for her that someone believed she would live. So when I met her， I started to hope instead of her， in spite of her. After one year of intensive psychotherapy，hope was restored and Mrs L. was able to start over.

Among these injuries， rib fractures are considered the most frequent type of clinically significant blunt thoracic trauma and are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Despite a large number of cases annually， there are no internationally recognized guidelines for rib fracture treatment yet. This controversy in treatment options can be attributed to the lack of high level convincing clinical research that confirms the benefits of surgical fixation over conservative treatment measures. Despite these developments， so far multiple clinical studies are required to prove the superiority ofone system over another.

However， sometimes in older people who have osteoporosis， only a slight force (as occurs in a minor fall) is required. The fracture itself is rarely serious， although the force that caused the fracture occasionally causes other problems， such as a bruised lung (pulmonary contusion) or a collapsed lung (pneumothorax). An injury that fractures the lower ribs sometimes also damages the liver or spleen. The more ribs that are broken， the more likely lungs or other organs are to be damaged. Flail chest can result if several adjacent ribs are broken in more than one place. In flail chest， a segment of the chest wall separates from the rest and moves in the opposite direction from the rest of the chest wall when a person breathes. Breathing becomes more difficult and tiring. Usually， a blow strong enough to cause flail chest also bruises the lung beneath the injured area.\n\n【20】删除13:<u>删除1:<u>Copyright C 2021 Sanjay Shah.

Patient was shifted to our facility with increasing respiratory distress. Patient was tachycardiac， tachypneic|删除段之间换行|NRBM (Non-Rebreather Mask) on arrival to ER (Emergency Room). On examination Bilateral Air entry was decreased with paradoxical chest movements on right side. Immediately Intercostal Drainage(ICD) insertion was done on bilateral 5h intercostal space in mid axillary line and attached with water sealed bag. A collection of 500ml in left ICD bag and 200 ml in right ICD bag was seen. Patient was managed with IV antibiotics，IV analgesics， IV antiemetic， IV antacid， IV fluids and shifted to ICU. CT thorax plain was repeated showing left1 to 7 rib fracture and right 1 to 9lh rib fracture with subcutaneous emphysema mild hemothorax with pulmonary contusion and bilateral ICD in situ . Three unit of blood transfusion was given over next 48 h.

The disease is characterized by a genetic deficiency of Arylsulfatase A (ARSA)， or the deficiency of Saposin B (which activates ARSA and is a non-enzymatic protein co-factor). ARSA has the function of breaking down and removing sulfatides from the body， and is toxic to myelin when built up in the CNS or PNS， causing pathological demyelination of the nerves. Cerebroside sulfate， which is normally broken down by ARSA， consequently accumulates， and is what causes the toxicity to myelin. We present a 2-year-old male who presented with recurring seizures and drop attacks beginning 18 months of age. He then recently began to regress with regard to milestones and subsequently progressed to quadriplegia. The case was investigated with an MRI and confirmatory biochemical testing for MLD. The MR imaging showed areas of elevated signal intensity of periventricular white matter， and the contrast MR shows early signs of demyelination on the basis of the lack of enhancement.\n\n【2】Keywords： Metachromatic leukodystrophy； Lysosomal storage disorders； Leukodystrophies； Demyelinating disorder； Seizures； Developmental delay\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\nA 2-year-old male presented to the outpatient pediatric neurology department of a large tertiary care center for further evaluation of persistent deterioration of gross motor skills as well as regression of his developmental milestones. He began experiencing paroxysmal drop attacks starting around 18 months of age， described as sudden loss of motor tone and consciousness that would result in him falling to the floor during normal everyday activities. Although previously meeting all developmental milestones， including walking unsupported，his motor functions deteriorated to the point that on presentation he was unable to sit up unsupported. He waspreviously misdiagnosed with Doose's syndrome， which is a seizure disorder characterized by frequent myoclonic and myoclonic-atonic seizures， owing in part to the limited availability of MR imaging studies in the rural areas of which the patient was a resident. The patient had no family history for seizure disorders. No other significant past medical or surgical history was reported， and he was delivered at term， via normal vaginal delivery， with an uncomplicated post-partum course. On initial examination the patient was a non-dysmorphic male who appeared his stated age. Vital signs were within normal limits. Neurologic examination was pertinent for generalized weakness in all muscle groups， with muscle power being 2/5. Reflexes were exaggerated， and bilateral plantar reflexes were up going. A generalized increase in body tone was also noted. Basic investigations including a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were unremarkable. Further imaging was sought with an MRI of the brain， which showed bilateral symmetrical confluent areas of periventricular deep white matter signal change， in particular around the atria and frontal horns with sparing of subcortical U fibers leading to a \"butterfly pattern\" on T2 weighted imaging， along with the tigroid' pattern on the axial section and the leopard'pattern on sagittal sections which were classic for a diagnosis of metachromatic leukodystrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. A contrast enhanced MRI showed lack of enhancement in areas of demyelination， a finding which also indicative of MLD . Biochemical testing also confirmed deficient ARSA activity in leukocytes. The patient was managed with injectable levetiracetam and divalproex sodium syrup for seizure control， along-with muscle relaxants for|删除段之间换行|Discussion\n\n【5】The pathogenesis of MLD revolves around the fact that deficiency of arylsulfatase A disrupts the normal metabolism of sulfate compounds， which are the most important components myelin. This defect leads to the accumulation of lipid material (e.g.， cerebroside sulfate)， which stains metachromatic in the white matter of the CNS and PNS， as well as in other organs like the gallbladder and kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-41</u>. When the accumulation occurs in glial cells and neurons， it causes a pathological demyelination. The clinical course is progressive， characterized for symptoms such as paralysis， tremors， stiffness， dysphagia， seizures， ataxia， optic atrophy， speech alterations， and deterioration of mental abilities， dementia and deterioration of the peripheral nervous system. In a growing child， this is characterized by a regression of milestones 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. This pathology is classified on the basis of age of onset of symptoms， and there are three recognized variants：Late infantile， between 6 and 24 months； juvenile， between 3 and 16years old， and adult MLD which begins at any age after puberty 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. In the early-onset variant， there is a predominant motor loss that comes before the mental deficit； in later-onset variants， the deterioration is reversed with neuropsychiatric symptoms preceding the motor. The progression of the disease is unstoppable and typically patients tend to die around a decade after symptoms present. The brain changes can be evidenced in magnetic resonance images， in T2 sequences， FLAIR and diffusion studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-8]</u>. The classic findings， notably the afore-mentioned \"butterfly pattern， as well as the classic ‘tigroid' pattern on axial or ‘leopard pattern on sagittal sections with relative sparing of sub-cortical U fibers were well described in our patient， and with progression can lead to cortical and subcortical atrophy. The gene that encodes Arylsulfatase A is on Chromosome 22p13.33. Treatment options currently available include bone marrow transplantation， enzyme replacement therapy， and gene therapy. However， their effectiveness in improving the long-term prognosis of the disease has not yet been proven. Bone Marrow Transplantation has been implemented to curb CNS effects 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， and the best clinical results are obtained when it is done before the symptoms present. Other treatment aspects include physical rehabilitation andpharmacological treatment of symptoms.\n\n【6】Conclusion\n\n【7】Since the clinical course of metachromatic leukodystrophy is fatal， it is necessary for early recognition of this disease. As our case demonstrates， it is important to limit misdiagnosis， which can delay appropriate care. The almost crucial role of MRI for accurate diagnosis is also highlighted here. The disease has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern， and therefore carrier screening and genetic counseling are important aspects of the management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The presence of epithelial cells in pleural tissue is a concern for a malignant process. We report a case of a 76 year old African American female， presenting with complaint of bleeding per rectum. The computed topography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed rectosigmoid wall thickening， a large fluid attenuated mass within the pelvis and a right middle lobe lung nodule. Image guided drainage of the pelvic mass revealed neutrophils and gram negative rods but no evidence of malignancy. Colonoscopy with biopsy of the sigmoid mass revealed invasive moderately differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the lung nodule showed clusters of malignant cells with rare acinar configuration and intracytoplasmic mucin. The tumor cells were positive for TTF-1 and CK7 and negative for CK20； these findings were consistent with primary lung adenocarcinoma. The core needle biopsy of the lung nodule did not show evidence of carcinoma. A well-defined cluster of benign epithelial cells with glandular configuration and a separate gland lined by ciliated columnar epithelium were identified in pleura. These benign glands expressed CK7 and TTF-1. The benign mesothelial cels lining the pleura were positive for CK5 and CK7. This case study highlights the importance of recognizing this benign condition， especially in patients with co-existing malignancy in order to avoid a false positive diagnosis of malignancy involving pleura.\n\n【2】Keywords： Pleura； Epithelial inclusion； Mesothelium；Lung adenocarcinoma\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The normal constituent of pleura is fibrous connective tissue composed of mainly elastic and collagen fibers， along with lymphatic， nerves and blood vessels. The lining of this connective tissue is single layer of mesothelium. A small amount of serous fluid is normally present between the parietal and visceral layers of pleura. Epithelial cells do not constitute normal component of pleura； thus， their presence raises the possibility of malignancy. We report a case of 76 year old African American female who was diagnosed with synchronous primary colon adenocarcinoma and primary adenocarcinoma of the right lung. The benign epithelial inclusions lined by columnar epithelium with glandular configuration were identified in the pleura during biopsy of the right lung nodule. This case study highlights that the finding of epithelial cells within the pleura does not always indicate metastasis， extension of primary lung carcinoma， primary mesothelioma， or endometriosis.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】We report a case of a 76 year old African American female， presenting with rectal bleeding. The computed topography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed rectosigmoid wall thickening， a large fluid attenuated pelvic mass， and a right middle lobe lung nodule . Image guided drainage of the pelvic mass revealed neutrophils and gram negative rods but no evidence of malignancy. The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics. Colonoscopy with sigmoid mass biopsy revealed invasive moderately differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma. CT guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) and biopsy of the lung nodule was performed. FNA showed clusters of malignant cells with rare acinar configuration and intracytoplasmic mucin. The tumor cells were positive for TTF-1 and CK7 and negative for CK20， consistent with primary lung adenocarcinoma. The biopsy of the lung nodule did not show carcinoma in multiple levels. A well-defined cluster of benign epithelial cells with glandular configuration and a separate gland lined by ciliated columnar epithelium were identified in the pleura ； these bland-appearing cells expressed CK7 and TTF-1 . The benign mesothelial cells lining the pleura were positive for CK5  and CK7.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\nHistological finding of glands within pleura is concerning for the presence of metastasis， advanced primary lung adenocarcinoma， or primary mesothelioma since pleura normally consists of connective tissue with interspersed nerves， lymphatics and blood vessels and a lining of mesothelial cells. The most common type of malignancy involving the pleura is adenocarcinoma characterized by the presence of malignant glands in the pleura. It is often accompanied with|删除段之间换行|malignant pleural effusion and dyspnea. The most common causes of malignant pleural effusions include primary lung adenocarcinoma(35%)， metastasis from breast carcinoma in females (23%) and lymphoma (10%)通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. The metastasis from gastrointestinal tract and gynaecological tract are rare in pleura. Although benign causes of glands in pleura are rare， endometriosis (endometrial implants in pleura) is the most significant cause 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>.\n\n【9】Epithelial and/or nonepithelial inclusions are most commonly reported in lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-12]</u>. Patients with endometriosis may have endometrial glands in pelvic and para aortic lymph nodes通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Ectopic glands are relatively rare above the diaphragm， most commonly found in cervical and axillary lymph nodes. Ectopic glandular breast tissue and cystic structures lined by squamous epithelium are found in axillary lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>. Ectopic thyroid tissueis found occasionally in cervical lymph nodes. Among nonepithelial implants，the most common are mesothelial inclusions in mediastinal lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>[16，17]</u> peritoneum 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u> as well as below the diaphragm in abdominal lymph nodes. Peritoneal endometriosis and surface epithelial inclusions of ovary are some examples of extranodal glandular inclusions.\n\n【10】There are several theories for the explanation of ectopic glands Among lymph node implants， one theory proposes maldevelopment at the embryonic level when glandular cells were entrapped within删除1换行lymph nodes and survived. The other possibility may be the mobilization of glands from their original site via lymphatics to the lymph nodes. The cause of mobilization may be inflammation or infection at the original site as seen in endometriosis where the inflammation due to menstruation dislodges the glands and they are transported via lymphatics to regional and/or distant lymph nodes. These two theories also hold true for ectopic mesothelial inclusions通用删除6(英):<u>[19，20]</u>. Epithelial implants on mesothelium can also be explained by metaplasia. Embryonic coelomic and/or subcoelomic mesenchyme undergoes metaplasticchange to mesothelium. Chronic inflammation may play a role in it. Regardless of the cause， these implants usually raise the suspicion for malignancy but the benign causes of these ectopic glands must be ruled out. This is especially important if the patient has a history of malignancy as lung is a common site of metastasis or coexisting/history of primary lung adenocarcinoma.\n\n【11】We expect to see elastic and collagen fibres in pleura， along with nerves， blood vesselsand lymphatics， lined by a single layer of mesothelium. Diagnosis of malignant glands in pleura makes lung carcinoma inoperable and in the case of distant metastasis indicates stage IV. This case study suggests that the false positive diagnosis of pleural malignancy should be avoided and presence ofbenign glands in pleura must be identified based on morphology.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】There is no specific immunostain to distinguish benign glands from primary lung adenocarcinoma in pleura. Careful evaluation of morphology is the key to establish the diagnosis. This case study highlights the importance ofconsidering the presence ofbenign glands in pleura in order to avoid the false positive diagnosis of advanced malignancy or stage IV metastatic disease from nonpulmonary cancers.

Respiratory study revealed mild fibrosis on CT-scan and an obstructive ventilatory defect， interpreted as tuberculosis sequelae.

She had a relevant past medical history of treated pulmonary tuberculosis (PT) and was not taking any medication. Her brother suffered from psoriasis.\n\n【5】The patient presented erythematous scaly cutaneous lesions on elbows，bilateral edema ofwrists， arthritis of distal and proximal inter-phalangeal joints of right hand’s second finger， bilateral fine crackles on lower lung fields and no other relevant findings. Pulmonary embolism was excluded and pulmonary computed tomography (CT) showed sub-pleural linear opacities at left superior lobe， fibrotic striae at pulmonary bases， cystic bronchiectasis of right pulmonary base and centrilobular micronodules at inferior pulmonary lobes .\n\n【6】Laboratory studies revealed mild lymphopenia， negative C-reactive protein， elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (89 mm/hour) and positive anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)(1/1000， speckled pattern). Muscle enzymes (creatine kinase， lactate dehydrogenase， aldolase and myoglobin) and further immunologic results were normal. Microbiological exams were all negative. Echocardiography and bronchoscopy were normal and both bronchoalveolar and bronchial lavage fluids were negative for malignant cells and microbiologic testing. No antibiotics were prescribed. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) showed a mild obstructive ventilatory defect which， again with the imaging changes， was attributed to PT sequelae.\n\n【7】Constitutive symptoms， joint involvement and analytic results raised the suspicion of a connective tissue disease (CTD)，stillundifferentiated， and the patient was started on oralprednisone(40mg daily) with clinical improvement. Two weeks after being discharged， she was observed at the outpatient clinic. She complained of fatigue and developed a severe and predominantly proximal muscle weakness， as well as solid dysphagia. Serum levels of muscle enzymes remained normal. Electromyography was normal， cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was not compatible with demyelinating disease and deltoid muscle biopsy presented non-inflammatory changes and suggested a glucocorticoid-induced myopathy (GIM). Prednisone was tapered and subsequent clinical improvement on muscle strength supported the diagnosis of GIM； the patient continued tapering prednisone.\n\nThree months later， a heliotrope rash appeared  and the diagnosis of dermatomyositis|删除段之间换行|(DM) with interstitial lung disease (ILD) was established， as well as its amyopathic subtype. The patient was started on oral prednisone(1mg/kg/day)and oralazathioprine(1.5mg/kg/day).Cancer screening was negative.\n\nOne month after the diagnosis of amyopathic DM (ADM)， the patient was readmitted for syncope. Pulmonary CT scan showed a marked worsening of structural changes and a spontaneous pneumomediastinum . Azathioprine was switched to cyclophosphamide (CPA) and a first intravenous pulse (0.6g/m) was given. A slight decrease of the pneumomediastinum was documented by additional CT scans. The patient remained clinically stable and was discharged； a next IV pulse of CPA was programmed within one month. Two weeks after the second pulse of CPA， the patient was readmitted for a larger spontaneous pneumomediastinum， with cervical subcutaneous emphysema， that clinically improved after supplemental oxygen and absolute resting|删除段之间换行|After 12 monthly pulses of CPA， the patient was able to perform her daily life activities without supplemental oxygen. The control CT scan showed a similar degree of pulmonary fibrosis， no worsening of structural changes related to ILD and no pneumomediastinum.

It is characterized by biopsy-confirmed cutaneous manifestations of classic DM occurring for six months or longer， with no clinical evidence ofproximal muscle weakness and no serum muscle enzyme or other muscle testing abnormalities 2|.\n\n【12】This case represents a diagnostic challenge. In the beginning， the constitutive symptoms， joint involvement， positive ANA and increased ESR raised the hypothesis of CTD， although the patient did not fulfill any classification criteria for a specific disease. In this context， and after excluding active infection， glucocorticoids were prescribed. Pulmonary disease was first interpreted not as ILD but as a consequence of PT sequelae， after excluding pulmonary infection and according to patient's previous history and PFT.\n\n【13】The patient developed muscle weakness after beginning oral prednisone. This fact， again with normal muscle enzymes， normal electromyography， histological findings and clinical improvement few weeks after prednisone tapering， allowed the diagnosis of GIM. GIM is a frequent but often underestimated adverse effect of steroid treatment， being more common in elderly patients and appearing few weeks to several months after corticotherapy introduction 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Corticoid doses correlate positively with the likelihood of developing myopathy and with a faster onset of weakness. GIM eventually resolves if steroid therapy is discontinued.\n\n【14】In this patient， and after steroid discontinuation， the appearance of a single clinical sign - the heliotrope rash - permitted the whole reinterpretation of clinical data. This case reinforces that clinical suspicion is extremely important and differential diagnosis must be actively explored， even if rare， especially if they can course with rapidly progressive clinical deterioration； it also illustrates that“clinical picture” can change within time， so patients should be closely followed.\n\n【15】ADM diagnosis was established： the initial cutaneous lesions on elbows (Gottron’s sign) were present for more than six months， with no clinical evidence of inflammatory myositis as described above(classical DM myopathy improves with steroids) 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.

ILD can precede the diagnosis (18-20% of patients)， appear simultaneously or develop later 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. In this patient， ILD was present from the onset of skin lesions but was misinterpreted. Early treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and additional immunosuppressive agents may result in improved outcomes for some patients. Several case series attest the benefit of CPA， being reserved for severe or refractory cases given its serious toxicities 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>.\n\n【17】Managing this patient’s disease course was challenging. At the time of ADM diagnosis， she started high-dose corticosteroids plus azathioprine but the delay regarding her first admission may be associated with a worse outcome. ADM-related ILD had a rapid progression and was refractory to first-line immune suppression， with markedly worsening of structural pulmonary changes and complicating with severe pneumomediastinum， which relapsed even after the first CPA course but finally improved. CPA is typically administered for six months before switching to another immunosuppressive agent； however， in this patient， it was decided to maintain CPA pulses for one year， considering the severity of the disease.\n\n【18】Spontaneous pneumomediastinumis rare and severe complication of ILD in myositis， occurring more frequently in ADM 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.

Although the diagnosis of ADM in elderly patients increases the suspicion of an underlying malignancy， this patient’s cancer screening was negative.

This prospective study was performed on 68 chronic low back pain patients divided into two groups by their usual doctor. The first group received a multidisciplinary care in a rehabilitation center for114 h spread over four weeks. The other group received a reconditioning program composed of six hours of physical activity spread over two weeks. Our result suggested that both care programs resulted in improved physical and psychological parameters， and reduced pain intensity (p<0.001). Thus， a physical activity reconditioning program outside the conventional health care structure can reduce pain and disability as well as increase physical capacities as shown by better muscle endurance and flexibility.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\nA large number of people worldwide are affected by low back pain. Indeed， epidemiological studies have shown that globally the number of people with low back pain in 1990 was 377.5million， and it increased to 577.0 million in 2017 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Thus， it is a very common health problem and a major cause of disability. This disability comes from the multifactorial nature of low back pain， including physical， functional， psychological， occupational and social factors 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. That is why there are numerous reports in the scientific literature that Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) patients suffer from a syndrome of physical and psychological deconditioning linked to pain 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>， making the management complex|删除段之间换行|Because ofthis complexity，interdisciplinaryrehabilitation programs appear to be one ofthe most effective care regimens to improve back pain and decrease disability通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. These programs include at least one physical component (physical activity or ergonomics exercises) and one other element of mental approach (psychological， social and/or educational). The length of these programs， usually4 to 6 weeks at the rate of 5 days a week，7 h a day， requires inpatient or outpatient hospitalization通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. Despite the differences between all these interdisciplinary programs， their objectives remain the same， namely to restore functional， physical and psychological capacities of CLBP patients in order to facilitate their return to work 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. But these programs are not suitable for subjects who are still employed.Indeed，this treatment requires hospitalization， so CLBP workers must take sick leave during the time of the care， in ducing direct costs (loss of wage， medical costs，etc.) and indirect costs (loss of production for the enterprises， etc.) 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. That is why many authors recommended these programs as a second-line treatment due to the resources allocated 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>. Thus， according to the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>， it is recommended to propose multidisciplinary rehabilitation only for CLBP patients at a therapeutic impasse， associated with social and/or professional exclusion.\n\n【4】Other programs based on physical activity， such as non-medical treatment to counteract disability in CLBP patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>， seem to be a good alternative to multidisciplinary programs for CLBP workers because they do not require hospitalization and can be provided outside conventional health care structures. Thus， the CLBP workers can maintain their work during the care. However， although the impacts of aerobic exercise interventions alone， muscle strength training alone or flexibility training alone on CLBP patients are known， the benefits of a general exercise program which combines the three interventions has not yet been demonstrated 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. However， as concluded删除1换行by Gordon and Bloxham， a specific intervention program focusing on one area of fitness for CLBP may not be appropriate because CLBP is multifactorial and affects all areas of fitness 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. That is why these authors recommended the implementation of a general exercise program to cover all areas of fitness 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>.\n\n【5】The objective of this current study was to demonstrate the impact， on CLBP workers， of a short physical activity reconditioning program including general exercises， outside the conventional health care structure， on the evolution of physical and psychological parameters.\n\n【6】Materials and Methods\n\n【7】Study design\n\n【8】This was a prospective study of two groups undergoing different care regimens. The first group of low back pain patients (G1) included patients who followed a multidisciplinary care program in a rehabilitation center for 4 weeks， 5 days per week， 7 h per day. The second group of low back pain patients (G2) comprised patients who underwent a physical activity reconditioning program outside the conventional health care structure over 2 weeks， 3 times a week， for 1 h per session. The G1 served as a reference group since the effectiveness of intensive multidisciplinary care is no longer to be demonstrated 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【9】The inclusion criteria were that the patients were more than 18years old and had low back pain for at least 3 months， demonstrating the chronicity of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. The exclusion criteria were specific low back pain (e.g.， infection， fracture and malignancy)， severe psychiatric or psychological disorders， and cardiac disease restricting physical activity. The patients were directed to either the rehabilitation center or the non-conventional health care structure by their usual doctor. Patients were directed to a rehabilitation center if they presented a therapeutic impasse and often had to miss work. The other patients who did not have these characteristics were directed to the non-conventional health care structure. Therefore， the constitution of the groups did not allow randomization， but it should be noted that the patients in the rehabilitation center serve as a reference group without comparison with the non-institutionalized group.\n\n【10】Before study enrolment， the design was explained to each patient， after which they signed a written consent form， specifying the purpose and risks of the study. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee N°2019-380-S77.\n\n【11】A total of 68 CLBP patients (35 males， 33 females) were included in this study. The G1 had 38 patients (22 males and 16 females) aged41.5±10.0 years old， and the G2 comprised 30 patients (13 males and 17 females) aged 42.5 ±15.7 years old. Their characteristics are summarized in Table 1. At the beginning of the study， G2 was composed of 36 patients， but six patients were excluded from the study because they did not meet the inclusion criteria， three because of the time commitment， two for personal reasons， and one for secondary low back pain.\n\n【12】Program content\n\n【13】Multidisciplinary care program (G1)： The G1 program included a multidisciplinary team composed of physicians， physiotherapists， occupational therapists， psychotherapists， sports therapists and social workers. Patients in this program had to tolerate some temporary discomfort， such as detoxifying from habit-forming narcotic medication. This program was intensive because the patients were删除1换行present in the rehabilitation center 5 days a week， 7 h a day over 4weeks， representing 114 h of care for each patient.\n\n【14】Over a week， patients received：\n\n【15】7% h of individual physiotherapy， including global muscle strengthening using body weight for 45 min a day， with a physiotherapist， and stretching， focusing on quadriceps， hamstring. pyramidal and spinal muscles for 45 min a day.\n\n【16】5 h of balneotherapy， composed of lower limb muscle strengthening exercises， stretching and relaxation.\n\n【17】5 h of occupational therapy， including training in weight-bearing techniques and rules for a healthy spine.\n\n【18】10 h of physical activity， with training in techniques for warming up， muscle strengthening (spine and lower limbs) and cardiovascular endurance， as well as soft gymnastic exercises， Scandinavian walking， badminton and outdoor biking. In addition， every morning for 45 min， patients underwent muscle waking， from mild to moderate intensity.删除2换行a 1-h theoretical class， given by a doctor of physical medicine and rehabilitation， regarding the anatomy of the spine， mechanisms of pain， and available non-medical treatment like physical activity in order to deconstruct false fear-avoidance beliefs.\n\n【19】The patients could also meet with a psychologist and/or a social worker， depending on their needs.\n\n【20】Physical activity reconditioning program(G2)：Patients received a physical activity reconditioning program for 6 h， spread over 2 weeks (three sessions of 1 hour a week)，including an individual session of muscle and cardiorespiratory endurance， an individual low-impact gym session， and a group aquatic gym session. Duringthe entire care， G2 patients had to stop narcotic treatments like patients in the G1 group.\n\nThe individual session of muscle and cardiorespiratory endurance consisted of the following：|删除段之间换行|15 min of cardiorespiratory warm-up on a cycle ergometer or an elliptical bike， at 65% of target heart rate， as determined by the Karvonen formula 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【22】30 min of stato-dynamic muscle strengthening activities using body weight or a resistance band. This activity included strengthening of the lumbar and dorsal region， and also the lower limb muscles.\n\n【23】15 min of stretching of the spine and lower limb muscles.\n\n【24】An individual low-impact gym session consisted of：\n\n【25】10 min of warm-up， including all articulations ofthe body.\n\n【26】30 min of proprioception and balance using Swiss exercise balls， a Bosu balance trainer and walking trails for balance and coordination.\n\n【27】20 min of muscle relaxation exercises， including stretching and respiratory exercises.\n\n【28】A group aquatic gym session was made up of：\n\n【29】Warm-up， consisting of swimming freestyle for 150 to 200meters.\n\n【30】Lower limb training for 20 min by， for example， swimming删除1换行three lengths of a 25-meter pool by forward kicking， backstroke kicking and vertical kicking motions. Training on the upper limbs for20 min by， for example， three lengths of breaststroke with alternate lengths of front crawl. These exercises included muscle strengthening and cardiorespiratory endurance， and used pool noodles， bodyboards and swimming fins. These sessions were of moderate intensity.\n\n【31】Recovery， which consisted of swimming 100 meters freestyle between each 20-min session.\n\n【32】The end of session， which consisted of relaxing for 5 min. The patients could choose either stretching exercises in the small pool or lying on their backs， on a pool noodle， letting the water rock them.\n\n【33】Physical and psychological measurements\n\n【34】For the G1， all the assessments were made in the rehabilitation center， the first before the care was started (T0) and the last one after4 weeks (T4 weeks). The G2 was assessed in a non-conventional health care structure before the beginning of the first session (T0) and after the sixth session (T6). Each assessment for both groups was realized by the same evaluator， and each patient completed the same assessment in the same way.\n\n【35】For each patient， age， body mass， height， gender， duration of complaint and disability were recorded .\n\n【36】Psychological measurements： Each evaluation began with pain measurement by the Analogue Visual Scale (VAS) 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>， which is a 0 mm to 100 mm scale (low scores indicate less severe pain)； then assessment of psychological parameters was done by three questionnaires. The Dallas questionnaire 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> assessed the repercussions of pain in four areas： Daily Activities (DA)， Work and Leisure activities (W/L)， Anxiety and Depression (A/D) and Social Interest (SI) (scale 0% to 100%； high scores indicated a severe repercussion of pain). The Tampa Scale for kinesiophobia questionnaire 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> determined the level of kinesiophobia in patients(scale 17 to 68； high scores indicated severe kinesiophobia). Finally， the Roland Morris disability questionnaire 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> measured back pain disability (scale 0 to 24；low scores indicated less severe disability).\n\n【37】Physical measurements： All the patients for the two groups began physical measurements with a 10-min warm-up on a cycle ergometer， at 65% of their target heart rate， as determined by the Karvonen formula 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. After the warm-up， the patients underwent删除1换行muscle endurance and then flexibility tests.\n\n【38】The physical measurements included： 1) tests where the finger-to-floor distance was used to estimate posterior chain flexibility 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> and heel-to-buttock distance was used to estimate anterior chain flexibility 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>； and 2) two additional tests： the Ito-Shirado test to assess abdominal endurance 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> and the Biering-Sorensen test to determine spinal endurance 通用删除6(英):<u>[251</u>.\n\n【39】Statistical analysis\n\n【40】Statistical analysis was performed with Sigma Stat version 3.5software. All values were expressed as means ± Standard Deviation(mean ± SD). For each parameter， data normality was tested with the Shapiro-Wilk test. The comparison of the initial demographic characteristics between the two groups was made using an unpaired t test. The intra-group comparisons between initial training and the end of training were made by paired t test. The significance level was set at the 0.05 level for all performed tests.\n\n【41】Results\n\n【42】Baseline evaluations of the two groups\n\n【43】There was no difference between groups in terms of age， body mass index and the duration of pain before study enrolment . Only work status differed between groups. For G1， nine subjects were still at work (23.7%)， 20 were on sick leave (52.6%)， six were unemployed (15.8%) and three were retired (7.9%)， while the 30CLBP patients in G2 were still at work (100%)； Table 1.\n\n【44】Patients of G2 presented significant differences in comparison with the patients of G1 for disability (p=0.002， Rolland Morris questionnaire)， pain repercussion (p=0.039 for the item DA； p=0.003 for the item W/L； p=0.014 for the global score of Dallas questionnaire). In the same way， some significant differences appeared between the two groups for flexibility of the posterior muscle chain (finger-to-floor distance)， with a difference of6.0±11.5 cm (p=0.024)， and the holding time ofthe Ito-Shirado test， with a difference of 20.8±41.2 sec.(p=0.045)； Table 3.\n\n【45】Post-treatment evaluation\n\n【46】Multidisciplinary care program (G1)： The 4 weeks of the multidisciplinary care program allowed a significant improvement in all the parameters measured.

As expected， these same results occurred in the multidisciplinary care program.\n\n【59】The interest in offering several types of physical activities supervised to patients was to provide them with positive experiences in a safe environment to demonstrate that movement is not necessarily associated with the occurrence of pain or increased pain 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. This method， named graded exposure to physical activity 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>， notably reduces kinesiophobia and increases self-efficacy in low back pain patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>.Ogston et al. stated that the decrease in kinesiophobia would come from an awareness of the possibility of safely engaging in physical activity 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>. Thus， the reduction in kinesiophobia in our study could explain the significant improvement in other pain-related parameters.Indeed，kinesiophobia is one of the mediators of disability in this population 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. Moreover， the decrease in kinesiophobia seems to be the cause of the improvement in physical parameters as well. Indeed， in order to improve physical abilities， it is necessary to offer a longer training period than the one we tested in our study. In this sense， Hakkinen et al. showed that in order to obtain physiological improvement in muscle function such as muscle hypertrophy， it was necessary to follow a period of muscle strengthening longer than 10weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. To improve neuromuscular parameters， the literature has also demonstrated the need for a training period longer than 2 weeks通用删除6(英):<u>[32-341</u>.\n\nIn the current study， at baseline， G2 presented significant differencesregardingrepercussion ofpain and disability in comparison with G1. In the literature， scores on the Dallas questionnaire are close to those of our G1， with scores for the daily activities and the work and leisure activities items generally between 50% and 60%， and for the anxiety-depression and the social interest items between 30%and 40% 通用删除6(英):<u>[35，36]</u>. This statement also applies for the Roland Morris disability questionnaire， for which the mean score for CLBP patients in the literature is usually around 12 a.u 通用删除6(英):<u>[37，38]</u>. With regard to the impact of the pain， the differences encountered in our study between the two groups could be explained by the fact that the patients in|删除段之间换行|G2 were still in professional activity. Indeed， workers with CLBP should maintain at least a sufficient level of physical activity to meet the physical demands of their jobs 通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u>. This result was recently confirmed by the study of Davergne et al.， which demonstrated that CLBP patients who were still at work presented better performance in endurance and flexibility tests 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> than CLBP patients who were benefiting from a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program 通用删除6(英):<u>[41，42]</u>. This result was evidenced equally in our study， with a significant difference in favor of G2 compared to G1 for the physical parameters at baseline. That is why it is necessary to propose early management to CLBP workers in order to avoid， in particular， a progression of kinesiophobia， which would limit physical activities 431.\n\n【61】There are a few limitations of the present study. First， the participants were not randomized because the choice of the care depended on participants’work status and therapeutic impasse. However， the main objective of this study was not to compare the two forms oftreatment， but to determine the possibility and the impact of a physical activity reconditioning program outside the conventional health care structure over a short period for CLBP workers.\n\n【62】Conclusion\n\n【63】This study demonstrated11thata a short physical1：activity reconditioning program outside the conventionalhealthcare structure is possible， and it can reduce pain and disability as well as increase physical capacities as shown by better muscle endurance and flexibility. In the same way， this program allows， through gradual exposure to physical activity， for the provision of positive experiences to patients， thus leading to a decrease in kinesiophobia and an increase in their physical aptitudes. The promising results of this study show that a short physical activity reconditioning program outside the conventional health care structure is a good alternative to multidisciplinary care for chronic low back pain patients still at work.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The predominant spectrum differs according to racial and geographic differences， with Ultraviolet (UV) - A and visible light often being the wavelengths of action in European countries and visible light in Asian countries. It was reported that in solar urticaria， there is a spectrum of inhibition of wheal formation 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.

Owing to its high cost， omalizumab cannot be easily used. Common sunscreens can protect against UVA and UVB but not visible light； therefore， they cannot protect against solar urticaria caused by visible light， as noted in this case. BB cream was developed in Germany to protect the skin and cover its blemishes. Although there are no studies that provide scientific evidence that BB creams block visible light， we can speculate that， like sunscreens，BB creams also contain zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. However， the zinc oxide and titanium dioxide in BB creams have larger particles than those in sunscreens， allowing them to block visible light and produce an effect similar to that of light shielding. It is also possible that the foundation in BB creams physically blocks visible light. Therefore， it is assumed that BB creams are effective in preventing solar urticaria， which is caused not only by visible light but also by UVA andUVB.\n\n【16】In summary， this case of solar urticaria was identified using irradiation tests as being caused by visible light.

The IF-FDG PET-CT examination showed multiple soft tissue masses and nodules in the left lower lobe had partial central necrosis and abnormal tracer concentration. The nodules， of which the SUV max was 6.7， were considered to have low-grade malignancy possibly.

Immuno-histochemical staining showed that both of the two cells expressed epithelial membrane antigen and thyroid transcription factor-1， of which TTF-1 expressed specifically in mature type II alveolar cells， Clara cells and embryonic alveolar epithelial cells. Further studies found that the expression of CK pan， CK-7， CAM5.2 and surfactant proteins were only positive in the surface cells， and barely he in round cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-8]</u>. Therefore， the researchers concluded that the|删除段之间换行|In the past pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma was considered to be benign. However， with more and more cases about PSH with lymph node or liver metastases reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>， many researchers believe that PSH have malignant potential. There is also another reported case which showed relapse as a bone metastasis after surgery， which initially showed node metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. As the same as benign tumor， the prognosis of PSH is good. Surgical resection of the lesion is the main treatment for PSH 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. The conventional procedures include partial lung resection， pulmonary lobectomy， and systemic lymphadenectomy in case of lymph node metastases. The preoperative diagnosis of PSH is difficult， for it is usually misdiagnosed as adenocarcinoma by intraoperative frozen section. Therefore， postoperative histological and immuno-histochemical examinations are the main way to diagnose PSH.\n\nThe literature search revealed a total of 21 cases reported PSH with lymph node metastases， of which 17 were described in English and 4 were in Chinese. The patients age was between 10 to 70， with an average age of 37.5 and a median age of 36. In these cases； there were 6 males and 15 females， with a gender ratio of 2：5. The average age of males and female was 27 and 40.7， respectively. Of the 21 cases， we found 10 primary tumors were in the left lower lobe， 3 were in the left upper lobe， 2 were in the right upper lobe， and 1was in the right|删除段之间换行|According to the case review， pulmonarysclerosinghemangiomas have the potential of malignancy. Literature review and analysis suggest that lymph node metastasis may be related to the age， sex， tumor size and location of the tumor. Although PSH can be with lymph node metastases， there is no significant difference in prognosis between patients with or without lymph node metastases. Currently， the complete surgical resection of the tumor is still the only effective treatment for PSH.\n\n【18】Although the histogenesis of Pulmonary Sclerosing Hemangioma(PSH) is thought to originate from respiratory epithelial， the molecular mechanisms that mediate its occurrence and development are not clear. Studies showed that highly frequent AKT1 gene mutation could be found in PSH including somatic mutations and copy gains. As we knew， the protein kinase v-AKT Murine Thymoma Viral Oncogene homolog (AKT) plays an important role in cell survival and proliferation， which functions downstream of PI3K通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Recurrent AKT1 mutation was first reported in breast cancers通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. However， the frequency of AKT1 mutations in PSH was much higher than other tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Although AKT1 mutations in PSH are relatively common， approximately 40% of PSHs exhibited neither driver mutation nor CNA mutation (Copy Number Alterations)； this result showed that the epigenetic and genetic origin of PSH had not been determined 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Some studies showed that aberrant mTOR signaling may play a role in the development of PSH， and its vascular nature may be due partially to high levels of VEGF caused by dysregulation of mTOR signaling 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Therefore， PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway may play a role in the occurrence and development of PSH， but the mechanism of action is still not clear. However， the mutation of AKTlwith high abundance was also found in the gene test of this patient， which might provide a guide for the treatment of PSH in the future.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】The preoperative diagnosis of PSH is difficult， postoperative histological and immuno-histochemical examinations are the main way to diagnose PSH. The PSH with lymph node metastasis is relevantly rare. The effective treatment for PSH is surgical resection and it is rarely relapse or metastasize after surgical resection. Completely surgical resection should be the first choice of the treatment due to the risk of malignancy. This uncommon case we delivered shows several gene mutations， including AKT1missense mutation and mTOR missense mutation. Although the medical treatment focus on gene target is not a mainstream， the gene research and further study of PSH is necessary and meaningful.\n\n【21】Ethics Approval and Consent to Participate\n\n【22】This case was approved by the ethics committee of our institution(Tianjin Medical University General Hospital).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Maternal polyphenol consumption benefitting infant health could lead to greater incentive to breastfeed. In order to demonstrate the presence of EA metabolites in breast milk after consumption of PomJ， two healthy women with full-term， exclusively breast-fed infants， consumed 8 ounces of PomJ daily for two weeks. Breast milk and urine samples obtained on day 1， 7 and 14. Samples analyzed with Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify EA metabolites. As a result， mothers had detectable and comparable EA metabolites (DMEAG and UAG) after 14 days of PomJ consumption. This pilot study demonstrates the presence of EA metabolites in breast milk after consumption of PomJ. Delivering phenolic compounds via breast milk could be a way to promote infant health and development.\n\n【2】Keywords： Ellagic acid metabolites； Pomegranate juice； Breastfeeding； Breast milk；Antioxidant； Polyphenols\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Pomegranate (Punica granatum) Juice (PomJ) is remarkable in containing Ellagitannins (ETs)， the largest known polyphenol antioxidant in a beverage with greater antioxidant activity than either red wine or green tea 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In addition， pomegranate extract inhibits the proliferation of human cancer cells and modulates inflammatory subcellular signal pathways and apoptosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In recent years， most health advantages of pomegranate have been attributed to the presence of ETs， mainly punicalagins and Ellagic Acid (EA) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-4]</u>. During processing of the whole fruits， ETs are extracted in significant amounts， subsequently enrichingpomegranate juice with at least 2 g/L of punicalagins通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Research from our group and others have showed what appeared in the plasma after ET ingestion was EA. ETs are hydrolyzed in the intestine and absorbed as EA over six hours after administration of 6 ounces of Pomegranate Juice (PJ) 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-8]</u>. After PJ consumption， the remaining ETs and EA are retained unabsorbed in the gut lumen where they likely interact with the complex intestinal bacteria of the microbiome. Previous research from our laboratory and others has shown that bacteria in the intestine are able to form a family of urolithins from the EA remaining in the gut 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，9，10]</u>. There is individual variation of individuals to produce either urolithin A， urolithin B， isourolithin or to be non-producers 通用删除6(英):<u>[11-13]</u>. These differences called metabotypes have also been related to biomarkers for cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases ofaging 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>.\n\n【5】Breast feeding plays a critical role in the psychological and physical well-being of the newborn infant. It has been established that prebiotic carbohydrates， found in breast milk as the third most common component after lipids and lactose， support the development of specific bacterial species which may aid in the establishment of the immune system 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. ETs affect bacteria in the adult gut with acute and chronic exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> and could also affect the microbiome of newborn infants. Demonstrating health benefits of pomegranate consumption on infant health couldlead to greater incentive for women to breast feed. This case report is to demonstrate for the first time whether pomegranate metabolites are secreted into breast milk.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】Subjects\n\n【8】A total of 2 healthy women with full term infants， exclusively breastfed， were in this case report.\n\n【9】Table 1： Characteristics of the study participants.\n\n|  | Case 1  | Case 2  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mother age (year)  | 41  | 37  |\n| Gestational Age at delivery (weeks)  | 38.7  | 40.0  |\n| Infant age at start of PJ (month)  | 1.5  | 6  |\n| Ethnicity of mother  | Caucasian  | Chinese  |\n| Ethnicity of infant  | Caucasian  | Chinese/Caucasian  |\n\n【11】Informed consent was obtained， the participants were investigators and it was a pilot study. The study protocol is now in place and approved by IRB. The demographic data is shown in Table 1. Both mothers were in excellent health without any chronic medical conditions. Both infants were delivered vaginally at an academic medical center without any complications.\n\n【12】The mothers consumed 8 oz of pomegranate juice (POM Wonderful LLC， Los Angeles， CA) daily for 2 weeks. Mothers were asked to maintain their usual diet pattern and abstain from consuming other polyphenol-rich foods during this 2-week period. Breast milk and urine samples were obtained from the mothers on day 1 and day删除4-1:<u>14</u>. For breast milk collection， the nipple was cleaned with cloth； 10ml of expressed milk was collected and frozen immediately.\n\n【13】Reagents and instruments\n\n【14】All solvents were HPLC grade and purchased from Fisher Scientific (Tustin， CA， USA). The HPLC-UV analyses were carried out on a Waters Alliance 2690 system equipped with a photo diode array detector (Waters Corp.， Milford， MA， USA) and data was processed using Waters Millennium software， version 3.02.\n\n【15】LC-MS/MS Analyses of pomegranate juice metabolites in breast milk and urine\n\n【16】One mL urine samples were processed as previous reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.5 mL breast milk was mixed with 20 mL acetonitrile by vortex. The mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The acetonitrile phase was dried using speedvac and reconstituted in 1 mL water， and further purified using by Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE) on C18cartridges (Waters WAT 036945) and eluted with 2 mL methanol. The elutant was SpeedVac to dry， reconstituted in 200 pl methanol：water1：1 (v：v)， and analyzed for ETs and ET metabolites， Dimethyl Ellagic Acid Glucuronide (DMEAG) and Urolithin A-Glucuronide (UAG) by LC-MS/MS system to determine the presence and levels of as previously reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Each breast milk and urine samples were separately extracted three times. The concentrations were estimated based on urolithin A standard. The conversion of UAG to UA was estimated by using B-glucuronidase to catalyze hydrolysis of β-D-glucuronic acid residues from UAG in human urine samples.\n\n【17】Table 2： Levels of PomJ metabolites in urine and breast milk.\n\n| I.D.  | Day  | Urine (nmol/L)  |  | Breast Milk (nmol/L)  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | UAG  | DMEAG  | UAG  | DMEAG  |\n| Case 1  | 1  | 3931±294  | 128±14  | 5.93±1.48  | 0.40±0.20  |\n|  | 7  | 17785±985  | 567±59  | 24.82±3.59  | 1.12±0.30  |\n|  | 14  | 16564±726  | 596±39  | 36.28±4.58  | 0.53±0.23  |\n| Case 2  | 1  | ND  | ND  | ND  | ND  |\n|  | 7  | 150±18  | 69±9  | ND  | ND  |\n|  | 14  | 7647±664  | 671±23  | 21.52±3.35  | 0.92±0.23  |\n| Detection Limit  |  | 12.37  | 1.0  | 4.95  | 0.40  |\n\n【19】Data are mean±STD (n=3). below detectable limit\n\n【20】Results\n\n【21】In these 2 subjects tested for the presence of conjugated EA and UA (DMEAG and UAG) in breast milk， both of them had detectable and comparable DMEAGand UAG after 14 day’s PomJ consumption. In the urine， the concentrations of DMEAG and UAG were at much higher concentration compared to breast milk. For both subjects， a trend of increase of DMEAG and UAG concentration was observed from day 1-14. The absence of DMEAG in breast milk was associated with absence or very low DMEAG in the urine .\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】To the best of our knowledge， this is the first human case report describing the presence of ellagic acid metabolites in the breast milk. Pomegranate has a long history of use for medicinal purposes 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. The potent antioxidant property as well as other biological activities of pomegranate has been mainly attributed hydrolysable tannins(ETs) including punicalagins and EA as well as anthocyanins and other polyphenols found in pomegranate extract and juice 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Pomegranate ETs are hydrolyzed to EA in the stomach. EA can then be absorbed into the bloodstream or further transformed to bacterial-derived metabolites including urolithins A-D in the intestine. Urolithins can be absorbed from the colon， conjugated， and excreted in the urine 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，9，10]</u>. Depending on the individual's gut microbiota， variability of the urolithin formation has been observed. Among healthy overweight/obese individuals about 57% formed urolithin A(UA)， 31% urolithin B (UB) and 12% did not form urolithins 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，13]</u>. EA and urolithins are both bioavailable. Our previous bioavailability study demonstrated that after consumption of 180 mL of PomJ the metabolite DMEAG occurred the same day and plasma EA reached the maximum concentration at 0.06 umol/L + 0.01 umol/L 1 h after PomJ consumption. While an increase from 0.04 umol/L to 0.11umol/L of conjugated urolithin A in plasma occurred between 0.5 and6 h and in all participants conjugated UA and UB occurred in urine24 h after consumption of PomJ通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. It is interesting to see that breast milk containing UAG at the level between 5 nmol/L to 36 nmol/L(0.005 umol/L to 0.036 umol/L)， within the range of previous plasma UAGlevel 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. More and more evidence has indicated that EA as well as its microbial metabolite urolithins are involved in many biological activities. The antioxidant， anti-inflammation， and antimutagenic effects of EA have been studied 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.Furthermore， neonatal Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in human newborns with motor and cognitive sequelae frequently seen in survivors 通用删除6(英):<u>[18，19]</u>. HIE has been associated with increases in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and recent studies suggest that new avenues of treatments of neonatal HIE should include selective responses to the generation of oxidative damage通用删除6(英):<u>[20，21]</u>. Phenolic phytochemicals are known for their antioxidant capacity， and studies have indicated the neuroprotective effects of dietary supplementation with food rich in phenolic compounds， such as green tea polyphenol EGCG，blueberry， and pomegranate 通用删除6(英):<u>[22-27]</u>.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】Breast milk is the perfect nutrition for infants， a result of millions of years of evolution. In addition to providing a source of nutrition， breast milk contains a diverse array of microbiota and a myriad of biologicaly active components that are thought to guide the infant's developing mucosal immune system as well as neonatal gut microbiota. In this case report， we showed for the first time that ellagic acid metabolites (DMEAG and UAG) are present in the breast删除1换行milk， and the concentrations are within the range of blood levels. This report provides the basis for future study to investigate the impact of phenolic compounds in breast milk on neonatal brain development and their role in the development of the neonatal gut microbiome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This patient received a transplanted kidney from her mother because of chronic renal failure. She developed chronic humoral immune transplant rejection (chronic renal rejection) four months before developing BP， and her BP started at the same time as acute cell-mediated immune graft rejection (acute renal rejection). After one month of BP treatment， her BP showed improvement， but the titer of anti-BP 180 non-collagenous16a (NC16a) antibody remained in a high range. The recrudescence of her BP would be cause for concern is apprehensive because of the high titer of anti-BP 180 NC16a antibody. Type XVII collagen (BP180) is a common antigen between the skin and kidney. Her BP and the high titer of anti-BP 180 NC16a antibody might be related to the transplant tissue. We were concerned about the recurrence of the BP， and we removed the transplanted kidney. After three weeks of nephrectomy， her skin condition was improved， and the anti-BP 180 NC16a antibody titer was quickly reduced. We present the case of BP in a young female， and six other cases of BP in younger people (less than30 years old) related to the rejection ofa transplanted kidney have been reported.\n\n【2】Keywords： Bullous pemphigoid； Kidney； Nephrectomy； Rejection； Transplantation； Type XVII collagen\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Bullous Pemphigoid(BP) usually occurs in elderly people， and cases of this disease in individuals younger than 30 years old are rare. Diseases that can be comorbid with BP include Diabetes Mellitus(DM)， dementia， Parkinson’s disease， autoimmune diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>， and psoriasis vulgaris 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. Cases of BP related to renal transplantation are rare， with a total of seventeen such cases having been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-20]</u> . Only six BP cases related to renal transplant rejection in individuals less than thirty years old have been reported in addition to our case  通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6，8，11，12，15]</u>. These BP cases might be related to immune cross-reactivity between epidermal and glomerular basement membrane antigens 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. One effective treatment for BP related to renal allograft rejection is nephrectomy.\n\n【5】A 24-year-old female developed bullas， erosion， and erythema on her whole body， and her skin condition did not improve. She had not been eating well due to oral mucous and tongue erosion， and her skin condition worsened. Our diagnosis was BP based on the clinical findings ， the results of skin biopsy (subepidermal bulla and mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils infiltrate， superficial and deep perivascular dermatitis) ， and the high titer of anti-BP180 non-collagenous 16a (NC16a) antibody (2980 U/ml) . The Bullous Pemphigoid Disease Area Index (BPDAI) scores were bulla and erosion 53/120， erythema 30/120， and mucous membrane11/120.\n\n【6】Her medical history is as follows. Chronic renal failure of unknown origin started at thirteen years of age， and she received renal transplantation from her mother nine years ago. The origin of her chronic renal failure was not detected. She developed chronic humoral immune transplant删除1换行rejection (chronic renal rejection) and restarted dialysis beginning at twenty three years of age， and then (after four months) she developed acute cell-mediated immune graft rejection (acute renal rejection) and BP at twenty four years old.\n\n【7】We began treating her BP using steroid ointment， steroid tablets(prednisolone 15 mg/day； 7.5 mg/day for immunosuppression and7.5 mg/day for BP treatment) and antihistamine tablets. After one month of treatment，her skin condition and BPDAI score improved， although her anti-BP180 NC16a antibody titer remained high (2820U/ml) . Because the high titer of BP-180 NC16a antibody might have been caused by the transplanted kidney， we removed the transplanted kidney at seven weeks of BP treatment. After the allograft was removed， the titer of BP-180 NC16a antibody quickly decreased. Thirteen weeks after the transplanted kidney was removed， her skin condition was good (BPDAI score： Bulla 0/120， erythema0/120 and mucous membrane 0/120) and then the dose of steroid gradually were decreased with the improvement of her skin condition and the titer of BP-180 NC16a antibody .\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Generally， BP is a chronic autoimmune blistering skin disease in elderly people. Patients with BP usually contract comorbid diseases such as DM， dementia， Parkinson's disease， or autoimmune diseases. Our patient did not exhibit any of these comorbid diseases. Based on the course of her BP， the development of BP in this case might have been related to chronic and acute renal rejection and we speculated that our patient's BP was caused by an immune cross-reaction between herskin and allograftkidney. The target ofthe autoimmune reaction in BP is located in the skin， basement membrane， and hemidesmosome通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. There are three protein molecules， namely plectin， BP 230， and BP180 (Type XVII collagen： BPAg2) in the extracellular components of the basement membrane. Type XVII collagen (BPAg2) is a component of hemidesmosome， an adhesion molecule in the skin basement membrane. The main target of BP is type XVII collagen(BP180) 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>，and many BP patients possess autoantibodies against the extracellular NC16a domain of collagen XVII 通用删除6(英):<u>[23-25]</u>.Recently， type XVII collagen was detected in the glomerular basement membrane 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> in a report that connected skin and kidney immune reactions. Matsumura 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> reported that anti-basement membrane autoantibodies react with the NC16a domain of BPAG2. The titer of anti-BP 180 (anti-BPAg2) antibodies is used to determine the删除表格换行activity of BP 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>. Patients with DM， dementia， Parkinson’s disease， and autoimmune diseases may be at risk of developing BP if they possess a positive titer of anti-BP 180 antibodies. Suzanne et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> described that the occurrence of anti-BPAg2 antibodies may be secondarily triggered by the initial cutaneous aggression through the phenomenon of epitope-spreading. Hashimoto et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> found that the analysis of epitope-spreading in skin diseases may provide insight into pathogenic mechanisms in transplantation immunity. Type XVII collagen was detected in the glomerular basement membrane 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>， and it is a common antigen between the skin and kidney. In these reports， type XVII collagen (BPAg2) is an essential antigen in the mechanisms of epitope-spreading in BP in patients with transplanted tissue. We speculate that antibodies against the BP-180 antigens in the skin and glomerular basement membrane could have been produced via epitope-spreading during chronic renal rejection， and an immune reaction between BP antigens and anti-BP180 antibodies might have been provoked during acute renal rejection in this case. A quick decrease of the titer of BP-180 NC16a antibody occurred after the nephrectomy，and this suggests that the slow change of the titer of BP-180 NC16a antibody after the skin improved could be related to the allograft kidney. Patients with BP sometimes develop comorbid diseases， possibly due to the presence of type XVII collagen in the bladder， buccal mucosa， conjunctiva， and neurons of the central nervous system， ocular cornea， placenta， retina， upper esophagus， and umbilical cord 通用删除6(英):<u>[30-33]</u>. Careful observation of elderly people with diseases in these tissues is needed， with a focus on the potential for developing BP.\n\n【10】Table 1： Cases of BP related to renal allagraft rejection.\n\n| Age  | Sex  | Type of Graft Rejection Reaction  | Reference No  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 10  | F  | Chronic  | 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>  |\n| 9  | M  | Chronic  |  |\n| 15  | F  | Chronic  | 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>  |\n| 27 13  | M M  | Chronic Chronic  | 通用删除6(英):<u>[111 </u>通用删除6(英):<u>[121  </u>|\n| 15  | F  | Chronic  | 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>  |\n| 25  | F  | Chronic Acute  | Our case  |\n| 47  | F M  | Chronic Chronic  | 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>  |\n| 5246  | M  | Acute  | 通用删除6(英):<u>[101  </u>|\n| 5246  | M  | Acute  | 通用删除6(英):<u>[101  </u>|\n| 50  | M  | Chronic  | 通用删除6(英):<u>[121  </u>|\n| 39  | M  | Chronic  | 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>  |\n| 59  | F  | Chronic  | 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>  |\n| 34  | F  | Chronic  | 通用删除6(英):<u>[171  </u>|\n| 49  | M  | Chronic  | 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>  |\n| 32  | M  | Unknown  | 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>  |\n| 63  | M  | Acute  | 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>  |\n| 46  | F  | Chronic  | 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>  |\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】A 24-year-old young female developed bullous pemphigoid related to allograft renal rejection with the high titer of anti-BP180NC16a antibody.

Primary care as well as specialists in busy practices needs to have access to quick and effective tools in order to screen for cognitive dysfunction. This case highlights an adult with worsening cognition and the utility of Mini-COG as a screening tool.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 67 year old female was referred to the Geriatric clinic by her primary care provider for gradual memory loss. Past medical history was positive for hypothyroidism， pre-diabetes， dyslipidemia， osteopenia and significant unintentional weight loss. Patient had no history of depression. Her medications were levothyroxine， atorvastatin， and Vitamin D3. Patient had lived by herself for many years， was divorced， had no children， and no close family. She was accompanied to the office visit by one of her neighbors who provided the collateral information regarding problems with thought process， judgment and memory， difficulty with remembering medical appointments， how to take medications， and how to use a tool or appliance. Moreover， patient had difficulty with meal preparation，balancing a checkbook， paying her bills， and had gotten lost in the neighborhood where she had lived for over twenty years. The neighbors had noticed the decline for the past few years， but they did not get involved in her care as she did not solicit any help， and was seeing her PCP and specialists. However they stepped in due to safety concerns when the patient got lost driving in the neighborhood and accompanied her to her PCP office visits to express their concerns.\n\n【6】Prior to the Geriatric medicine referral by her PCP， patient had been reported for self neglect to Adult Protective Services， and a case had been opened pending conservatorship from her remote family.\n\n【7】On geriatric review of systems，patienthad unintentional weight loss of about 75 lbs， from 199lbs in 2016 to 124 lbs in 2019. She reported difficulty with gait and balance， anxiety and depression with apathy alternating with irritability and agitation， mild bilateral hearing loss， and urge incontinence. Her Activities of Daily Living (ADL) were 5 out of 6 (she needed help and reminders for eating) and she was dependent in all Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)-0/8 (she was not able to take her medications， use the phone， prepare meals， manage money， drive， do moderate housework， laundry， shop for groceries， or get to places beyond walking distance by bus， or taxi).\n\n【8】On physical exam， patient looked older than her stated age. She was oriented to person， but not to place and time. Motor bulk was diminished throughout， gait and stance were impaired， and she was not able to follow directions. She made poor eye contact and her speech was slow， hesitant， monotonous and dull with long pauses. She demonstrated lability， irritability， anger and anxiety. Thought process was incoherent， illogical and irrelevant to topics being discussed， with tangential speech and circumstantialities. Memory， concentration， and attention were impaired and she had no decision making capacity.\n\nHer geriatric screenings were positive for malnutrition， alcohol use-AUDIT C positive， anxiety(GAD-2)， and depression (PHQ-2). Her cognitive screen (Mini-Cog) was 0/5. Her Montreal|删除段之间换行|Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA)was7/30. She scored 1/5 on visuo-spatial/executive function-failed the trail and copying a cube.

Scored 2/3 on naming， 1/6 on attention， 2/3on language， 0/2 on abstraction， 0/5 on delayed recall， was not able to use cues or multiple choices， and scored 1/6 on orientation.\n\n【10】Laboratory results revealed a normal Complete Blood Count(CBC) and a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP). TSH was over suppressed at 0.07 (N 0.4-4.5)， and fT4 was 2.0 (N 0.8-1.8). Because the patient had been neglectful to take care of her medical insurance， and lost her Medicare part B， brain imaging studies could not be obtained.\n\n【11】Patient was diagnosed with cognitive impairment and self neglect and assistance with ADL and IADL was recommended.Due to her cognitive impairment， she was unable to prepare meals and eat properly and hence had a significant unintentional weight loss. Moreover due to her confusion in taking her thyroid medication correctly， her levels were over suppressed. She had been missing follow up appointments and serial blood work for over eighteen months with her PCP. All these in retrospect were significant red flags for cognitive impairment， and should have led to an earlier cognitive screening， detailed cognitive assessment as well as multi-disciplinary approach to her multiple medical and social issues. Given the significant delay in diagnosing cognitive impairment， by the time of the encounter in the Geriatric clinic， patient had no decision making capacity and unfortunately no durable power of attorney in place which led to the recommendation for conservatorship.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Cognitive impairment， social assessment and decline in functional status\n\n【14】The prevalence of cognitive impairment doubles every 5 years after the age of 65 and approaches 40% to 50% at the age of 90. Many patients with dementia do not complain of memory loss or even volunteer symptoms of cognitive impairment unless specifically asked. Therefore， an important feature of assessment in older adults should be a brief cognitive screening.\n\n【15】A social assessment of the older adult should include the evaluation of a personal support system， emergency contact， safety of the home environment， need for a caregiver， and the patient's advanced directive. If a patient lives alone and there is no help available， referral to a home health service will assist in determining home safety and level of personal risk.\n\n【16】In older adults， the rapid decline in functional status is usually precipitated by infections， such as urinary tract infections or pneumonia， injuries， such as a fall resulting in hip fractures， or other events such as stroke， or heart failure exacerbation. However， in about a third of the patients， the functional decline is due to loss of compensatory strategies in highly vulnerable and frail older adults under stress and with a low reserve capacity.\n\n【17】Geriatric screening\n\n【18】Geriatric screening， which focuses on target areas， followed by detailed assessment in the areas of concern， is a valuable tool in a busy office. Some of these targeted areas are also mandatory parts of the Medicare Annual Wellness visit-such as functional ability and level of safety， nutrition， depression and cognitive impairment.\n\n【19】Screening for cognitive impairment\n\n【20】It is important for primary care providers to be alert to the early symptoms of cognitive impairment， such as behavioral or personality changes，difficultiesin followingmedicalrecommendations，managing medications， recurrent hospitalizations due to errors in medication management， concerns for safety reported by family， caregivers， or neighbors， and functional decline. If a patient lives alone， and there is no available informant to interview， the evaluation becomes more difficult， and a home health referral for a visiting nurse and/or social workers could be helpful for gathering more information.\n\n【21】Mini-Cog is a short screening tool that combines a three-word recall and a clock drawing test and is useful in a busy clinical practice to screen for cognitive dysfunction， including executive dysfunction通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【22】Case based discussion\n\n【23】For our case the timely cognitive screening and safety evaluation had been missed， which resulted in delay of diagnosis and treatment to the point that patient had severe functional and cognitive decline， was lacking decision making capacity， and needed conservatorship.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】In the current practice， the diagnosis of cognitive impairment occurs as a result of clinician suspicion based on patient presentation， and family concerns， and not as a result of routine systematic and formal screening. As such， it is estimated that up to 70% of patient with cognitive impairment are undiagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【26】Clinicians need to be able to recognize the clinical presentations for cognitive impairment and dementia for makinga correct diagnosis in atimely manner， and for addressing the safety concerns early in the process.\n\n【27】Since 2011， cognitive screening for adults over 65 years of age has been recommended by Center of Medicare Services (CMS)，and it is a component of the Medicare Annual Wellness visit， with the initial visit， and annually as appropriate 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【28】In 2014 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation regarding screening for cognitive impairment， noted that “although the overall evidence on routine screening is insufficient， clinicians should remain alert to early signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment (for example， problems with memory or language) and evaluate as appropriate\"通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【29】The Alzheimer’s Association published in 2013 guidance on the cognitive impairment screening by using of a brief structured assessment 通用删除1(英):<u>(such as the Mini-Cog Test， Alzheimer’s Disease8-Item Informant Interview， or the short version of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly)</u> if concern of cognitive impairment， or no collateral information 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【30】As such， the Mini-COG Test has been proven to be reliable and efficient in busy practices.\n\n【31】For people who screen positive for cognitive impairment， one should consider referral to a geriatrician， neurologist and/or to behavioral health provider for formal cognitive/neuropsychological evaluation.\n\n【32】删除6:<u>1.

Typically， compartment syndrome is associated with high energy injuries which impart significant damage on the surrounding tissues， but it is important to recognize that compartment syndrome can develop after low energy injuries as well. It is the job of the orthopedic surgeon to maintain a high level of suspicion in order to diagnose and appropriately treat these patients. Our case highlights an atypical presentation of anterior thigh compartment syndrome following an acute quadriceps tendon rupture and addresses the management from diagnosis through treatment.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Acute Compartment Syndrome (ACS) can be a devastating complication associated with significant morbidity in the orthopedic patient. Compartment syndrome occurs when the pressure in a confined space rises， resulting in a reduction of blood flow to the tissues within the space， leading to ischemia， necrosis and functional impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. ACS is typically associated with high energy injuries， but recent literature has demonstrated a significant proportion of ACS associated with lower energy injuries. Classically the signs of ACS include pain out of proportion to exam and pain with passive stretch， with late findings including pulselessness and paresthesias. Risk factors associated with the development of ACS include anticoagulant use，younger age，polytrauma，altered level of conscious and associated nerve injury. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are paramount as a delay in diagnosis is the main factor associated with significant sequela and treatment failure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>.\n\n【4】This article describes the case of a 67 year old man who developed anterior thigh compartment syndrome following an acute quadriceps tendon rupture sustained after a ground level fall 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. To our knowledge there is only a single case report documenting ACS following a quadriceps tendon rupture， and it is our goal to raise awareness regarding this clinical entity.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】An obese male with a history of atrial fibrillation on Xarelto 20 mg QD presented to our ED after a groundlevel fall onto a hyper flexed right knee with thigh pain and inability to ambulate. He was initially evaluated by a non-orthopedic physician and diagnosed with a quadriceps strain， placed in a knee immobilizer and discharged home. He was not evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon on his initial emergency room visit.\n\n【7】The patient returned to the ED the next day with significantly worsening pain， paresthesias， and noted his thigh had become“hard like a rock”.On examination the patient appeared uncomfortable and was diaphoretic. Upon evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon he was found to be unable to perform a straight leg raise and had a palpable defect at the superior pole of the patella， and was diagnosed with a quadriceps tendon rupture with suspected complete medial and lateral retinacular tears. Even though we were unable to assess pain with passive stretch due to the disruption of his extensor mechanism there was great concern for acute compartment syndrome of the anterior thigh based on his clinical picture 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. His anterior thigh was swollen compared to the left， measuring 58cm compared to 55 cm (both measured 10 cm proximal to the superior pole of the patella). He had developed diffuse bruising over the anterior and anterolateral aspect of his thigh with a firm anterior compartment and little swelling of the medial and posterior compartments. Paresthesias were present over the anterolateral thigh but were neurovascularly intact distally. The decision was made to take the patient to the operative room emergently fasciotomy and possible quadriceps repair.\n\nPrior to the procedure the anterior compartment pressure was measured with the use of a|删除段之间换行|Stryker Intra-Compartmental Pressure Monitor System (Stryker， Kalamazoo， Michigan)， and found to be 85 mmHg. The diagnosis of compartment syndrome was confirmed and we proceeded with the surgery.\n\n【9】In reference to Kuri et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> we proceeded with a longitudinal midline incision made over the anterior aspect of the knee. Upon incision of the fascia there was a gross extrusion of approximately 500cc of clot as well as an additional 500 cc of hematoma， significantly decreasing the pressure in the anterior compartment. This fascial incision was then extended proximally to the level of the proximal thigh and distally past the inferior pole of the patella and all remaining hematoma and clot was removed. Further inspection of the anterior compartment revealed an avulsion of the quadriceps tendon off the superior pole of the patella， and no continued source of bleeding was identified. Throughout the case the color， consistency， contraction， and circulation of the quadriceps muscle was continually evaluated. A small portion of the medial VMO was found to be dusky in appearance and was debrided， while the rest of the musculature was deemed viable. We then performed a repair of the quadriceps tendon with #2 fiber wire and bone tunnel construct， followed by repair of the medial and lateral retinacula. Superficial and deep Hemovac drains were placed and the wound was primarily closed and dressed with a negative pressure dressing and placed into a Knee immobilizer.\n\n【10】After the procedure the patient's symptoms of intractable thigh pain had resolved. His post-operative course was uneventful. At 8month follow up the patient has full active and passive ROM of the right knee 0 to 120 degrees of flexion without extensor lag. There is minimalstrength asymmetrybetweenthe operative and non-operative knee with mild palpable decrease in muscle bulk most notable over the VMO. The patient was able to ambulate independently without the use of an assistive device.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Acute compartment syndrome of the thigh is a rare clinical entity that is typically seen in high energy injuries with associated femoral shaft fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>， but none theless， ACS of the thigh has been shown to occur in lower energy injuries as well. Rupture of the quadriceps tendon is a relatively common injury， but is rarely associated with the development of ACS 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. To our knowledge there is only a single case report documenting the development of acute anterior thigh compartment syndrome following an acute quadriceps tendon rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. It is our goal to bring light to this distinct clinical entity as well as highlight patients at risk for developing this complication.\n\n【13】Certain risk factors predispose patients to developing ACS，and in our situation anticoagulant use was a contributing factor. Previously reported risk factors for the development of ACS include direct thigh trauma，anticoagulant use， coagulopathy， older age， neurologic deficit， and crush or vascular injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. On initial presentation our patient bar did not demonstrate evidence of compartment syndrome. Over the next 24 h he continued to bleed into his thigh， likely influenced by his anticoagulation use， and presented back to the hospital with an evolving compartment syndrome of the anterior thigh. The posterior and medial compartments remained soft and were seemingly uninvolved which was similar to the previously reported case.\n\n【14】The vascular supply to the anterior knee is derived from the rich anastomotic network formed by the geniculate arteries which are branches off the popliteal artery. No identifiable source of bleeding was found intraoperatively， which supports the idea that a network of smaller vessels were disrupted， and an effective clot was only formed once a significant tamponade was achieved. After decompression and hematoma removal the thigh was soft and the decision was made to perform a tension free closure at the time of surgery. This goes against the traditional thinking that fasciotomies should not be closed acutely， but based on our intraoperative findings and after removal of a large space occupying lesion we felt this to be appropriate. Both the medial and posterior compartments remained soft and were found to have minimal swelling so no intervention was deemed necessary.\n\n【15】Preoperatively， the decision to hold the patient's anticoagulation was clear， but when it is safe to restart is not as clear cut. Based on our experience the patient's chemical anticoagulant was held after his injury and for two weeks following surgery. There is no evidence defining a timeline for restarting anticoagulation following ACS， but our decision was made once the patient’s wound showed no drainage and demonstrated minimal and improving clinical swelling of the thigh.\n\n【16】The clinical impact of ACS cannotbe understated as compartment syndrome is routinely associated with worse outcomes compared to similar fractures without ACS. Due to this there are also significant medicolegal ramifications for all parties involved. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are paramount， as a delay in diagnosis is linearly related to the value of the indemnity payment and any decompression performed within 8 h was uniformly associated with a successful defense 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. ACS most commonly is seen in high energy injuries， but this case demonstrates the possibility of ACS developing following lower energy soft tissue injuries in at risk patients.\n\n【17】In conclusion， all consultations for compartment syndrome should be taken seriously. Frequently it is the responsibility of the orthopedic surgeon to appropriately diagnose these injuries， and timely management is essential to improve outcomes and prevent further complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The disease is characterized by systemic illness， pain and soft tissue swelling with visible radiographic alterations in bone. The most common bacteria isolated in cases of osteomyelitis in dogs and cats are Staphylococcus spp. (60% of cases)， followed by Escherichia coli and Streptococcus spp. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. To our knowledge， this is the first canine case of Salmonella spp. osteomyelitis.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 7 months old， male mixed breed dog weighing 16.5 kg was presented to XXX for worsening lameness on the right hind limb from 3 weeks. No other clinical sign was present. The dog was adopted from Sicily 4 weeks earlier， regularly vaccinated but without prophylaxis for ectoparasites. Other anamnestic information was unknown.\n\n【4】On presentation， the physical examination revealed poor body condition (BCS of 3/9)， muscular hypotrophy of the right hindlimb and increased thickness of the right femur with algia to palpation. The dog also had generalized lymphadenomegaly. Blood tests and hind limb radiography were performed. Hematologic abnormalities at presentation included normocytic， normochromic， mild regenerative anemia (Hematocrit [Hct] 32.2%)，leukopenia (2.84×10/mL；reference range，6-17×10/mL) characterized by lymphopenia (0.8×10/mL； range 1-4.8×10/mL)， neutropenia 1.69×10'/mL (range 3-12×10/mL) and thrombocytopenia (8×10'/mL； reference range 160-500×10/mL). The blood chemistry panel， including electrolytes， was normal except for hypoalbuminemia(2.02 g/dL； reference range 2.75 g/dL to 3.85 g/dL) and a decreased albumin/globulin ratio (0.46； reference range 0.75-1.35). Electrophoresis showed hypergammaglobulinemia. Coagulation panel was in the range of normality. Indirect Immunofluorescent (IF) assay test was performed on suspicion of an infectious disease， with positivity for Ehrlichia canis with a title of 1：1280. The radiographic exam of the right hind limb  revealed a focal osteopathy with severe mixed proliferative-lytic pattern. In particular， it was evident a focal deformation of the distal third of the femoral diaphysis， characterized by a severe and non-homogeneous increase of the radiopacity of the bone with evidence ofa radiolucent， sharply round， intralesional area. Moreover， there were an extensive proliferation of periosteal bone tissue with “a palisade” aspect， in correspondence with the caudal aspect of the lesion and thickening of the cortical bone involving a large part of the femoral diaphysis. The main differential diagnoses for this type of bone lesion were osteomyelitis or bone abscess with sequestrum (of bacterial or fungal origin) or neoplasia. Therefore， it was decided to carry out a bone biopsy and X-rays of the chest to exclude metastatic involvement. The lesion bone biopsy was performed with the patient under general anesthesia with a Jamshidi needle 10G：Seven bone biopsies were performed， of which four underwent histological examination； two were subjected to bacteriological examination and one to PCR examination for Ehrlichia canis detection. Waiting for the results of biopsy， the patient was placed on doxycycline 7.5 mg/kg BID for the treatment of Ehrlichia canis.\n\n【5】The histological examination revealed a moderate， chroniclympho plasma cellular osteomyelitis with areas of necrosis， severe fibrosis and bone remodeling. The PCR was negative for the presence of Ehrlichia canis， while the bacteriological culture was positive for the presence of Salmonella spp. with isolation of large amounts of the bacteria. A stool test was also performed which was negative for parasitic elements and negative for the presence of Salmonella spp. Accordingtothe antibiogram， Salmonella spp. was sensitive to doxycycline，therefore the already set therapy was kept unchanged. Clinical and radiographic checks were performed once a month for the first three months， then every 3 months up to a year. One month after the start of therapy， the dog was no longer limping. Check blood tests was performed with the resolution of hematological abnormalities. After 6 weeks an additional bone biopsy was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy. Bacteriological\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory condition of bone usually caused by infectious agents， such as bacteria， fungal or viral agents通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>.The condition generally results from iatrogenic or spontaneous inoculation of these agents into traumatic or surgical wounds 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，4]</u>. It can also develops following hematogenous spread to the bone， and occurs relatively more frequently in young than in adult animals， especially in those with predisposing conditions including failure of passive transfer of maternal immunity or concurrent infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Hematogenous osteomyelitis most frequently involve the metaphysis and epiphysis of developing bones in young dogs， and the diaphysis of long bones in adults， and localization within vertebral bodies can also occur 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. Radiographic evaluation is often helpful in successfully diagnosis of osteomyelitis， but the current gold standard is a positive microbial culture. The most common bacteria isolated in cases of osteomyelitis in dogs and cats are Staphylococcus spp.\n\n【8】(circa 60% of cases)， followed by Escherichia coli and Streptococcus spp. Other Gram-negative organisms (e.g.， Pasteurella，Pseudomonas， Proteus， Serratia and Klebsiella species) and Gram-positive organisms(e.g.， Corynebacterium spp.， Enterococci) have also been isolated. Anaerobic organisms should also be taken in consideration (e.g.， Bacteroides， Nocardia， Clostridium， Actinomyces， Fusobacterium)， andpolymicrobial infections are notuncommon. Moreover， fungal agents (e.g.， Blastomyces， Aspergillus， Candida， Cocidioides， Cryptococcus， Histoplasma) have been also isolated， even if not so commonly， and so are viral agents 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. Salmonella is a very rare agent of osteomyelitis and there are only few cases reported in human medicine 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Even if young animals are thought to be predisposed to hematogenous osteomyelitis， in this case we present， the first suspect was a post traumatic osteomyelitis (bite injury or penetrating wound) due to the localization of the lesion and the severe periosteal reaction， usually not present in hematogenous infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. However， being the patient's remote medical history unknown and blood culture not performed， a hematogenous infection cannot be totally excluded. Osteomyelitis can generally be managed medically，but some cases require surgical debridement with removal of sequestrum and necrotic bone or surrounding necrotic soft tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7，11，12]</u>. Antibiotic treatment should be based on an antimicrobial susceptibility test whenever possible. However， until culture and antibiotic susceptibility test results are available， broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. The prognosis of osteomyelitis depends on the time of the presentation， the degree of alteration in bone architecture and response to treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. In the case shown the choice of antimicrobial therapy was based on the outcome of the antibiogram and doxycycline was chosen as a treatment also for Ehrlichia canis.\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】This case represents a rare and unique presentation of Salmonella osteomyelitis in a dog.Osteomyelitis remains a challenge in all animal species commonly encountered in veterinary medicine. A positive culture and the corresponding antibiotic susceptibilitytest are helpful for an effective treatment.

The examiner concluded that based on the severity of the case， the patient was unfit to work. Forensic psychiatric examination is extremely important to guarantee the individual's rights. A detailed study of the case with a complete history and psychopathological examination are essential for a proper assessment.\n\n【2】Keywords： Assessment； Capacity； Anxiety disorder； Stress\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is characterized by increased stress and anxiety following exposure to a traumatic or stressful event. Such events may include witnessing or being involved in an accident or violent crime， assault， kidnapping， natural disaster， or physical or sexual abuse. The person reacts to the experience with fear and powerlessness， persistently reliving the event and attempting to avoid remembering it. The event can be relived both in dreams and in thoughts， when awake (flashbacks) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【5】PTSD is the only psychiatric condition with a defined external event as part of its diagnosis. A situation that risks the person’s physical integrity or life triggers a reaction by the body to be able to survive the threat. Most people overcome the threat， but some do not， and the event then becomes a traumatic memory， relived with great suffering 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【6】Studies have shown that 40% to 60% of people have been exposed to traumatic events， but that only 8% develop PTSD. Women are twice as likely to have PTSD when compared to men (10% and5%， respectively)， even though men are more prone to being exposed to trauma {60% of men and51% of women have undergone traumatic events at some time in their lives) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【7】Stressors related to PTSD are sufficiently devastating to affect nearly everyone. Individuals relive the traumatic event in their dreams and daily thoughts. They persistently avoid anything that brings the event to mind and display blunted responsiveness， along with a state of hypervigilance. Other symptoms are depression， anxiety， and cognitive difficulties such as lack of concentration 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【8】Situations with the greatest potential for the development of mental disorders are those that lead to breaks in the social fabric， in the form of catastrophes， or those caused intentionally by other individuals， through acts that are inconsistent or alien to culture itself， so-called “barbarian acts”such as robberies，kidnappings， rapes， and murder attempts 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>\n\n【9】Various studies in Brazil and elsewhere in the world have aimed to identify the population’s victimization rate 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Andreoli et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> reported that more than half of urban Brazilians in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo reported having experienced a traumatic event some time in their lives. Another study with a Brazilian sample found that 36% of deaths from external causes were the result ofhomicides 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【10】The current article reports the case of a patient with diagnosis of PTSD who underwent forensic psychiatric examination to assess her work capacity.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】Mary， 50 years of age， born in Northeast Brazil， has a complete university education， is married， and is a government employee.\n\n【13】The patient reports that she was hit by two gunshots during an attempt on her life， and that injured her face and neck. The attempted homicide occurred near her home when she had stopped to buybread at a bakery. Mary states she was working at the time as an inspector of a government agency. She underwent various surgical procedures due to the injuries on her face. At the time， she spent one week in a clinical hospital. She believes that the reason she suffered the murder attempt was that she was investigating “shell companies\"， and that she was the victim of a possible reprisal because of her professional activities. She has not returned to her workplace for three years due to the symptoms of anxiety related to the traumatic event.\n\n【14】Since the attack， the patient states that she has only returned a few times to the city where she used to work， and exclusively for forensic medical assessments， always with a police escort， since she suffers“terror and horrible fear” because of the situation she experienced. She says that after the traumatic event， she went “into hiding” for two months at a relative's home.\n\n【15】Mary has been in psychiatric follow-up since the traumatic event and is medicated with various antidepressive and anxiolytic drugs. Her follow-up has continued to the present， and she shows the examiner various medical reports and psychoactive drug prescriptions during the current forensic examination.\n\n【16】The patient further reports that since the attempted homicide，she has suffered constant nightmares， always related to the attack： “I felt afraid， and I still feel afraid that they'll come back.\" She says that since the attempt on her life， she has experienced intrusive thoughts and ideas， that “invade my mind\"， related to scenes from the trauma. She always feels afraid walking on the street， believing that she is being watched by everyone， afraid they will chase her and harm her. She also says that she does not like to talk about the matter， stating that“whenever I’ve talked about it， I’ve always started to cry.\n\n【17】Her fear of leaving home persists to this day， and she reports that she only leaves the house in the company of family members：“Tm afraid the attackers will come back.” She never leaves the house at night. She also states that she has recurrent nightmares， several times a week， related to the traumatic event， which she describes as “getting shot again\".\n\n【18】During her psychiatric examination， the patient is collaborative， promptly answering the questions addressed to her. She is dressed adequately for the occasion， with proper personal hygiene. Awake， alert， well-oriented in time and space. She remains alert during the interview， speaking and articulating her thoughts clearly. When asked to talk about herself， she says， “I’m still very afraid of leaving the house. What if they come back for me， like they've already done once? Whenever I go out on the street， I suspect someone might be following me.\" The patient expresses some recurrent ideas and nightmares involving the traumatic event. She reports suffering a “nervous breakdown\" whenever she thinks of the possibility of resuming her job activities in the city where she used to work. Her memories of recent and distant facts are preserved. Her intelligence is within the删除1换行normal range. Her thinking displays constancy， organization， and continuity. She has prevalent ideas with persecutory and self-referred content. No delusions or hallucinations are present. Her mood is highly anxious. Her volition and pragmatism are jeopardized by her chronic state of anxiety. She is aware ofher condition.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Based on the history of a traumatic event and the symptoms and their evolution， the patient presents a mental condition in the form of posttraumatic stress disorder (F43.1-CID-10)通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【21】Various studies in the literature have emphasized the importance of the triggering stressor and the physical and psychological consequences and functional， work， and social disability associated with posttraumatic stress disorder. An epidemiological study in the United States by Pietrzak et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>， with a sample of 34，653individuals， found that stressors related to threats on one's life were the most frequent stressors in individuals that developed Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PT'SD).\n\n【22】Other studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> have found that interpersonal trauma like the case in question is associated with more symptoms in PTSD， and longer duration of symptoms， when compared to non-interpersonal events (motor vehicle accidents for example). This type of study 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> has pointed not only to greater intensity of PTSD after intentional traumatic events but also greater severity of the disease course(chronicity) and prognosis， as in the current case.\n\n【23】There is ample evidence that victims of serious 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> and intentional crimes 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>， as in the current case， present more emotional and physical consequences， which can lead to feelings of depression， anxiety， and fear of falling victim to crimes again， as with this patient. The stressor in this case was extremely serious， nearly fatal. The patient was attacked by individuals who shot her in the face， and she was hospitalized for a week. Studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> have shown that even an \"indirect trauma”(e.g.， witnessing or knowing that someone was attacked) can trigger PTSD. It is not difficult to imagine that a severe trauma like the one suffered by this patient is a much more intense trigger for the development of this mental disorder.\n\n【24】An important current research topic involves the impact of OpI traumatic events on the quality of life of individuals that have experienced such events. A European study 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> found that two years after the traumatic event， individuals continue to present poor emotional functioning， functional impairment， socioeconomic deficits， andseriously jeopardizedquality of life. Allthese characteristics are present in the current case. The patient， formerly healthy and productive， and having held several important positions in her professional career， now rarely leaves home since the traumatic event， due to fear of a repeat attack. She has avoided her friends(social withdrawal)， feels anxious most of the time， has great difficulty concentrating， and suffers cognitive impairment， in addition to all the psychological suffering after the traumatic event. All these aspects have resulted in evident major harm to her quality oflife.\n\n【25】Although malingering is a differential diagnosis in PTSD 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>， there is no possibility of this behavior happening in the current case. The patient brought extensive medicalandpsychiatric documentation on the day of her forensic examination. The reported and measured symptoms were assessed in detail. The patient’s mental disorder(PTSD) shows a linear and coherent evolution that reflects her true clinical state.\n\n【26】We conclude that the symptoms of the mental disorder presented by the patient (PTSD) are intense and permanent， leading to major subjective suffering and impairment to her quality of life in various domains (physical and emotional health， feeling of wellbeing， autonomy， psychological functioning， social role) and major psychological suffering. The prognosis in this case is extremely unfavorable， and her mental disorder displays a chronic course. The patient meets all the criteria for the forensic medical definition ofwork incapacity 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>： “the impossibility of performing work activities as a consequence of morphological and psychophysiological alterations1ol caused by a disease or accident\". The mental disorder in this case(PTSD) has left the patient unfit to perform her work activities.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】The forensic psychiatric examination is extremely important for guaranteeing the individual's rights.

Indeed， in the literature， cases are described in anterior arthrodesis， but no case of post-cervical arthroplasty is described. The management of this type of complication is poorly described and not consensual. Surgeons are rarely confronted with this type of complication， especially since the working space is very limited and does not allow direct suturing.\n\n【2】Case Report： We present the case of a patient who underwent cervical arthroplasty complicated by a post-dural tear meningocele. The revision surgery consisted of a combination of closure of the breach with a fatty patch covered by a TachoSil patch， followed by reinsertion of a cervical prosthesis.\n\n【3】Conclusion： At the last follow-up，thepatient did not present any residual effects of the complication， and the mobility of the disc prosthesis was not altered by it. The use of TachoSil appears to be a satisfactory surgical option for the management of these complications.\n\n【4】Keywords： CerebrospinalFluid (CSF) leaked； Duraltear； Anterior cervical discectomy；TachoSil； Dural repair； Cervical arthroplasty\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】We present the case of a 48-year-old patient who underwent cervical disc hybrid surgery， arthroplastyand fusion， complicatedbya compressive anterior meningocele followinga peroperative dural breach. This patient presented a multilevel cervical spondylosis leading to myelopathy (C5-C6， C6-C7 and C7-T1)； benefited from a hybrid surgery， arthroplasties of the C5-C6 and C6-C7 levels(MOBI-C， Zimmer Biomet) and an arthrodesis of the C7-T1 level (ROI-C， Zimmer Biomet). The initial procedure was performed with the patient in the dorsal position under C-arm fluoroscopy and microscope. During the C5-C6 discectomy， it was noted that a small portion of the posterior longitudinal ligament was adherent to the dura on the right foramina. A lateralized punctiform dural tear is then visualized under the microscope with minimal flow. The placement of a 5 mm TachoSil sponge at the level of the tear allows drying up the flow immediately. The rest of the surgery was carried out without any complication. Initial post-operative course was simple. The patient was discharged from the department on the first day after surgery， with no postoperative headache and no cervical abnormality， no dysphonia. The patient was seen in consultation at fifteen-day post op because of the persistence of a \"clear water\" flow through a punctiform orifice， laterally to the skin incision without any clinical or biological signs. He was seen again on 26h day with persistent clinical discharge. A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed and a 10 cm×7 cm×4cm pre-vertebral fluid collections was identified， with leftward discharge of the esophageal tract without any abnormality of the medullary cord. No dysphagia or dysphonia was observed but the leakage was evident. Despite neurological post op improvement from myelopathy signs， it was decided rehospitalization urgently for 2D surgery with evacuation of the collection， bacteriological sampling and closure of the dural tear at the origin of the meningocele fistulizing to the skin .\n\n【7】Diagnostic Imaging\n\n【8】The diagnosis was therefore made on a cervical MRI with a 10 cm x7 cm × 4 cm image of prevertebral fluid collection， without cord abnormality， with a suspicious hypersignal opposite the right foraminal C5-C6 consistent with the intraoperative tear. Material-related artifacts did not allow accurate visualization of the dural disruption .\n\n【9】Historical Review.

In the cervical spine， the pressure of the CSF is low and one surgical option is to do anything to close these leaks except simply complete the operation and avoid using drainage.

First， we made a skin opening opposite the incision of the first surgery. Sampling of liquid with a \"clear water\" appearance (200 ml) for systematic bacteriological analysis as usual. The sternocleidomastoid approach删除1换行is taken from the anterior aspect of the cervical spine between the aero-digestive axis and the jugulo-carotid bundle， following the plane of the meningocele. The C5-C6 prosthesis is approached with an opposite leak. Placement of a Caspar and TSI retractor to obtain the best possible exposure. Easy removal of the C5-C6prosthesis without bony complications. Under the microscope， we observe a dural breach lateralized on the right side of the dura mater. No more TachoSil seen at that place. A regular flow of CSF was observed through a tiny hole of a few millimeters. It was therefore decided to place fatty tissue at the level of the breach and then apply a new TachoSil patch to close the breach， which was difficult to suture given the limited space available . We waited for four minutes (minimum duration of effectiveness) and then performed Valsalva maneuvers which did not reveal leak anymore. Given the absence of leakage， it was decided to install a new total disc prosthesis (identical to the previous one). Closure without the use of a suction drain， as usual.\n\n【12】Outcome， Follow-Up\n\n【13】The patient was evaluated clinically and radiologically at 2 and6 months postoperatively and had no documented complications suggesting persistent leakage. In addition， tear and meningocele has not caused any complications of mechanical failure to the prosthesis for the moment .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

He received an antibiotic treatment at home (amoxicillin and clavulanic acid) and consumed 2 L to 2.5 L of energy drink (Red Bull) per day during that week. His dyspnea suddenly worsened with a clinical presentation of acute pulmonaryedema. During out-of-hospital transport， the patient presented a severe circulatory failure secondary to rapid atrial fibrillation requiring an external electric shock and invasive mechanical ventilation support.\n\n【19】On admission this 68-year-old patient， measuring 177 cm for 89kg (BMI of 28)， still presented signs of circulatory failure with diffuse mottling of both lower extremities， a blood pressure of 82/58 通用删除7(英):<u>(63)</u> mmHg and sinus tachycardia at 109 bpm， the atrial fibrillation having been reduced by the external electric shock.\n\n【20】The initial chest X-ray with signs of cardiac overload and the electrocardiogram showing sinus tachycardia rhythm without signs of myocardial ischemia are presented in Figure 1A，1B.\n\nA coronary angiography wasperformed and didn’t show anyacute coronarylesion eliminating cardiogenic shock of ischemic origin. The transthoracic echocardiography performed in ICU showed a severe and diffuse bi-ventricular hypokinesis with an estimated left ventricle ejection fraction of 10% to 15%， an increase of left ventricular filling pressures at the mitral level [elevated values of the ratio of early-to-late diastolic blood Doppler velocities and of the ratio of early blood Doppler to early tissue Doppler diastolic wave velocity 通用删除7(英):<u>(18)</u>]， a right ventricular function severely altered (peak of systolic tricuspid annulus tissue Doppler velocity of 8 cm/s). Inotrope and vasopressor supports were rapidly introduced to restore normal blood pressure.

Indeed， baseline serum cortisol level was 59 nmol/l (normal range：170-740 nmol/l)， serum ACTH level was abnormally normal 5pmol/l (normal range： 2-11 pmol/) and taurine urinary dosage was354 umol/mmol of creatinine (normal range： 16-150). The ACTH stimulation test performed the next day was in favor of corticotropic insufficiency： Cortisol level was 86 nmol/l after stimulation for a normal >550 nmol/l). Urinary catecholamines and cortisol were not measured. Moreover， the serum level of caffeine assessed at the same time was rather low： 1.6 mg/l (normal range： 8-20). There was no argument for another etiology for this severe acute heart failure， in particular no argument for a septic myocardial dysfunction.\n\n【25】Corticosteroid therapy allowed norepinephrine and dobutamine withdrawal within 24 and 48 h， respectively. After catecholamines weaning， myocardial dysfunction had quickly reversed and returned to baseline on check echocardiography . The patient was able to be extubated at day 5 after diuretic depletion.

Up to May 7h，2020， the number of globally confirmed cases has reached 3，634，450， and the number of mortality cases has reached 258，359. Many studies are focusing on COVID-19 and associated morbidity in special populations. Chen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> reported the clinical characteristics of 9 laboratory-confirmed pregnant women with COVID-19 and the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission， which was published in The Lancet.

COVID-19 was confirmed according to the diagnosis and treatment criteria for new coronavirus pneumonia， which was issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (the Fourth Edition， 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> the Fifth Edition 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>). Based on the quantitative analysis of respiratory tract specimens through Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)， both children with COVID-19 were tested positive for new Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The study was reviewed and approved by the medical ethics committee of Gansu maternal and child health care hospital (approval number 2020GSFY-3)，and the written informed consent was obtained from each patient's legal guardian.\n\n【21】Data collection\n\n【22】Theepidemiological data， medical records，laboratory examinations， and chest CT scans of the two infected children were traced and collected with a pre-designed data collection table. The data were collected independently and were cross-checked by two investigators (YW and JW). Researchers from the third party (LZU) have reviewed the data in case of any discordance. According to the WHO guidelines for qRT-PCR analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-9]</u>， the throat swab specimens of the 2 children were collected， and SARS-.S} CoV-2 was tested using the kit (BioGerm， Shanghai， China)， which was recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All specimens were processed at the municipal CDC and the provincial CDC at the same time， and COVID-19infection was confirmed when the test results from both laboratories were positive.\n\n【23】Statistical analysis\n\n【24】Since only two children were involved， statistical analyses and software were not utilized in this study. Continuous variables and subtype variables presented the actual data.\n\n【25】Role of the funding source\n\n【26】The sponsors were not involved in research design， data collection， data analysis， and report writing. The corresponding author is responsible for all aspects of the study to ensure the proper investigation and resolution of the research for problems related to accuracy or completeness. The final version was approved by all authors.\n\n【27】Results Epidemiological history\n\n【28】Child 1 was a female patient with 1 year and 8 months of age， who lived in the Wuchang District of Wuhan City， Hubei province. Her father was a COVID-19 infected patient. He lived together with child 1 and her mother before the diagnosis (January 284h). Child 1was diagnosed on January 29h， and her mother was diagnosed on February 84h . On the other hand， child 2 was a female patient with 11 months of age， who lived in Shapingba District of Chongqing city. Her aunt and uncle were infected with COVID-19， who had close contact history with child 2 before diagnosis (February3d and February 7h). Child 2 was diagnosed on February 84， and her mother was diagnosed on February 9h .\n\n【29】Clinical and laboratory characteristics\n\n【30】The two children had no underlying diseases， and both had a history of contact with infected people. The clinical manifestations were not of the severe type. Child 1 presented with low-grade fever as删除1换行the main presenting symptom (36.7Cto38.0°C)， while child 2 mainly presented with diarrhea. When admitted to the hospital，both children were in good mental condition， with normal thoracic cage， regular respiratory rhythm， normal intercostal space， and without chest wall tenderness or percussed pain in the sternum. Both children showed symmetric breasts， and no package block was touched. The chest breathings were observed with symmetric respiratory movement. There were no obvious abnormalities in the intercostal spaces. The vocal fremitus was normal， and neither pleural friction nor skin twisting sensation was found by touching. Bilateral lung percussion revealed a clear voice， and the sounds of bilateral lung breathing were clear， without dry or wet rales. The pleural frictions were unheard，and no significant abnormality was found regarding voice conduction. Both abdominal and nervous system examinations were normal. The detection result of laboratory tests showed that child1 had a higher level of AST， suggesting that the liver function might have been affected. The White Blood Cell (WBC) count in child 2was increased， which might be related to viral infection. No abnormal observations were found except for the aforementioned observations. Imaging findings revealed the typical characteristics of pneumonia in the chest CT scans of both children . The lung markings became thickened and distributed disorderly. Patchy and ground glass shadows were observed on the chest wall outside the lower lung.\n\n【31】Therapies and outcomes\n\n【32】Child 11 was evaluated as a mild COVID-19 case. After admission， she was given 2 mL lopinavir/ritonavir orally， twice a day. She also inhaled 250 g atomized interferon twice a day. The enteric microecological preparations were given orally with other symptomatic treatments. Symptoms disappeared after 9 days of treatment， and the results of two successive (February 6h and February 8h) SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests of throat swabs were both negative. On February 104， child 1 was discharged from the hospital for medical observation. No recurrence or sequela occurred during the 14-day observation. Child 2 was assessed as the common type. After admission， she was given 100 mg potassium sodium dehydroandrographolide succinate through an intravenous drip， once a day. She also inhaled 20 ugs atomized interferon twice a day with lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (Kaletra) and intestinal microecological regulation. Symptoms disappeared after 6 days of treatment， and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests of throat swabs were negative for two consecutive times (February 16h and February 164). Eventually， child 2 was discharged from the hospital for medical observation on February 17h. No recurrence or sequela occurred during the 14-day observation.\n\n【33】Discussion\n\n【34】The clinical data of two cases of COVID-19 pneumonia under2 years of age， who were diagnosed by throat swabs SARS-CoV-2nucleic acid tests， were reported. The symptoms of both children were not typical. Child 1 had a low-grade fever， while child 2presented with diarrhea.

This article is a documentation of the diagnosis and treatment of a patient with a common atrioventricular septation defect， referred to our institution.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Atrioventricular septation defects are a group of congenital heart diseases that consist of a defect in endocardial cushions， also known as atrioventricular septum defect. It is characterized by the presence of a common atrioventricular union due to the absence of the membranous and muscular septum， anomalous left ventricular outflow tract， an abnormallateral rotation of the posteromedial papillary muscle and an abnormal configuration of the atrioventricular valves 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. This condition represents 4% to 5% of congenital heart diseases. It is more frequent in patients with Down’s syndrome (40% to 45%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>and in women 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【4】AV septation defect can be classified as complete or partial， and as balanced or unbalanced； it can also be catalogued with the Rastelli classification in types A， B or C通用删除6(英):<u>[1，5-7]</u>.\n\nAssociated1complications are congestive heart failure， atrial arrhythmias， complete atrioventricular block and pulmonary hypertension. The development of these complications depends on the specific morphology and the time-of-diagnosis， as well as the follow-up and treatment the patient receives 1|.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 2-vear-old male patient was referred to our institution with the diagnosis of systolic murmur， interventricular and interatrial communication. Previous to the admission， the patient was receiving digoxin.\n\n【8】The mother referred that her son had been showing fatigue during breast-feeding and profuse sweating since 6 months ago. During the previous three months， he presented two episodes of dyspnea and acrocyanosis， productive cough， fever and perioral cyanosis. He had a history of four hospital admissions due to heart failure.\n\n【9】Physical examination revealed distal and perioral cyanosis. In the thorax， right ventricular impulse was detected and the apex was palpated 1 cm left from the midclavicular line. Auscultation was remarkable due to a holosystolic murmur II/IV with eccentric radiation and an increased-in-intensity S2； crackles were also heard at pulmonary examination.\n\n【10】The Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed a left-deviated axis and a PR of 0.18 sec， biatrial enlargement， Left Ventricle (LV) enlargement and right ventricle hypertrophy .删除2换行cited.\n\n【11】Chest radiography revealed a second-grade cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic index of 0.56). Transthoracicechocardiographyshowedan atrioventricular septation defect. Cardiac catheterization through the left saphenous vein corroborated the presence of an atrioventricular septation defect， ostium primum interatrial communication and interventricular communication.\n\n【12】RA： Right Atrium， RV： Right Ventricle， LA： Left Atrium， LV： Left Ventricle\n\n【13】The patient was referred to pulmonary artery banding and through left posterior thoracotomy， the connection between the aorta and the pulmonary artery was dissected and an umbilical tape was placed.\n\n【14】The patient did not present any complications from the procedure. However， 4 years later， the patient was readmitted with the diagnosis of non-functional pulmonary artery banding， pulmonary hypertension， right and left atrioventricular regurgitation and complete atrioventricular septation defect Rastelli type C.\n\n【15】Catheterization demonstrated reversiblepulmonaryhypertension and the patient were considered for surgical correction. The patient continued 4 years with pharmacological management and close monitoring until total correction of the atrioventricular septation was made， total excision of the pulmonary artery banding was also删除1换行realized， without complications . During the hospital stay， the patient received inotropic support with amrinone and dopamine.\n\n【16】In a follow up ECG， a first-degree atrioventricular block was detected as well as right atrial and ventricular enlargement and complete right bundle branch block. Physical examination revealed a mesosystolic murmur I/IV in the pulmonary area (which suggested pulmonary dilation) and a regurgitant murmur II/IV at the mitral area with radiation to axilla (suggesting mitral regurgitation). The patient is currently being closely followed up in our institution and shows no apparent complications.\n\n【17】Overview of the atrioventricular septation defects\n\n【18】Pathophysiology： The patient we exposed previously， had a complete atrioventricular septation defect， it combines ostium primum-type atrial communication， interventricular communication删除1换行and a unique common atrioventricular valve 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. A right-to-left shunt predominates due to the septation defects. Additionally， volume overload is present because of the common atrioventricular valve regurgitation， which usually is abnormal and incompetent 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，8]</u>.\n\n【19】Volume overload in right chambers causes increased pulmonary flow， which can lead to pulmonary hypertension and heart failure通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Pathological alterations at the pulmonary circulation increase the pulmonary vascular resistance and when the latter the systemic resistances， the shunt is inverted from right to left， which produces the Eisenmenger syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\nClassification： This disease is classifiedaccording to its complexity in partial or complete：|删除段之间换行|1. Partial： consists in ostium primum interatrial communication and mitral valve cleft (a space between the superior and inferior valves， above the interventricular septum).\n\n【21】2.Complete：consists of ostium primum interatrial communication， interventricular communication and mitral cleft.\n\n【22】It is important to determine whether the defect is balanced or unbalanced， according to the ventricle's dimensions. In balanced defects， the ventricles sizes are similar while in the unbalanced there is a remarkable size difference between ventricles and it must be determined which ventricle is the largest or dominant 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，5，6]</u>\n\n【23】Another classification depends on the anterosuperior valves insertions according to the right ventricle， called the Rastelli classification  通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， which is constituted by 3 types： A， where the tendinous chordae are inserted in the ventricular septal crest； B， where the tendinous chordae are inserted in a papillary muscle(located in the union of the ventricular septum with the free wall of the right ventricle and C， where the tendinous chordae are inserted in the papillary muscle in the free wall of the right ventricle 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【24】Clinicalmanifestations： Clinicalmanifestationsdepend删除1换行on the presence and size of the interatrial and interventricular communication， as well as the competence of the atrioventricular valve 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The most frequent manifestation is heart failure due to right ventricle volume overload， which in the first months of life becomes apparent with the presence of polypnea， dyspnea， diaphoresis， fatigue during breast-feeding， malnutrition and failure to thrive 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，8]</u>.\n\n【25】Common findings on physical examination are： A simple S1(from the common atrioventricular valve)， an increased S2 (due to pulmonary hypertension)， a systolic murmur due to atrioventricular valve regurgitation and a mild expulsive， systolic murmur due to pulmonary hyperflux 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，5，8]</u>. During early stages， the presence of pulmonary hypertension and a mild pressure gradient between left and right chambers produces scarce turbulence at the shunt and thus， few findings on auscultation 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【26】In cases where patients develop pulmonary vascular disease， the intensity of the expulsive murmur decreases due to the decrement in the blood flow through the pulmonary valve. However， the regurgitant murmur persists because of the atrioventricular valve 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【27】If patients are over one year old， the pulmonary vascular disease produces Eisenmenger’s syndrome， where the right-to-left shunt displays with progressive central cyanosis， dyspnea， syncope， desaturation and digital clubbing 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，8]</u>.\n\n【28】Diagnosis： The most important diagnostic test in a patient with suspicion of atrioventricular septation defect is the Doppler echocardiography， which allows to visualize directly the anatomical defect (in the four-chamber view the atrioventricular valve can be observed)， the typical atrial communication and the interventricular posterior communication， as well as the functional defect 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，5]</u>； therefore it is the election test for the diagnosis of this disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Additionally， it allows determining the grade of competence of the atrioventricular valve； it also helps estimate the right-to-left shunt and the systolic pressure of the right ventricle. Tridimensional删除1换行echocardiography is important for surgical planning 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，5，6]</u>.\n\n【29】An ECG must be performed in all the patients where a septation defect is suspected. The main finding is left axis deviation 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Furthermore， atrial flutter could be detected and， in older patients， complete atrioventricular block associated with right ventricle enlargement and right bundle branch block could be identified 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6]</u>. Existence of pulmonary hypertension could manifest as a wide P wave， which can also be altered due to right ventricle overload 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【30】Chest radiographs exhibit cardiomegaly with prominent right atrium， right ventricle dilation and increased pulmonary flow. In cases of mild interatrialcommunicationnand important incompetence of the atrioventricular valve， cardiomegaly may manifest due to left ventricle enlargement with normal pulmonary flow. Moreover， signs of Eisenmenger’s syndrome can be detected， such as pulmonary artery calcification， dilated pulmonary arteries with narrowing of peripheral vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6]</u>.\n\n【31】Cardiac catheterization directly estimates the pulmonary artery pressure to determine the severity of pulmonary hypertension. In addition， it allows to evaluate the pulmonary vessels reactivity through the administration of a vasodilator agent， aiming to define if the pulmonary resistances are reversible and， consequently， if the patient is a good candidate for surgical management. Nowadays， cardiac catheterization has been almost completely replaced by transthoracic echocardiographyand its only application is in patients that are in late stages of the disease， when there is an advanced pulmonary vascular alteration 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【32】Treatment： A surgical procedure should be performed in patients with a de novo or non-corrected atrioventricular communication. Additionally， surgery is indicated in patients with symptomatic persistent regurgitation (or postsurgical stenosis) of the mitral valve， or patients with atrial arrhythmias， ventricular function impairment or with severe subaortic obstruction (mean rest gradient >50mmHg)通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6]</u>. If possible， surgical correction should be performed before the six months old， aiming to avoid pulmonary vascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>.\n\n【33】In cases of severe pulmonary hypertension， there must be a left-to-right shunt of 1.5：1 as minimum and signs of pulmonary vascular reactivity to a vasodilator agent， such as oxygen， nitric oxide or prostaglandins 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【34】Our patient was first managed with a pulmonary artery banding followed by intracardiac correction， called “Stepped approach\". This approach has been replaced by primary intracardiac correction during breast-feeding， pretending to achieve adequate atrial and ventricular septations， as well as to reconstruct the left and right atrioventricular valves. The employed techniques are simple-patch， double patchand no-patch to close the interatrial and interventricular communications. Occasionally， a mitral valve substitution could be needed when the correction is not feasible 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6]</u>.\n\n【35】Prognosis：Surgically-managed patients need frequent evaluations due to the recovery rate at 5 years of only 75% 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Mortality attributed to surgery also depends on the malformation删除1换行anatomical characteristics， the patient's functional status， and the severity of pulmonary hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. After the procedure， late onset complications can occur， for example patch dehiscence， residual septal defects， atrioventricular block (which outpatient developed)， atrial flutter or fibrillation， mitral valve dysfunction and subaortic stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，5，6]</u>. As a post-operatory evaluation， a Doppler Echocardiography， an ECG， and chest radiography should be performed to estimate cardiac function after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【36】Patients that are not surgically treated have a higher risk of death than those surgically treated in the first year of life， mostly due to heart failure and its complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Those who survive， develop Eisenmengers syndrome，and usually develop congestive heart failure in the fifth decade. The most common death causes are sudden death in (30%)， congestive heart failure in (35%)， and hemoptysis in (15%). Perioperative deaths during extracardiac surgery can happen， as well as infectious events such as cerebral abscesses and endocarditis. Death can also occur during gestational period in some cases.\n\n【37】Conclusion\n\n【38】Patients with a complete atrioventricular septation defect should be diagnosed and managed in a prompt and comprehensive manner to correct the anatomical and functional defects that this disease exhibits. It is important to highlight the fact that， in case of not performing surgical treatment， complications can shorten the lifespan of patients as well as impair their quality of life. Multidisciplinary assessment and management of different cardiology subspecialties improve the prognosis of patients with this congenital heart disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

A majority of the posterior dislocations were reported during epileptic fits (seizure)， electroconvulsive therapy， patients with neuromuscular and psychiatric disorders. Bilateral anterior fracture dislocations of the shoulder mostly caused by violent trauma， few cases were attributed to epileptic and hypoglycemic seizures.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\nA 23 years old male patient has been presented to our hospital emergency room suffering from bilateral deformed painful shoulder after an attack of epileptic convulsive seizures forty eight hours earlier. Clinical examination findings included bilateral flattening of both shoulders with restricted painful movements in abduction and external rotation. The radial pulse felt well bilaterally， there were no signs of neurological deficit. Radiological examination revealed bilateral anterior fracture dislocation of the shoulders with symmetrical bilateral greater tuberosity fractures . After preoperative workup， Neurophysician and Anesthetic consultation as well as informed consent， the patient was taken to the theater where he was treated by closed reduction of the shoulders under general anesthesia. The bilateral greater tuberosities fractures were still displaced so； reduction and fixation were performed under image intensifier using percutaneous short threaded titanium cannulated screws and washers. The post operative check X-rays showed satisfactory reduction and fixation . The patient was kept in bilateral broad arm slings in adduction and internal rotation for five weeks， progressive mobilization started at the third week with pendulum exercises followed by electric stimulation after each session， gentle capsule stretching exercises were used for restoration of flexibility. The patient was able to resume work three months after surgery. After a period of one- year follow-up， the patient achieves an excellent recovery with bilateral comfortable|删除段之间换行|range of motion in both shoulders (0 to 160) degrees abduction， internal rotation to 70 degrees to (T6) bilaterally and 60 degrees of external rotation on both sides. Clinically the patient had no signs of instability.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】The gleno-humeral joint is the most dislocatable joint in the body about 85% ofall dislocations.95%ofshoulder dislocations are anterior，10% to 15% of those are associated with greater tuberosity 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. In epileptic patients， although majority of bilateral shoulder dislocations are posterior，bilateralanterior dislocations are rare entity as the forces required to produce the dislocation must act synchronously and in a similar manner at both joints. Sudden violent muscular contractions and deceleration forces in extension abduction and external rotation have been reported as the main cause of bilateral anterior dislocation or fracture dislocation of the shoulder 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-6]</u>. The internal rotators of the arm overcome the external rotators forces the humerus in adduction and internal rotation during epileptic convulsions when violent muscle contraction dislocates the humeral heads posteriorly通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. The literature had been previously reported few cases of post traumatic bilateral anterior dislocations of the shoulders 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-10]</u>. As the greater tuberosity was displaced in approximately 10% to 15% of all anterior dislocations， anatomical reduction and internal fixation should be achieved properly because failed management can lead to impingement syndrome， rotator cuff damage and permanent shoulder disability 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3]</u>. Bachhal Vetal 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> have been reported one case with post traumatic bilateral anterior dislocations associated with bilateral four-part fractures of the proximal humerus in 60 years old male patient due to electrocution. Considering the patient age and删除1换行the fractures pattern，bilateral hemiarthroplasty was done. At the final follow-up after two years， the patient was pain free with comfortable range of motion of both shoulders.

Inspired by the success of early Extubation and fast-tracking in adult recipients many pediatric transplant centers have started practicing early Extubation in children. The use of high dose of sedatives and opioids in the post-operative period significantly delays and complicates early extubation. We performed Subcostal TAP block and bilateral rectus sheath blocks at the end of surgery on 16 pediatric liver recipients below 2 years of age and successfully extubated them on table. In our short experience performing blocks under ultrasound guidance was safe and significantly alleviated need of opioids during the post-operative period.\n\n【2】Keywords：Transversus abdominis plane block； Pediatric liver transplantation；Early Extubation\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Traditionally pediatric liver recipients were sedated using opioids and electively ventilated during the early postoperative period because of the high rate of re explorations， the requirement of multiple imaging & the occurrence of abdominal compartment syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. However， inspired by the success of early extubation and fast-tracking in adult liver transplant programs， many pediatric transplant centers of late practice fast tracking 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. One of the hindrances for early Extubation would be the use of a high dose of sedatives and opioids in the early postoperative period. Use of regional anesthesia has significantly decreased the requirement of post-operative opioids， reduced complications and has aided in enhanced recovery in the general surgical population 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【5】Even though coagulopathy is a concern， there have been reports encouraging use of regional anesthesia in liver transplant recipients. Milan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>performed Subcostal TAP blocks in 17 adult recipients and demonstrated a reduction in the time required for extubation as well as post-operative opioids requirements. Trzebicki et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> performed thoracic epidural anesthesia in a select group of67 patients and demonstrated on table extubation on 84% ofpatients. Inspired by the fact that there haven't been any reports on the application of regional anesthesia in pediatric liver recipients， we decided to perform right Subcostal TAP block along with bilateral rectus sheath block in pediatric liver recipients below 2 years of age. As the trends are changing in pediatric liver transplantation towards early extubation and fast tracking， TAP block with its proven effectiveness in post-surgical pain & enhanced recovery protocols along with very limited side effects， has the potential to further improve outcomes in pediatric liver transplantation towards early extubation & fast tracking.\n\n【6】Description of Cases\n\n【7】We did on table Extubation aided by TAP block on 16 children under the age of 2 years. The anesthesia protocol is briefly described as follows. Anesthesia was induced using fentanyl 2 mcg/kg， propofol 2 mg/kg and succinylcholine 2 mg/kg. Following endotracheal intubation and securing adequate venous and arterial access， maintenance of anesthesia was done using sevoflurane +oxygen & air， along with fentanyl at 1 mcg/kg/h & atracurium at 0.3 mg/kg/h. All patients were monitored using ECG， pulse oximetry invasive arterial line， central venous line， EtCO2 along with core temperature and urine output. Blood samples were taken as per need to guide therapy on pH， lactates， potassium， calcium & hemoglobin. Blood component therapy administration was guided by clinical bleeding and TEG.\n\n【8】Table： Demographics and Intraoperative variables.\n\n| Age in months (mean ±sd)  | 14±6.32  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Weight in kg (mean ±sd)  | 8.48±2.30  |\n| Aetiology (Cholestatic：Metabolic)  | 14：02  |\n| PELD (mean ±sd)  | 23±7.04  |\n| GRWR (mean ±sd)  | 3.01±0.93  |\n| Anhepatic Time in minutes (mean ± sd)  | 37.50±7.12  |\n| Duration in hours  | 10.8  |\n| Crystalloid in ml/kg  | 63.8  |\n| Albumin in ml/kg  | 30  |\n| PRC in ml/kg  | 34.5  |\n| FFP in ml/kg  | 22.8  |\n| Platelets in ml/kg  | 5  |\n\nPELD： Pediatric End Stage Liver Disease； GRWR： Graft to Recipient Weight Ratio； PRC： Packed Red Cells； FFP： Fresh Frozen Plasma|删除段之间换行|After successful completion of vascular anastomosiss and confirmation by means of Doppler a decision was made to extubate the patient based on preoperative sensorium， nutritional status， hemodynamic stability， correction of acidosis， normothermia &absence of abdominal compartment syndrome on closure. Once the decision was made to extubate the patient’s， fentanyl & atracurium infusions were discontinued. After the application of skin sutures， right sided Subcostal TAP along with bilateral Rectus sheath blockwas performed using a 9.4 MHz Linear array probe and 24 Ghypodermic needle. The drug used was 0.2% Ropivacaine， the dose of which was calculated to a maximum dose of 3 mg/kg and injected in the 3 areas. The preoperative clinical features and intraoperative features of the cases are described in Table 1.\n\n【11】Once in the ICU， oxygen therapy was tailored as per the clinical condition of the patient. Arterial blood gases were done as soon as the patient arrived， and subsequently as per the clinical condition. Post-operative analgesia was provided using intravenous paracetamol at10 mg/kg thrice daily. Pain Scores were measured 2n hourly using FLACC score by trained nursing staff. Pain score >3 were treated with intravenous fentanyl at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg. Daily monitoring included routine blood counts， along with coagulation profile， liver and kidney function tests. Liver Doppler was done twice a day for the first post-transplant week. All the patients received a standard antibiotic，antifungal & immunosuppressive therapy.\n\n【12】The mean pain score as measured by FLACC scale was 2 till 14 h in the post-operative period. The mean pain score at the 14h and 16h h were 3.73 & 4 respectively. Two patients required a bolus of fentanyl to control the pain. However， the mean pain scores decreased to 3after 18 h and remained stable after that. We didn’t have any children needing opioids boluses after 16 h.\n\n【13】There were 4 reintubations in the post-operative period. Two patients were re intubated on the second post-operative day as they had to be re explored in view of secondary hemorrhage. One child developed pulmonary edema on day 5 due to fluid over load and had to be intubated following an unsuccessful trial of non-invasive ventilation. Another child was re-intubated on day 5 for drainage of an intra-abdominal collection and was immediately extubated after the laparotomy.\n\n【14】The mean ICU stay in our patients was 4.2 ± 1.2 days. All our patients showed satisfactory recovery of graft functions except one删除1换行who had developed features of rejection on the 6th post-operative day. We had 2 instances of mortality one on day 14 and the other on day 28. The reasons for mortality in both the cases were multi organ dysfunction due to gram negative sepsis.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】In recent times， pediatric liver transplantation centers are becoming more liberal to the idea of early extubation. This is because of favourable experiences with on table extubation in pediatric liver recipients demonstrating， enhanced patient recovery， graft function & reduced requirement of ICU stay 1， 2. One of the factors causing an aversion towards early extubation is the use of high dose opioids intra-operatively and in the post-operative period making the children vulnerable to the depressant effects of these drugs. By performing a myofascial block at the end of the procedure， we attempted to decrease the need of post-operative analgesia in the form of opioids infusions.\n\n【17】We believe that the TAP block significantly reduced our post-operative opioids requirements. A single shot TAP block given with only local anesthetic agents is supposed to provide analgesia for 8 h to 10 h. This would have sufficed for the immediate post-operative period during which pain would have been most severe. The fact that none of our patient s in the TAP group required opioids infusions for analgesia could be attributed to the efficacy of ultrasound guided Subcostal TAP block and bilateral rectus sheath block. Avoidance of opioids helped in avoiding unnecessary sedation which would have led to respiratory complications.\n\n【18】Inspite of the pre-existing coagulopathy we did not encounter any complications in any of the 16 patients on whom we performed TAP & Rectus sheath blocks. This could be attributed to the fact that our anesthesia providers were sufficiently trained in ultrasound guided fascial plane blocks. It has to be emphasized that performance of Subcostal TAP and rectus sheath blocks in pediatric patients could be associated with significant complications if one is not careful. Care must be taken to ensure strict asepsis during the procedure. We do not recommend blind placement of TAP blocks in pediatric liver recipients， since injury to viscera， vasculature and pneumothorax are serious complications. Use of a 9.4 Mhz vascular ultrasound probe along with Doppler will aid in safe and effective deposition of the drug in the right plane.\n\n【19】We believe post-operative nociception in pediatric liver recipients is poorly understood and often overlooked. Most clinicians are reluctant to treat pain in pediatric patients owing to fear of causing sedation & respiratory depression. The use of myofascial blocks like the Subcostal TAP with a bilateral rectus sheath block would help significantly in controlling pain and reducing post-operative opioids requirements.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】We were able to successfully perform ultrasound guided TAP block with bilateral rectus sheath block to aid on table extubation in pediatric liver transplants. We propose a study on similar lines on a much larger population of pediatric liver transplantation recipients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Nowadays iatrogenic trauma is the most common cause of urethral injury that presents after improper instrumentation 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>； the estimated risk being 3.2 per 1000 during a hospital stay 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. According to Chapple 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， partial urethral tears are usually associated with iatrogenic causes and the other forms ofiatrogenic trauma include urethral injury because ofendoscopy， synthetic sling placement， diverticulectomy surgery and vaginal surgeries. However， iatrogenic injury to the urethra， bladder neck and trigone causing urinary incontinence is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【12】Pelvic organ prolapse presents with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms which can be extremely incapacitating at times that a patient might want a definitive resolution of her symptoms and removal of the uterus along with needed specific compartment repair. A case of vaginal hysterectomy for a grade 4 pelvic organ prolapses along with compartment repair for grade 3 cystocele and grade 1enterocele with urethral reconstruction for an uncommon， iatrogenic traumatic rupture of the urethra during Foley insertion is described here， with good outcomes.\n\n【13】Methods and Methodology\n\n【14】Sixty three years old lady presented to us with something coming out per vaginum for the past 2 years. It was minimal to start with and she would reposit it back before passing urine or stools. However， for the past 6 months， she found it difficult to put it back as the prolapse had become swollen. She developed dribbling of urine for the past4 months when she was admitted to a hospital and a urethral Foley catheterization was done. She developed dribbling of urine in spite of being on the Foley catheter and reported that the procedure of Foley catheter insertion had been quite painful with a little bleeding related to the procedure. She denied any form of urinary incontinence prior to the Foley catheter insertion. She had previous three vaginal deliveries with no obstetric or neonatal complications and she had been hypertensive for 10 years， maintaining normal blood pressure on tablet Telmisartan 40 mg once a day with a BMI of 28kgmand no other co-morbidities.\n\n【15】Urogynecological examination showed a bivalved urethra at12O'clock and 6OClock position starting close to the bladder neck and going up to the urethral meatus. The urethral meatus had widened and she had a peri Foley catheter leaking of urine with grade uterine 4 ( Baden-Walker halfway system) prolapse with grade2 cystocele and a grade 1 enterocele . The prolapsed part had become quite edematous because oflong-standing prolapse so she was on vaginal packing (roller gauze with betadine solution and liquid paraffin) twice a day for about 10 days to decrease the congestion. Ultrasound of the kidney urinary bladder showed normal bilateral kidneys with irregular bladder walls and settled echogenic debris suggestive of cystitis. Urine routine and microscopy showed15 pus cells/ HPF and urine culture suggestive of Enterococcus species sensitiveto nitrofurantoin，so she was started on Tablet Nitrofurantoin200 mg BD for 7 days. Cystoscopyshowed urethra as patulous，bladder neck wide open， anterior bladder wall normal， posterior bladder wall laid open with prolapsed bladder neck； the trigone seemed inflamed with bilateral ureteric orifice normal . The remaining urethral length was about 2 cm. Pre-anesthetic fitness was obtained and an option of vaginal hysterectomy with anterior and posterior compartment repair along with urethral reconstruction was given which the patient consented to as she wanted a definitive option for her symptoms.\n\n【16】Surgical steps\n\n【17】The patient was taken in a low lithotomy position under spinal combined epidural anesthesia\n\n【18】Hydrodissection with Injection of normal saline was done in the paracervical region .\n\n【19】A circumferential cervical incision was taken anteriorly just below the bladder reflection .\n\nThe vagina was mobilized anteriorly with the help of a|删除段之间换行|The posterior cul-de-sac was opened sharply by making a bold cut in the posterior vaginal wall held by the Allis forceps between the uterosacral ligaments .\n\n【21】Bilateral uterosacral ligaments were clamped， cut and ligated by vicryl No 1， followed by transfixation of the cut pedicles. Both pedicles were tagged individually by a curved artery .\n\n【22】Bladder retractor was inserted in the vesicouterine space to keep the bladder away .\n\n【23】Bilateral uterine vessels were clamped， cut and ligated by vicryl No 1， followed by transfixation of the cut pedicles .\n\n【24】Right side fallopian tube， round ligament and ovarian vessels were clamped， cut and transfixed by vicryl No 1， with the pedicle tagged by a straight artery .\n\n【25】The uterus was held by an Allis forceps and kept away on the other side .\n\n【26】Left side fallopian tube， round ligament and ovarian vessels were clamped， cut and transfixed by vicryl No 1， with the pedicle tagged by a straight artery .\n\n【27】The uterus was delivered out and sent for histopathology.\n\n【28】All the pedicles were inspected for any bleeding .\n\n【29】The cul-de-sac was obliterated by getting both the uterosacral pedicles in the midline by going through both the uterosacral pedicles and tying them in the midline.\n\n【30】The redundant posterior peritoneum was sutured in 2 to 3continuous layers by vicryl no 2 to obliterate it .\n\n【31】Allis forceps were used to hold the anterior vaginal wall at the vaginal apex and hydrodissection was done by injecting normal saline .\n\n【32】Bilateral vaginal flaps were created by incising the anterior vaginal wall in the midline  and inserting scissors just below the vaginal epithelium and dissecting the entire cystocele from the vaginal wall. The assistant held the created vaginal flap by multiple Allis forceps to give gentle traction for dissection and the dissection was carried out until the inferior pubic rami were reached bilaterally.\n\n【33】Both the bivalved urethral edges were held by Babcock forceps and stay sutures were taken by vicryl no 4.\n\n【34】Periurethral dissection was done to mobilize the urethra circumferentially .\n\n【35】The bivalved urethral edges were approximated primarily by vicryl no 4 in a continuous manner anteriorly (12O’clock) and posteriorly (6O’Clock)  to restore the urethral lumen.\n\n【36】Dorsal reconstructed urethra was buttressed by the periurethral tissue by interrupted sutures with vicryl no 4 .\n\n【37】Plication sutures were taken at the urethrovesical junction by vicryl no 2 in an interrupted manner to support the posterior urethra.\n\n【38】Ventral reconstructed urethra was buttressed by the pubocervical fascia by interrupted sutures with vicryl no 4.\n\n【39】A purse-string plication suture was taken by vicryl no 2 to reposit the prolapsed bladder.\n\n【40】Ventral reconstructed urethra was buttressed by the left vaginal flap which is insinuated right up to the right inferior pubic rami so that the sutures to close the anterior vaginal wall do not overlap the reconstructed posterior urethra .\n\n【41】The redundant vaginal flaps were trimmed bilaterally.\n\n【42】The anterior vaginal wall was closed by vicryl no 2 in an\n\n【43】The uterosacral ligaments were anchored to the posterior vaginal wall bilaterally.\n\n【44】Vaginal vault was closed by vicryl no 1 in an interrupted manner and picture after vault closure .\n\n【45】Hydrodissection with Injection of normal saline was done just below the posterior vaginal wall.\n\n【46】Three Allis forceps were used to hold the vaginal wall posteriorly and form a triangle on gentle traction .\n\n【47】A wedge-shaped perineum was cut to reconstruct the perineum .\n\n【48】Bilateral vaginal flaps were created by incising the posterior vaginal wall in the midline and dissecting the entire rectocele from the anterior wall of the rectum .\n\n【49】A purse-string plication suture by vicryl no 2 was taken to reposit the prolapsed rectum.\n\n【50】The posterior vaginal was closed by vicryl no 2 in an interrupted manner and the perineum was reconstructed .\n\n【51】Vaginal packing was done with roller gauze dipped in betadine solution.\n\n【52】The Foley catheter was fixed to the anterior abdominal wall with adhesive sticking in a form of a gentle loop to minimize tension on the neourethra.\n\n【53】The operative time was about 3 h with a blood loss of approximately 250 ml to 300 ml. Vaginal packing was removed on day 1 post-operatively. She was kept on intravenous antibiotics for3 days and then shifted to oral antibiotics for a total of 7 days. The patient was kept on PUC for 4 weeks and she did not report any pericatheter leaking of urine post-operatively  shows day21 post-operative status. Post-operative urine culture sent on day2 post-surgery was sterile. After 4 weeks a VCUG was performed which showed no extravasation of urine and successful voiding with insignificant urinary post-void residual volume. Hence， PUC was removed， on day 28  post-operative images shows a near normal looking neomeatus. She was followed up after 1 month， 3months，6 months and 12 months maintaining urinary continence. Ethical committee approval has been taken to publish this case.\n\n【54】Discussion\n\n【55】Etiology of iatrogenic urethral injury\n\n【56】Post-traumatic urethral injury is rare in females because ofits short course， mobility and the urethra is protected under the bony pelvis with no significant attachments to the pubis 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In the developing countries， urethral injuries were seen as part of complicated labor whereas in the developed countries urethral injuries are mostly caused by trauma or iatrogenic causes 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Erosion of the urethra by the synthetic pubovaginal slings is the emerging new cause ofurethral injuries encountered lately 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> and requires more extensive urethral repair because it is complicated by removal of the graft material.\n\n【57】Routine Foley insertion can sometimes go wrong， and there have been cases of bladder rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> and incomplete ureteral rupture in a neurologically impaired person 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>； warranting extreme caution when inserting Foley catheter in every patient. A 14 Fr-16 Fr Foley删除1换行catheter with a 5 ml to 10 ml balloon is recommended for women to reduce the pressure effects on the urethra and the bladder neck by Igawa et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>as long term Foley catheterization can cause pressure necrosis of the urethra needing urethral reconstruction later 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【58】Diagnosis of iatrogenic urethral injury\n\n【59】A thorough history to know the exact cause of injury would help to plan the management and a thorough urogynecological examination to look for the extent and the site of urethral injury. Cystourethroscopy tells us about the condition of the remaining urethra， particularly the proximal urethra and the internal urethral sphincter 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In a case of urethral injury it is important to rule out a concomitant bladder injury before we plan a surgical repair.\n\n【60】Management of iatrogenic urethral injury\n\n【61】The goal of urethral reconstruction after a urethral injury is to achieve a continent and an unobstructed urethra. However， considering the lack of standardization in urethral reconstruction restoring the anatomy and the urethral function is a challenge. The second hurdle is accomplishing the surgical repair of the anatomy and the function in a single-stage procedure； correcting the anatomy is restoring the torn urethra and correcting the function means preserving the urinary continence. Urinary incontinence is most commonly encountered because of the sphincteric loss 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> similarly seen in our patient.\n\n【62】The literature related to urethral reconstruction is quite diverse and there is no standardization regarding the best technique. The surgical technique of urethral repair largely depends on the extent of damage to the urethra and the surgeon's expertise. If there is minimal disruption， a single layer of interrupted sutures can suffice， a bigger defect would need a vaginal flap and if lateral tissue is insufficient then a U-shaped vaginal wall can be rotated to create the posterior urethral wall. However， in cases of extensive scarring， a labia minora flap can be raised to cover the defect 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Sufficient mobilization of the periurethral tissue is important for a tension-free reconstruction followed by a multi-layered closure of the defect， along with adequate blood supply and a continuous urinary drainage form essential features of surgical repair 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【63】Timing of the urethral reconstruction： In the earlier days， the timing of urethral reconstruction was after 3 to 6 months after the injury has occurred； however， with the advent of flaps and grafts， it has become feasible to perform when the tissue is out of any infection or inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>[11</u>. However， a well-vascularized flap is essential in cases of severe injury and compromised blood supply. So a urethral repair can be performed immediately， or there can be a delayed primary repair (10 to 14 days) and at times a late repair which is after3 months 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【64】Single stage urethral reconstruction with concomitant anti-incontinence procedure： Summond et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> had 40/50 patients with iatrogenic urethral injury and total incontinence (AC±V H in27， UD in 11 and transurethral bladder neck dissection in 2). All the patients had 75% or more loss of the urethral floor. Primary closure was performed in 25 cases， lateral relaxing incisions were taken in3， labial skin flap was taken in 12 cases and Martius flap was taken in 10 patients. A second stage retropubic urethrovesical suspension was performed in 20 patients with a cure rate of 74% (37/50) and improved in 8%(4/50).\n\nBlaivas et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> in their series of 10 incontinent women with extensive urethral injury because of operative complications (UD in|删除段之间换行|6，AC in 2 and AI-procedures in 2 patients) performed a concomitant anti-incontinence procedure (pubovaginal sling in 6， modified Pereyra operation in 3， and modified Kelly plication in 1). 6/10 were continent after a single-stage procedure and the remaining 3/10had SUI with VVF in 1/10. An anti-incontinence procedure was performed as a second stage procedure in the 3 patients with SUI with suiccess.\n\n【66】Flisser et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> performed urethral reconstruction in 67/74women for iatrogenic reasons (UD 28， urethral injury after Pereyra procedure 18， AC 10， gynecological surgery resulting in fistula in3， synthetic material erosion 5， urethral obstruction from previous surgery 3). Vaginal Flap Repair (VFR) alone 10/74， VFR with autologous pubovaginal sling 56/74， VFR with modified Pereyra repair 5/74， VFR with Kelly plication 1， Urethrolysis with primary urethral repair in 1 and Tanagho anterior bladder flap in 1 was done. Preoperative incontinence was in 62/74 and postoperatively 54/74(87%) women had improved or cured incontinence. Four had SUI cured by 2 stage procedure and 2 had de novo urge incontinence. Flisser et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> deemed staged procedures and the use ofbladder flaps as“unnecessary” in their experience and advocated VFR along with pubovaginal sling as an anti-incontinence procedure.\n\n【67】In a review by Blaivas et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> in 2008， less than 500 patients with severely injured urethra were described in English literature and successful reconstruction was achieved in 67% to 100% with continence in 55% to 92% of them， after a single-stage procedure. Incontinence was about 50% to 84% in women where an anti-incontinence procedure was not performed concomitantly；however， secondary procedures performed subsequently were successful in most of the patients. It was advocated that proximal urethral injuries have as high as a 50% chance of urinary incontinence unless a concomitant sling has been used. Hence， Blaivas et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> preferred an autologous pubovaginal sling concomitantly at the time of urethral reconstruction in cases of sphincteric incontinence.\n\n【68】A case of urethral injury along with the sphincter has been cited by Wadie et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>， while enlarging the vaginal introitus and was treated successfully with a PAS and posterior vaginoplasty， a similar case of urethral injury extending up to the bladder neck at 6Ocock position following a longitudinal complete urethral incision for a mistaken vaginal septum was described by Albayrak et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>leading to total incontinence and corrected by a rectus fascial sling.\n\n【69】Rosenblum et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> in their review described urethral erosion by synthetic sling as the entry of the sling substance into the urethral lumen which is treated by complete surgical removal of the foreign body， debridement and reconstruction primarily with or without the use of Martius flap along with an autologous fascial sling for SUI. Similarly Amundsen et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> in their series of 9 patients with urethral erosion following pubovaginal (1 autologous and 8 synthetic) sling insertion described locating the urethral erosion cystoscopically and then incising the sling near the erosion with debridement of the urethra and then primary reconstruction along with augmentation with Martius graft. In a case of a synthetic sling， the whole sling was removed and in non-synthetic slings， it was “peeled out”of the urethra. However， in this series 30 months after surgery all the patients had some form of voiding dysfunction (urinary retention in4， urge incontinence in 3 and mixed incontinence in 2)； one of the patients with SUI required a pubovaginal sling later.\n\n【70】Reconstructive vascular flaps for post-traumatic urethral删除1换行reconstruction： Approaches for urethral reconstruction described by Blaivas et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> include using anterior or posterior bladder flaps and vaginal wall flaps.\n\n【71】Flisser et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>used flaps in 60/74 patients， Martius in 58，omental in 3， gracilis myocutaneous in 1； Martius flap was found to improve the outcome of the surgery as it would prevent the breakdown of the repair and thereby a recurrent fistula. Tubularized pedicle flaps of the buccal mucosa， neurovascular pudendal thigh flap and rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap have come up recently 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【72】A modified neurovascular pudendal thigh flap (Singapore flap) was described by Zorn et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> for complete urethral reconstruction following previous urogynecological surgeries in 2 patients. In 1patient a tubularized flap was anastomosed to the bladder neck，but she developed bladder neck stricture after 2 months and required urethral dilation. For the 2 patient， a flap was used to cover up an inlay urethroplasty.\n\n【73】Post-operative urethral catheterizatiom after urethral reconstruction： Chapple et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> recommended bladder drainage for about 4 weeks for complete urethral healing； we had kept our patient on per urethral catheterization for 4 weeks with good outcomes.\n\n【74】Complications related to urethral reconstruction： One of the early complications of urethral injury is an infection which can lead to an abscess formation， warranting early urinary diversion and antibiotics to prevent complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【75】Incases of urethral injury， the bladder can develop low compliance， over activity and impaired contractility which in most cases improves after successful urethral reconstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【76】Sling concomitant with POP repair in pre-operative SUI cases： Post POP repair there is a 25% to 40% chance of developing SUI (de novo or worsening) because of the unkinking of the urethra in previously continent women 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> concomitant sling surgery reduces the chances of postoperative SUI at the cost of increased risk of complications related to the AI procedure. However， in cases of preoperative SUI， a concomitant sling surgery along with POP repair had a significantly decreased rate of SUI at 1 year follow up 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Autologous fascial pubovaginal slings in comparison to synthetic mesh MUS have a higher risk of voiding dysfunction post-operatively along with greater morbidity associated with fascia harvesting通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>.

In our case， the patient reported acute onset of urinary incontinence following painful Foley insertion so primarily urethral reconstruction was sought along with VH and a second stage AI procedure was planned if she had persisted urinary incontinence.\n\n【77】Urethral reconstruction concomitant with POP repair： To our current knowledge， this is one of the first cases of urethral rupture during improper Foley catheterization treated successfully with urethral reconstruction， which was concomitantly performed with a vaginal hysterectomy and compartment repair in a single-stage procedure.\n\n【78】Conclusion\n\n【79】Even though Foley catheterization is a simple procedure but needs to be done with caution as improper insertion can lead to major删除1换行urethral injuries. Hence， in the present era of increasing medical litigation， knowing the management of iatrogenic urethral trauma is important， even though it is quite uncommon.\n\n【80】Pelvic organ prolapse repair and urethral reconstruction can be accomplished in the same setting； however， the need for an anti-incontinence procedure needs to be individualized.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In medical history of the patient， drug abuse was verified with a daily intake of 160 mg of furosemide during four years. The reason of selfinitiated excessive furosemide intake was allegedly face and limb swelling. Patient denied any previous kidney disease. The patient was normotensive with completely normalphysical status. Both， blood count and urinalysis were normal. Blood pH value was 7.43 and urine pH value was 6.5. Amount of 24h urine proteinuria was 200 mg. Electrolites and urine acid concentrations in blood and in 24h urine sample were normal. Serum levels of renin and aldosteron as well as their ratio were regular. Urine concentration test showed izostenuric values. At sonography， normal shaped and sized kidneys were found， with reduced parenchyma and a diffuse increase in echogenicity throughout the medullary pyramids.

In kidney biopsy samples， medulla calcifications(both in tubuli and interstitium) were described.\n\n【3】Conclusion： In conclusion， we can address that in our patient broad diagnostic procedure was performed in a way we could exclude various causes of nephrocalcinosis. In adults with nephrocalcinosis， besides many disorders， furosemide abuse should be considered as a potential etiopatogenetic factor.\n\n【4】Keywords： Adults； Furosemide； Nephrocalcinosis； Renal insufficiency； Ultrasonography\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Nephrocalcinosis， the abnormal deposition of calcium salts in the renal parenchyma， is a rare disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. It can take two different forms： medullary nephrocalcinosis is the most frequent form and is characterized by the exclusive involvement of the medullary pyramids. In a diffuse or cortical nephrocalcinosis， which is rare， the entire parenchyma is affected： this pattern is associated with severe metabolic disorders， such as hyperoxaluria， or end-stage nephropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【7】The association between nephrocalcinosis andlong-term furosemidetherapy is well documented in infants 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Pyramidal involvement is present in more than 60% of preamature infants with low birth weight or full term infants with congestive heart failure， treated with furosemide for long periods. Although furosemide is widely used for various medical conditions in adults， its association with nephrocalcinosis is not well established. In adults， nephrocalcinosis induced by furosemide is rare and presents as medullary nephrocalcinosis without significant alteration of renal function. So far， only a few cases of nephrocalcinosis caused by furosemide in adult patients have been described in the literature， but just one of them included either imaging description ofkidney and histological documentation of the kidney biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\nA 50-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital for investigation of azothaemia. She was seen in another hospital for facial edema and swelling of the fingers and knees， and later was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. In previous medical history， she had tonsillectomy， fracture of left hand in a traffic accident. The patient entered menopause in her 37h year and was taking oral hormonal supplementation only for several months. Three years before admission she|删除段之间换行|had a parodontosis of upper teeth. During past several years she has been occasionally suffering from insidious lumbar pain. The patient has been self-administering furosemide 160mg/day for 4 years due to persistent facial and knee edema and allegedly low daily urine volume. Two weeks before hospitalization at our department she had cancelled furosemide intake according to advice of her general practitioner.\n\n【9】Methods and Results\n\n【10】On admission the patient was 161cm tall， weighted 53 kg and had high blood pressure (170 mmHg/110 mmHg). No edema was observed and physical examination was normal. We performed a broad laboratory analysis. Both， blood count and urinalysis were normal. Blood pH value was 7.43 and urine pH value was 6.5. Urine microbiology was sterile. Amount of 24h urine proteinuria(determined by Biuret test) was 200 mg. Initial metabolic evaluation was performed： concentration of creatinine， calcium， phosphorus， uric acid， sodium， potassium and chloride were measured both in blood and urine. 24-urine samples were also analyzed for volume， magnesium， oxalate and citrate.\n\n【11】Renal function was depressed (creatinine clearance was 62 ml/min). All the other parameters analyzed were normal. A parathyroid ultrasound was normal. Intact PTH was measured in the blood which was normal. Serum levels of renin and aldosteron as well as their ratio were regular. Urine concentration test showed izostenuric values (in first urine sample osmolality was 290 mOsm/L). Finally， we decided to make radio morfological and pathohistological investigation.\n\n【12】We used Simens acuson ultrasound device and Siemns Somatom Sensation 16 CT system. A renal ultrasound showed medullary nephrocalcinosis with total involvement of medullary pyramids. An abnormal renal computerized tomography confirmed this sonographic finding .\n\n【13】Biopsy findings\n\n【14】Three peaces of kidney tissue measuring 4-10 mm were analyzed. About 70% of tissue was medulla and the rest was cortex with 11glomeruli. Two glomeruli were globally sclerotic and the all others had normal morphology. There were several foci of calcification in tubules and interstitium predominantly within medulla . Only few cortical tubules were involved by calcification. The all others cortical tubules had normal morphology. The foci of calcification were surrounded by interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. The blood vessels were unremarkable. There was no evidence of immune deposits in immunofluorescent stains and electron microscopy demonstrated the normal ultra structure of analyzed glomerulus and surrounding tubules.\n\n【15】Clinical follow-up\n\n【16】Two months after discharged from hospital， patient came to first control examination. In laboratory findings there were 24h proteinurialevel of0.7 gand better renal excretion parameters： serum creatinine 83 umol/L with creatinine clearance of 72 mL/min and normal serum potassium level (4.5 mmol/L).\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Nephrocalcinosis， is a term originally used to describe deposition of calcium salts in the renal parenchyma due to hyperparathyroidism. It is now more commonly used to describe diffuse， fine， renal parenchymal calcification on radiology. Nephrocalcinosis can be subdivided into the cortical type， which is classicallythe result ofacute tubular necrosis， and the medullary type seen in several metabolic disorders. Many causes of nephrocalcinosis have been added since the original description. These include causes of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria， medullary sponge kidney， hyperparathyreoidism， renaltubularacidosis ( (RTA)Sspecifically distal1RTA。renal tuberculosis， renal papillary necrosis， oxaluria， sarcoidosis and milk-alkali syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-7]</u>. Furosemide is a powerful diuretic drug which has been used successfully in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Hyponatremia， hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis are frequent side-effects of the treatment. An association of renal calcinosis with furosemide therapy in preterm infants was first reported in the early 1980's， the risk of developing nephrocalcinosis being highest删除1换行in the most premature ones. Furthermore， the risk of developing nephrocalcinosis was correlated with the dose of furosemide 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In addition to， the period soon after initiation of furosemide therapy appears most sensitive in regard of developing nephrocalcinosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The calciuric action of furosemide is one of the most distinguished factors provoking nephrocalcinosis in preterm infants， but other provoking pathogenic mechanisms are undoubtedly also involved in most cases. Human and animal studies suggest that the development of nephrocalcinosis does not always require hypercalciuria， but alterations in urinary inhibitors of crystal formation (e.g. citrate， magnesium)， urinary excretion of oxalate and urine pH may also play a role 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，8]</u>. The possibility of nephrocalcinosis being due to type I renal tubular acidosis must be excluded by a complete nephrologic examination (serum potassium，pH，bicarbonate， tubular acidification test with NH CD.\n\n【19】Our findings are consistent to previous reports suspecting long term furosemide treatment in adults may cause mild medullary nephrocalcinosis，characterized by peripheral d depositionof calcium salts in the pyramids with depressed renal function.

This study aimed to compare the results of trimodality therapy with CRT alone in patients with locally advanced resectable SCC.\n\n【2】Patients and Methods： Patients with locally advanced resectable SCC of esophagus were eligible. For trimodality， patients received surgery and preoperative/postoperative chemoradiation. In CRT alone group， patients only received radiation and chemotherapy. Local tumor control，3-year survival and treatment-related mortality were assessed.\n\n【3】Results： 184 consecutive patients were analyzed. 109 were treated with trimodality therapy， 75received CRT alone depended on patients'willing. 17.4% of the resected patients in trimodality group had locoreginal recurrent disease versus 30.7% in the CRT alone group (P=0.036). The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 53.8% versus 33.5% (P= 0.019)， and the overall survival (OS) was 51.2% versus 39.8% (P= 0.011)， for patients received trimodality and CRT alone， respectively. Treatment-related mortality was 3.7% in trimodality group compared with 1.3% in definitive CRT group (P=0.650). There was no significant difference in the 3-year OS in patients receiving a 50.4Gy radiation dose compared with >50.4 Gy radiation dose in CRT alone group (45.3% vs. 36.4%， P=0.927).\n\n【4】Conclusions： Compared with CRT alone， trimodality therapy appeared to have superior local control， PFS and OS， with similar treatment-related mortality for the treatment of patients with SCC of esophagus. The role of surgery could not be replaced by CRT alone， even with increased radiation dose.\n\n【5】Keywords： Oesophageal squamouscell carcinoma；TTrimodality therapy； Preoperative chemoradiotherapy； Postoperative chemoradiotherapy； Definitive chemoradiotherapy\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Esophageal cancer is the sixth most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide and is more common in the developing nations通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Esophageal cancers are histologically classified as Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma. SCC is the major histology in Eastern Europe and Asia， and 95% of esophageal cancer is pathologically diagnosed as SCC in China通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Radiochemotherapy and surgical resection are standard therapies for patients with locally advanced resectable SCC of the esophagus.\n\n【8】Numerous randomized trials have investigated the impact of radiotherapy dose modifications， combined-modality therapy， and preoperative/postoperative administration of adjuvant therapy in an effort to improve effectiveness without compromising safety， reducing the incidence of local recurrence， and prolonging survival 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-7]</u>. For example， results from the multicenter phase III randomized trial (CROSS study)， the largest trial in its class， showed that preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with carboplatin and paclitaxel significantly improved overall survival(OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) compared to surgery alone in patients with resectable (T2-3， N0-1， M0) esophageal or esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancers通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Similarly， the results of删除1换行two meta-analyses have shown that preoperative CRT combined with surgery significantly reduced 3-year mortality and locoregional recurrence when compared with surgery alone通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>. On the other hand， the efficacy of postoperative CRT compared to surgery alone has not been demonstrated in a randomized trial in patients with esophageal cancer. However， in retrospective analyses， the addition of postoperative CRT has been associated with survival benefit in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer， such as those that are lymph node-positive and with deeper primary tumor invasion(pT3， pT4)， compared with surgery alone通用删除6(英):<u>[11-13]</u>. Finaly， two randomized trials comparing trimodality therapy with definitive CRT demonstrated no OS benefit with the addition of esophagectomy to CRT通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>， especially in patients with locally advanced SCC of the esophagus who experience response to initial CRT通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Therefore， the optimal multimodality therapy for locally advanced SCC of the esophagus is still unclear.\n\n【9】This retrospective study was designed to determine the best approach to administer multimodality therapyto patients with locally advanced SCC of the esophagus. The primary aim was to determine if the addition of surgical resection to CRT decreases local recurrence and prolongs in survival compared with CRT alone. Furthermore， we sought to assess the factors that may affect survival and recurrence in patients with locally advanced SCC ofthe esophagus.\n\n【10】Materials and Methods\n\n【11】Patient population\n\n【12】Patients with locally advanced resectable (cT3， potentially resectable cT4 or N+) SCC of the esophagus who were treated with preoperative CRT or postoperative CRT plus esophagectomy(trimodality therapy group)， or only radiation with chemotherapy(CRT alone group)， between April 2011 and November 2015 were included. Patients were included if they were aged 18 to 75 years， with an ECOG/WHO performance score <2， and showed<10% weightloss. Patients were excluded if their esophageal cancer was located in the cervical esophagus， if this was their second malignancy， if they were identified as receiving irradiation to a site other than the esophagus， or if they received radiotherapy without concurrent chemotherapy. The patient population consisted partially of patients enrolled in the ZTOG1201 trial， a randomized controlled trial in which eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive preoperative CRT plus surgery or surgery plus postoperative CRT 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【13】Chemoradiotherapy\n\n【14】Chemotherapy consisted of concurrent paclitaxel (50 mg/m’of body-surface area) and carboplatin (intravenous carboplatin [AUC 2mg/ml per min]) targeted at an area under the curve of two， starting on days 1， 8， 15， 22， 29， and 36 during the first and sixth weeks of radiotherapy in the preoperative CRT group and the CRT alone group. Patients in the postoperative CRT group mostly underwent postoperative CRT at 4-6 weeks after surgery. Chemotherapy in the postoperative CRT group consisted of two cycles of sequential paclitaxel (150 mg/m’ of body-surface area) and carboplatin(intravenous carboplatin [AUC 5 mg/mL per min]) targeted at an area under the curve of five， starting on week 3， and week 6 after radiotherapy.\n\n【15】All patients were treated with external-beam radiation using an intensity-modulated radiation therapy technique. Gross tumor volume was drawn on each relevant slice of the planning CT and was defined by the primary tumor and any enlarged regional lymph删除1换行nodes. The planning target volume (PTV) provided a proximal and distal margin of 4 cm and a radial margin of 1.3 cm around the gross tumor volume. Individually shaped beams were used in each field by multileaf collimators to ensure optimal sparing of normal tissue. The daily prescription dose of 1.8 to 2.0 Gy was specified by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurement50/62 reference point， and the 95% isodose had to encompass the entire PTV. The maximum dose to the PTV was not to exceed the prescription dose by <7%. Tissue density inhomogeneity correction was used.\n\n【16】Patients were required to have complete information regarding the total radiation planning， as well as the chemotherapy regimen. We limited our analysis to patients who received radiation doses of41.4 to 50.4 Gy in the preoperative CRT group， 45 to 50.4 Gy in the postoperative CRT group， and 50 to 64.8 Gy in the definitive CRT group， as these represent the expected ranges for preoperative/postoperative to definitive radiation doses. All patients received the same chemotherapy regimen with paclitaxel and carboplatin. The delivery of concurrent CRT was determined by only including patients who were identified as receiving their chemotherapy within a1-week window before or after the initiation of radiotherapy.\n\n【17】Surgery\n\n【18】Patients in the trimodality therapy group preferably underwent surgery at 4-6 weeks after completion of preoperative CRT， or as soon as possible after randomization in postoperative subgroup. The final choice of surgical procedure including minimally invasive oesophagectomy (MIE) or open oesophagectomy (OE) with a intrathoracic gastric tube reconstruction (Ivor Lewis procedure) or neck anastomosis (Mckeown procedure) was at the surgeon's discretion， depending on tumor localization， patient characteristics. Gastric-tube reconstruction with a cervical anastomosis was the preferred technique. A wide local excision of the N1 lymph nodes， including standard excision of the celiac nodes， was carried out.\n\n【19】Assessment of recurrence\n\n【20】Relapses were classified as locoregional or distant. Locoregional relapses were defined as recurrences at the site of the primary tumor or locoregional lymph nodes. Lymph node recurrences at the celiac trunk or in the supraclavicular region were also considered to be locoregional. Distant recurrences were defined as non-regional lymph node recurrences， systemic metastases， malignant pleural effusions， or peritoneal metastases. Most patients suspected of experiencing recurrence underwent a CT scan of the thorax and abdomen or an endoscopy. If necessary， cytology or histology was obtained. Ifa second recurrence was detected within 4 weeks after the first occurrence， it was considered to be synchronous. Localization and date of identification of all locoregional and distant recurrences were recorded.\n\n【21】Statistical analysis\n\n【22】Demographic details were compared between patients who received trimodality treatment or CRT alone using the x2 test， the Fisher exact test， and the Mann-Whitney test， where appropriate. Multivariate Cox regression of OS and tumor recurrence was performed to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using these same covariates， excluding age， gender， WHO/ECOG score， tumor location， tumor length， T staging， N staging， radiation dose， and treatment approach. Kaplan-Meier analyses of OS were performed comparing patients who received删除表格换行(95% CI： 26.7-52.9%) with a median survival time of 22.0 months(95%： CI 17.1 to 26.9 months； P= 0.011， ). Furthermore， treatment related mortality was 3.7% in the trimodality group compared with 1.3% in the definitive CRT group (P=0.650).\n\n【23】Table 1： Patient Characteristics (n=184).\n\n| Characteristic  | Trimodality therapy (n=109)  |  | CRT alone (n=75)  |  | Pvalue  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Characteristic  | No.  | %  | No.  |  |  |\n| Age， years  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Median  | 59  |  | 61  |  | 0.010  |\n| Range  | 42-74  |  | 41-75  |  |  |\n| Gender  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Male  | 104  | 95.4  | 62  | 82.7  | 0.004  |\n| Female  | 5  | 4.6  | 13  | 17.3  |  |\n| WHO performance status score  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 0  | 5  | 4.6  | 6  | 8  | 0.672  |\n| 1  | 104  | 95.4  | 69  | 92.0  |  |\n| Tumor location  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Proximal thire  | 4  | 3.7  | 20  | 26.7  | 0.037  |\n| Middle third  | 58  | 53.2  | 34  | 45.3  | (Proximal and Middle vs. Distal)  |\n| Distal third  | 47  | 43.1  | 21  | 28.0  |  |\n| Tumor length (cm)  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| c5  | 36  | 33  | 47  | 62.7  | <0.001  |\n| 25  | 73  | 67.0  | 28  | 37.3  |  |\n| Clinical T category  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| T1 or T2  | 25  | 22.9  | 13  | 17.3  | 0.356  |\n| T3 or T4  | 84  | 77.1  | 62  | 82.7  |  |\n| Clinical N category  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| NO  | 20  | 18.3  | 8  | 10.7  | 0.154  |\n| N1  | 89  | 81.7  | 67  | 89.3  |  |\n| Radiation dose (Gy)  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| <50.4  | 30  | 27.5  |  |  |  |\n| 50.4  | 79  | 72.5  |  |  |  |\n| 50-50.4  |  |  | 28  | 37.3  |  |\n| >50.4  |  |  | 47  | 62.7  |  |\n\n【25】CRT - Chemoradiation Therapy； WHO - World Health Organization删除1换行definitive radiation to a dose of 50 to 50.4 Gy with those who received>50.4 Gy. Survival analyses were also performed comparing those who received definitive CRT with those who received trimodality therapy after stratification by treatment sequence (preoperative CRT or postoperative CRT). Significant values were defined as those with a P-value of <0.05.\n\n【26】Results\n\n【27】Study population\n\n【28】The analysis included 184 patients： 109 (59.2%) underwent trimodality therapy， including57(31.0%)whounderwent preoperative CRT followed by oesophagectomy and 52 (28.2%)who underwent oesophagectomy followed by postoperative CRT， and75(40.8%) underwent CRT alone. The median age was 60 years old(range， 41 to 75 years). Patients undergoing trimodality therapy were more likely to be younger， male gender， have a longer tumor length， and a tumorlocation in the distal third of the esophagus. Additional details on patient characteristics are listed in Table 1.\n\n【29】Analysis of recurrence\n\n【30】After a median follow-up of 36 months (range， 6 to 53 months) and a median survival time of 31 months (95% CI： 20.2-41.8删除1换行months)， 33.9% (37/109) of the resected patients in the trimodality therapy group had recurrent disease versus 50.7% (38/75) in the CRT alone group. There was a significant difference between the two treatment groups in terms of tumor recurrence (P= 0.023). Only17.4%(19/109) of the resected patients in the trimodality arm had locoregional recurrent disease versus 30.7%(23/75) in the definitive CRT arm (P =0.036). Moreover， fewer patients (16.5%， 18/109) in the trimodality arm had distant failure compared to those in the CRT alone arm (18.7%，14/75)， although this difference was not significant(P=0.705).\n\n【31】Table 2 lists the univariate and multivariate Cox Regression Analyses for tumor recurrence.

However， the survival was not significantly\n\n【42】Discussion\n\n【43】The present study indicated that adding surgery to CRT for the treatment of clinical resectable，locally advanced SCC ofthe esophagus significantly decreased the local recurrence rates， prolonged PFS and OS， with similar treatment-related mortality for the treatment compared with CRT alone. In the trimodality treatment group， the 3-year OS was 51.2% (95% CI： 36.1-66.3%) similar to the result achieved for preoperative CRT in the CROSS trial (51%)通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>， which were better than that achieved in the CRT alone group (39.8%，95%CI： 26.7-52.9%).\n\n【44】Surgery is a major component of treatment for resectable disease. Based on data from the National Cancer Database of America， trimodality therapy was associated with improved OS (P<0.001)， with a median OS of 35.6 months and 3-year OS of 49.6%，compared删除1换行to patients receiving CRT (median and 3-year OS were 16.8 months and 26.8%， respectively)通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. The effect of adding surgery to CRT in patients with locally advanced SCC of esophagus has also been evaluated in two randomized trials通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>. Stahl et al. randomized172 patients to either induction chemotherapy followed by CRT and surgery or induction chemotherapy followed by CRT通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. The 2-year PFS rate was better in the surgery group (64.3%) than in the CRT group (40.7%)， without significantly affecting 3-year OS (31% vs. 24%， respectively).However， this study was prematurely terminated due to lack of accrual. On the other hand， Bedenne et al. (FFCD 9102 trial) showed that adding surgery to CRT provided no benefit compared with treatment with additional CRT， especially in patients with locally advanced SCC of the esophagus who responded to initial CRT通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. However， this trial suffered from suboptimal study design， indeed，the results of non-randomized patients in the FFCD 9102 phase III trial indicated that OS did not differ between responders to induction CRT and patients having salvage surgery after clinical failure of CRT通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Moreover， in a recent prospective study that compared the outcomes of surveillance versus surgical resection in patients with esophageal cancer achieving complete clinical response after preoperative CRT， surgical resection was independently associated with less recurrence(32.7% vs. 50.8%；P=0.021) and better median survival (83 months vs. 31 months； P= 0.001)通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Similarly， Patients who completed TMT ( chemoradiotherapy [CRT] and surgery)had the best local control in a Single-Institution Experience conducted by 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>Sio TT et al. 5-year local control was 82% for TMT， while 60% for CRT and40% for PTMT patients who began treatment with trimodality intent but did not undergo surgery groups (P<0.001).\n\n【45】Regarding if the role of adding surgery could be replaced by escalated radiation dose in the CRT alone group. The current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommended ranges for preoperative， postoperative and definitive radiation are41.4 to 50.4 Gy， 45 to 50.4 Gy， and 50 to 50.4 Gy， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Despite the lack of significant evidence supporting radiation dose escalation， we found that radiation doses exceeding 50.4 Gy were used in 58.7% of patients in the CRT alone group in this retrospective study due to the historical situation in China. However， we found no survival benefit to a dose escalation of >50.4 Gy compared with those receiving a 50 to 50.4 Gy radiation dose. A previous study on the use of definitive CRT (the RTOG 8501 trial) showed that the 5-year OS was 26% in patients receiving chemotherapy with radiotherapy (to a total dose of 50 Gy) and 0% when radiotherapy (to total dose of 64Gy) was used alone通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Owing to the low OS and high local failure rate with definitive CRT， the Intergroup 0123 trial subsequently randomized patients to receiving the same chemotherapy with either50.4 Gy or 64.8 Gy of radiation通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. However， the trial was stopped early after an interim analysis showed the 2-year median survival (13vs. 18.1 months) and locoregional failure rates (56% vs. 52%) were not significantly different between the high-dose and standard-dose arms. Similarly， our multivariate analysis indicated no differences in OS and recurrence based on the radiation dose delivered in both the trimodality and CRT alone groups. As no subsequent studies have revealed a significant benefit to dose escalation exceeding 50.4 Gy in CRT alone group， our study indicated that the role of surgery could not be replaced by CRT alone， even with increased radiation dose for locally advanced SCC of the esophagus.\n\n【46】The current study does have some limitations. For example， as this was a retrospective study and only esophageal SCC patients in China were recruited， we may have introduced selection bias and we lack a删除1换行proper intent-to-treat analysis. Furthermore， while the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is dramatically increasing in Western countries， the results of our study should not be generalized to apply to North American and European patients until a randomized study including esophageal adenocarcinoma patients confirms our results. Moreover，based on our study， its unclear what is the potential value of additional locoregional therapy with surgery in patients with clinical complete response to CRT.We also had no idea about the timing and necessity of oesophagectomy in (all) patients. In the future， molecular biology techniques probably may enable to improve prognostic stratification， thereby allowing us to determine the types of patients who benefit from surgical therapy and show improved OS通用删除6(英):<u>[22-25]</u>. In addition， we did not analyze whether patients received salvage therapies， such as salvage esophagectomy， in the CRT alone group， which may have affected survival outcomes. Further investigation of the innovative multidisciplinary management (i.e.，preoperative CRT followed by salvage esophagectomy) for patients withlocallyadvanced esophageal cancer is warranted. Indeed， this approach is currently being explored in Netherlands by investigators of the preSANO trial， clinical response evaluation after neoadjuvantchemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer (NTR4834)通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>.\n\n【47】In conclusion， adding surgery to CRT appears to have superior local control， PFS and OS， with similar treatment-related mortality for the treatment of patients with SCC of esophagus.

Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) are used as routine diagnostic procedures in the evaluation of pulmonary sarcoidosis but they are unable to detect active inflammation.\n\n【5】LFF-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (\"F-FDG PET)/CT has shown useful in assessing the extent of organ involvement and in suggesting the organs that might be candidates for diagnostic biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Furthermore，F-FDG PET/CT seems to contribute to a better evaluation of the extrapulmonary involvement and it may identify occult granulomatous lesions that are not detected by physical examination， conventional thoracic radiography or CT 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. Additionally， the IBF-FDG PET/CT has been compared to Ga-scintigraphy in patients with sarcoidosis illustrating a superior sensitivity， especially in depicting sites ofextrathoracic involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【6】Here we report a case of sarcoidosis detected by 1F-FDG PET/CT.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 29-year old man with a history ofbilateral enlargement ofthe parotid glands， alternating fever， discrete dyspnea， and fatigue for several months was admitted to the hospital. Before admission， the patient had been examined by an otorhinolaryngologist and a fine needle biopsy from the parotid gland was conducted， demonstrating granulomas， indicative of sarcoidosis. The patient had felt enlargement of the inguinal lymph nodes but had otherwise no other discomforts. Due to suspicion of sarcoidosis， an lBF-FDG PET/CT was conducted to visualize the extent of organ involvement. The \"F-FDG PET/CT revealed significantly increased IF-FDG uptake in bilateral enlarged parotid glands  and in bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes， predominantly right paratracheal adenopathy . No enlargement or increased F-FDG uptake was observed in the inguinal lymph nodes. Measurement of the serum angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) demonstrated highly elevated level (166 U/l) (normal upper limit <115U/).\n\n【9】The 'F-FDG PET/CT findings， elevated level of serum ACE， and histopathological examination of parotid gland biopsy with non-caseating epithelioid-cell granulomas confirmed the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.\n\n【10】As the patient’s symptoms were regressing， no treatment was initiated.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】In 1990 Sulavik and colleagues described increased symmetrical lacrimal gland and parotid gland &Ga-citrate uptake combined with normal accumulation of the radionuclide in the nasopharynx(\"panda\"appearance) in 79% ofsarcoidosis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Furthermore， a distinctive intrathoracic lymph node 67Ga -uptake pattern was observed， resembling the Greek letter lambda (A). The simultaneous\"lambda\" and \"panda\" patterns were observed only in sarcoidosis patients and this was considered highly specific for sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Therefore， it has been argued that the combination of the \"lambda\"and \"panda\" sign may obviate a histopathological examination. Enlargement of the parotid glands is rarely seen in patients with sarcoidosis (~6%)通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【13】The appearance of hypermetabolic intrathoracic lymphadenopathy detected by F-FDG PET/CT in patients with sarcoidosis is comparable to the \"lambda\" sign on the gallium scintigraphy as well as the bilateral involvement of the parotid and lacrimal glands with high \"F-FDG uptake， resembling the \"panda\"sign 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. The typical \"panda\" appearance is however partially obscured because of the high physiological lBF-FDG uptake of the brain. In our patient the \"lambda\" and \"panda\" signs coexisted on the IF-FDG PET/CT although involvement of the lacrimal glands could not be visualized.\n\n【14】IBF-FDG PET/CT is increasingly used in the diagnostic work-up of pulmonary and mediastinal tumors that are suspected to be malignant. However， sarcoid lesions can demonstrate high \"F-FDG uptake mimicking malignant processes such as lymphoma or lymph node metastases. Irrespective of the combination of the “lambda” and“panda”signs detected by IF-FDG PET， histological confirmation should be mandatory.\n\n【15】In active sarcoidosis， a significant increased metabolism in the active lesions can be detected by an increased IF-FDG uptake. However， after immunosuppressive therapy or spontaneous regression， the metabolism of the lesions may decrease 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，9，10]</u>， probably prior to morphological changes. Thus， IBF-FDG PET/CT删除2换行may be a valuable adjunct to the clinical examination in monitoring the response to therapy.\n\n【16】Although the serum level of ACE is elevated in up to 60% of sarcoidosis patients， it is never diagnostic since elevation can be seen in other diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. It may however decrease after corticosteroid treatment or spontaneous improvement 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In this patient no treatment was initiated as spontaneous regression was observed.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】IBF-FDG PET/CT is valuable in demonstrating active lesions of sarcoidosis， both thoracic and extrathoracic involvement. Furthermore， IF-FDG PET/CT might be useful in monitoring treatment response in patients with sarcoidosis； however， costs and radiation expose should always be taken into account.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Although rare， the general surgeon should be familiar with the workup， evaluation and treatment of these tumors. PNETs account for 1% of all pancreatic tumors， the majority of which are non-functional. Thelocation variation ofthese can be significant making surgicalplanning challenging. Although PNETs can occur sporadically， they have been found to be associated with MEN-1， Von Hippel-Lindau，and neurofibromatosis type 1. PNETs， also called Islet cell tumors，are pancreatic neoplasms that are derived from islet cells within the pancreas. Non-functioning PNETs are typically found incidentally on imaging. However，patients with larger PNETs may present with abdominal pain， mass effect， obstructive symptoms， or metastatic disease. Surgical resection in these patients can be curative or palliative.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】JL is a 59 year-old female with a past medical history of morbid obesity with lap band that presented to her family medicine clinic on May 6\"， 2019 complaining of fatigue for several months. She reported a lack of appetite， 20 pound unintentional weight loss and malaise. She had been worked up previously for hypothyroidism and was started on levothyroxine with minimal relief of symptoms. However， after starting on levothyroxine， she reported continued lethargy and fatigue. At this initial visit to her primary care provider， she was noted to have abdominal fullness measuring approximately 10 cm in diameter. Due to the fullness in the abdomen， the primary care provider ordered a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast and basic lab work. She was also scheduled to see her bariatric surgeon for removal of Lap band.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】Imaging\n\n【6】CT abdomen pelvis findings： There is a large solid vascular heterogeneous mass involving most of the bodyand tail of the pancreas. This measures approximately 12 cm x 12 cm x11 cm. The mass pushes the stomach anteriorly and stomach laterally. Etiology of mass is uncertain based on imaging. Could represent pseudopapillary tumor or neuroendocrine tumor but is non-specific .\n\n【7】The patient then presented to the bariatric/general surgery office after referral from primary care for concerns of pancreatic mass. The patient has noted early satiety over the past several months as well as weight loss and fatigue. The abdominal exam revealed a large， central abdominal mass. CT report and images were reviewed. CT pancreas protocol was ordered at this time. The patient also underwent MRI abdomen with and without contrast. This revealed a large mass centered in the tail region of the pancreas with a couple arterially enhancing liver lesions concerning for metastases. Large hemangioma also noted in the left hepatic lobe. CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed the hepatic lesions were consistent with hemangioma. CA-19-9 was within normal range. No other significant laboratory findings at that time. Oncology was consulted and the patient was scheduled for distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy.\n\n【8】Operative report： July 26h， 2019\n\n【9】Patient taken for distal pancreatectomy， partial gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy， splenectomy， gastric band and port removal.\n\nIn the preoperative area informed consent was obtained and all questions were answered. She|删除段之间换行|was wheeled back to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. She was placed under excellent general endotracheal anesthesia and a left arterial line and right internal jugular vein central venous catheter was inserted. A Foley catheter was placed to monitor resuscitation. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion using Chloraprep and a surgical time out was performed.\n\n【11】A midline laparotomy incision was made with a ten blade from xiphoid to suprapubic. It was taken down using Bovie electrocautery until we entered the peritoneum. When we had good visualization of our abdomen， we used LigaSure to take down any adhesions for better visualization. We immediately noticed， on inspection， a hemangioma on the liver and a large 15 cm mass displacing the stomach downward. We inspected and palpated the rest of the abdomen and checking small bowel， did not notice any other masses or abnormalities. We entered the lesser sac through the gastrocolic ligament and took the ligament laterally and medially to make room， we took down the short gastrics with good hemostasis. The mass wa adherent to the antrum of the stomach. We used LigaSure to dissect it free from the superior stomach， however， we noticed it would not free from the distal stomach/antrum. We came across the stomach with an echelon stapler， utilizing a green loadproximal to the antrum.\n\n【12】We then， using combination of LigaSure and stick ties (3-0 vicryl) were able to obtain hemostasis as we went. Despite this， the tumor was bleeding profusely. As we were dissecting lateral to the tumor the LigaSure came across the splenic hilar vessels. We then took the spleen with two echelon white loads. Hemostasis was achieved. We were able to bluntly dissect with our fingers behind the neck of the pancreas and came across it with an echelon white load. With one whiter load we were able to free the mass from the peritoneal attachments and adhesions to nearby structures and deliver it. It was at least 15 cm in diameter and close to 5 lbs. We then transected the duodenum distal to the antrum using Echelon blue load and removed the antrum. We turned our attention to the gastric band and freed it from the capsule using Bovie electrocautery and then removed it from the stomach and abdomen. Next starting at ligament of Treitz we traveled down 50 cm and transected it with 2 white loads. We then measured out 80 cm of jejunum distally for the alimentary limb. We secured the jejunojejunostomy with a running 3-0 vicryl suture and created two enterotomies. We used the echelon to staple our jejunojejunostomy and closed the remaining enterotomy with running 3-0 Vicryl. We then took the proximal end of the alimentary limb and secured it to the distal stomach remnant. We created two enterotomies with the Bovie and stapled with the echelon to create our gastrojejunostomy. We then closed our remaining enterotomy with the running vicryl suture. We were satisfied with our repair. We took one more look in the abdomen and ensured hemostasis with Surgiflo and 3-0 Vicryl stick ties in our dissection bed， where small unnamed vessels were bleeding. We were happy with our hemostasis and closed our mesenteric defects with Ethibond running suture， tacking the jejunum to the mesentery after we closed the majority of the defect to ensure that it would not slide though superiorly. We then removed the port from inside of the abdominal wall and closed the fascial defect with a figure of 8， 0-vicryl suture. Finally， we closed the abdomen with 0 PDS in running fashion. The skin was closed with staples and dressed with abdominal pads and tape. All counts were correct .\n\n【13】Table 1： WHO 2010 Grading system based on mitotic count and Ki-67 indices(ENETS).\n\n| Grade  | Differentiation  | Ki-67 index%  | Mitotic Count/10 HPF  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Grade  | Differentiation  | Ki-67 index%  | Mitotic Count/10 HPF  |\n| G1(low)  | Well  | </=2  | <2  |\n| G1(low)  | Well  | </=2  | <2  |\n| G2(intermediate)  | Well  | 3-20  | 2-20  |\n| G2(intermediate)  | Well  | 3-20  | 2-20  |\n| G3(high)  | Poor  | >20  | >20  |\n\n【15】Table 2： Tumor staging.\n\n| Tumor staging  | Description  |\n| --- | --- |\n| TX  | Cannot be assessed  |\n| TO  | No evidence of tumor  |\n| T1  | <2 cm， limited to pancreas  |\n| T2  | 2 cm to 4 cm， limited to pancreas  |\n| T3  | >4 cm limited to pancreas  |\n| T4  | Involving adjacent organs or blood vessels  |\n\n| Nodal Staging  | Description  |\n| --- | --- |\n| NO  | No regional lymph node metastasis  |\n| N1  | Regional lymph node metastasis present  |\n\n【18】Patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells， 4 units of fresh frozen plasma\n\n【19】Mass Measurements： 15 cm x9 cmx 10cm，80oz\n\n【20】Post-operative report\n\n【21】Thepatient was transferredl to the intensive care unit postoperatively. The patient was mobile the following day after surgery on July 27h， 2019， able to get up out of her bed and move to her chair. She remained NPO at this time as she had not vet had a bowel movement. The patient's postoperative blood loss anemia remained stable. On July 28h， 2019， Post-operative day #2， the patient remained mobile and was able to walk around the unit. She had still yet to pass a bowel movement. On July 30h， 2019，Post-operative day#3， the patient was noted to be hypoglycemic at 56. The patient was started on D5W at 75 mL/h and Accu-Cheks ordered every 4 h. The patient remained NPO as she had not vet passed a bowel movement. On July 315， 2019， post-operative day #4， the patient s hypoglycemia had improved and she had been advanced to a full liquid diet as she began passing flatus. D5W was discontinued as were the Accu-Cheks. The patient maintained excellent pain control with her pain medication regimen. On August 1， 2019， Post-operative day #5， the patient noted that she did have a bowel movement over the course the previous evening and continued passing flatus. She was advanced to a regular diet and was tolerating it well without nausea or vomiting. Her only complaint at that time was mild incisional pain. The patient was medically cleared for discharge with instructions to follow-up with the surgeon on August 9t and follow-up with her primary care physician and oncologist in 1 to 2 weeks.\n\n【22】Follow up with surgeon： August 9h， 2019\n\n【23】The patient reported mild reflux but otherwise doing well.

The liver lesions were determined to be hemangiomas per triple phase CT.\n\n【32】PET done on December 27t.2019\n\n【33】Revealed no lesions of concern for metastatic disease\n\n【34】Discussion\n\n【35】Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors can be divided into two main subtypes： Functional and non-functional depending on their ability to secrete biologically active hormones 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，21</u>. In this discussion we will focus on the non-functional subtype which was described in the case.\n\n【36】Neuroendocrine tumors remain a rare pathology for the general surgeon. However， of allneuroendocrine tumors， pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are the most common， making up 7% of all NETs. The overall incidence of PNETs appears to increase with age， with the peak being 65 years of age. Of all PNETs， non-functioning PNETs comprise up to 90% and are often asymptomatic. These tumors commonly present as advanced disease when metastatic complications arise 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【37】Staging and prognosis of PNETs have changed in recent years， focusing on the mitotic counts and Ki-67 indices. Well differentiated tumors are determined to be lower grade as poorly differentiated mors are higher grade .\n\n【38】AsS1mentioneddbefore， non-functionalPNETsareoften asymptomatic until the disease process is more advanced. The lack of hormonal function of these tumors makes symptomatology lacking or non-specific. Commonly， the presenting symptoms are due to mass effect from a large， growing tumor. This was the case in our patient which initiated her workup. These tumors are often found in the pancreatichead resulting in obstructive symptoms，both duodenal and pancreatic and biliary. Common symptoms include weight loss，删除1换行jaundice， and abdominal pain. The most common area of metastasis is hepatic. Often bilobar and multifocal 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【39】90% of NF-PNETs are sporadic with up to 10% being genetically associated. Up to 75% of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasm type 1 eventually develop PNETs， most commonly， NF-PNETs. Of note， patients with von-Hippel Lindau syndrome do have an increased incidence of PNETs， up to 20% 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【40】Diagnostics\n\n【41】The imaging modality of choice remains Computed Tomography with IV contrast if high suspicion of PNET's. PNETs typically appear well circumscribed with enhancing features with contrast， specifically during the arterial phase of CT. Referring back to Figure 1 above； the mass appears well circumscribed with arterial enhancement.\n\n【42】Alternatively， MRI is another option for diagnosis and operative planning of suspected PNETs. PNETs displaylow signal intensity with T1 weighted and high intensity on T2 weighted images. Referring to Figures 2 and 3， the intensity difference can be observed 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【43】Treatment\n\n【44】Surgical resection of symptomatic NF-PNETs remains the treatment of choice and is suggested in ENETS consensus Guidelines通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Surgical resection is often the only curative option for patient with pancreatic neoplasms. Patients with NF-PNETs may benefit from symptomatic relief as well as curative outcomes depending on pre-operative staging. Patients with obstructive symptoms will likely need operative intervention regardless of respectability for symptomatic relief. Per the ENETS guidelines， these patients may undergo tumor resection with hepatic metastasis resection concomitantly. However， if a pancreaticoduodenectomy is performed， large hepatic resection should be avoided.\n\n【45】In patients with <2 cm NF-PNETs， observation has been suggested， however， safe resection remains the recommendation as it may be curative. Larger lesions， however， are likely to require surgical resection通用删除6(英):<u> 3]</u>.\n\n【46】NF-NETs remain to be primarily treated with surgical resection. According to a large retrospective study done by Hill et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> patients with NF-NET's exhibited significant survival benefits in all stages of surgery. The results revealed that patients benefit from surgical resection in local， regional and metastatic disease. Overall， the median survival difference in patients undergoing surgical resection was 114 months vs. 35 months in patients not undergoing resection. It has been suggested that small <1 cm， low grade tumors may be surgically enucleated. However， with larger masses， more extensive operations may be required. Typically， PNETs located in the head of the pancreas should be considered for pancreaticoduodenectomy， whereas distal pancreatectomy should be the operation of choice for lesions located in the body and tail. Splenic preservation is typically an intra-operative decision and does not appear to affect overall outcomes. For smaller lesions requiring distal pancreatectomy， a minimally invasive approach may be feasible and has been shown to reduce morbidity； mortality， operative blood loss， and length of hospital stay 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【47】Any lesion >2 cm or lesions with calcification are recommended to undergo simultaneous lymphadenectomy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Rupture of the arterial wall leads to extravasation of blood into the surrounding tissue， followed by tamponade and clot formation. Left untreated this has the potential to cause catastrophic haemorrhage.\n\n【2】Case Report：A 59-year-old male presented to our department with bony ankylosis of his temporomandibular joints bilaterally as a result of previous osteomyelitis. He underwent bilateral temperomandibular joint replacements in a two-stage procedure. Following his discharge he presented tothe emergency department six weeks laterin haemorrhagic shock，having lost significant blood volume from a pulsatile lesion over his right mandible. Computed tomography angiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm of the right facial artery. He proceeded to emergent embolisation with resolution of the pseudoaneurysm.\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Aneurysms are defined as abnormal and local dilatations of blood vessel walls. They can be classified as either true or false. In a true aneurysm all three lavers of the affected blood vessel are involved： intima， media and adventitia 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. A false aneurysm， or pseudoaneurysm， is a collection of blood leaking completely out of an artery， but confined next to the vessel by the surrounding tissue删除4-1:<u>2</u>.\n\n【5】Pseudoaneurysms are caused by the partial rupture of an artery， followed by the extravasation of blood into the surrounding tissue. This leads to haematoma formation that tamponades the arterial flow. The structure of the haematoma begins to organise and an endothelial lining forms around the periphery 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Following liquefaction of the haematoma， the aneurysmal sac and artery communicate， forming a pulsatile mass. This mass may gradually expand and is at risk of rupture， which can lead to life threatening haemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，4]</u>. Pseudoaneurysms usually show a delayed occurrence， presenting weeks or months after the precipitating event 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，5，6]</u>.\n\n【6】We present a case of a pseudoaneurysm of the right facial artery that occurred in the weeks following bilateral temperomandibular joint (TMJ) replacement surgery. To the author'sknowledge this has not been reported in the literature to date.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 59 year old male was referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) Department for evaluation and management of his complete trismus. He had immigrated to New Zealand six months prior from Africa. Approximately 10 years ago he suffered widespread mandibular osteomyelitis， which was treated with intra-venous penicillin over many months. Prior to this， his mouth opening was normal.\n\n【9】On examination， the patient was micrognathic， with a retruded chin and atrophied masseter muscles. He had tethering of the skin over the body of the mandible bilaterally. Computed Tomography (CT) showed bony fusion of both the left and right mandibular condyles to their respective glenoid fossa.\n\n【10】Following biopsy of his condyles to ensure the osteomyelitis had completely resolved， he underwent two-stage bilateral TMJ replacement surgery. After initial resection of the bony ankylosis and placement of temporary spacers， he proceeded to placement of bilateral artificial temporomandibular (TM) joints.\n\nFollowing TMJ replacement surgery， the patient recovered well without complication and was|删除段之间换行|discharged home. He was reviewed two weeks following the surgery where he was noted to have developed a haematoma over his right submandibular wound (site of surgical access). There was no sign of infection， but was causing the patient discomfort. At the time， under local anaesthetic， this haematoma was partially evacuated. Upon review the following week， this area was much more comfortable， and at further review at two weeks it continued to improve， but had not resolved completely.\n\n【12】Approximately two weeks after his last review (six weeks since the initial surgery) he presented to the Emergency Department (ED) in hemorrhagic shock. He had sustained a severe bleed from a pulsatile lesion in the right suubmandibular region. Intra oral examination was unremarkable. His haemoglobin on arrival was 59 g/L and blood pressure 90/51 mmHg. Blood tests showed prothrombin time(PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were within normal limits.\n\nFollowing resuscitation with normal saline and two units of red blood cells he was stabilized and direct pressure over the lesion had stopped the bleed. A computed tomography arteriogram (CTA) was arranged urgently. This showed a large pseudoaneurysm of the right facial artery， lying superficial to the right TMJ replacement， with the|删除段之间换行|Endovascular embolisation was arranged and a microcatheter was passed through the base of the aneurysm to the exit point of the facial artery from the aneurysm.  A tissue adhesive (75%histocryl/lipiodol/tantalum) was injected， closing the facial artery both proximal and distal to the aneurysm， and closing the defect in the artery without filling the bulk of the aneurysm . Follow up CTA was performed that showed resolution of the pseudoaneurysm. The patient made a successful recovery， and has had no recurrence or complications from the treatment after one vear of follow up.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Pseudoaneurysms ofthebranches ofthe external carotid artery are extremelyrare 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，6]</u>. The soft tissues and bones ofthe face protect these branches， but in regions where they surface and cross bone structures， they become vulnerable to damage 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.

The most dangerous complication of a pseudoaneurysm in this region is catastrophic haemorrhage following rupture. Other complications include compression of adjacent neurovascular structures， and release of embolic thrombi.

The consensus amongst the literature is that emoblisation through interventional radiology of the aneurysm is safest and most effective treatment method 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，7]</u>. Treatment is essentialy mandatory，given the unstable nature of pseudoaneurysms， and the potentially devastating consequences of rupture.\n\n【16】This case highlights the importance of prompt evaluation and treatment of pseudoaneurysms of the facial artery.

We report a case of an 86 year-old female patient with an orbital cellulitis with post-septal involvement admitted in our departement for topical and intravenous antibiotics. On the fourth day of admission vesicular lesions began to emerge in the left side of the face and scalp not exceeding the mid line and treatment for herpes zoster withoral acyclovir and topic ganciclovir was initiated. Then an anisocoria was noticed and in the left pupil the direct and consensual reflexes were abolished as well as the accommodation reflex. There was no intraocular hypertension， anterioror posterior synechiae； no external ophthalmoplegia， ptosisor diplopia. The brain CT revealed no relevant alterations. The patient was discharged after eighteen days of hospitalization， maintaining the paralytic mydriasis ofthe left pupil.\n\n【2】Discussion： Isolated paralytic mydriasis as the only complication after herpes zoster ophthalmicusis extremely rare. The responsible mechanisms are notfully understood. It is thought that the cause is， among other factors， the involvement of the pupillary fibers for light and accommodation-convergence， with no damage of the motor fibers.\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Herpes zoster ophthalmicus occurs when there is a reactivation of herpes 3 (varicella-zoster) lying latent in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve， and this involvement occurs in about 10-25% ofthe cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Half of these will have ocular involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>， being the symptoms varied and caused by the perineural and intraneural inflammation of sensory nerves 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The various manifestations obey the midline and depend on the branches of the trigeminal nerve that are affected(supraorbital， lacrimal or nasociliary). The nasociliary branch innervates the globe， so when it is affected there is a greater probability of serious ocular involvement and complications. The classical sign of these involvement is the“Hutchinson's sign”-involvement of the tip ofthe nose-and these patients have twice the incidence of ocular affection 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.

Aging， nutrition deficits， immune compromised status and other factors such as fatigue and stress (physical / emotional) may precipitate an episode of herpes zoster.

Physical examination showed mild erythema and edema of the left cheek and more marked and painful eyelid edema. Slit-lamp examination showed mild conjunctival hyperemia and chemosis with mucopurulent secretions in the lower lashes， pseudophakia and no signs of anterior chamber inflammation or other alterations. The pupils were regular， direct and consensual light reflexes were preserved， she had no proptosis，limitation of ocular movements or diplopia. The visual acuity|删除段之间换行|of the left eye was 0.3 (decimal scale) and the right eye 0.8， without any correction. The computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbits revealed orbital cellulitis with post-septal involvement. The patient was admitted for treatment with topical of loxacin and intravenous antibiotic therapy with vancomycin 1 g bid and ceftriaxone 1 g bid. On the fourth daypost admission，began to emerge vesicularlesions in the left side ofthe face and scalp that did not exceed the midline，being very suggestive of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. The patient presented with lesions in the tip of the nose - Hutchinson's sign - suggesting involvement of the nasociliary branch and greater probability of more serious ocular involvement. The remaining examination just showed mild superficial keratitis， without signs of anterior chamber inflammation， ocular hypertension or posterior segment alterations； and we began therapy with oral acyclovir 800 mg， 5 times per day and ocular topic ganciclovir q4h. On the sixth day post admission the skin lesions were improving and at different stages of evolution， there was an improvement of the face and eyelid edema， but the left pupil was almost not reactive to light， still with no signs of anterior chamber inflammation or ocular hypertension. Oral corticosteroid therapy was initiated. On the ninth day of hospitalization and despite symptomatic improvement， we objectified an anisocoria (left pupil 3mm bigger than the right) which decreased in scotopic conditions， with the left pupil almost with no light reaction . Slit-lamp examination showed a mild conjunctival hyperemia and superficial keratitis in the lower half of the cornea； there were no alterations of the iris and no signs of anterior chamber inflammation， anterior or posterior synechiae. The intraocular pressure was 15/16 mmHg and the visual acuityoftheleftevedecreased to 0.1.Brain CT scan revealed ischemic leukoencephalopathy and enlargement of the cerebrospinal fluid circulation pathways by atrophy-changes consistent with theage of the patient. The neurology examination showed preserved higher functions； algic hypoesthesia in the territory of the left first division of the trigeminal nerve and anisocoria described as above： both pupils were regular， and the right pupil had direct and consensual light reflexes preserved but in the left pupil， the direct and consensual light reflexes were abolished as well as the accommodation reflex. There were no external ophthalmoplegia， ptosisor diplopia .\n\n【7】The patient was discharged after eighteen days of hospitalization，删除1换行asymptomatic， with almost complete resolution of the skin and scalp lesions and no eyelid edema. She completed 13 days of intravenous therapy with vancomycin and ceftriaxone； 14 days of oral acyclovir and topical ganciclovir and 11 days of oral corticosteroid therapy. Currently， six months after discharge， the patient has a visual acuity of the left eye of 0.3； the slit lamp examination shows only a slight posterior capsule opacification and maintains the anisocoria with paralytic mydriasis of the left pupil.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Isolated paralytic mydriasis as the only complication after herpes zoster ophthalmicus is extremely rare， with only few cases reported. Usually pupillary paralysisis reported associated with some degree of ophthalmoplegias (total， external/internal) or isolated palsies of the third， fourth or sixth nerves 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The responsible mechanisms are still unclear. In this case we excluded some of the inflammatory causes as inflammation ofthe anterior chamber with iritis，iris atrophy，anterior and posterior synechiae； as well as ocular hypertension.Various the ories have been postulated-Denny-Brown et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> described that motor neuritis was independent of the inflammation of any ganglion； Kreibig 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> concluded that perivasculitis-myositis was responsible for the extraocular palsies rather than a neural cause； Godtfredsen通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> postulated that the involvement of the cranial nerves was due to contiguous intracavernous radiculo meningitis； and the major cause could also be ischaemia due to occlusive vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[21</u>. The cause of the isolated paralytic mydriasis is probably a combination of these mechanisms (separately or simultaneously) that led to aparcial third nerve palsy with spared motor fibers but with the involvement of the pupillary fibers for light and accommodation-convergence 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. These paralyticlesions tend to be temporaryand resolve spontaneously； and there is no specific treatment described in the literature.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Treatment typically involves administering testosterone and GnRH or gonadotropin injections， but testosterone administration may result in mood disorders and aggression in some patients. In this article， we present the case of a 27-year-old patient who was stable on Aripiprazole 20 mg/day for bipolar disorder but experienced a manic attack two day after increasing their testosterone dose. Patients with bipolar disorder who receive testosterone replacement therapy should be closely monitored for any behavioral or mood changes. It is crucial to recognize that administering testosterone replacement therapy to patients with bipolar disorder may lead to mood changes or even trigger the onset of bipolar disorder.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a dysfunction that manifests itself in the insufficiency and absence ofpuberty and infertility， caused by Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone deficiency(GnRH)通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. This hormone is essential for regulating the reproductive axis.

Treatment involves injections oftestosterone and GnRH or gonadotropin通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， but testosterone administration can cause side effects such as mood disorders and aggression in some patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. However， rare cases of patients developing manic episodes after receiving testosterone or androgenic anabolic steroid treatments have been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-8]</u>. Epidemiological studies that have evaluated the relationship between testosterone levels and mood disorders are rare with contradictory results 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，9-11]</u>.

Although the physical effects of testosterone therapy are well documented 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. The psychiatric effects and the circumstances that precipitate them are still the subject of studies. In this article， we present a case of a patient who developed a hypomanic episode following testosterone replacement therapy.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 30-year-old single Moroccan patient who has been followed for osteoporosis since the age of删除4-1:<u>21</u>. He is treated with Risedronate 35 mg weekly. As part of the etiological research for osteoporosis， he was diagnosed with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The patient also has psoriasis and his brother is being followed up for intermittent explosive disorder.\n\n【6】In terms of his psychiatric history， he has been under treatment since the age of 22 for depressive episodes and a substance use disorder， notably alcohol and tobacco， with occasional use of ecstasy. He has received several antidepressants since the beginning of his illness and has been hospitalized only once for the management of depression with anxious features and suicidal ideation. During this hospitalization， he was treated with escitalopram 20 mg/day and alprazolam 3 mg/day with gradual decrease. The evolution was marked by occurrence of hypomanic episode that was likely induced by ecstasy use； therefore， a bipolar disorder type II was diagnosed， and this hypomania episode was treated ambulatory with aripiprazole 20 mg/day and carbamazepine 800 mg/day， which led to a rapid resolution of symptoms. However， after a few months， the patient stopped taking carbamazepine due to a decrease in his libido that he attributed to the treatment， and continued taking aripiprazole at a dose of 20 mg/day.\n\n【7】He presented with his mother to the psychiatric emergency department for psychomotor agitation and insomnia. The psychiatric examination revealed that the patient was agitated in terms of motor activity with increased energy and logorrhea， he had an irritable mood， disinhibited，he presents a flight of ideas， increased self-esteem and insomnia. His mother indicated that he had been unusually unstable over the past few days， presenting multiple violent anger outbursts at the slightest frustration. After completing the ANGST hypomania questionnaire， this episode was diagnosed as hypomania.\n\n【8】His mother noticed that these symptoms began after 2days of receiving the Andotardyl 250 mg/1 ml injection for his hypogonadotropic hypogonadism， which his treating physician had increased to one ampoule per month， instead of half ampoule as an initial dose. The patient was hospitalized and treated with aripiprazole20 mg/day and chlorpromazine 200 mg/day， which resulted in gradual improvement during the second week of his hospitalization.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Hypogonadism is an endocrine disorder characterized by insufficient production of testosterone. Symptoms of hypogonadism include low libido， difficulty achieving or maintaining a satisfactory erection， difficulty ejaculating， testicular atrophy， infertility， reduced hair growth， gynecomastia， asthenia， sleep disorders， loss of muscle mass， muscle pain， signs of bone fragility， weight gain， poor concentration， memory impairment， decreased motivation， and mood changes 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Several studies have established a correlation between low testosterone levels and depressive symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. The results of Woodson et al. study revealed a significant decrease in testosterone levels in men with bipolar depression compared to control men 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Similarly， a cross-sectional study of 856 men aged50 to 89 years， which measured free testosterone levels and evaluated major depressive disorders using the Beck Depression Inventory， revealed a correlation between low testosterone levels and depressive symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. This suggests that chronically low testosterone levels in our patient may be an etiological factor in the initial depressive episodes.\n\n【11】Our patient presented signs of hypomania shortly after receiving an injection of 250 mg/1 ml of Androtardyl， which his treating physician had increased to one ampoule per month. Although we cannot definitively exclude spontaneous decompensation of bipolar disorder. This case suggests that testosterone administration can induce hypomania or manic episodes in vulnerable individuals， particularly in patients with personal or family histories suggesting a predisposition to mania or psychosis. Given that our patient had bipolar disorder， it seems that he was particularly sensitive to the increase in testosterone substitution dose，which probablycontributed to his hypomanic episode. Similar cases have been reported in the literature. Elboga et al. described the case of a 25-year-old patient with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and a history of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)， who experienced a manic episode after testosterone replacement therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Weiss et al. reported the case of a 28-year-old man with bipolar disorder who developed mania one month after starting testosterone patch therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Papazisis et al. also described the case of a 25-year-old man with a history of depression who presented a manic episode with psychotic features shortly after increasing his daily dose of Androgenic Anabolic Steroids (AAS) to over 2 g per day 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. However， Franey et al. reported the case of a 30-year-old man with no personal or family history of bipolar删除1换行disorder who developed a manic episode after starting AAS use 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Similarly， Barbenel et al. also described a case of mania in a bilateral orchiectomy patient taking testosterone replacement therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Overall， these observations suggest a possible relationship between blood testosterone levels and mania.\n\nStudies have examined the effects of testosterone on healthy men and have shown that some subjects developed manic symptoms通用删除6(英):<u>[19，20]</u>. In a randomized controlled study conducted by Pope et al. on healthy men aged 20 to 50 years， the administration of supraphysiological doses of testosterone induced hypomania in 16%of participants 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In addition， a study by Sher et al. of 67 patients with bipolar disorder showed a positive correlation between testosterone levels and the number of manic episodes and the number of suicide attempts 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. In contrast， a case-control study found no significant difference in salivary testosterone levels between the euthymic， depressed， and manic phases in patients with bipolar disorder type1 and a healthy control group 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In addition， the study by Bhasin et al.， which examined the physical effects of a weekly 600 mg dose of testosterone for 10 weeks， found no significant changes in mood or behavior11|.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】It is important to note that patients receiving testosterone substitution therapy may develop manic or hypomanic symptor Therefore， careful monitoring for behavioral and mood changes is warranted， especially in patients with bipolar disorder.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

His history includes temporal lobe epilepsy， refractory to medication， since two years of age. The seizures occurred up to fifteen times per day， typically presenting as a rising epigastric tyP sensation， sudden fear， speech arrest， followed by a dyscognitive phase and subsequent oral-buccal automatisms. Serial EEGs demonstrated a left temporal electrophysiological correlation.\n\n【7】Prior to surgery， his treatment consisted of phenytoin and carbamazepine at optimal doses. His family history was unremarkable for obsessive-compulsive or tic disorders. Apart fro a remote history of recreational cocaine use in the adolescence，he had no psychiatric history. Three decades ago， he underwent an eventful left anterior temporal lobectomy. Immediately， the seizures frequency decreased drastically. Over the upcoming years， phenytoin has been tapered since he became seizure-free. Carbamazepine has been maintained at the same dose. About 20 years ago， a flood occurred in one of the buildings where he had been employed as a maintenance worker. This event triggered checking compulsions， increasingly incapacitating throughout the years. It took him20 years to disclose this information to his neurologist.\n\n【8】This condition impacted his life significantly. Before leaving work， he would routinely check the taps severaltimesto ensure that they were turned off， even with the insight that he already underwent this verification. Skipping a routine check induced debilitating anxiety. As a consequence of his inner doubts regarding the taps， he took pictures of the faucets used that day to demonstrate that they were effectively turned off. However， this ritual was insufficient to relieve his anxiety， as he still needed to return to work in the middle of the night to perform supplemental check-ups. Even if he had an ego dystonic perception of the overall situation， it was impossible to suppress those rituals.\n\n【9】There was no evidence of depression at the neuropsychiatric evaluation. He was prescribed citalopram， which was discontinued due to excessive nausea.No subsequent serotonergic medication was considered， as he refused to take additional drugs. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been the cornerstone of the treatment，leading to a moderate improvement in his symptoms & quality of life.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Epilepsy results from aberrant synchronous discharges of the neuronal network. Focal temporal删除1换行lobe epilepsy， is mainly associated with hippocampal sclerosis， previous complex febrile seizures and developmental abnormalities.\n\n【12】Obsessive-compulsive ddisorder is apsychiatric condition typically characterized by the coupling of two major components：intrusive compulsive thoughts， accompanied by ritualistic behaviors leading to an emotional relief. Anatomic circuits involved in OCD are still controversial； multiple possible theories coexist without a unifying consensus. Most models suggested disruptions along the striatal-orbitofrontal-thalamic interconnections. Along these interconnections， various neurotransmitters are well balanced in a finely regulated environment， including glutamate， serotonin， dopamine，and gamma-aminobutyric acid 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【13】Serotonin has numerous functions within the central nervous system， mentioning： appetite regulation， sleep， memory， learning consolidation， mood， behavior， as well as the maturation of neuronal cells and1Ssynaptic connections. A Amongstpostulated theories pertainingto OCD pathophysiology，the mostlongstanding implicates serotonin. In the 1960s， scientists noted that the use of clomipramine， a tricyclic antidepressant and serotonin reuptake inhibitor， resulted in obsessions and ritualistic behaviors 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. Consequently， high doses of SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) show efficacy in the treatment ofOCD 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>.\n\nInterestingly， an increased prevalence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms have been documented in treatment-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Even more， agents elevating the extracellular 5-HT levels， such as 5-hydroxytryptophan and 5-HT reuptake blockers， prevent both focal and generalized seizures. However， depletion serotonin CNS levels lowers convulsions threshold 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Interestingly， several anti-seizure drugs， including phenytoin， generate an increased concentration of extracellular brain 5-HT 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. In our case， the use of phenytoin， although not particularly efficacious for the complete control of the patient's focal seizures， could have had a certain role in modulating and even suppressing OCD. However， the medication was tapered after clinical resolution of the seizures and the OCD behavior was present before and after the discontinuation of this drug. The subtle variations in symptomatology is difficult to evaluate retrospectively. Furthermore， it is also possible that our gentleman presented an undiagnosed OCD background from an early age， only revealed when serotonin became significantly disregulated|删除段之间换行|OCD and epilepsy may be linked according to the theory of an “interrupted pathological shared organization”resulting from neurosurgery. The temporal lobectomy leads to seizure control， but on the other hand contribute to the emergence of latent OCD traits 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. Along the same line， the sudden postoperative seizure cessation might be perceived as \"forced normalization\". The presence of sustained excitatory epileptic form activity could have inhibited删除1换行the underlying psychiatric disorder. In this “latent disease theory， surgery represents the removal of this excitatory activity，potentially allowing for the OCD emerge 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Epileptic patients should be carefully screened for concomitant psychiatric disorders. In addition， prophylactic use of SSRIs could potentially prevent the emergence and decrease the severity of OCD in this specific patient population. Also， slow tapering of anti-seizure medication following epilepsy surgery is recommended. Overall， the role of neuropsychiatry in this patient population is of utmost importance and this expertise could prevent unexpected complications in the long-term management of refractory epilepsy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

As a result of immune histochemicaland electromicroscopical studies， GIST's are thought to be arised from the pacemaker cells of intestine known as Cajal cells. They are sometimes accompanied by symptoms， however in most cases are detected by chance. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare tumors that may arise from any site of the GI tract and are generally associated with abdominal pain， GI bleeding， or a palpable mass. However， a small intestinal GIST rarely causes hemorrhagic shock. We here in report a case of hemorrhagic shock with excessive bleeding caused by anjejuneal GIST that was managed by emergency surgery. The patient provided written informed consent for the publication of this case report.Complete resection is the primary treatment in the management of localized GIST's.

The patient was discharged in good overall condition.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\nA 70-year-old female patient presented to the Department of Emergency of the Bagcilar Research and Training Hospital with dizziness and blood in the stool. The patient's medical history included treatment for hypertension by a local physician. The findings of the subsequent physical examination were unremarkable， except for low blood pressure (100/60 mmHg) and mild pallor of the conjunctiva. Laboratory data revealed severe anemia (hemoglobin， 7， 3 g/dl)， INR：|删除段之间换行|1.33， WBC： 8200mm， PLT：276000mm.Upper endoscopy revealed no hemorrhagic lesion of the duodenum， stomach， or esophagus. Colonoscopy revealed fresh blood with clotting discharged from the proximal side ofthe ileocecal valve； hemorrhagic areaswere identified at the colon or rectum. In the scintigraphical study， there was no hemorrhagic focus.\n\n【8】The abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed the 59 x37 mm exophytic mass in the small intestine， The intestinal bleeding continued， and the patient eventually developed hemorrhagic shock. Hence， 2 units of red blood cells and 1 units of fresh-frozen plasma were administered.Emergency partial resection of the jejunum tumor which was 100 cm distaltothe ligament of Treitzwas performed. There were no signs oflymphadenopathy，peritoneal dissemination， or liver metastasis. The excised tumor (59 x 37 mm) exhibited ulcerative mucosal changes. Sectioning of the tumor revealed a solid and grayish white tissue. Histological examination of the excised tumor revealed proliferation of spin dle-shaped cells in the submucosa to the subserosa of the ileum anda ruptured intratumoralarteryat the tumor surface . Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor Was positive for CD34， KIT and a-smooth muscle actin， but negative for S-100 protein. The MIB-1 labeling index using Ki-67 was 1.0-5.0%. The tumor size and the immunohistological findings supported the diagnosis of a low-risk GIST of the jejunum. The patient had an uneventful recovery， was discharged on postoperative day 7.\n\n【9】This case demonstrated the efficacy of the diagnosis of small intestinal bleeding， and immediate emergency surgery should be considered for cases of small intestinal GISTs with excessive bleeding.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】The clinical presentation of GISTs is variable and the most frequent symptoms are abdominal pain， GI bleeding， or a palpable mass. GISTs arise in any site， including the stomach， duodenum，删除1换行small intestine， colon and rectum. However， with respect to small intestinal GISTs， abdominal pain (35.5%) is the most frequent symptom， while hemorrhagic shock (6.4%) is relatively rare. Owing to limited information about the natural course and malignant potential of GISTs less than 2 cm in size and the difficulty in targeting and completely resecting such tumors， regular follow-ups rather than resection have been recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Clinical symptoms and ailments related to the presence of a tumor largely depend on its location and growth direction. Tumors with an outward pattern of growth develop unnoticed， which is why they are not discovered in the early stages. In this case， the patient developed hemorrhagic shock； thus， upper endoscopy， colonoscopy， scintigraphy and abdominal CT were performed to investigate the source of the hemorrhage. The abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed the 59 x 37 mm exophytic mass in the small intestine. The most common clinical indications of GISTs include obscure bleeding， abdominal pain， and anemia. The first-line treatment of small intestinal GISTs with excessive bleeding remains debatable. In the case，the CT located the level of the bleeding and guided resection. In the present case， we performed emergency partial resection of the jejunum， including the GIST.\n\n【12】In conclusion，identify the source of bleeding in the smallintestine is more essential before the symptoms begin.

Obtaining images similar to magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n【2】Background\n\n【3】Epidural hematomas are manifested by symptoms that may be indistinguishable from herniated disc. Symptomatic epidural hematomas are frequent in spinal operations. However， in clinical practice， cases have been identified following regional anesthesia in various types of surgeries. Asymptomatic， epidural hematoma may occur in 33% to 100% of patients undergoing lumbar decompression surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. The incidence rate of symptomatic postoperative epidural hematoma is 0.1% to 0.24%通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. A meta-analysis of epidural hematomas showed that the most common cause was idiopathic， followed by using anticoagulant drugs and thirdly spinal procedures in combination with the use of anticoagulants. It represents a medical emergency because the neurological consequences include bowel and bladder dysfunction， saddle anesthesia， sciatica， motor weakness of the lower extremities and sexual dysfunction， which are also seen in cauda equina syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The occurrence of spinal epidural hematoma is exceedingly rare and was first described as a clinical diagnosis by Jackson in 1869 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The diagnosis is made with magnetic resonance imaging with a sensitivity of more than 90%. Regional anesthesia is the most used procedure during the resolution of pregnancy either by abdominal or vaginal delivery. A review of the literature found no reports of the usefulness of ultrasound as an accessible， fast，low-cost， and bedside tool for the diagnosis of epidural hematoma， as a complication of obstetric regional anesthesia. The objective of this article is to report the diagnostic utility of ultrasound for the identification of epidural hematoma and epidural edema in two women with neurological symptoms in the immediate puerperium. Obtaining images like magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n【4】Case 1\n\n【5】A 32-year-old female， 35 weeks pregnant， history of 3 pregnancies， 3 cesarean sections， no chronic disease. Scheduled for cesarean section and obstetric hysterectomy secondary to placental accretism， through regional anesthesia with epidural approach， sterile cleft field is placed， infiltration of skin and subcutaneous cellular tissue， we proceed to the placement of regional anesthesia technical Mixed BPD at L2-L3 level， Tuohy 17， loss of Pitkin + resistance， at the first traumatic attempt， locating peridural space. Whitacre No. 25 needle is introduced， obtaining clear CSF， when starting dose administration， the patient reported pain and paresthesia in both extremities， so the procedure was restarted. Once the epidural space was located， Whitacre needle was introduced，and clear cerebrospinal fluid was obtained. Anesthetic dose was administered with hyperbaric bupivacaine 6.5 mg+ sufentanil 5 mcg， morphine 100 mcg and dexmedetomidine 5mcg without complications. Whitacre needle was removed and a peridural catheter was placed in cephalic direction， permeable without blood or cerebrospinal fluid return，latency 30\"， extension T6\n\n【6】Bromage IV. During the surgical procedure she presented obstetric hemorrhage of 3，200 mL and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for hemodynamic monitoring and organic support. Laboratory tests in the first 12 h of stay with blood biometry leukocytes 7，900 cells/m’， hemoglobin 8.1 g/dL， hematocrit 23.7%， platelets 142，000 cells/mm， Tp 10. 8 sec， TPTa 22.3 sec； INR 1.03， sodium 138 mmol/L， potassium 3.5 mmol/L， chlorine 102 mmol/L， calcium 7.4 mg/dL， magnesium 1.9 mg/dL， creatinine 0.5 mg/dL， urea 19 mg/dL. The clinical picture begins 12 h after the surgical procedure with sudden pain in the right lower extremity， intensity 9/10， with limitation of mobility， paresis， and paresthesia at the level of the dermatomal dermatomes T12， L1， L2. Muscle weakness on extension and flexion34 in comparison with the left pelvic limb. Ultrasound was performed with general electric Logiq E9 equipment， with a 10 mhz linear transducer； the patient was placed in the left lateral cubitus position and insonation was performed with tracking to 3 interventebral spaces above the puncture site and 3 below. This technique allows the identification of the following structures： Skin， muscle mass， bone structures， intervertebral spaces， and epidural space. During insonation deformation and amplitude of the epidural space of 4cm x 1.3 cm is visualized and anechoic image is observed from T12to L2 subjective of epidural hematoma . The patient is hemodynamically stable for the following hours and requires management with analgesic and gabapentin 300 mg every 12 h. In order to corroborate the diagnosis was requested nuclear magnetic resonance which reports； at the height of L1 and in the interior of the spinal cord a nodular image of 2 cm long hyperintense in the T2\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Neuraxial techniques are used to provide analgesia during labor通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u> and anesthesia for operative delivery. In a meta-analysis it was noted that in publications after 1990 there is an estimated incidence of epidural hematoma 1 in 168，000 obstetric anesthesia， persistent neurologic injury occurs in 1 in 257，000 and transient neurologic injury 1 in 5，537. In our center these two cases occurred out of 2，502obstetric anesthetic procedures. (79.9 cases per 100，000 live births). In these cases， acute and severe lumbar pain， radiating to the right lower extremity and paresthesias were the first signs reported by the patients. This clinical picture is like other cases published by Alessandro Svelato 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> in a 44-year-old woman following caesarean删除1换行section where epidural hematoma requiring laminectomy was also found. A delay in diagnostic imaging can lead to devastating results， as neurological symptoms and low back pain can be erroneously attributed to epidural infusion of drugs or a prolonged effect of the local anesthetic 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【9】The presence of spinal cord compression is an indication for surgery. In the case of transient motor deficit with MRI evidence of epidural hematoma， as in our case， decompression laminectomy within the first 12 h offers the best surgical outcome 通用删除7(英):<u>(3， 15，16)</u>. However， the literature reports cases of good evolution also in the case of surgery performed after 24 h from the onset of symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. To avoid chronic complications surgery is an option to improve the results 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Ultrasound is a tool that has allowed diagnostic imaging in different clinical scenarios because it can be used in a feasible way， due to its low cost， without major intervention， at the patients bedside and with immediate results. These cases reflect how using ultrasound of the lumbar spine it is possible to evaluate the epidural space， intervertebral space， bone， and muscle structures as well as the presence of edema and epidural hematoma. This is the first article that explores the usefulness of this diagnostic tool in pregnancy and puerperium.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】Ultrasound examination of the puncture site area in regional anesthesia in women， with symptoms and/or neurological deficits allows the identification of edema and epidural hematomas that help to reduce neurological complications as well as subsequent transient sequel during pregnancy and puerperium.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Its incidence is approximately 276/100，000 live births per year 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Blood grouping apart from ABO system also includes Rh typing which are a complex system containing 49 Rh antigens and among them D is the most important one. However some minor blood group antigens C， E， c， e，Duffy， Kidd， MNS are also significant ones 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Over the years the frequency of indirect hyperbilirubinemia due to Rh sensitization in neonates has decreased significantly with better ante-natal care and widespread use of anti-D globulin， but at the same time the contribution for HDFN due to minor blood group antigens incompatibility such as Kell， c， C， E， e etc. has gradually increased 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u> however most of them are mild to moderate. We are presenting two cases of minor blood group incompatibility in which we used IVIG as alternate therapy for double volume exchange transfusion. In first case serum bilirubin was persistently rising high despite one Double Volume Exchange Transfusion (DVET) and one Single Volume Exchange Transfusion (SVET) so we used a single dose of IVIG @ 1 gm/kg IV over 6 h after which it fell gradually to below phototherapy range. In second baby serum bilirubin was in exchange level at 8h of life DVET was contemplated but compatible blood required was not available in blood bank Based on first experience and unavailability of blood for DVET we started IVIG as alternative to exchange therapy while blood bank was arranging the blood. IVIG was given over 6 h after which serum bilirubin fell to phototherapy range so exchange transfusion deferred and serum bilirubin fell further to below phototherapy range in 72 h when phototherapy was no discontinued， thus the exchange transfusion was not needed.\n\n【20】Case Series\n\n【21】Case 1\n\n【22】A Term baby boy born to 2n gravida (G2P1A0L1) mother by Elective LSCS， having uneventful course of pregnancy both in previous as well as current pregnancy， cried immediately after birth， received routine care and was shifted to mother side. At 20 h of life the baby was reported to be icteric up to palms and soles following which baby were started on Double Surface Phototherapy (DSPT) and Intravenous fluids and relevant investigations were sent. The investigations， interventions and other details are given in Table 1. TSB level was 25.44 mg/dl with Direct Bilirubin was 0.12 mg/dl，Direct Coombs Test (DCT) was positive (4+)， both mother's and Baby blood group were O positive， Indirect Coombs Test (ICT) of mother was also Positive. So Double Volume Exchange Transfusion (DVET) was done as the Bilirubin level was above exchange transfusion limit per AAP nomogram 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. TSB at 4 h after DVET was 16.75 mg/dl and after 8 h rose to 19.55 mg/dl which was above exchange transfusion level， hence again one Single Volume Exchange Transfusion(SVET) done due to unavailability of required volume of blood for DVET. As evident in Table 1， the SB again kept on increasing and keeping that in mind IVIG [@ 1 gm/kg] was given due to persistent hyperbilirubinemia despite of exchange transfusions with ongoing DSPT and DCT 4 +ve signifying immune hemolysis. In view of severe immune hemolysis in absence of ABO/Rh incompatibility， minor blood group incompatibilities were suspected and investigated. In the mother's blood Anti-c，Anti-E allo-antibodies were detected in titers1：512 and anti-s 1 in 256 and whereas in baby's blood Anti-c and Anti-E were detected in 1 in 256. Afterwards there was steady fall in bilirubin level and it came down below the phototherapy range after48 h of phototherapy post IVIG， thus phototherapy was stopped on day 5 oflife. Baby recovered well and post discharge ophthalmological and hearing evaluation was within normal.\n\n【23】Case 2\n\n【24】A late-preterm (36 wk +6 D) baby girl born by Emergency LSCS(i/v/o non-reactive non stress test and thin Meconium stained liquor) to a 3d gravida (G3P2A0L1D1) asymptomatic COVID-19 positive，删除1换行hypothyroid mother. The mother had a bad obstetrics history in past as her 1 pregnancy was a monochorionic twin out of which one fetus had IUD and another died at 24 h of life however the 2nd pregnancy was uneventful. The baby cried immediately after birth， received routine care and shifted to NICU for isolation in view of COVID-19 and feeding stated with expressed breast milk and formula. At 8 h of life， baby found to be icteric up to thighs following which baby was started on Double Surface Phototherapy (DSPT) and intravenous fluids and relevant investigations were sent. TSB level was 12.66 mg/dl with Direct Bilirubin was 0.16 mg/dl， Direct Coombs Test (DCT) was positive (4+)， both mother’s and baby blood group were O positive and Indirect Coombs Test (ICT) of mother was negative. Bilirubin level was above exchange transfusion limit per AAP nomogram 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， but due to unavailability of compatible blood， exchange transfusion couldn't be done at that time hence IVIG (@1 gm/kg) was started at 16 h of life over a period of 6 h and double surface phototherapy continued while the compatible blood was to be arranged. Repeat TSB at 6 h after IVIG was 11.71 mg/dl which was below exchange transfusion limit but above phototherapy limit， thus dual surface phototherapy continued with IV fluid relaxation. Repeat TSB at 12 h，24 h & 48 h after IVIG were 11.75 mg/dl， 14.09mg/dl and 13.59 mg/dl respectively which were within phototherapy range thus dual surface phototherapy was continued with gradual introduction of oral feeding. In view of immune hemolysis in absence of ABO/Rh incompatibility， minor blood group incompatibilities were suspected and investigated， which revealed presence of anti-E antibody in baby's blood. The repeat TSB at 72 h after IV IG was 10.1mg/dl which was below phototherapy range thus phototherapy was discontinued on day D 4 of life. The investigations and interventions with timelines are given in Table 2. Baby recovered well and post discharge ophthalmological and hearing evaluations were within normal limits.\n\n【25】Discussion\n\n【26】Immune hemolysis is an important cause of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in newborns requiring exchange transfusion and ABO and Rh incompatibility are the most common causes of severe immune hemolysis， but Minor Blood Incompatibilities (MBI) such as删除表格换行(Day 4) Day 6 BERA：WNL VEP：WNL\n\n【27】Table 1： Investigations and Intervention details with timeline.\n\n| Post-natalage (inhours)  | Investigation  | Total SerumBilirubin  | 4 hr  | 8 hr  | 16hr  | 24 hr  | 48 hr  | DVET/SVET/INTERVENTION  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 20  |  | 25.44  |  |  |  |  |  | DSPT started  |\n| 24  | HB： 14.6 gm/dl， CRC：13%.

IVIG blocks the Fc receptor and thus prevents antibodies from causing immune destruction of the red blood cells containing minor blood group antigens acquired due to genetic inheritance， from father.

He also reported a purulent left ear discharge with left anterior neck and posterior auricular pain. He has a medical history of multiple episodes of AOM that were treated with antibiotics at district level clinics in childhood. In 2012 he had Computed Topography (CT) that revealed chronic mastoiditis which was treated with prolonged antibiotics. He had recently tested negative for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and received all his vaccinations. This was his first hospitalization for this problem.\n\n【13】His vital signs on the day of admission revealed a temperature of 40.3C； a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with oxygen删除1换行saturation of 96% while breathing ambient air； a radial pulse rate of124 beats per minute； and a non-invasive blood pressure of 106/74mmHg.\n\n【14】His physical examination revealed lefttposterior auricular swelling with small posterior auricular lymph nodes as well as a tender， swollen left carotid-angle. He was pale however his cardiovascular examination was normal and there were no features of infective endocarditis. His respiratory examination revealed features of consolidation involving his right midzone and right lower zone， furthermore there was reduced breathe sound in both lung basis. His abdominal and central nervous system examinations did not reveal any abnormalities. He was diagnosed as septic chronic otitis media complicated by mastoiditis.\n\n【15】Case Management\n\nThe results of investigations done during this admission are summarized in Table 1. Day one of admission， he was taken to theatre for radical mastoidectomy with incision and drainage. He received amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 1.2 g three times daily from|删除段之间换行|day one to three. On day three， his blood cultures grew P. mirabilis(PM) with sensitivity to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole， penicillin， cephalosporin and gentamycin. The amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was changed to ceftriaxone 1 g three times daily as he had worsening hyperbilirubinemia and cholestasis. On the fifth of his admission， his clinical condition had not improved despite directed antibiotics and surgical drainage； he still had tenderness and swelling at the left carotid angle with fever， dyspnea， tachypnea and on-going production删除1换行of blood streaked sputum. Four additional blood cultures and six sputum cultures were negative at this point. He was now assessed as worsening septicemia and his antibiotics was changed to piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin. Repeat imaging of his head， neck and chest was performed. The chest X-ray was repeated and it showed a cavity in right lower zone . The Computed Tomography (CT) scan found that there was reorganization of the abscess with transverse sinus thrombus . The CT scan ofthe neck and chest revealed rim enhancing collection in the soft tissues of the left peri-auricular region and deep neck tissues with an Internal Jugular (IJ) thrombus extending to the transverse sinus . The CT scan of the chest further revealed multiple lesions that were in different stages of breakdown with cavities . The transverse sinus thrombosis was an extension of internal jugular thrombus due to sepsis related thrombophlebitis and the distribution of his lung lesions suggest they were due to septic embolization from his primary site of infection. He was subsequently diagnosed with Lemierre’s syndrome secondary to COM complicated with mastoiditis and Citelli's abscess.\n\n【17】On day six， he was referred to Ear， Nose and Throat (ENT) department for emergency incision and drainage. His surgery was delayed because of the South African lockdown due to coronavirus prevention strategy. Surgery was performed on day eight after his initial presentation； he underwent drainage of post-auricular and Citellis abscess in theatre which evacuated fifteen milliliters (15ml) and twenty milliliters (20 ml) of purulent debris. His clinical condition showed marked improvement post-surgery. The respiratory symptoms and productive cough immediately ceased day one post-surgery. On the eleventh day of his admission， the intraoperative\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Our patient had four positive cultures of P. mirabilis from different sites that were obtained at different times during his admission. P. mirabilis as an offending organism in LS is rare. Ninety percent of proteus infections are due to P. mirabilis， a gram-negative bacillus 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. This organism is considered to be a community acquired organism that is able to survive on solid surfaces 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. It is reported to be one of the common pathogens cultured in chronic middle ear infections and is also commonly cultured in patients with urinary tract infection in the setting of prolonged catheterization 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6，13，12]</u>. A systemic review from 2003 to 2019， found that P. aeruginosa， S. aureus， and P. mirabilis were there main reported pathogens associated with bacterial otitis media in the Sub-Saharan Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. P. mirabilis was found to be the culprit organism in 36%(18/50) adults with otitis media in Western Cape， South Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Furthermore P. mirabilis was also the most frequently cultured organism in a system review of 1，307 cases with otogenic brain abscess in 2018 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. During the initial stages of management， this Proteus organism proved to be a challenge in the treatment of the patient due to the uncertainty of whether the organism had resulted in the chronic mastoiditis or if it was a contaminant. This proved to be a challenge during the initial stages of management of this case. Due to LS being relatively rare， it was difficult to ascribe the patient's index clinical state being due to P. mirabilis infection and thus the choice to direct antibiotics as per cultures became an area of contention. In spite of five days of directed antibiotic therapy， the patient showed no clinical or biochemical improvement.\n\n【20】Prolonged antibiotics are suggested to be the mainstay treatment of internal jugular vein thrombosis in patients with LS. There is no suggested regimen of antibiotics as there has never been randomized controlled trials to assist with clear guidelines to the management of LS. Surgical removal of the thrombus was previously explored in the pre-antibiotic era but not in the post antibiotic era 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，71</u>.\n\n【21】The presence of chest lesions and infiltrative liver function test with hyperbilirubinemia should alert treating physicians to explore the upper respiratory tract for a possible source of infection as delay in diagnosis can have near fatal consequences.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】Early diagnosis and initiation of antibiotics is key to the outcome of these patients.

Generally MODY affects 1%to 2% of diabetes. The defect in glucose sensing mechanism in MODY-2 results in higher set point for maintenance of glucose homeostasis. Treatment is not recommended outside the pregnancy however in pregnancy fetal abdominal circumference helps to decide about the insulin requirement. We are presenting a case in which MODY 2 was diagnosed for the first time after her first pregnancy， there were controversies around the first pregnancy and the second one was uneventful. Genetic testing is mandatory to establish the diagnosis. In addition to it， implications of MODY and its subtypes along with pattern of inheritance and management aspects have been discussed in detail.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Gestational diabetes is the one of the most common medical disorder in pregnancy apart from anemia and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. It’s defined as glucose intolerance of varying severity either with its first onset or recognition during pregnancy. It is not uncommon for type II or even type I diabetes recognised for the first time in pregnancy. Rarely， Glucokinase gene mutation related hyperglycaemia-Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (GCK-MODY) may get detected for the first time in pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> . If the diagnosis is known the management is straight forward. However during pregnancy it is not uncommon to misdiagnose it as Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and they may not respond to usual treatment modalities of gestational diabetes. We are presenting a case of pregnant woman with glucokinase mutation with the clinical dilemma in management during her first pregnancy before its recognition and successful management of the same once the genetic mutation is identified.\n\n【4】The pregnant lady presented to us at 24 weeks with known case of genetic mutation. She was G2L1 with previous caesarean section that had high fasting blood sugar values at the time of presentation. Her previous pregnancy was managed at different hospital. She was diagnosed to have GDM at 28 weeks in her previous pregnancy and which required treatment with insulin apart from Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT). In spite of 80 units of insulin per day  it was difficult to achieve optimal control of blood sugar throughout the pregnancy. Since there was a lag in the growth of the fetus pregnancy was terminated at 36 completed weeks. An elective caesarean section was done in view of Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) and the neonatal outcome was good. Her blood sugar level did not come down as in cases of GDM and hence she was evaluated for MODY. It was found to be that the mutation in hexokinase enzyme which was responsible for the marginal fasting hyperglycaemia and her medications were stopped. She was on follow up. After 4 years， the present pregnancy was after the diagnosis of hexokinase mutation. Even though she had high fasting blood sugar values and mild post prandial hyperglycaemia she was not on any medications. In discussion with endocrinologist， it was decided to start insulin only if post prandial blood sugar is more than200 mg % and the abdominal circumference of the growing fetus was also used as a guide to decide删除表格换行about the initiation of insulin treatment. With minimal physical activity and diet her blood sugar levels were always between 140 to160 mmHg. She did not develop any other complications and the target ultrasound was normal. Fetal biometry at appropriate intervals did not show any evidence of macrosomia. It was decided to allow her for Trial of Labour after Caesarean Section (TOLAC) after assessing the risks and explaining the pros and cons of it. Epidural analgesia was offered as labour analgesia in discussion with anaesthesiologist. She came with Rupture of Membranes (PROM) at 37 week and the labour was induced with oxytocin and had successful Vaginal Birth after Caesarean Section (VBAC). The baby weighed 3.2 kg and had shoulder dystocia which required Mc Robert’s manoeuvre. Baby had mild Erb’s palsy and recovered completely over the period of 6 weeks.\n\n【5】Table 1： Diagnostic criteria for glucokinase gene mutation related hyperglycaemia in pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，12]</u>. Persistent fasting hyperglycaemia before， during and after pregnancy， in the range of 5.5-8.1 mmol/L An increment of <4.6 mmol/L on at least 1 OGTT (either during or after pregnancy) A parent may have mild type Il DM but often it has not been detected. A negative family history does not exclude the condition BMI <25 kg/m²\n\n【6】Ultrasonogram).\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Glucokinase is the key regulatory enzyme in regulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. Mutation in this enzyme can lead to either hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. There are about195 mutations have been detected. Heterogeneous mutation in this enzyme usually presents as MODY and it is detected in later part of life and is called as MODY-2. Since there is a defect in glucose sensing mechanism the glucose homeostasis is maintained at a higher set point删除1换行resulting in mild， asymptomatic fasting hyperglycaemia. They don’t develop microvascular complications usually and the prevalence of macro vascular complications is similar to general population.\n\n【9】This monogenic diabetes， caused by single gene mutation was first described by Tatersall et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. There is paucity on specific data about monogenic diabetes in pregnancy. The GCK-MODY is unique and it differs from others sub groups. GCK-MODY usually presents with mild hyperglycaemia and has distinct pathology unlike other subtypes. Other types of MODY are usually born normoglycaemic and they develop diabetes in adolescents or in young adults and it progresses over the period of time. Such individuals require treatment outside the pregnancy too as there is increased risk of diabetic related complications.\n\n【10】It affects 1% to 3% of all GDM population. The prevalence of HCK-MODY may not be different in different population unlike type II DM which is more prevalent in black and south Indian population通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The universal screening gives an opportunity to pick up the condition in pregnancy and the diagnostic criteria is similar to non-pregnant population. Lachance et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> had reviewed a total 11 cases in a cohort study in which 4 were diagnosed in pregnancy and 7 were diagnosed after the pregnancy. It was found that fasting blood sugar删除表格换行delay/Learning difficulties删除1换行level was ≥ 5.5 mmol/L in 98% of cases . However most of the time they were erroneously diagnosed as either GDM or type II DM which can lead to unnecessary interventions. Generally any treatment with an intent to normalize the blood sugar is ineffective outside the pregnancy in women with GCK-MODY as there is lack of evidence of any long term complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6]</u>.\n\n【11】Table 2： Pregnancy implications in different type of MODY Wheeler BJ et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n| Gene and MODY subtype in the mother  | Gene Function +Phenotype  | Pregnancy implication  | Prognosis  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Glucokinase (GCK)gene (MODY 2)  | Catalyses conversion ofglucose to glucose-6-phosphate Reduced glucase sensing by B cells-Milddiabetes  | Unaffected fetus-Excess fetal growth if no GCK mutation Affected fetus-maternal hyperglycemia will be sensed as normal and result in normal growth  | Generally non or slowlyProgressive Complications rare  |\n| HNF1-alpha gene(MODY 3)  | Regulates insulin gene Transcription Reduced insulin secretion/diabetes and marked sensitivityto sultonylurea  | Not associated withincreased birth weight  | Progressive May require insulin May develop secondarycomplications  |\n| HNF4-alpha gene(MODY1)  | Nuclear transcription factorthat regulates hepatic and pancreatic B cell gene expression Reduced insulin secretion/diabetes and marked sensitivity to sulfonylurea  | Associated with increasedbirth weight (50% of babies) Can cause neonatal Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia  | Progressive May require insulin May develop secondarycomplications  |\n| HNF1-beta gene(MODY 5)  | Regulates HNF4'a gene Transcription Insulin resistance+ wideclinical spectrum +/-Urogenital/pancreatic Anomalies & Pancreatic exocrineFailure +/-Developmental delay/Learning difficulties  | In affected mother-possible pregnancy complications associated with genital anduterine malformations， such as recurrent miscarriages orpreterm labour For affected fetus-Urogenital malformations may bevisible on prenatal ultrasound  | Progressive beta-cell failure withdiabetes onset aroundPuberty Insulin resistance withoutObesity Insulin dependence  |\n\n【13】Fetal growth depends on whether the fetus inherits the GCK gene mutation from the mother or not. On routine USG if there is evidence of increased abdominal growth， it suggests that the fetus is unaffected and insulin treatment is required in such situations only 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. If fetus is inherited with GCK mutation and insulin treatment is initiated in such women， it will result in fetal growth restriction which happened in her first pregnancy (inappropriate high dose of insulin to optimize glucose homeostasis resulted in baby weight of 2.25 kg). Generally the treatment is not initiated before 32 weeks. There is 50% chance that the offspring is affected 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Knowledge of fetal genotyping is not usually not mandatory to determine the need for initiation of insulin treatment and regular monitoring of abdominal circumference would suffice. Whenever the fetus is unaffected， the AC usually goes beyond75h percentile. In such situations， an intensive insulin treatment is required and large doses of insulin may be required which may be difficult sometimes to reduce the blood sugar values to near normal range of pregnancy.\n\n【14】The birth weight was more than 90h percentile in 55% of babies who were not inherited with hexokinase enzyme compared to only9% when the inheritance was present 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. It was also found that there was reduction in birth weight of around 400 gm in those babies who were inherited and the mother was not. There is no increased risk of congenital anomalies reported so far in women with hexokinase删除1换行mutation. In spite of having an impact on fetal growth in GCK mutation， the evidence is lacking for the development of any long term complications in the off spring 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【15】There is a data of metformin outside the pregnancy and it shows that there is no effect on lowering blood glucose in women with hexokinase mutation. There is no place for OHA in women with hexokinase mutation in pregnancy.\n\n【16】If the fetal growth is unaffected， pregnancy can be continued till term and the pregnancy is terminated at 38 weeks if there is any evidence of macrosomia. The pregnancy implication in different types of common forms of MODY is described in Table 2 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【17】Postpartum evaluation of the mother and genetic screening is needed if the condition is not diagnosed earlier. There is no need for routine follow up of women with glucokinase mutation. Medical nutrition therapy has little impact on blood glucose level in women with hexokinase mutation. At present there is no evidence to initiate treatment outside the pregnancy as these individuals are not at risk of developing any vascular complications. If the women is already on treatment and if subsequently diagnosed as glucokinase mutation the treatment can be stopped. There was a longitudinal study in which there were about 799 GCK-MODY patients were compared. The HbA1C levels of those who received treatment was not different from those who were not on treatment (6.5% vs. 6.4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The risk of developing type I and type II DM in future is similar to general population.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】The heterozygous mutation of hexokinase enzyme results in mild fasting hyperglycaemia. They don’t require treatment outside the删除1换行pregnancy. They are not at risk of developing long term complications and they don’t respond to oral hypoglycaemic agents. If the baby does not inherit the enzyme and there is an evidence of macrosomia insulin treatment is required. Uncontrolled fasting hyperglycaemia in spite of high doses of insulin during pregnancy should always raise the suspicion of this simple condition. However other subtypes of MODY requires multidisciplinary management which involve other specialities like endocrinologist， geneticist and neonatologist.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is also linked to an increased rate of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). Patients are typically prescribed medications to address the symptoms associated with acute vestibular crisis， but are not referred to physical therapy for treatment of lingering symptoms of PVD after the crisis has passed. Physical therapy has been shown to be safe and effective for reducing symptoms and improving function for patients suffering from chronic PVD，but early intervention has not been studied extensively.\n\n【2】Objective： The purpose of this case is contrast the effect of early physical therapy intervention for a patient with symptoms resulting from acute vestibular neuritis with the traditional course of care.\n\n【3】Case Presentation： The patient was a 54-year-old female who was referred to physical therapy by an emergency room physician following diagnosis of acute vestibular neuritis. At time of evaluation， she was unable to independently perform many activities of daily living (ADLs). Examination revealed BPPV， motion sensitivity， and vestibular-ocular reflex dysfunction. Interventions included patient education， canalith repositioning maneuvers， habituation/compensation program， and gradual return to functional activities.\n\n【4】Outcomes： At discharge， the patient had achieved all of her goals and reported no symptoms. In addition， the patient demonstrated no limitation with any ADLs.\n\n【5】Discussion： The outcomes suggest that， for this patient， the chosen intervention resulted in complete resolution of symptoms. The key to the patient’s rapid success was early intervention and patient education.

Vestibular neuritis has been linked to increased rates of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)， indicating that the dysfunction of the utricle may result in otoconia displacement into the posterior semi-circular canal. BPPV has been reported to occur in 15%-20% of patients post vestibular neuritis versus the3% prevalence in the general population. Treatment of secondary BPPV using canalith repositioning maneuvers (CRMs) has been shown to be somewhat less effective that treating idiopathic BPPV， generally requiring more treatment sessions and demonstrating increased recurrence rates 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【8】Typically， patients who suffer from vestibular neuritis are prescribed medications during the acute phase to suppress the vestibular system， curb nausea，and reduce anxiety. These medications are typically taken consistently and for an extended period of time. After resolution of the active vestibular crisis， motion sensitivity and oscillopsia lingers for the majority of patients. In a study published researching the effect of medication， the authors found that at 12 months post onset of vestibular neuritis， complete peripheral vestibular recovery ranged from 36%-62.4% of patients depending on the medications prescribed indicated that many patients continue to suffer from symptoms regardless of medication 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The result of vestibular dysfunction can be debilitating and， if left untreated， function generally declines further.

Though this is suggested， there is little research published about early intervention after acute vestibular neuritis.\n\n【9】Table 1： Psychometric Properties of Tests and Measures.\n\n| Test  |  | Reliability (interrater)  | Validity (Criterion)  | Sensitivity  | Specificity  | MCID  |  | MDC  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Head Thrust  |  | NE  | NE  | 35%通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>  | 95%通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>  | N/A  |  | N/A  |\n| Computerized DVA (NE for manual DVA)  |  | NE  | NE  | 94.5%通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>  | 95.2%通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>  | NE  |  | NE  |\n| DHI  |  | NE  | -0.64通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>fcorrelated with ABC)  | 50%通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> (multiplesclerosis)  | 77%通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> (multiplesclerosis)  | 218 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> (vestibulardeficits)  |  | 17.18通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>(vestibular deficits)  |\n| Dix-Hallpike  |  | 0.92 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>  |  | 79.3%通用删除6(英):<u>[171  </u>| 75%通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>  | N/A  |  | N/A  |\n| SOT  |  | NE  | NE  | 95%通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>(estimated)  | NE  | NE  |  | >710  |\n| FGA  |  | 0.86通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>  | 0.64通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> fcorrelated withABC)  | 100%通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> fcommunity dwelling older adults)  | 72%通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> fcommunitydwelling older adults)  | >6 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> (vestibulardeficits)  |  | 4.2 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> (stroke)  |\n\n| 5 weeks  | Pt. will be independent with HEP  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 5 weeks  | SOT normal in all conditions  |\n| 5 weeks  | Increase FGA by 40% (to 21/30) in order to improve ambulation in all conditions  |\n| 5 weeks  | Decrease DHI score by 60% (to 32/100) to decrease activity limitation from dizziness to a moderate level (from severe)  |\n| 10 weeks  | Increase FGA by 90%(to 28/30) to allow for normal ambulation with all normal head/body motions  |\n| 10 weeks  | Decrease DHI score by 90% (to 8/100) to decrease activity limitation from dizziness to a minimal level  |\n| 10 weeks  | Decreased symptoms of dizziness to allow independence with all prior activities  |\n| 10 weeks  | Independent with gait x 300 ft. with head turns for environment scanning with good path management to allow for safe ambulation in busy environments  |\n\n【12】Through a literature review， a single study was found by Strupp et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> which addressed vestibular rehabilitation immediately following diagnosis of vestibular neuritis. The patients were all hospitalized and treatment was giving for seven days， followed by a detailed Home Exercise Program (HEP). The treatment group demonstrated significantly greater postural stability at a 30 day follow-up as compared with the control group. This being said， patients diagnosis with vestibular neuritis are now not generally hospitalized， and referral to vestibular rehab is not a standard procedure when the patients visit the emergency room or a primary care physician to receive treatment.\n\n【13】For patients with chronic peripheral vestibular dysfunction， physical therapy interventions including CRMs， Vestibular Ocular Reflex (VOR) retraining， vestibular spinal reflex (VSR) retraining， habituation， and adaptation/compensation have been reported to successfully reduce symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Prior to instructing the patient in any exercise， it is important to educate the patient on the expected results of rehabilitation. The patient must understand the mechanism of recovery in vestibular rehabilitation is error detection/error correction. This means the patient will have increased symptoms with the activities untilthecentral nervous system adapts to the dysfunction. If the patient does not understand this progression， compliance with the home exercise program will decrease significantly 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【14】According to Giray et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> vestibular rehabilitation including adaptation， substitution， and balance activities results in significant improvement of symptoms， disability， balance， and postural stability in patients with chronic vestibular hypofunction 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，7]</u>. Habituation and adaptations activities for vestibular recovery are also considered safe and effective forms of rehabilitation for patients with peripheral vestibular loss. Goals of vestibular rehabilitation often include reduction in symptoms， fear， and risk of falling. Improvements in删除1换行balance， VOR function， and gait (especially with head movements) are also expected 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【15】The purpose of this case report is contrast the effect of early physical therapy intervention for a patient with symptoms resulting from acute vestibular neuritis with the traditional course of care.\n\n【16】Case Presentation\n\n【17】Patient history\n\n【18】Mrs. M.， a 54-year-old female， was referred to physical therapyby an emergency room physician when she visited the emergency room ten days prior to the physical therapy evaluation with complaint of persistent vertigo， leading to diagnosis of vestibular neuritis. No clinical tests were performed to evaluate vestibular function. The patient was prescribed Reglan， Diazepam， and Meclizine to address symptoms of acute vestibular crisis and anxiety. She had not taken any medication for four days prior to beginning therapy. Her chief complaints at the time of the evaluation were motion sensitivity， imbalance， and oscillopsia. Mrs. M. had no history of similar symptoms. Her general health status was fair. She was overweight but had been active in aerobic exercise， successfully reducing her weight. The patient reported history of significant left knee dysfunction resulting from a prior ACL injury. She had history of multiple arthroscopic surgeries to address the dysfunction. She had no psychological medical history. Mrs. M. quit smoking three years prior to evaluation after smoking one pack per day for over thirty years. She indicated occasional drinking. She reported no significant family medical history.\n\n【19】Prior to vestibular neuritis， the patient was independent with all household and community activities. She was married and lived with her husband. Mrs. M. was a mother and grandmother and enjoyed visiting her family which required driving and flying frequently. She was a retired EMT， but remained active as a volunteer medical coordinator for community events such as concerts and festivals.\n\n【20】Table 3： Home Exercise Program.\n\n| Exercise  | tx 1eval  | tx 2(wk 1)  | tx 3 (wk 2)  | tx 4 (wk 2)  | tx 5 (wk 3)  | tx 6 (wk 3)  | tx 7 (wk 4)  | tx 8 (wk 5)  | No tx (Wk6)  | tx 9 (wk 7)  | tx 10 (wk 8)re-eval  | tx 11 (wk9)  | tx 12(wk 10)discharge  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gaze stabilization(yaw plane)3x 45-90Sec  |  |  | Firmsurface，simplebackground，no pacing  | Pacing 85BPM， frmsurface.simplebackground  | Pacing 80BPM， softsurtace.simple background  | Pacing 90BPM， softsurface.complex background  | Pacing 100BPM， softsurface.complex background  | Pacing 100BPM， firmsurtace.narrowrBOS.complex background  | Pacing 110BPM， firmsurtace.narrowBOS， complex background  | Pacing 110BPM， softsurface.narrowrBOS，complex background  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  |\n| Gazestabilization(pitchplane) 3 x45-90 sec  |  |  |  | Firmsurtace.simplebackground，no pacing  | Pacing 75BPM， firmsurtace.simplebackground  | Pacing 80BPM， softsurface.complexbackground  | Pacing 90BPM， softsurtace.complex background  | Pacing 110BPM， softsurtace.complexbackground  | Pacing 110BPM， softsurface.complex background  | Pacing 105 BPM， softsurface.narrowrBOS.complex background  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  |\n| Brandt-Daroff 3x 5  |  | EO  | FC  | FC  | EC  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  |\n| Log Roll3x5  |  | EC  | FC  | FC  | FC  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  |\n| Standinghead turns/head nods 5x5  |  |  |  | EO， Firmsurtace (ptto progressto EC)  | EO， softsurtace  | EC， softsurtace  | EC， softsurtace  | EC， softsurtace  | EC， softsurface  | EC， firmsurtace.narrowrBOS  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  |\n| Standingtorward flexion 3x 5  |  |  |  |  |  | EO  | EC  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  | Hold  |\n| 1/2 turns3x5  |  |  |  |  |  |  | EO  | EO  | pt toprogress toEC whenappropriate  | EC  | EC  | FC  | EC  |\n| Ballbounces(Otolithstimulation)3x30 sec  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | visualfixation.simplebackground  | visualfixation，simple background  | visualfixation.complex background  | visualfixation，complexbackground  | withcervicalrotation.flexion.and extension  | withcervicalrotation.flexion.and extension  |\n| Ambulation with quickmotionsfotolithstimulation)  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Stopping，turning  | Stopping，turning  |\n\n【22】tx=treatment，EO=eyes open， EC=eyes closed，BOS=base of supportPt self-progressed pace by 5 BPM when symptoms allowed (able to perform for >90 sec with symptom provocation <2/5)\n\n【23】At time of evaluation， Mrs. M. was unable to perform certain activities of daily living (ADLs) independently； she was limited with driving， ambulation， bending forward， rolling in bed， and functioning in visually complex environments secondary to her symptoms. Her husband was actively involved in her recovery and was able to provide transportation， as well as emotional support throughout the rehabilitation process.\n\n【24】Mrs. M.s personal goals were to return to all prior activities without symptoms， including：an exercise program， volunteer activities in visually complex environment， and frequent traveling.\n\n【25】Systems review\n\n【26】Mrs. M.’s blood pressure was slightly elevated， but all other vital signs were within normal limits at rest (BP =144/72 mmHg，HR=78BPM，RR=16，O，=99%). She reported no diagnosis of hypertension or cardiac disease.\n\n【27】The patient had no integumentary impairments. Scar formation， skin color， and skin integrity were normal， and she had no evidence of edema. Mrs. M.'s musculoskeletal system was generally unimpaired. Her gross range of motion and strength were within functional limits. She had history of left knee dysfunction， but reported only stair climbing and extended periods of standing caused discomfort. She stated she used the rail to climb stairs secondary to knee instability.\n\n【28】Her height was 1.73 m (5’8\") and her weight was 113.4 kg (250 lbs.). The patient presented with no cognitive deficits， though she had extreme anxiety with movement secondary to fear of falling. Mrs M. had neurological involvement secondary to her disease process Her balance and locomotion were impaired by symptoms of motion sensitivity and imbalance. An in-depth evaluation of balance and gait was performed.\n\n【29】Clinical impression #1： The patient's rehab potential was good due to recent onset of symptoms. Her anxiety was also acute， beginning only with symptom onset. She was highly motivated to return to her normal activities.\n\n【30】To determine extent of dysfunction and plan interventions， full oculomotor exam， BPPV screen， impairment based balance testing， and functional testing were performed 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【31】Patient examination\n\n【32】The psychometric properties of the tests and measures utilized are recorded in Table 1. Oculomotor exam revealed normal smooth pursuits and vergence indicating no central involvement. Self-paced vestibular-ocular reflex testing (VORx1， which indicates a gain of one between head and eye movements) resulted in patient report of increased dizziness andloss of visual focus.

Subjective symptoms of dizziness were evaluated with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory(DHI). With the patient’s score of 80/100， she was severely impaired by her symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) screen revealed positive right Dix-Hallpike with up-beating， right， torsional nystagmus， indicating right posterior canalithiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Balance was screened with Romberg test which was positive eyes closed with right posterior loss of balance. To evaluate balance system impairment， the patient's sensory organization was tested using the NeuroCom Balance Manager computerized sensory organization test (SOT). Mrs. M. presented with somatosensory pattern indicated by difficulty in condition #2. No other impairments were noted with this test， although she reported extreme anxiety throughout testing. It was observed that the patient had large limits of stability， allowing her to remain standing though she demonstrated significant sway through tests conditions #5 and #6 which tax the vestibular system. Her composite score was within the normal range for her age 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【37】Because the SOT indicated a somatosensory deficit， sensation of the lower extremities was assessed. Literature has demonstrated that peripheral neuropathy is suggested with the presence of two or more signs of deficit. If two signs are diminished， the sensitivity is 94.1%and the specificity is 84.4% for neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. The patient’s light touch with localization was intact throughout the lower extremity dermatome pattern. Vibration was tested using a Rydel Seiffer graduated tuning fork on the great toe and medial malleolus. The patient reported feeling the vibration until a value of 7.5 at each location bilaterally. The normal value for lower extremities for her age group is greater than 4.0 indicating the patient's vibration sense is intact 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. With both of these intact， somatosensory impairment was not indicated. Mrs. M.’s score of 15/30 on the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) put her at increased risk for falling (fall risk <22/30) 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. The patient had difficulty and symptom provocation during ambulation with head motion and turning. She presented with decreased velocity of ambulation with head movements， backward ambulation， and ambulation with eyes closed. Observation of Mrs. M. revealed increased lumbar lordosis secondary to anterior pelvic tilt during stance. The patient's center of gravity (COG) alignment was appropriate， indicated by SOT results.\n\n【38】Evaluation： Tests and measures indicated the patient suffers from right posterior canalithiasis (BPPV)，motion sensitivity，and increased anxiety post vestibular neuritis； which were consistent with initial impressions based on history. The patient’s problem list included fall risk， BPPV， VOR dysfunction， and motion sensitivity which limited ADLs including the following： driving， household chores (i.e. bending forward to unload dishes or laundry)， ambulation， volunteer community involvement， and exercise program .\n\n【39】Physical therapy diagnosis\n\n【40】The patient was diagnosed as having impaired motor function and sensory integrity associated with peripheral nerve injury(Practice pattern 5F)， which includes peripheral vestibular disorders such as labyrinthitis and paroxysmal positional vertigo 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. The most appropriate ICD-9 code is 386.1 (other and unspecified peripheral vertigo)， but others include 781.3 (lack of coordination) and 780.4(dizziness and giddiness).\n\n【41】Goals： Goals divided into short term (5 week) and long term (10week)， are outlined in Table 2.\n\n【42】Prognosis\n\n【43】The patients rehab potential was good due to recent onset of motion sensitivity. Her anxiety was also acute， beginning only when her symptoms began. She was highly motivated to return to her former activities and had support from her husband.\n\n【44】Plan of care： The plan of care for Mrs. M. included canalith repositioning maneuvers (CRMs)， VOR andVVSR retraining， habituation activities for motion sensitivity， and gait activities. The CRMs were to address mechanical dysfunction of the vestibular systems resulting from BPPV 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Habituation， VOR， and VSR exercises provided the appropriate stimulus of error detection/error correction to promote central nervous system reorganization通用删除6(英):<u> 5]</u>.\n\n【45】The patient was treated twice per week for three weeks， followed byonce per week for seven weeks with re-evaluation on the tenth visit. The first three weeks included completion of the initial evaluation， CRMs as indicated， and considerable patient education. The patient was educated in symptom recognition， symptom provocation， and symptom management. She was taught to rate her symptoms on a scale of zero to five， and to discontinue any activity when symptoms of3/5 were provoked. The last seven weeks of treatment were primarily to provide the patient with the appropriate progression for her home exercise program.\n\n【46】Intervention： The detailed home exercise program progression is provided in Table 3.\n\n【47】删除10:<u>BPPV</u>\n\n【48】Treatment began with CRM to address right posterior canal BPPV. The Epley maneuver was successful in treating the condition with resolution of nystagmus and complaint of vertigo with second Dix-Hallpike 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. The patient continued to complain of a light-headed and floating feeling upon return to upright， which is consistent with motion sensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. The patient's BPPV resolved completely after the first treatment and did not reoccur throughout the course of her treatment.\n\n【49】Motion sensitivity： Habituation program\n\n【50】The patient was progressively introduced to a habituation home exercise program. Habituation exercises included Brandt-Daroffs，log rolls， standing head turns/head nods， standing forward flexion， and% turns. These activities were chosen based on results of a motion sensitivity screen， derived from the motion sensitivity quotient test. These were also based on literature which demonstrates successful reduction of symptoms using similar activities 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，23，24]</u>.\n\n【51】Ball bounces on 65 cm exercise ball were included after an otolith screen of both horizontal and vertical acceleration revealed dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. It has been demonstrated that patients who have involvement of both the semicircular canals and the otolith respond删除1换行to vestibular rehab as effectively as those with only canal involvement通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>.\n\n【52】All of these exercises were progressed based on symptom limitations. The patient began each exercise with eyes open， and when symptom provocation decreased to less than 1/5， the exercise was progressed to eyes closed. The activity was then performed until symptoms were no longer provoked. Standing head turns/head nods were progressed from standing on a firm surface to a soft surface， which further stimulated the vestibular system. The symptom limited progression was performed to determine when this was appropriate.\n\n【53】The patient was limited to only three habituation exercises at a time. A new exercise was introduced after a current exercise was discontinued. The home exercise program was titrated this way to prevent overstimulation of the vestibular system which results in slowed progression， or even regression.\n\n【54】VOR retraining\n\n【55】VOR dysfunction was identified from oculomotor examination. To train this system， the patient was treated with progressive gaze stabilization (VOR x1) activities in both pitch and yaw plane通用删除6(英):<u>[5，27，28]</u>. By performing these exercises in standing， VSR retraining was also incorporated.\n\n【56】The exercise was progressed based on the same parameters as the habituation program. The patient was to increase the pace of the exercise by five beats per minute when she was able to perform 90seconds of the activity with symptoms of less than 1/5. The activity was progressed from standing on a firm surface to standing on a soft surface when the patient's postural stability during the activity had improved. This was determined by observation and the patient's subjective report of stability.\n\n【57】Functional activity\n\n【58】After significant reduction in symptom provocation through the habituation and VOR retraining program， the patient was introduced to functional activity training including ambulation with head turns/head nods (environment scanning)， ambulation with eyes closed(mimicking dark environments)， ambulation with quick starts and stops， and ambulation with half-turns. These activities stimulated both the semicircular canals and the otolith. They were chosen based on symptom provocation and the initial FGA results. The patient was to self-monitor symptoms during these activities and discontinue if symptoms reached 3/5.\n\n【59】The patient was also instructed to re-initiate her gym program within symptom limitations 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. She was to self-monitor symptoms and discontinue any activity that provoked symptoms of motion sensitivityof3/5. Her gym program included water aerobics， stationary bike， treadmill， rowing machine， and resistance training machines. These activities all stimulate the vestibular system significantly with altered surfaces and quick horizontal and vertical acceleration. The patient performed these activities at a community gym， which also incorporated a visuallycomplex environment. When the visual system is taxed， and not able to be utilized to provide balance feedback， the vestibular system input is more heavily weighted. For a patient with motion sensitivity， this leads to increased symptom provocation.\n\n【60】These activities were incorporated intothe patient'shome exercise program after she had demonstrated the ability to perform self-limitation of activities and had demonstrated significant reduction in symptom provocation with more simple tasks.\n\n【61】Outcomes\n\n【62】Outcomes are shown in Table 4. At discharge， the patient reported no symptoms of dizziness， oscillopsia， or vertigo. She did not present with fall risk or motion sensitivity， and had no anxiety with movement. The patient achieved all of her goals by discharge. She increasedher FGA score to 28/30 which indicated no fall risk and was normal for her age. Her DHI score decreased from 80/100，severe handicap， to 4/100 which indicated no handicap related to dizziness. Mrs. M.s DVA remained positive with three lines lost， normal is less than three lost. She had significant improvement on the test， but reported her contact lenses were shifting during the test at discharge resulting in less clarity during head movements. At initial evaluation， she wore glasses.\n\n【63】Discussion\n\n【64】The outcomes suggest that， for this patient， early intervention including： BPPV treatment， VOR/VSR retraining， habituation， and gradual return to functional activities resulted in complete resolution of the patient's symptoms. This is consistent with findings from previous studies focusing on chronic PVD which indicate significant improvement in patients'symptoms and quality of life with vestibular rehabilitation 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，6，7，24]</u>. The combination ofthe habituation activities， progressing from lower level， full support activities to higher level activities with less support or on compliant surfaces， provided stimulus to re-integrate signals from the vestibular system into the central nervous system 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. BPPV treatment was successful without typical post-repositioning precautions provided. According to Tusa and Herdman 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， studies indicate there is no evidence to support the efficacy of remaining upright for 48 hours after the repositioning maneuvers.\n\n【65】The key to this patient’s siccess was early intervention and patient education on symptom limitation and reduction of vestibular taxing activities to keep symptoms within acceptable limits. She was required to self-monitor and alter her normal activities to prevent symptom provocation above acceptable limits.\n\n【66】The patient was able to resume all ADLs， volunteer activities， and full work-out program in ten weeks. She no longer had difficulty with ambulation in complex environments or with head movements. She was able to return to social drinking without anxiety about becoming lightheaded. All of these things were very important to the patient as she wanted to maintain an active， social lifestyle.\n\n【67】It is interesting to note， in week five， the patient's progression slowed because she complained of increased symptom provocation throughout the week. During that week， the weather suddenly changed from sunny and warm to overcast and rainy. There is no literature to describe the effect of acute weather changes on vestibular function. Articles have been published describing self-reported triggers for migraine associated vertigo in which weather changes have been implicated 通用删除6(英):<u>[29，30]</u>. These articles are not experimental in design， and they are not specific to the pathology described in this case， but they are the only literature available supporting the claim. Many online communities which are dedicated to patients suffering from vestibular disorders (i.e. blogs， support groups， social networks) also suggest that weather changes lead to increased symptom provocation， but as previously stated， this has not been formally studied. The effect of acute changes in weather and barometric pressure would be an interesting area of further research， especially because subjective complaints implicate these changes as a major trigger for symptom删除1换行provocation.\n\n【68】Though there were set-backs throughout the treatment including the weather changes and the missed treatment day in week six， her recovery followed the expected timeline. She was able to return to all activities in less than three months and no longer experienced anxiety about movement. Due to her compliance with the program and motivation to recover， she completed her rehabilitation and was satisfied with the experience and results.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "f542a1dd-4305-4423-9da9-edf7e70c33c7", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】We report three cases of Total Elbow Arthroplasty (TEA) for complete bony ankylosis in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Two cases had trauma around the elbow joint before ankylosis. At the most recent examinations， the average arc of motion was 85 degrees among patients. Two patients satisfied with surgical outcomes， however， one patient complained of residual pain and numbness. There were some reports about TEA of ankylosed elbow，however， there were few reports limited to ankylosed elbow with RA. TEA for ankylotic elbows in patients with RA is a good surgical option to restore adequate function. To gain a good outcome， it should be evaluated other joints in the extremity in order to properly evaluate the mobility and function of the elbowand to prepare a comprehensive plan of pre- and post-operative management that takes into consideration the full motion of the upper extremity.\n\n【2】Keywords： Ankylotic elbow； Rheumatoid arthritis， Total elbow arthroplasty\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a common disease characterized by chronic synovitis and resulting in joint destruction. Recent advancements in the diagnostic process and treatment of RA have decreased joint surgery， including synovectomy or joint replacement， over the last decade 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Nevertheless， some patients with severe joint destruction occasionally develop severe contractures or ankylosis which impair the Activities of Daily Living (ADL).\n\n【5】The incidence of elbow joint involvement in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is approximately 50%通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Destruction of the elbow joint seriously impairs upper limb function. Moreover， complete ankylosis of the elbow results in severe disability and functional limitations， especially when other joints in the ipsilateral upper extremity also have limited motion 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In a previous study not limited to RA patients， the analysis of compensatory movement after arthrodesis of the elbow showed compromised ability， despite a significantly increased dependence on wrist movement 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Since the wrist or shoulder joint is occasionally damaged and impaired in patients with RA， ankylosis of the elbow affects ADL more than it would in a patient without RA 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Accordingly，an ankylosed elbow， especially in RA patients， generally should be treated.\n\n【6】Elbow contractures are usually treated with arthroscopic surgery or open surgical release and numerous reports have indicated the achievement of good results 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-6]</u>. However， fewer reports present the results of Total Elbow Arthroplasty (TEA) in ankylosed elbows 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，7-10]</u>. Figgie et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> concluded that stiff elbows are difficult to treat and have a high complication rate. The latter study was reported in 1989 and good anatomical implants were not available at that time. Since implant design and surgical techniques have advanced in recent years， TEA could now be a reliable option to restore function to completely ankylosed elbows damaged by RA. There were some reports of TEA on ankylosed elbow； however， there were few reports about TEA ankylosed elbow limited to RA patient. This report is a retrospective review of TEAs performed in our hospital between 2008 and2015 for ankylosed elbows in patients with RA. We examine complete ankylosis in three elbows of three patients with RA who underwent TEA. All of the patients were women and their average age at surgery was 55 years (range， 29 to 72 years). Herein we report these cases.\n\n【7】Anteroposterior and lateral views after total elbow arthroplasty (TEA).\n\n【8】Case Presentation Case 1\n\n【9】A 29-year-old woman had complained of polyarthralgia when she was16 years old， at which time she visited our clinic and was diagnosed with RA. When she was 27 years old she struck her right elbow when she fell to the ground. After the accident， she was referred to the nearby hospital， where she was diagnosed with a right humeral supracondylar fracture and treated conservatively with a cast. Bone union was achieved 3 months after the injury. However， this patient was referred to our department 1 year after the injury because she noticed a reduction in motion and gradual impairment of her right elbow. Radiographs revealed that her right elbow was completely ankylosed and fused at 20 degrees flexed position . There were no symptoms due to ulnar nerve. In the hope that she would be able to regain the mobility needed to be able to wash her face and hair by her， at 29 years of age she underwent a linked TEA (K-NOW snap in； Nakashima Medical， Okayama， Japan). The posterior Campbell approach was used， and the triceps was incised in an inverted V-shape. First， the ulnar nerve was isolated and protected. Second， the extensor carpi ulnaris and anconeus muscles were released from the ulna. Although osseous ankylosis had occurred， it was easy to identify the landmarks of the original humeroulnar joint. After the radial head was resected， the humeroulnar joint line was carefully opened using a bone saw and mini-osteotomes. The rest of the procedure was almost the same as any standard TEA method. Care was taken to release the anterior part of the capsule to improve extension and the triceps muscle was released from the humerus in order to improve flexion. Under general anesthesia， the range of motion of the elbow ranged from 0 to 125 degrees after the implants had settled. The triceps flap was elongated using the V-Y method. The ulnar nerve was replaced anteriorly from its origin. A radiographic examination after the surgery showed the alignment of components was acceptable . The patient's elbow was immobilized with a splint for 1 week. Under the observation of an occupational therapist， the splint was removed and range of motion exercises were begun with a 30 degrees restriction on extension. Three weeks after the operation， the patient was allowed to move her elbow freely. Any elbow brace was not applied. At the most recent examination， or 65 months after surgery， passive motion of the patient's elbow ranged from 30 to 110 degrees and she did not experience any pain or numbness. She was able to wash her face and hair by herself again and she was very satisfied with the surgical outcome.\n\n【10】Case 2\n\nA 64 year old woman was diagnosed with RA at the age of 30.

She injured her left elbow at age 69 and was diagnosed with a supracondylar fracture of the humerus. Her left elbow was treated conservatively and progressively lost motion. This patient hoped to undergo elbow surgery and was referred to our hospital at age 71. Her left elbow was fused at 90 degrees and radiographs revealed that it was completely ankylosed . At age 72， she underwent linked TEA using The Discovery Elbow System. The surgical approach and technique were the same as those described for Case 1 and included a triceps flap elongation and ulnar nerve transposition. Because a crack occurred on the lateral condyle of the humerus during bone reaming， Kirchner wires were inserted and the fragment was fixed. Under general anesthesia， the range of motion of the elbow ranged删除1换行anteroposterior and lateral views. (B) Anteroposterior and lateral views after\n\n【13】删除10:<u>TEA.</u>\n\n【14】from 40 to 140 degrees after the implant settled. A radiographic examination after the surgery showed that the alignment of the implants was acceptable . The postoperative treatment was the same was described for Case 1. The patient complained of continued numbness in her ring and little finger immediately after the surgery. Therefore， she underwent neurolysis of the ulnar nerve7 months after her primary surgery. The symptoms on the ulnar side of her hand gradually improved after the neurolysis； however，hand numbness persisted at her most recent examination. Passive motion at her elbow ranged from 60 to 125 degrees. The increased range of motion at the patient's elbow improved her ADL， so she was satisfied with her surgical outcome to some extent， despite the handnumbness that persisted.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】There have been several reported case series of TEA for ankylosed elbows 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，7-9]</u>. Figgies et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> reported a 19-case series of TEA using linked implants for ankylotic elbows in patients with a variety of conditions that have included RA. Of the 19 cases， 4 cases were evaluated as excellent， 11 as good， 3 as fair， and 1 as a failure. The failed case occurred after an infection developed around the surgical site and the implants were removed. The authors stated that the functional limitations of patients should be evaluated at the outset and this should include a concurrent evaluation of other upper extremity joints. Mansat et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> reported 14 cases， 4 of which were rated as excellent， 4 were good， 1 was fair， and 5 were poor. Peden et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> reported 13 cases： 5 were rated as excellent，3 were good， 4 were fair， and 1 was poor. According to these reports， functional ability restored in most patients postoperatively and was sufficient enough that they could perform ADL normally. In our cases， two of the three patients were very satisfied with the surgical outcome and reported that their ADLs were better than they had been preoperatively.\n\n【17】In the previous reports， the range of motion achieved at the elbows was mostly good. Figgie at al.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> reported that the mean arc of motion improved from 0 degrees preoperatively to 80 degrees(range， 35 to 115 degrees of flexion) at an average 5.75 years after the operation. Mansat et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> reported that the mean increase in the arc of flexion was 60 degrees (range， 5 to 115 degrees)， with a mean increase of 33 degrees in flexion and 27 degrees in extension. Peden et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> reported that the improvement in range of motion at the elbow measured 1 vear after the operation was maintained for all patients after a 12-year follow-up. In our study， the average arc of motion was 85 degrees (range， 65 to 110 degrees) at the most recent examination. This result is similar to that of the Peden et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> study. Improvement in the range of motion of the elbow improves the ADL for patients with RA. Common complications following TEA are aseptic loosening， infections， ulnar nerve problems， elbow instability， dislocation， subluxation， intraoperative fracture， fracture of the prosthesis， and ectopic bone formation 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. When performing TEA for an ankylotic elbow， special care should be taken to prevent infection， ulnar nerve problems， instability， and an intraoperative fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，8-10]</u>. Infection is not typically frequent， but severe complications can arise if it does occur. In the previous study reported by Figgie et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> the only case to fail was due to a deep infection and the patient was not a suitable candidate for implant arthroplasty because of noncompliance. Mansat et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> reported that a deep infection developed in one elbow of two patients with posttraumatic stiffness. One patient had two previous operations prior to the arthroplasty， and the other patient had been operated on four times删除1换行before. Both of these patients required revision surgery. In another previous report， three patients had deep perioperative infections that required an average of four additional operations 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Neurogenic symptoms， especially those pertaining to ulnar nerve disorders， were a relatively common complication after TEA. It was reported that some patients with moderate neurogenic symptoms preoperatively had complete relief after ulnar nerve decompression and transposition， while other previously asymptomatic patients developed ulnar nerve symptoms； however， no pain was attributed to the ulnar nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Among our cases， one of the three patients had significant ulnar nerve symptoms after undergoing TEA and required revision surgery(neurolysis). Because kinking or compression of the ulnar nerve can occur after TEA for ankylotic elbows 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， perioperative procedures to manage the ulnar nerve should be employed. In previous reports， linked implants have been recommended in order to maintain the stability of elbows over the full course of the period during which they are observed 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. Our cases had received linked implants and we did not encounter complaints regarding symptoms caused by elbow instability. Intraoperative fracture is one of the most severe complications to try and avoid during this type of operation. Peden et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> reported that two cases had a fracture of the lateral humeral epicondyle which resolved uneventfully and the ulnar component was malpositioned causing a perforation of the posterior cortex in another case. Mansat et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> reported that two patients sustained a fracture associated with a loose component. One of our cases had an intraoperative fracture and it was fixed with a Kirchner wire. We noted that the original border between the humerus and ulna was sometimes difficult to identify intraoperatively and this can inadvertently contribute to a fracture when opening up an ankylotic joint.\n\n【18】In conclusion， TEA for ankylotic elbows in patients with RA is a good surgical option to restore adequate function as well as any other spontaneous ankylosis. For the sake of a good outcome， it is necessaryto evaluate other joints in the extremity in order to properly evaluate the mobility and function of the elbow and to prepare a comprehensive plan of pre- and post-operative management that takes into consideration the full motion of the upper extremity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Gait disturbance was added thereafter， and she became unable to walk without support. Her neurological examination showed limited abduction in her left eye and ataxic gait. Her routine blood tests did not reveal any pathology. Her brain MRI showed hydrocephalus as well as leptomenigeal thickening and contrast enhancement around the brainstem Figure 1. T2-weighted spinal MR images revealed a diffuse hyperintense area between C2 and C7 in the spinal cord，consistent with edema. Post-contrast images revealed diffuse leptomeningeal contrast enhancement across spinal cord and prominent contrast enhancement in central anterior median fissure Figure 1， 2.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the tumor usually reveals diffuse leptomeningeal contrast enhancement and hydrocephalus 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In addition to the above-mentioned conventional MRI findings， our case had diffuse edema affecting a long segment删除1换行in cervical spinal cord without an intrinsic mass lesion. Increased intracranial pressure due to communicating hydrocephalus is the major clinical finding in DLGNT 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. MRI findings are important for diagnosis. Conventional MRI findings of DLGNT are leptomeningeal contrast enhancement especially in the basal cisterns and throughout the spinal cord， which can be confused with tuberculous and other types of meningitis， and accompanying hydrocephalus 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. The only specific radiological finding described for this tumor is subpial cysts which can only be seen in some of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. It is of interest that various spinal cord lesions are described in DLGNT tumor patients in the literature whereas brain lesions are somewhat the same limited number of lesions. Many radiological findings such as intramedullary predominantly cystic lesion without spinal leptomeningeal contrast enhancement， enhancing intramedullary lobulated mass， small enhancing intramedullarylesions， subpial cysts， and extramedullary nodular lesions were described in the spinal cord通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>. Our case showed diffuse leptomeningeal contrast enhancement which was most prominent in the anterior median fissure and two tiny enhancing extramedullary nodular lesions. In addition to these classical findings， the most striking finding in our case was long segment spinal cord edema exceeding two vertebral bodies although there was no intramedullary tumoral lesion. We suggest that the most appropriate mechanism for the formation of long segment T2-hyperintense lesion is that diffuse leptomeningeal involvement prevents venous return and edema occurs in the spinal cord as a result of increased capillary pressure. In diffuse leptomeningeal involvement， parenchymal infarcts can also be expected due to alteration of the arterial supply. In our patient， diffusion restriction was not observed in the cervical spinal cord in DWI.On the contrary， increased diffusion was observed， so acute and subacute infarctions were ruled out. Another possible mechanism is that DLGNT may have made a diffuse microinvasion into the spinal cord through the perivascular spaces which is difficult to detect with MRI. This could be demonstrated by postmortem pathological examination， but this was not possible in our case. Lesions can be observed in the brain and spinal cord as a result of paraneoplastic effect， however， in this case antibody-mediated damage in myelin and neuronal elements and associated clinical findings are expected. Our patient did not have transverse myelitis findings， which ruled out the aforementioned mechanism.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】Our case showed that increased T2 signals can be seen in the spinal cord in DLGNT. Although MR images are suggestive of transverse myelitis， they might be misleading. As in our case， the absence of clinical findings of transverse myelitis in patients with myelitis findings on MRI and diffuse leptomeningeal contrast enhancement should suggest DLGNT.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Synchronous multiple primary malignant tumors are defined as the occurrence of two primary neoplasms within six months of each other. Overall， the occurrence of MPMT's varies from 1%-16%， with HCC and multiple other tumors very rare and the synchronous occurrence of HCC and gallbladder carcinoma has only been reported 6 times. It is crucial to patient care that each tumor is identified correctly as they are treated entirely different and the prognosis for the patient is dependent on the stage for each.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】The occurrence of multiple synchronous primary tumors in patients with HCC is extremely rare and the association HCC and GBC has only been previously reported 6 times.\n\n【4】Criteria for the classification of multiple primary tumors： 1) each tumor is unequivocally malignant 2) each tumor is a separate and distinct entity 3) must exclude that one is a metastasis from the other 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. It is critical that simultaneous tumors be identified as therapy must be guided taking into consideration both tumors and the treatment for each independently， as well as the treatment for both combined. A thorough review of the literature in PubMed was performed and articles relevant to this case report cited.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】An elderly male was referred to our institution after computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed a suspicious mass in the dome of the gallbladder and he was scheduled for a laparoscopic versus open cholecystectomy with possible radical cholecystectomy. No hepatic lesions were noted on CT. At the time of the laparoscopic surgery the surgeons were unable to completely visualize the gallbladder secondary to dense adhesions therefore an open cholecystectomy was performed. After careful dissection， the gallbladder was isolated and a firm mass was palpated in the fundus. The node of Calot was dissected and sent to pathology for an intraoperative frozen section which was positive for carcinoma. A radical cholecystectomy was performed which included additional lymph node dissection and resection of segment 4 of the liver. The procedure and postoperative care of the patient was excellent and there were no complications. The patients care was transferred to a different facility but he was stable one year later with no definitive recurrence of the two tumors.\n\n【7】The gross specimens consisted of a partial hepatectomy 5 cm x 4.5 cm x 4 cm with a poorly circumscribed 2.5 cm tan yellow mass in the background of a cirrhotic liver. The gallbladder consisted of a 10 cm x 6 cm x 4 cm gallbladder with a mass consisting of multiple fragments of friable red papillary tissue in aggregate 4 cm x 3 cm x 2.5 cm. Microscopically the HCC consisted of thickened trabeculae (some 8-10 cells thick) comprised of moderately atypical hepatocytes with prominent nucleoli， nuclear pseudoinclusions and mitoses . The gallbladder consisted of a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma that predominantly formed glands although there are nests of cells infiltrating the gallbladder wall . The GBC was positive for CEA ， CK7， CK20 while the HCC was negative for these markers. The HCC was intensly positive for AFP.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\nAsthe longevity of human's increases and medical science capabilities improve the occurrence of multiple primary malignant tumors (MPMT's) will also increase. There are three established criteria|删除段之间换行|for the classification of multiple primary tumors： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> each tumor is unequivocally malignant 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> each tumor is a separate and distinct entity 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> must exclude that one is a metastasis from the other. These criteria were first put forth by Warren and Gates in 1932 and for the most part still remain valid 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. With today's modern immuno-histochemistry and genetic analysis the latter two criteria are easily met and mutually exclusive. Synchronous tumors are defined as tumors that occur within 6 months of each other and metachronous tumors occur greater than 6 months ofeach other. In the present case the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the gallbladder carcinoma(GBC) occurred simultaneously， there was no clinical or histological connection between the two and IHC demonstrated that the two tumors are phenotypically distinct and thus one is not a metastasis from the other .\n\n【10】The occurrence of MPMT`s varies considerably， between 0.734%and 11.7% as documented by Demandante et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> in a literature review of 1，104，269 patients with MPMT's and the incidence of synchronous MPMT's is rare. Bagri reported that out of 23，260patients， 41 had MPMT's and only 9 were synchronous (<0.04%)通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Papaconstantinou et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> reported on a twelve year period and the incidence was 0.5%， 39 out of 7516. An in-depth and thorough SEER\n\n【11】Table 1： IHC demonstrated that the two tumors are phenotypically distinct and thus one is not a metastasis from the other.\n\n| Immunohistochemistry  | CK7  | CK20  | CDX2  | AFP  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gallbladder carcinoma  | 删除8:<u>十 </u> | 删除8:<u>十 </u> | 删除8:<u>十 </u> |  |\n| Hepatocellular carcinoma  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> |  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> | 删除8:<u>十 </u> |\n\n【13】report stated the incidence varied depending on the site of the initial primary and was 1% for liver to 16% for bladder 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【14】The occurrence of additional multiple primary tumors in patients with HCC are extremely rare and the association HCC and GBC has only been previously reported 6 times. De Pangher Manzini et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> reported that over a fifteen year period from 1980-1995 there were 29cases of HCC and MPMT's， and in two of these cases the additional tumor was GBC. Wei et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> reported on a series ofpatients who had HCC and the associated MPMTs. Over a 26 year period 448 HCC's were identified， 40 had MPMT's， only 11 had synchronous tumors(about 2.5%) and there was a single case of HCC and GBC (0.22%). Imada et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> reported on a case of triple carcinomas； HCC， GBC and cholangiocarcinoma. Kim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> reported on a case in which a patient underwent a partial hepatectomy and at the time of surgery an intraoperative frozen section discovered an adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder and La Greca et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> discovered a GBC after resection for HCC.\n\n【15】Although simultaneous HCC and GBC is extremely rare it is imperative that they both are identified as the treatment and prognosisis radically different for each one. The basic concepts involved in treating a patient with both HCC/GBC can be applied to any patient with MPMTs， ie whether surgery， chemotherapy， immunotherapy or radiation is the desired treatment. For example， transplant or partial hepatectomy are the primary treatment options for HCC with the greatest chance of success. However， less than 30%of GBC is amenable to surgical resection 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> which greatly limits surgery as a treatment option in HCC. Cytotoxic chemotherapy such as gemcitabine is used in GBC but chemotherapy is generally not beneficial in HCC 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>. Sorafenib， an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated pathway， is the only approved chemotherapy agent in HCC however it is potent bone marrow suppressor and even if it was not harmful in GBC， the addition of cytotoxic chemotherapy with the immunologic would be especially harmful to the bone marrow.\n\n【16】Although extremely rare concurrent HCC and GBC are treated entirely different and their occurrence’s should be recognized pathologically and clinically. This case superbly demonstrates the multifaceted aspects of treating patients with multiple primarytumors and as the longevity of human's increase， and with the capabilities of the medical profession rapidly advancing， multiple primary删除1换行malignant tumors will probably become more commonplace.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Prolonged use of corticoids can induce some specific side effects like iatrogenic Cushing syndrome(moon face， central obesity，plethora，buffalo hump). Sudden withdrawal ofcorticosteroids will lead to adrenal hypertrophy which releases insufficient cortisol into the blood and leads to adrenal crisis. Here， a 52 years old female patient experienced Cushing syndrome after taking dexamethasone tablet for prolonged period. She presented with all physical symptoms of Cushing syndrome.

Due to aspirational pneumonia the patient collapsed before initiating ventilator support.\n\n【29】Discussion\n\n【30】Glucocorticoids are commonly used in clinical practice for the management of various autoimmune， inflammatory and allergic diseases. Drugs like dexamethasone can cause Cushing syndrome， irrational administration of glucocorticoids iss most common particularly in chronic therapies which lead to many side effects like hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis suppression， Cushing's syndrome， increased risk of infections and changes in mental status通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Before initiating steroid therapy， patients should be well informed about the possible side effects of steroids.\n\n【31】Otherwise， it may lead to severe systemic side effects including Cushing's syndrome， hypertension， dyslipidemia， and suppression of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis， striae， glaucoma， skin atrophy， cataract and predisposition to life threatening infections 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【32】Iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome was suspected if the patient had：AM Cortisol of ≤4 mcg/dL and ACTH of ≤ 10 pcg/mL. Iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome is the most common cause of hypercortisolism通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Most patients with Cushing syndrome have round， red， full moon face， growth retardation in children， fat accumulation on the trunk along with weight gain， fat loss from the buttocks， legs， and arms (central obesity)， skin infections， purple marks (striae) on the skin of the breast， abdomen and thighs， thinly skin with easy bruising， backache while doing routine activities， fat deposit between the shoulders and above the collar bone， hips and shoulder muscle weakness， fracture of the rib and spine due to thinning of the bones.\n\n【33】Treatment is done by tapering the dose of corticosteroids which may take a year. Sudden stoppage corticosteroids after chronic intake can results in adrenal crisis 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. Slowly tapering the corticosteroid that is causing Cushing syndrome can help reverse the effects of adrenal gland atrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【34】In our case patient is under adrenal crisis as she stopped the drug suddenly and patient is in septic shock condition so before initiating steroid tapering therapy patient collapsed due to pneumonia.\n\n【35】Conclusion\n\n【36】In our case， we found that the Dexamethasone was a sole reason for occurrence of Cushing syndrome.

Deferred to urgent surgery in the first days with prosthesis implantation in the aortic arch and reconstruction of supra-aortic trunks with good subsequent evolution.\n\n【2】We carry out a narrative review of recent years articles dealing with the actual need of modifying current traditional classifications， in order to emphasizing a new use with a view to staging severity and prognosis and， above all， to help treatment decision management， whether to choose conservative or urgent surgical intervention.\n\n【3】Keywords： Aortic dissection； No A no B； Aortic surgery\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Acute Aortic Dissection (AAD) is a pathology encompassed within the acute aortic syndrome together with other entities such as intramural hematoma or penetrating ulcer， with an approximate annual incidence of 2-15/100，000 inhabitants and a high mortality rate. AAD occurs as， a result of a tear between the intima and media layers， creating a false lumen， where blood flows between the media and adventitial layers. It is associated with several cardiovascular risk factors such as advanced age， male gender， hypertension， previous aortic aneurysm， connective tissue diseases， and bicuspid aortic valve 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. It can progress rapidly with the risk of rupture， cardiac tamponade， myocardial ischemia or aortic insufficiency and can cause involvement of its main branches with ischemia of distant organs (kidney， brain， intestine，etc.)， the so-called malperfusion syndrome.\n\n【6】It has traditionally been classified according to De Bakey and Stanford， and taking into account， the involvement or not of the ascending aorta. However， in recent years the involvement or not of the aortic arch from where the supra-aortic trunks depart has been increasingly taken into consideration. These two categorization systems are easy to use and have significantly helped in improving patient's management， independently from， whether they had a surgical or medical indication. However， as new therapeutic strategies have increased， those have become increasingly limited as they do not include factors that predict results and that could influence the decision-making process， particularly in patients with arterial branch involvement.\n\n【7】In untreated acute type “A”aortic dissection， mortality in the first 48 h is greater than 50%， and open surgical treatment is indicated. In contrast， the course of acute type “B”dissection is usually without complications， and medical treatment is widely accepted as the first option， with the endovascular technique (TEVAR) being the treatment of choice if complications develop 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，4]</u>.\n\n【8】In this sense，non-A non-B aortic dissection is characterized by being limited only to the aortic arch， or that it is affected by retrograde propagation starting distal to the left subclavian artery， without extension to the ascending aorta， which it is not it is included any of the traditional classifications.删除2换行cited.\n\nArch involvement is defined as retrograde extension of an intimal tear in the descending aorta(sparing the ascending aorta) or an intimal tear located in the aortic arch. In 1994， Von Segesser et al. were the first to highlight the failure of traditional DAA classifications to adequately account for the aortic arch； proposed the term “no A no B\" to refer to the involvement of the aortic arch in|删除段之间换行|dissections 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Four years later， Lansman et al. suggested a modified Stanford classification by adding a subcategory of aortic arch to type A and B dissections 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Since then， several studies have debated how to classify retrograde extension of a descending aortic dissection； however， the primary involvement of the aortic arch remained unresolved. Recently， Rylski et al. established a new classification that divided“non-A non-B”into downward entry and arch entry types通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. This definition was based on the location of the entry tear； the descending artery would be located distal to the left subclavian artery； which happens to located between the brachiocephalic trunk and the left subclavian artery from the arch.\n\n【10】Currently，there is not enough scientific evidence about its natural history， indications for surgery or treatment results. In fact， the latest guide for the management of aortic disease of the European Society of Cardiology does not mention this type of dissection 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Nowadays， treatment options are open surgery (with replacement of the standard aortic arch or frozen elephant trunk)， endovascular repair of the thoracic aorta (with chimney stent graft or extrathoracic surgical transposition of supra-aortic branches)， or a hybrid procedure (with debranching of the supra-aortic vessels next to a stent).\n\n【11】In this article we present the case of a patient with non-A non-B aortic dissection treated in our intensive care unit， commenting on his management and carrying out a brief narrative review of the literature.\n\n【12】Case Presentation\n\n【13】We present the case of a 56-year-old male， obese， smoker and active drinker with hepatic steatosis， without other known cardiovascular risk factors. He went to the emergency room due to stabbing central chest pain radiating to the back and high blood pressure of up to 200 mmHg systolic，accompanied by nausea. Urgent chest CT angiography was performed， where an aortic dissection of about 5 cm was observed， restricted to the aortic arch， between the exit of the brachiocelphalic trunk and the left carotid artery， without删除1换行extension to the ascending or descending aorta， classified as \"no A， no B\".，with no signs of rupture， dilatation or signs of malperfusion. He was admitted to the ICU where continuous perfusion of labetalol was started to control blood pressure and cardiac surgery was discussed， which decided on initial conservative management.\n\n【14】The patient had a stable evolution during the first days prior to surgery performed 72 h later， consisting of clamping of the proximal brachiocelphalic trunk and the left carotid artery， excision of the proximal aortic arch and ascending aorta up to a couple of centimeters distal to the sino-tubular junction and 26-mm branched tube end-to-end anastomosis. He leaves the pump in sinus rhythm， with a time of 283 min， anoxia time of 63 min， and a thermographic cerebral perfusion circulatory arrest of 54 min and total circulatory arrest of 5 min. He received a transfusion of red blood cells and from the recuperator and was transferred to the ICU with dobutamine， milrininone and norepinephrine at medium doses due to the development of biventricular dysfunction， especially the right one.\n\n【15】As incidents in the postoperative period， he developed left hemiplegia with hemineglect， with multiple ischemic foci in the right hemisphere of probable cardioembolic origin being observed on cranial CT， which progressively improved with antiplatelet therapy and rehabilitation， as well as acute renal parenchymal dysfunction， also improving.\n\n【16】Once on the floor， control CT angiography is performed； persistence of a penetrating ulcer is observed at the exit of the left common artery， assessed by vascular surgery， with conservative management.\n\n【17】The patient was discharged home a month after admission with only one admission a month later due to post-cardiotomy chest pain and moderate pleuropericardial effusion that resolved with corticosteroids and colchicine.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】In a meta-analysis， 88% of patients with non-A non-B dissection had a complicated course， which is a considerably higher proportion than that observed in type B dissection， signs of poor perfusion； defined as loss of blood supply to vital organs resulting in target organ ischemia； they were present in 29% of patients at admission， while 6% presented signs of contained rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Additionally，53%developed signs of poor perfusion and/or disease progression within2 weeks of diagnosis.\n\n【20】Medically treated patients had a 30-day mortality of 14%， which is significantly higher than type B dissection. Despite the limitations of high heterogeneity and relatively small sample size， there are important differences in the natural history of type B dissection and non-A non-B dissection.\n\n【21】The studies we found in the literature show that patients with non-A non-B dissections are more likely to require intervention to treat dissection-related complications. These results suggest that early intervention may be indicated in non-A non-B dissections.\n\n【22】It should be noted that the treatment of non-A non-B dissection poses some specific challenges for cardiac and vascular surgeons. Several studies show that the TEVAR techniques with extra thoracic surgical transposition of the supra-aortic branches or stack stent grafting were frequently adopted solutions (18% and36%， respectively). However， other studies have proposed adopting surgical treatments for “non-A， non-B”aortic dissections； which删除1换行showed that conservative treatment was associated with a higher mortality rate 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【23】In the analyzed studies， patients without poor organ perfusion， without aneurysm， and without aortic rupture were admitted to the intensive care unit for blood pressure control，hypertension， and pain management according to type B aortic dissection guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【24】However，those who presented poor organ perfusion according to clinical data (cold and Pulseless extremities， severe abdominal pain)， laboratory data (elevated serum lactate) or imaging data (collapsed true aortic lumen， dissected visceral arteries with a significantly narrowed true lumen due to thrombosed false lumen) or rupture were treated endovascularly or openly on an emergent basis.\n\n【25】Endovascular treatment involved endovascular thoracic aortic repair (TEVAR) with (TEVAR Zone 2) or without (TEVAR Zone3) carotid-subclavian bypass or transposition of the left carotid and left subclavian arteries (TEVAR Zone 1)， as well as isolated stent placement in dissected visceral arteries. The hybrid approach included sternotomy for supra-aortic vessel debranching with Dacron shunts anastomosed in the ascending aorta and TEVAR with stenting in the distal ascending aorta (TEVAR Zone 0) 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Open surgery included replacement of the aortic arch， generally using the frozen elephant trunk technique， or revascularization of poorly perfused organs with arterial bypasses.\n\n【26】For all these reasons， it is urgently necessary to project a new updated classification on the indication for surgical management of a dissection that only affects the aortic arch， and to carry out new studies to evaluate short-and long-term mortality.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】Non-A non-B aortic dissection is a rare entity within acute aortic syndrome， around 10%， where in the majority， the tear begins in the aortic arch.\n\n【29】It is necessary to increase the implementation of new classifications of aortic dissection in order to plan therapeutic measures and evaluate the prognosis.\n\n【30】Malperfusion syndrome， rupture and other complications删除1换行are more frequent than in type B dissection， so most require emergent surgical intervention. Most patients require aortic repair within the first few days.\n\n【31】Overall hospital mortality in patients with non-A non-B dissection is higher than in type B dissection but lower than in type A dissection， especially higher in those with emergent surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus with envelope belongs to the genus of B-coronavirus. It is the seventh kind of human coronavirus infections， closely related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)，characterized by lower respiratory infection. In the past 20 years， more than 10，000 cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection have been reported in the world 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV，SARS-CoV-2 has stronger infectivity. As of September2021， more than 200 million confirmed cases and more than 4 million deaths have been reported in the world 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Considering there are many infections of COVID-19 are asymptomatic， the total number of infections may larger 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. As we known， pregnant women are a vulnerable population who were more susceptible to viral infections.SARS-CoV orMERS-CoV infection during pregnancy could lead severe complications such as maternal death， stillbirth， spontaneous miscarriage， and so on. It has been reported that the mortality rate of SARS-CoV infection in pregnant women was|删除段之间换行|25% (10% of the general population)， while the mortality rate of pregnant women infected with MERS-CoV was as high as 37%通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2，5-7]</u>. Therefore， a SARS-CoV-2 screening method for pregnant women is required， especially to differentiate the asymptomatic from health pregnant women. The main mode of SARS-CoV-2 spread from person-to-person is through respiratory droplets， close contact and high concentration aerosol transmission. Vertical transmission is also reported occasionally. Some studies showed that a low proportion of newborns delivered from pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were infected with SARS-CoV-2， but most of them had no evidence of placental infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. A Sweden team reported a confirmed intrauterine vertical SARS-CoV-2 case with high viral load in placenta 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Therefore， the possibility of intrauterine transmission in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ignored. Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) based on cell-free DNA(cfDNA) which is present in maternal plasma has been introduced in routine pregnant examination 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Pregnant women in Changsha， Hunan could get free NIPT， benefitting from the financial support provided by the government's preferential policies. In this study， we present an approach of noninvasive prenatal testing of SARS-CoV-2(NIPT-SARS-CoV-2) to achieve the screening of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women during routine prenatal examination.\n\n【8】Materials and Methods\n\n【9】Study design\n\n【10】This study was approvedbythe Ethics Committee ofthe Changsha Hospital for Maternal and Child Health Care， Hunan， China. A total of 50 pregnant women were recruited from Changsha Hospital for Maternal and Child Health Care between July and September 2020for this study， in which 40 were NIPT negative and 10 were NIPT positive. The SARS-CoV-2RNA sample used in this study was from COVID-19 patients visited in the First Hospital of Changsha，Hunan， China. Written consent was obtained from all participants. An optimized NIPT was designed to detect fetal aneuploidy and SARS-CoV-2 at the same time.\n\n【11】Plasma separating and processing\n\n【12】First， peripheral blood of pregnant women was centrifuged at1，600 g for 10 min at 4-C. Second， the supernatant was transferred to 2.0 ml EP tubes， centrifuged again at 16，000 g for 10 min at 4C. Finally， the plasma was transferred to fresh tubes and immediately stored in -80-C， with 0.6 ml each tube. The separated plasma was divided equally into two parts， one was for extracting cfDNA， and the other was for extracting SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The plasma cfDNA was extracted by QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen， Germany). The plasma RNA was extracted by QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen， Germany)， and then was reverse transcripted to cDNA immediately by Fapon RNA-sep cDNA Synthesis Kit (Feipeng， China).\n\n【13】Library constructing and sequencing\n\n【14】The cfDNA and SARS-CoV-2 cDNA were mixed in equal proportion and were used as the input DNA to make the NIPT library. Three groups of libraries were set up， including negative group， trisomy positive group， and simulated SARS-CoV-2 group. The negative group library was prepared by cfDNA and SARS-CoV-2cDNA from NIPT negative pregnant women. The trisomy positive group library was prepared by cfDNA and SARS-CoV-2cDNA from NIPT positive pregnant women. The simulated SARS-CoV-2 group library was prepared by cfDNA from NIPT negative pregnant women删除1换行and SARS-CoV-2 cDNA from COVID-19 patients. Three different SARS-CoV-2 concentration gradients were set up in the simulated SARS-CoV-2 group， including 1，400 copies/ml， 14，000 copies/ml， and 140，000 copies/ml. Through end repairing， adding adapter， and PCR amplification to prepare the NIPT library， after quality control， the products were sequenced on the Ion Proton platform (Life Technologies，USA).\n\n【15】Data analysis\n\n【16】The Quality Control (QC) analysis was used to filtered the low-quality reads from raw sequencing data. The clean data were mapped to human genome 19 (hg19). The BAM files obtained were sorted and the PCR repeat reads were filtered. NIPT analysis software (Darui Biotechnology Co.， Ltd.， Guangzhou， China) was used to preform GC-bias correcting and Z-score calculating to determine the risk of fetal chromosome aneuploidy. When the Z-score >3 or <-3 of any chromosome showed that the fetal with high risk of fetal chromosome aneuploidy. At the same time， the clean data were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC045512.2)， and the low-quality reads (mapped length less than 60) were filtered. Then through calculating the number of mapped SARS-CoV-2 reads to determine whether there was SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【17】Statistical analysis\n\n【18】Paired t-test was used to compare the amount of data that generated by different methods， and Pearson correlation coefficient was used for data correlation analysis. All statistical analysis were performed using R3.5.1.\n\n【19】Result\n\n【20】Detection of fetal chromosome aneuploidy\n\n【21】NIPT analysis and SARS-CoV-2 analysis were performed for all samples. Negative NIPT result was confirmed in all cases in the negative group and simulated SARS-CoV-2 group， while positive NIPT result was confirmed in all cases in the trisomy positive group， including 4 cases for trisomy 21， 4 cases for trisomy 18， 1 case for trisomy 13， and 1 case for trisomy 21 combined with trisomy 13.20 clinical routine NIPT samples from Changsha Hospital for Maternal and Child Health Care were selected randomly to evaluate the sequencing data of the new technology of NIPT-SARS-CoV-2. The results demonstrated that there was no significant difference of total sequencing data in the two technologies， which indicated the new NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 could accurately analyze fetal chromosome aneuploidy without increasing the sequencing data.\n\n【22】Detection of SARS-CoV-2\n\n【23】SARS-CoV-2reads were detected in all cases in simulated SARS-CoV-2 group， with average 35 reads in 1400 copies group (range4-64)， average 337 reads in 14，000 copies group (range 252-464)， and average 2，759 reads in 140，000 copies group (range 2392-3220). None SARS-CoV-2 reads were detected in the negative group and trisomy positive group. Combined the NIPT result indicated that the new NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 could detect SARS-CoV-2 in the three concentration gradients without affecting the fetal chromosome aneuploidy analysis. The fewest number of SARS-CoV-2 reads only 4 in 1，400 copies group， suggesting that this method could accurately detect SARS-CoV-2 with a viral load of 1，400 copies/ml. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 reads in 1 million total reads was calculated to analysis the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 reads proportion and detected viral reads. The correlation coefficient删除1换行between the two up to 0.977， suggesting that the new NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 has potential for quantitative or semi-quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】Since the outbreak of COVID-19， asymptomatic infections have beenreported in manystudies 通用删除6(英):<u>[11-13]</u>.Asymptomatic infections mean who have no clinical symptoms and abnormalities in images but with positive detection of SARS-CoV-2. A study focuses on asymptomatic ratio showed that the incidence of asymptomatic was estimated to be 30.8% among 565 Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Asymptomatic infection is also existed in pregnant women. Another study investigated 675 pregnant women for delivery in three New York City hospitals found that 10.4% were positive for SARS-CoV-2and up to 78.6% of them were asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Some studies indicated that the viral load in asymptomatic infections is similar to COVID-19 patients， and the infectivity between the two has no significant difference， which signified asymptomatic infections may accelerate the spread of COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>[15-18]</u>. But it has great challenge to identify and control asymptomatic infections due to no obvious clinical manifestations with them. Screening high-risk populations is a possible effective measure to find asymptomatic. The new method NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 reported in this study can accurately analyze fetal chromosome aneuploidy and SARS-CoV-2 without increasing the sequencing data， and the virus load could low to 1，400 copies/ml.So that through this method SARS-CoV-2 can be detected for all pregnant women when they carry out the routine prenatal testing. In addition， detecting viral nucleic acid by peripheral blood can avoid the drawbacks of collecting nasopharyngeal swabs collection， such as the discomfort and psychological pressure to pregnant women， the exposure of healthcare staff. In this way， pregnant women with asymptomatic infection can be early recognized and controlled， which will be conducive to get the optimal management and treatment for them. The collection of upper respiratory specimens， especially nasopharyngeal swabs， has been widely used to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19. However， in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs， some researches show that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid can also be detected in other sites including sputum， feces， blood and other types of samples 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，20]</u>. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid can be detected in the blood of COVID-19 patients 2~3 days after onset， and there is even report shown that the same one COVID-19 patient with positive SARS-CoV-2 detection in blood samples， but no SARS-CoV-2 is detected in throat swabs， which suggesting that it is feasible and necessary to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by blood samples. Once virus infection occurs， although it takes a period of time to form toxemia or show obvious clinical symptoms， the nucleic acid fragments of virus degraded in the process of metabolism will enter the peripheral blood at an early stage. Therefore， the new technology NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 has the advantage of screening pregnant women carrying the virus in the early stage of infection. The diagnosis of COVID-19 mainly depends on clinical manifestations， epidemic history， CT imaging screening and etiology detection， among which etiology detection is the most accurate diagnosis scheme 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Etiology detection includes viral nucleic acid detection， antibody and antigen detection， and the viral gene detection by quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) is a priority test recommended by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. RT-qPCR can detect viral nucleic acids efficiently and rapidly， with high sensitivity and high specificity. But this method only can detect some specific viral gene regions， such删除1换行as Open reading frame 1 ab (ORFlab)， Nucleocapsid protein (N) and Envelope (E)， which may cause false negative due to the virus variant. Unlike RT-qPCR， the NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 can detect whole genome of the virus with low-depth sequencing， which can identify virus variants and trace the cryptic origins of the virus in theory. A recently study reported an intrauterine infection case of COVID-19， the puerperal and the newborn were infected with the same virus，but a variant of the virus occurred in the newborn a few days later 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. The researchers thought it might be caused by the contact with the external environment after birth， and the virus mutated surprisingly fast， which also suggested the importance of virus gene sequencing. In conclusion， the technology of NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 reported in this study can achieve the purpose of NIPT detection and SARS-CoV-2detection for pregnant women in the progress of routine prenatal testing by drawing only one tube of peripheral blood. In this way， SARS-CoV-2 screening can be performed for pregnant women， so that asymptomatic infections can be early recognized and controlled， which ensure the optimal management and treatment for pregnant women and newborns. In addition， it has the potential for monitoring virus variant and tracking virus transmission， which will be helpful for control the spread of this serious epidemic.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Infection， stone disease， primary bowel mass， and recurrent urothelial cell cancer are among the causes to consider. Here， we report a case of a 61 year old male who developed hematuria secondary to neobladder varices which was managed with TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt) and variceal embolization.\n\n【2】Keywords： Neobladder； Hematuria； TIPS； Cirrhosis； Bladder cancer； Varices\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The standard of care for muscle invasive bladder cancer is a radical cystectomy. While different urinary diversion techniques are utilized， an orthotopicneobladder allows the patient to utilize the natural orifice for urine drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. By utilizing bowel， neobladders are uniquely susceptible to pathologies associated with the gastrointestinal system as well as the genitourinary system 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. This creates a diagnostic problem in these patients when presenting with hematuria. This is a case report of a male with hepatic cirrhosis who developed hematuria from neobladder varices that was managed by TIPS and variceal embolization. To our knowledge， this is the first case of TIPS and variceal embolization being utilized to successfully stop hematuria in this setting.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nA 61 year old male with idiopathic hepatic cirrhosis who had undergone cystoprostatectomy for muscle invasive bladder cancer with ileal neobladder ten years prior presented with a one month history of hematuria. He maintained follow up after his original surgery as it was complicated by wound dehissence resulting in neobladder cutaneous fistula. It was eventually closed andhe was lost to follow up about 7 years ago. He reports that he was doing well in the interim until he developed hematuria but did not seek treatment until he developed clot retention and went to an outside hospital. There， he had cystoscopy which revealed diffuse mucosal hemorrhage. He continued to have hematuria requiring continuous bladder irrigation and blood transfusion so he was transferred to our academic institution. On presentation， he was actively hemorrhaging from his neobladder so he was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU). His liver function was compromised as he had Child Pugh class B cirrhosis with total bilirubin of1.5mg/dL， albumin at 2.4g/dL， prothrombin time of 16.7s， moderate ascites on CT scan， and no evidence of encephalopathy. After the patient received resuscitation， cystoscopy was performed to evacuate clots revealing hemorrhage emanating from multiple sites but no mucosal abnormalities indicative of neoplasm. CT angiogram did not show active extravasation but did show prominent varices surrounding the neobladder . During the diagnostic workup， he remained in the ICU as his hematuria persisted such that he received a total of 20 units of packed red blood cells， 6 units of platelets， and 8 units of fresh frozen plasma to maintain hemodynamic stability. The medical team's recommendation was to obtain hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement to assess the varices as a cause of the bleeding. His pressure gradient was found to be elevated at 19 mmHg (normal <5mmHg) so 10 mm TIPS endoprosthesis consisting of a nitinol stent with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft was placed lowering the gradient to 6 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> . Unfortunately， variceal flow remained retrograde and his bleeding continued 2 days later so embolization of the neobladder varices was performed with vascular coils and Amplatzer plugs . Subsequently， his|删除段之间换行|Discussion\n\nHematuria as a result of neobladder varices is a rare entity. Review of the literature only revealed one other case. That patient was unsuccessfully treated with diathermy of the mucosa at the sites of hemorrhage resulting in his death 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Additionally， there is a handful|删除段之间换行|of case reports of patients who developed hematuria from varices associated with an ileal conduit. Two of these were successfully treated by a TIPS procedure while another was managed by revision ofthe conduit and ligation of the varix 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>.\n\n【8】Although very few cases have been reported， the etiology of the bleeding suggests this pathology carries a high risk of death. In the current case， the patient was improved a combination of TIPS and variceal embolization. Additionally， he benefitted from having relatively preserved liver function in the face of cirrhosis severe enough to induce varices and ascites.\n\n【9】Conclusion删除1换行varices. The difficulty associated with managing patients who develop hematuria from varices mandates that liver function and cirrhotic state are factored in when considering type of urinary diversion. Based off the limited number of case reports available， ileal conduit may be a safer option in these patients as management of hematuria from the varices appears to be more successful. Although many factors influence the overall survival of a patient with muscle invasive bladder cancer considering radical cystectomy， underlying hepatic disease must be included. We present a treatment option for patients who develop hematuria as a result of portal hypertension induced neobladder varices.\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1.

Patients with cachexia are likely to experience reduced quality of life and survival. Timely and effective intervention can reverse cachexia and improve the clinical outcome of patients. This patient was diagnosed as esophageal cancer， accompanied by cachexia， esophageal fistula， anemia and hypoproteinemia. After combination therapy， including nutritional support， metabolic regulation， anti-tumor treatment and symptomatic treatment， the patient’s symptoms were significantly relieved， and cachexia was reversed. The quality of life was improved tumor was significantly reduced.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】The clinical incidence of cancer cachexia is relatively high. Epidemiological study of more than 40，000 tumor patients in China shows that the incidence of cachexia is as high as 37% 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>， which is higher in digestive system tumors than in other tumors. In another systematic review， the prevalence of 5-year cachexia at risk is estimated about 30% in all cancer patients in the USA and EU 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. It is well known that cachexia is to be associated with decreased quality of life， reduced tolerance to anti-tumor therapy and reduced survival. Hence， there is a large unmet clinical need for therapy of cachexia. Most patients diagnosed esophageal cancer are already in locally advanced stage or have distant metastasis， and suffer from cachexia and various complications. Without timely and effective intervention， the quality of life and prognosis of those patients will be seriously affected 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. As a special malnutrition state， cancer cachexia is characterized by persistent skeletal muscle loss， with or without loss of adipose tissue， often accompanied by anorexia， fatigue， anemia， hypoproteinemia， electrolyte imbalance， infection， etc. Meanwhile， it is accompanied by gradual damage to the functions of the heart， lungs and other organs. The pathophysiology is characterized by abnormal metabolism and negative balance of protein and energy caused by reduced intake. It is a multi-factor syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【4】Cancer cachexia has its own characteristics and pathophysiological mechanism. It cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support. However， cancer cachexia does not refer to the end-stage ofthe disease， but can occur in any stage of malignant tumor， including newly diagnosed， postoperative and end-stage patients. Timely and effective intervention can partially reverse the disease， and then improve the clinical outcome of such patients.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 54-year-old man， went to the hospital because of \"choking on food for more than 2 months\"in June 2022. Contrast-enhanced CT of chest and abdomen showed significant thickening of the esophageal wall in the middle and lower segments， suggesting esophageal cancer. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were found in the right cervical root， mediastinum， right hilum， gastric cardia. Esophagography showed the middle and lower esophagus wall was stiff and irregular filling defect. Besides，the mucosa was destroyed， interrupted and disappeared. The length of the lesion was about16 cm， and local mediastinal fistula was possible. Gastroscopy showed an irregular raised neo-organism 25 cm away from the incisor teeth， full of lumen， narrow lumen， the endoscopic body could not pass through， surface erosion and necrosis， easy to bleed when touched.\n\n【7】Gastroscopic pathology： Well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.

In view of the poor general condition of the patient at admission， anti-tumor therapy was not tolerated， and the efficacy of nutritional support alone wan not good effective. Thus， a \"comprehensive treatment strategy\" was adopted for this patient， including： 1) nutritional support： Naso-enteral nutrition tube was|删除段之间换行|On July 15h， 2022， the patient went to the hospital again， and his weight did not change significantly. PG-SGA score： Grade B (7points). After admission， the angiogram showed that the esophageal lesions was better than before， and the esophageal mediastinal fistula was obvious. The gastroscope showed that the mucosa was stiff 20 cm to 38 cm from the incisor teeth， a new protuberant creature could be seen on the periesophageal wall 30 cm to 37 cm， and a fistula with a diameter of about 4 mm could be seen at 35 cm. The naso-intestinal nutrition tube was placed again， and \"comprehensive treatment\" was given. The original scheme was treated for one cycle on July 174，2022. After discharge， the patient received total enteral nutrition treatment (1400 ml/d). During this period， diarrhea occurred， about 5 to 7 times a day. There was no abdominal pain and mucus bloody stool. On August 7h， 2022， he was admitted to the hospital due to \"cough， expectoration with chest tightness and asthma after activities\"， and his body weight dropped by 4.4 kg over two weeks (the weight loss rate was about 9%). Physical examination： Emaciated and anemic appearance， naso-intestinal tube in position， thick breath sound of both lungs， audible moist rales， heart rate 102 times/min， regular rhythm， others were negative. On August 84， 2022， chest and abdomen CT showed that the middle and lower esophageal wall was thickened， and the esophageal wall was significantly thinner than that in the front. The consolidation area of the adjacent right posterior mediastinum was narrowed. There were multiple enlarged lymph nodes near thetrachea， in the mediastinum， andattherightpulmonary hilum， and some of them were smaller than that in the front； Multiple|删除段之间换行|inflammation of both lungs with bronchiectasis.

The patient was given anti-infection， enteral nutrition(1400 ml/d， pay attention to temperature， speed and gradient)，删除1换行anti-diarrhea， metabolic regulation， anti-anxiety， and symptomatic treatment of sleep adjustment. The patient's symptoms improved significantly. On August 13h， 2022， the patient was discharged after one cycle of anti-cancer treatment with the original protocol. On August 25h， 2022， the patient’s naso-intestinal tube fell off outside the hospital and he did not go to the hospital. He ate by mouth without obvious cough， choking， pain and discomfort. On September 4，2022， his body weight increased from 44.5 kg to 54.3 kg， and skeletal muscle mass also increased significantly . Imaging showed that esophageal lesions were improved and esophagotracheal fistula was not obvious . On September 7h， 2022 and September30h， 2022， the patients were treated with the original regimen for 2cycles. Nutrition evaluation on October 25\"， 2022： PG-SGA： Grade B(2points)，weight 60.1 kg， soft food taken orally to meet the nutritional requirements， anemia improved， albumin and prealbumin gradually returned to normal and maintained. The inflammatory indexes CPR， IL-6 and N/L gradually decreased from high to normal. On October26h，2022， chest and abdomen CT： The volume of esophageal lesions decreased， and most of the multiple lymph nodes were smaller than before， and lung infections also improved significantly； Evaluate PR. He continued the original scheme on October 26h and November 17hh， 2022. Now， he has a good quality of life tolerance to anti-tumor.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Cancer cachexia is a kind of malnutrition and metabolic disorder characterized by \"calorie-protein deficiency malnutrition\". It originates from the insufficient intake and absorption of calories and nutrients in the patient's body， as well as the complex nutrient metabolic disorder and consumption caused by the stress state of the body and the production of various pro-decomposition cytokines by the tumor tissue. Under the joint action of the body and the tumor， the negative balance of protein and energy is eventually caused， and the body presents a state of cachexia 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. Most patients are accompaniedbyhypoproteinemia，anemia， infection， gastrointestinal dysfunction and so on. Muscle loss caused by progressive skeletal muscle loss is the main cause of its clinical symptoms and poor prognosis. Conventional nutritional support and drug treatment are difficult to improve the nutritional metabolism disorder of patients with cancer cachexia， so the effect is poor and the progress of anti-cachexia is slow删除4-1:<u>71</u>.\n\n【18】The key to improve and reverse the cachexia is to attack the tumor load， effectively reduce the metabolic activity of tumor tissue， and control the inflammatory state of the body. However， patients with cachexia usually cannot tolerate conventional anti-tumor drug treatment. So，treatment needs to take into account a variety of issues. Clinically， \"comprehensive treatment\" strategies are usually used to reverse cancer cachexia， including antitumor therapy， nutritional support， metabolic regulation therapy， repair and maintenance of gastrointestinal function， palliative therapy， psychological therapy and exercise. Our team includes medical staff and dietitians from the department of oncology and clinical nutrition and metabolism therapy. The \"comprehensive treatment\"strategies are used to reverse cachexia. The clinical effect was satisfactory， and a new treatment plan was explored for the treatment of cancer cachexia. When this patient was admitted to the hospital， his general condition was poor， and there were many complications. He was given active nutritional support (mainly in the intestine， maximize the use of intestinal function， and maintain the intestinal barrier function)，删除1换行metabolic regulation treatment (combined use of multiple metabolic regulators)， symptomatic reduction and psychological support. After the patient's symptoms improved， he was given anti-tumor treatment for etiology. During this period， the patient suffered from diarrhea due to poor method of parenteral nutrition outside the hospital and cachexia was caused again， which was reversed after active“comprehensive treatment\". At present， the nutritional status of the patient is good， and the fistula is basically healed. There is no cough and infection through oral eating. The improvement of nutritional status is helpful to the healing of the fistula. In oncology， esophageal lesions were significantly improved and lymph nodes were shrunk. PR was evaluated. The tumor index SCC decreased to normal and maintained. Body weight increased 11.2 kg and muscle mass increased 4.4 kg from baseline. Anemia index improved， albumin and prealbumin significantly improved to normal， and inflammation index improved. The general condition and nutritional status were significantly improved， and the tolerance of anti-tumor treatment was good. At present，he continues the original anti-tumortreatment. The objective of improving the quality of life and prolonging the survival period of patients is achieved.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\nThe high incidence of cancer cachexia is one of the main causes of death. Most patients have poor physical strength， and conventi nutritional support is difficult to reverse. Most patients cannot tolerate conventional anti-tumor treatment. It is important to accurately understand the mechanism of energy nutrient metabolism disorder and make correct nutritional diagnosis. Effective anti-tumor treatment provides basic guarantee for the improvement of abnormal metabolic status， and good nutritional status is the premise to ensure the smooth progress of anti-tumor. Metabolic regulation treatment can reverse the nutritional status of tumor patients， reduce chemotherapy induced toxicity， and improve chemotherapy tolerance and efficacy. The maintenance of gastrointestinal function provides an input way for nutritional support and reduces the risk of infection. Psychological regulation and physical activity can improve the patient's mood and promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function. Reducing consumption and symptomatic treatment can improve the patient's quality oflife|删除段之间换行|In conclusion， primary disease treatment is the premise， and nutritional support is the basis. Metabolic regulation is the key， and inhibition of inflammation is fundamental. A variety of treatment methods should be taken into account to reverse cancer cachexia and improve the quality of life and survival of patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The physical examination revealed a palpable mass at the right lobe of the thyroid gland without any palpable cervical lymph nodes. All the laboratory tests including the thyroid hormones were normal.\n\nThe ultrasound (US) revealed a 33 x 20 mm hypoechoic nodule on the right lobe of the thyroid gland without any cervical lymph node enlargement. There were some other nodules with a variety|删除段之间换行|of dimensions on the left lobe suggesting a multinodular goitre.\n\n【12】FNAB was performed from the dominant nodule with the guidance of US. The FNAB was efficient with enough amount of glands.\n\n【13】In the cytopathology report there was a suspicion of neuro-endocrine tumor.These findings were explained to the patient， her consent was taken and a Total Thyroidectomy (TT) was planned due to suspicious FNAB report and multinoduler goitre.\n\n【14】In the operation the nodule was found to be fixed to the adjacent trachea. During the dissection on the trachea of the right thyroidlobe， a laceration of the trachea happened. Perioperative Ear Nose Throat(ENT) consultation was done and the defect was primarily repaired by the surgical team. Both recurrent nerves were seen and preserved and TT was completed.\n\n【15】In the final histopathology report； grossly the tumor was found to be emerging from the thyroid gland. It was ill defined. On the cut section， it was red-brown in color and soft in consistency， size was 3.0x2.5x2.0 cm.\n\n【16】Histologic sections were prepared from routinely fixed paraffin-embedded tissue， cut at 3 to 4um.

S-100 staining demonsrated the presence of sustantacular cells at the periphery of tumor nests. The pathologic diagnose was thyroid paraganglioma (TP).\n\n【20】Patient was discharged on postoperative day two. Later on that developed wound infection and apse formation at day 7 post-operatively was treated with drainage and dressing of wound in our out-patient clinic.\n\n【21】Screening ofthe patient 29 months after the surgery wasperformed and no metastasis or local recurrences were seen in the ultrasound and PET scan (F-18 FDG). Tests performed for the detection of catecholamine secretion； serum and 24 hours urine adrenaline， noradrenaline， dopamine， metanephrine， normetanephrine， vanyl mandelic acid， 5 HIAA were found to be in normal limits. The thyroglobuline and anti-thyroglobuline levels were 1，45 ng/mL通用删除7(英):<u>(1，60-59，9)</u> and <1，0 IU/mL通用删除7(英):<u>(0-4)</u> respectively. The patient is still being followed up in 6 months periods and using 100 mcg./day L-thyroxin PO.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Although the TP accounts for the 0.1 % of all the thyroid neoplasms， this tumor must be remembered in the differential diagnosis of the thyroid cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【24】The FNAB cannot be diagnostic in all cases preoperatively but sometimes like in our case may give an idea about the suspicion of a TP. Generally final pathology reports after the resection of the tumor will give the definitive diagnosis. For the accurate diagnosis of the pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas， both pathologists and the clinicians must communicate properly. The importance of this multidisciplinary approach has been popularized in recent studies. Also an algorithm has been designed for the diagnosis of these cases通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The paragangliomas can rarely be diagnosed by the radiologic investigations and even diagnosis is difficult after the FNAB of the nodule 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. They can be easily be confused with the other thyroid malignancies.\n\n【25】The diagnose frequently cannot be made during the surgery with frozen sections and the differential diagnosis includes primarily the medullary thyroid cancer and the other types of thyroid cancers. Only 1 of the frozen sections performed in 22 patients made the paraganglioma diagnosis. In 10 of these cases diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma and in 3 of the cases follicular carcinoma diagnosis删除1换行were made by the frozen section 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>.\n\n【26】The immunohistochemical stains applied has a major role in the differential diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，12-14]</u>. The Chromogranin A， NSE， Synaptophysin and S-100 will demonstrate the staining around the Sustantacular cells. The S-100 staining however is not to specific for the paragangliomas. It can be seen in the Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC) too. Thus makes the diagnosis complex 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In this case， paraganglioma presented as a mass located within the thyroid gland. When present in such location， the main differential diagnosis was MTC. On histologic examination， TP and MTC may show similar microscopic features， with nesting. The co-expression of neuroendocrine markers makes the distinction far more complicated. MTC originates in the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid gland. Therefore， MTC is characterized by positive staining with Calcitonin. The positivity of epithelial markers and lack of S-100 positive sustantecular cells also facilitate the differential diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，12-14]</u>.\n\n【27】They have a high tendency to invade (in two out of three cases) adjacent structures like； trachea， recurrent nerves and vascular structures. The extensive resection is generally enough for the treatment of these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. The tumor was strictly attached to the tracheal cartilages but any tracheal resection was not performed in our patient.\n\n【28】The genetic mutations are reported in about %10 of the paragangliomas. It is recommended to screen the patients for the succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB)， C(SDHC)，D (SDHD) or SDH assembly factor 2 (SDHAF2) gene mutations. Especially it is known that the SDHB mutation is important in diagnosing the malignant paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. We did not perform a genetic screening.\n\n【29】In the literature there is no reported case of metastatic or catecholamine producing thyroid paraganglioma 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. But still it is advised to follow up those patients for the risk of metastasis and catecholamine production 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Screening of the patient 29 months after the surgerywas performed and no metastasis or local recurrences were seen in the ultrasound and PET scan (F-18FDG). Serum and 24hours urine tests were normal for the catecholamine and degradation products.\n\n【30】Conclusion\n\n【31】TP must be consideredin differential diagnosis of the neuroendocrine tumors of the thyroid. FNAB is helpful but not always diagnostic for a neuroendocrine tumor. Generally they are local invasive to the adjacent structures. Extensive resection and close follow up is the treatment of choice because their malignancypotential is still not exactly known.

Following proper diagnostic workup that includes bronchoscopy and histopathological examination of tissue biopsied， the involved tracheal segment was surgically resected followed by reconstruction and involved field radiotherapy.\n\n【2】Keywords： Adenoid cystic carcinoma； Stridor； Pulmonology； OPD\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】A 34 year old traffic warden， non smoker with no relevant personal history presented in Pulmonology OPD with complaints of worsening of noisy breathing for the last two years. He was alright about 12 years back when he felt this noisy breathing first time and he visited local physician. He was labeled as a case of “Bronchial Asthma\" and advised some treatment that he quit just after taking two to three doses as he got relief. Since then he felt similar issues intermittentlyand took some home remedies to control this symptom. From last 3 years， this issue (noisy breathing/stridor) worsened and he visited ENT specialist. He was labeled as a case of“chronic sinusitis”despite he had no nasal symptoms and advised treatment accordingly. He remained symptomatic and presented to general physician， who， after examining him， advised a CT SCAN chest . With that CT scan， he presented in Pulmonology OPD. On examination he had audible stridor with no other significant findings. CT scan， that he was carrying， showed mass at level of upper trachea with marked luminal narrowing. He was admitted and scheduled for bronchoscopy that showed \"multi-lobulated mass in the upper segment of trachea\"， that revealed\"Adenoid cystic carcinoma of trachea\" on histopathology . Thoracic surgeon was consulted and advised to get CT scan neck and chest with reconstruction images that was done  and was referred for surgery.

He was under radiotherapy currently and resumed his duties.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Adenoid Cystic/adenoid cystic carcinoma or cylindroma of the trachea is a relatively rare occurrence. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is second to squamous cell carcinoma among tracheal malignant neoplasms， and has a nature of long clinical course and less malignant potential. ACC of trachea is reported.

{"seq_id": "ada85280-1e3d-4b9a-b781-4ecee3f96cda", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Epithelioid Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor (EMPNST) is a rare variant of an already rare sarcoma， Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor (MPNST). Approximately 5% of MPNSTs are EMPNSTs.EMPNST is similar to MPNST in that they are both of neural origin. Histologically， EMPNST differs in that its cells are epithelioid in nature. EMPNST has a specific histologic marker profile which is diffusely positive for S100 & SOX-10 with alack of expression ofINI-1. In this study， we present the case of a 30-year-old female with a non-locally invasive EMPNST who underwent wide local surgical excision. Research is limited in this disease process and management of these neoplasms is not structured or standardized. Wide local excision currently remains the mainstay of treatment and chemoradiation is an option for advanced or metastatic disease.\n\n【2】Keywords： Epithelioid Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor； Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor； Excision\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST) are considered a rare form of sarcoma which originate from peripheral nerves or from cells associated with the nerve sheath， such as Schwann cells or fibroblasts 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Also known as malignant schwannomas， the incidence of MPNSTs is approximately 3% to 10% of malignant soft tissue tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. MPNST is considered to be an aggressive soft tissue tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. MPNSTs are， for the most part， bulky， deep-seated tumors， which often form in the neck， extremities or buttocks 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Generally speaking， half of MPNST's present de novo and half are related to Neurofibromatosis type I(NF-1)通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【5】Prognosis of patients with these MPNST nerve sheath tumors is decreased in certain circumstances including the presence of neurofibromatosis， tumor size， excisional margins，site and depth of tumor location.In patients with a tumor size >5 cm it seems that tumor recurrence and metastases is increased 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，7]</u>. On the other hand， there seems to be no difference in prognosis on the basis of male to female 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，8-10]</u>.\n\n【6】EMPNST differs from conventional MPNST in that it shows diffuse positivity for S-100 staining and is rarely associated with NF1. Loss of expression for INI-1 marker is found in up to two thirds of patients diagnosed with EMPNST 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. These tumors can stain positively for neuron-specific enolase but will lack melanoma-associated antigen and cytokeratin 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. For an unknown reason， most EMPNST will arise within a pre-existing schwannoma. The differential diagnosis of EMPNST includes melanoma， clear cell sarcoma， epithelioid sarcoma and carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【7】Histologically speaking， EMPNST will show an epithelioid pattern consistent with large epithelioid cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. They will have rhabdoid cytology and will simulate carcinoma or a melanoma. Many are seen to have a characteristic nodularity with cords and strands with rounded epithelioid cells with prominent nucleoli 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\nWe present the case of a 30-year-old black female with no significant past medical history other than 2 C-sections， who presented to our clinic with complaints of a protruding mass on her lower back. The mass had grown slowly over time at the site of her last epidural which was 3 years prior. The mass itself was non tender， irritation was present with certain clothing but due to its location and increasing size， the patient requested surgical removal. The patient had no history of cancer|删除段之间换行|or radiation exposure. Family history was positive for cancer on her father's side， but was unaware of any specific details regarding that history. Physical exam revealed a large 3 cm × 4 cm x 1 cm pedunculated exophytic mass roughly at the level of L4. The mass was non-tender with a firm and rubbery texture on palpation. There was no erythema， induration， or other signs of infection. The patient had no similar masses or skin lesions elsewhere. The initial differential diagnosis was lipoma vs. acrochordon. The patient was scheduled for elective surgical excision. In the operating room， a wide elliptical incision was made along the vertical axis of the spine using a 15 blade scalpel. The soft tissue was dissected using electrocautery until normal appearing subcutaneous adipose tissue was encountered. The mass was then excised en bloc. The subcutaneous tissue was approximated using a simple interrupted stitch with 3-0 Vicryl suture and the epidermis was closed using an interrupted horizontal mattress stitch with 2-0 nylon. Post operatively， the excision site healed well without any complications. Gross pathology revealed a 4.0 cm x3.0 cmx1.8cm mass weighing 16.0 grams . Located centrally within the specimen is a 3.5 cm x 2.5 cm x2.5 cm subcutaneous lobulated mass with the nearest margin being 0.2 cm. Immunohistochemical stains were performed with the results shown in Table 1通用删除6(英):<u>[13-18]</u>， which also highlights a description and some of the common uses of each stain.\n\nWith this initial stain pattern， the diagnosis was indeterminate. The pathologist recommended an outside pathology consultation with the Cleveland Clinic for further evaluation and confirmation. At the Cleveland Clinic， additional immunostains included smooth muscle actin， EMA， BRAF and INI-1. The mass showed weak|删除段之间换行|immuno-activity against EMA， as well as loss of nuclear expression of INI-1. No significant activity was seen for the other tumor markers. Based on their evaluation， the diagnosis of epithelioid MPNST was made with the following features： mitotic rate of 3/10 HPF， no necrosis noted， histologic grade 2 with negative margins， and no lymphovascular identified.\n\n【11】With the diagnosis of EMPNST， the patient was referred to an oncologist for recommendations on chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. A CT scan of the chest， abdomen and pelvis was done for staging purposes. The scans did not reveal any evidence of metastasis or lymphadenopathy and therefore， no adjuvant therapy was indicated. With the narrow margin of 0.2 cm， a discussion was had regarding re-excision， however， the patient elected for close clinical follow up with the oncologist and surgeon.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】The reason for presentation to a surgical clinic for an EMPNST will either be for cosmetic reasons or because there is associated pain. Generally， a patient will present with a new onset mass. The patient in our case presented with a mass that caused irritation while wearing certain types of clothing.\n\n【14】Diagnosis of an EMPNST is generally done via a tissue biopsy. There are several reports in the literature of cases that successfully diagnosed EMPNST with fine needle aspiration. Whether it is better to arrive at a diagnosis through wide local excision or FNA is not clear. Many of these neoplasms will most likely be diagnosed through wide local excision. Treatment of EMPNST has generally been carried out by wide local excision. Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment for non-locally invasive or metastatic disease. Several papers have删除表格换行outlined their treatments of similarlesions. Tomohiro et al. presented a case of a 62 year old male without neurofibromatosis with advanced EMPNST showing complete response with combination of wide local excision and chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Their patient presented initially with a large fungating foot lesion. Ten weeks after initial excision the patient presented with lung nodules on computed tomography. The patient was treated with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy using doxorubicin (60 mg/m’) and ifosfamide (7.5 g/m). The patient received two doses as well as surgical resection of remaining lesions in lower lung fields. The lesions were confirmed metastatic EMPNST. Complete response was noted after the patient had completed four rounds of chemotherapy in combination with resection of the pulmonary lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. This case highlights the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy for highly aggressive metastatic EMPNST. Since EMPNST is an aggressive lesion with metastasis commonly， chemotherapy should be a considered to provide complete response. Considering that MPNST is a rare tumor and EMPNST is only 5%of these tumors， there is little standardization of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. The optimal excision margins have not been standardized as of yet. With our patient， the margins were 0.2 cm. Efficacy of radiation therapy and chemotherapy have yet to be determined as well. It seems that further research and standardization needs to be achieved for this rare condition.\n\n| Table 1： Results， description and common uses of initial immunochemical stains used.  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Stain  | Result  | Description  | Use  |  |\n| S100  | Positive  | Multigenic group of non ubiquitous cytoplasmic EF- hand Ca+-binding proteins.  | S100 is commonly used as a marker of neural tissue and melanomas 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.  |  |\n| SOX-10  | Positive  | Transcription factor known to be crucial in thespecification of the neural crest and maintenance ofSchwann cells and melanocytes  | Melanoma marker.

Considering the disease tends to metastasize to lungs and other distant organs， it would be pertinent to perform aggressive surveillance early on in both MPNST and EMPNST with computed tomography for screening of recurrence. Regular physical exams at intervals of 3， 6 and 12 months of the surgical site as well as lymph node examination of draining sites would be prudent.

Thirteen of the patients received chemotherapy and/or radiation. Twenty-two patients had no evidence of disease at time of follow-up. Nine patients developed local recurrence. Five patients developed distant metastases and four patients died of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. This review emphasizes the aggressive behavior of this neoplasm. Distant metastasis is common and the treating team should be aware. Post-op surveillance should be mandatory. This brings up an important question which tries to identify what screening interval should be used. Also， considering distant metastasis is common， would these patients benefit from interval computed tomography or other imaging modality?\n\n【17】In an article by Kar M et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>， twenty-four cases of MPNST were reviewed. Ten cases had relapsed. Eight out of the ten cases showed relapse within the first two years of their treatment. Also， the overall survival and disease-free survivals were 58% and 38%， respectively， with median disease-free period of 17 months. EMPNST删除2换行and MPNST are closely related， and this paper points out that many cases of metastases occurred within two years. Considering the disease tends to metastasize to lungs and other distant organs， it would be pertinent to perform aggressive surveillance early on in both MPNST and EMPNST with computed tomography for screening of recurrence. Regular physical exams at intervals of 3， 6and 12 months of the surgical site as well as lymph node examination of draining sites would be prudent. History including symptoms of new onset shortness of breath or other respiratory symptoms should be performed. New onset abdominal pain would raise suspicions for abdominal metastases. History and physical examinations could be increased to 1-year intervals， and it should be stressed to the patient that loss of follow up could be detrimental. 5-year disease free survival of MPNST is 38% in certain studies and emphasizes the importance of follow-up and surveillance 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. CT scan of the chest， abdomen and pelvis could also be completed at regular intervals. Whether this should be done at yearly intervals or more frequent is uncertain. In a study by Kim A et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> the importance of whole-body MRI as surveillance for high grade MPNST is emphasized. Another article by Reilly KM et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> emphasizes a similar concept of whole-body MRI for surveillance of MPNST recurrences. Would whole body MRI be a useful modality for surveillance in EMPNST as well? A review of the literature found very little information， if any， on the matter. Considering the close relationship between the two entities it could be of importance.\n\n【18】Considering the diagnosis and size of our patient’s tumor size and the malignant nature of these neoplasms， follow up would be highly recommended as emphasized above including history and physical exams at increasing intervals. The patient could also benefit from more frequent imaging at 6 months， 12 months， and yearly thereafter. This would be beneficial as most metastases seem to occur before 2years and the 5 year overall disease free survival is low in high risk patients.\n\n【19】Prognosis of patients with these nerve sheath tumors is worse in certain circumstances including patient with concomitant neurofibromatosis， increased tumor size， positive excisional margins， site and increased depth of tumor location 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In patients with tumor size >5 cm it seems that tumor recurrence and metastases is increased通用删除6(英):<u>[2，7]</u>. There seems to be no difference in prognosis on the basis of male to female 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-10]</u>. Having said all this， biological behavior and prognosis of EMPNST is less clear than that of MPNST. Malignant删除1换行peripheral nerve sheath tumors are prone to locally recur， are highly malignant and commonly metastasize.\n\n【20】EMPNST will stain diffusely positive for S100 and will generally stain negative for INI-1 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. This is in contrast to the much more studied MPNST which will stain positive for CD99/013 (86%)，S100， and CD57.MPNST will also stain negative for EMA， Keratin and CD19 in most cases. Histologically， EMPNST will differ in appearance from MPNST. MPNST will show monomorphic serpentine cells， palisading， large gaping vascular spaces， and geographic necrosis with tumor palisading at edges which resembles a glioblastoma multiforme. These will also have glandular differentiation and melanin in the tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】MPNST and EPMNST differ in terms of their origin as well as their histologic and immunochemical staining properties. They are closely related， but the latter is a rarer presentation. EMPNST will stain diffusely positive for S-100 protein and will show loss of INI-1 expression. More research needs to be done on this neoplasm as there is no standardization of management and follow up long term. Generally， they can be treated with wide local excision. However， advanced cases should be treated with a combination of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. If the disease is large preoperatively， neoadjuvant chemo-radiation can be beneficial. Postoperatively， patients should undergo regular follow-up with history， physical exam and imaging studies. Imaging modalities such as computed tomography and whole-body MRI are possible modalities of benefit. Distant metastasis is of concern for EMPNST and tends to present within 2 years of initial treatment. Intervals should be regular and more frequent early on. Very little research has been done on the rare entity of EMPNST. Much standardization needs to be achieved in terms of treatment including minimal margins， indications for chemotherapy and radiation， dosing and timing. Further research and standardization for postoperative surveillance including exact modality and timing would improve the management of this rare condition.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Although there are many treat options， they can only relieve symptoms， but not can modify the disease. Moreover， conventional treatment has limitations because of its adverse events. Therefore， it is necessary that development of Disease Modifying OA Drugs (DMOADs) with low adverse effects. To evaluate the effects of Membrane-Free Stem Cell Extract (MFSCE) on the clinical signs and cartilage regeneration of OA dogs. Thirty privately owned dogs with OA were separated into two groups；placebotreated group (n=6)， MFSCE treated group (n=22). All dogs were injected MFSCE or placebo once a week for 4 weeks in intra-articular. To evaluate the symptoms， dogs and owners were visit hospital at day 0， 7，14，21， and 28. The effect of MFSCE on pain relief was evaluated using pain score and pain at palpation score. Both symptoms were improved in MFSCE treated group while no significant changes in placebo treated group after 4 weeks treatment. The effect of MFSCE on physical function improvement was evaluated using behavior score， standing score， walking score， lameness score， and weight bearing score. All symptoms were improved in MFSCE treated group while no significant changes in placebo treated group after 4 weeks treatment. The effects of MFSCE on joint structure were evaluated using radiographic score. Joint structure was improved in MFSCE treated group while no significant changes in placebo treated group after 4 weeks treatment. There were no changes on general symptoms， symptoms of lesion， adverse events or general symptoms that can be occurred by injection，hematological parameter， and urinal parameters. Overall， these results， MFSCE could be the first-in-class DMOAD.\n\n【2】Keywords： Osteoarthritis； Membrane-free stem cell extract； Adipose-derived stem cells； Anti-inflammatory drugs\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Arthritis， defined as the disease affect to joints， is commonly occurred in both human and animals 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Clinical symptoms of arthritis are included swelling， deformities， pain and stiffness of joint 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Dogs show high prevalence of arthritis due to excessive exercise， injury， and genetic predisposition. It was reported that 25% of 77.2 million dogs has arthritis in United States 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Arthritis is separated via etiology to Osteoarthritis (OA)， Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)， Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)， Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and Septic Arthritis (SA) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. It is reported that， OA， chronic joint degenerative disease， is most common disease among the arthritis in dogs 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>. Pathological symptoms of OA shown to be various symptoms such as progressive loss and destruction of articular cartilage， inflammation of synovium， and degeneration of ligaments and menisci of the knee etc.，通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【5】There are some treatment options to treat the OA in dogs 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Weight loss， exercise modification， and physical therapy can use as non-pharmaceutical therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. In the severe dogs， surgery can be used for treatment. For the pharmaceutical therapy， Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs(NSAIDs) were used as standard therapy. However，NSAIDs has some limitations because of its adverse effects such as gastrointestinal ulceration 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. There are other pharmaceuticaloptions such as diacerein， corticosteroids，and hyaluronic acid. However，these pharmaceuticals also had limitations because they had also adverse effect and they been only relieving symptoms but not modifying disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Therefore， many studies are conducted to development of alternative products which enhanced efficacy and safety.\n\n【6】The stem cell， which considered for new therapeutic strategy of OA， defined as undifferentiated删除1换行multipotent cell 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>. Among the various stem cells， Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (ADSC)， which divided from human adipose tissue， has been gotten attention because of its various advantages such as accessibility and abundance compared with other stem cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Recent studies have provided some evidence that ADSCs are effective in the treatment of OA. Kriston-Pal et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> reported that intra-articular injection of allogenic ADSC with hyaluronan into OA dog shown the effect of lameness improvement and hyaline-type cartilage regeneration. However， there are some limitations such as instability of chondrocyte-like phenotypes， limited replicative lifespan， etc.，通用删除6(英):<u>[14-201</u>. To overcome these limitation， various studies in progressed.\n\n【7】To overcome limitation of stem cell therapy， we developed Membrane-Free Stem Cell Extract (MFSCE)， which consist with252 peptides using patented technology about removing the cellular membrane of ADSC and purifying the peptides. In the previous studies， we identified the anti-inflammatory effect and cartilage regenerative effect of MFSCE in Interleukin-1a (IL-1a) induced OA in vitro model using rat primary cartilage cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Moreover， MFSCE has shown the anti-inflammatory and regenerative effect in golf-injury patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. However， the effect of MFSCE on OA in canines not yet identified. In the present study， we evaluated the effect of MFSCE on OA through change of clinical sign in dogs. We also evaluated the adverse effects of MFSCE through change of general sign， hematological sign and urinalysis in dogs.\n\n【8】Materials and Methods\n\n【9】Preparation of MFSCE\n\n【10】The MFSCE was provided from T-Stem Co.， Ltd. (Changwon， Korea). The preparation was manufactured as previously described通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. Human ADSCs were separated from human adipose tissue which donated from healthy female aged twenties. All donors had to complete blood test for check compatibility. ADSCs were cultured in5% CO2 and 37°C condition. ADSCs were harvested at the passages of 5 to 7 to using for MFSCE. Cells membranes were removed using ultra sonication and centrifugation，and intracellular peptides，named MFSCE， were collected using filtration. The aqueous solution of MFSCE was further lyophilized and stored in powder form. Non-toxicity of MFSCE， the final product， was identified via 9 safety tests performed by the Good Laboratory Practice accreditation authority.\n\n【11】Experimental design\n\n【12】The study was conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All owners were required to sign an informed consent form for the clinical trials before enrolling their animals in the study. The protocol was approved by the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency of Korea.\n\n【13】Twenty-eight dogs with spontaneous occurred OA were enrolled in the study. To OA was evaluated using radiographic and clinical sign. Dogs that had other knee disease， treated with NSAIDs or corticosteroids within 14 days before enrolment， or pregnancy or likelihood of becoming pregnant during the study were excluded. For ethical reasons，dogs were analgesictreated or excluded from the study according to change of general symptoms or symptoms of lesion， and occurring infectious disease and adverse events. Characteristics of dogs which completed the study were shown in Table 1. There are no significant differences of characteristics between placebo and MFSCE groups at TO.\n\nDogs were separated into two groups； placebo treated group|删除段之间换行|(n=6)， MFSCE treated group (n=22). The MFSCE treated group was injected with 100 mg/2 mL of MFSCE (dissolved with phosphate buffer solution (PBS)) in intra-articular while placebo treated group was injected with 2 mL of PBS in intra-articular. All dogs were treated once a week for 4 weeks. To evaluate the symptoms， dogs and owners were visit hospital at day 0， 7，14，21，and 28.

Therefore， MFSCE has no adverse effects.\n\n【63】Discussion\n\n【64】This is the first study that demonstrated the treatment effect of MFSCE on OA without adverse effects in dogs. All clinical symptoms related with OA such as pain， physical function and radiography were significantly improved after 28 days treatment. Even so， no changes in any general symptoms， adverse events， hematological parameters， and urinalysis parameters were seen after 28 days treatment.\n\n【65】In the present study， we evaluated the various clinical symptoms with reference of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities(WOMAC) osteoarthritis index for identify the effect of MFSCE on OA. WOMAC which is consist with 24 questions for evaluate the pain， stiffness， and physical functioning of joint， is the most widely删除1换行identified in OA. Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) is the proteolytic enzymes whichare occurred cartilage destruction through degradation of collagen，aggrecan，and various proteoglycans in OA 通用删除6(英):<u>[39-41]</u>. It was reported that MMP-3andMMP-13were increased in OA通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>.MMP-13 is the main proteinase which is directly related with degradation of collagen， aggrecan and proteoglycans in OA cartilage 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>， while MMP-3 can help the MMP-13 to degrade cartilage components 通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>. In the previous study， it was identified that MFSCE decreased MMP-3 and MMP-13 gene and protein level in IL-1a induced OA in vitro model 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Furthermore， we also identified that MFSCE inhibited the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KB) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway which are regulated the MMP levels 通用删除6(英):<u>[21，45]</u>. Therefore， it was suggested that MFSCE may inhibit the progress of OA through inhibition of MMPs. Another molecular mechanism which related with cartilage formation is SRY-type high-mobility group box-9 (SOX-9) which is control chondrogenesis通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u>. SOX-9 expressed in pre-chondrogenic mesenchyme and fully differentiated chondrocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>. It was reported that the expression level of SOX-9 was lower in OA chondrocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>[48，49]</u>. Moreover， overexpression of SOX-9 in explant cultures of OA articular cartilage increased collagen and proteoglycan expression level similar with normal cartilage 通用删除6(英):<u>[50，51]</u>. Therefore， it was considered that increasing SOX-9 expression is important treat target for cartilage regeneration通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u>. In the previous study， MFSCE increased SOX-9 gene and protein level in IL-1a induced OA in vitro model 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Therefore， it was suggested that MFSCE may promote cartilage regeneration through increasing SOX-9 level. In conclusion， MFSCE may improve the OA through not only inhibit the progress of OA but also increase the cartilage regeneration.\n\n【66】Many researches for the Development Disease-Modifying OA Drug (DMOAD) were progressed； however， it was still not developed because OA has complex pathogenic mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u>. It was reported that， stem cell can promote cartilage regeneration by various mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u>. It also has been reported that transplanted stem cells can replace the damaged cartilage through differentiate to target cell 通用删除6(英):<u>[55]</u>. Recently， it was identified that stem cells can be affect to cartilage regeneration through release the paracrine molecules such as growth factor and thrombospondin 通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u>. Furthermore， stem cells can modulate the immune response through release the cytokines 通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u>. However， although the stem cell had attention as a new DMOAD， there are still some limitations 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>. To treat OA using stem cells， it has to be attached on the lesion， and has to be differentiated and proliferated. However， these processes are affected by various factors such as cell condition， growth condition， amount of stem cell and other endogenous factors 通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u>. Moreover， stem cell can be differentiated unexpected cell because of its multi-potentiality通用删除6(英):<u>[58，59]</u>. Because of these various limitations， stem cell therapy has been difficulties to development. In the present study， we evaluated the cartilage regenerative effect using radiography. As shown in Figure 10， joint structure was improved and cartilage was regenerated28 days after MFSCE treatment. We suggested that MFSCE may act as paracrine factor released from stem cell to regulate cartilage regeneration and immune response. Moreover， we identified that MFSCE did not shown any toxicity performed at the GLP institution(data not shown). Therefore， MFSCE may alternate the stem cell therapy because it overcomes the limitations of stem cell therapy.\n\n【67】In this study， we found that 4 weeks treatment of MFSCE not only improve clinical sign of OA but also regenerate cartilage with no significant adverse effects. In addition， previous studies have删除1换行confirmed the mechanism of action of MFSCE on OA， and the non-toxicity. Therefore， MFSCE could be the first-in-class DMOAD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Mesenteric lymphangioma is extremely rare in adults. Gastrointestinal and mesenteric lymphangioma or lymphangiomatosis are extremely rare in adults. A lymphangioma usually appears as a partially septated， cystic mass on imaging studies including ultrasound， Computed Tomography (CT)， and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Lymphangioma is a rare benign tumor that develops in the lymphatic system. Lymphangiomas occasionally occur diffusely， and this process is referred to as “generalized lymphangiomatosis\". This disease usually occurs in children and involves the skin. Mesentery lymphangiomatosis is extremely rare in adults.\n\n【2】Keywords： Mesentric lymphangioma； Acute abdomen； Intestinal obstruction\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Lymphangiomatosis is a condition where the defective lymphatic channels develop over a large area as compared to Lymphangioma which is localized. It can be seen in any tissue that has lymphatics. Here we present a rare case of mesentric Lymphangiomatosis.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 45 Year old female presented to ER with complaints of pain abdomen since 8 days associated with fever， vomiting and not passage of feces and flatus since 7 days. She was brought in state of shock and was febrile and hypotensive with BP of 70/40 mmHg and pulse of 140 bpm with respiratory rate of 40 cycles/min and severely dehydrated. On per abdominal examination abdomen was grossly distended with board like rigidity and rebound tenderness with absent bowel sounds. Note on percussion was tympanic. Pain started in the right lower abdomen， progressed to entire abdomen over the period of 8 days. Blood investigations showed raised TLC of 32，000 cumm and acidosis with pof 7.0. X-ray abdomen standing showed multiple air-fluid levels with ground glass appearance and an USG showed multiseptated organized collection filling the peritoneal cavity with dilated bowel loops showing sluggish peristalsis.\n\n【7】Patient was immediately admitted and after initial resuscitation with a pre-operative diagnosis of peritonitis secondary to perforation was taken to the OR.\n\n【8】Intraoperative Findings\n\n【9】Approximately 500 ml of whitish foul smelling fluid was present in the peritoneal cavity.\n\n【10】Approximately 31/2 feet away from the duodeno-jejunal junction grossly thickened lobulated mesentery encasing 1 feet of ileum within it， causing extra luminal obstruction and the proximal and distal bowel with its mesentery was found to be normal .\n\n【11】Proximal to the obstruction bowel was distended and distal bowel was collapsed.\n\n【12】Grossly thickened lobulated mesentery containing multiple cysts within it which were filled with whitish fluid .\n\n【13】Operative Procedure\n\n【14】Exploratory laparotomy with resection of the encased bowel and mesentery with ileo-ileal end to end anastomosis with peritoneal toileting.

The placenta cannot be avoided to deliver the fetus. Ultrasound \"three-line four-zone method\"accurately locates the placental edge and the umbilical pedicle.

When the placenta is implanted， if the villi invade the myometrium and reach or penetrate the uterine serosa， the placenta in the lower uterus and cervical can seriously affect the bladder and even the rectum， which significantly increases intraoperative bleeding and difficulty in surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Placenta previa combined with placenta implantation can cause severe obstetric hemorrhage， peripheral organ damage， shock， DIC， increased neonatal asphyxia rate， anemia， infection and other complications. It is also one of the main reasons for obstetric perinatal removal of the uterus， a serious threat maternal life and reproductive health； improper handling can even lead to maternal death 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In order to avoid severe intraoperative bleeding， reduce maternal and infant complications， and preserve fertility， Scholars around the world have proposed a variety of surgical schemes， such as temporary blocking of the abdominal aortic balloon and double uterine incisions 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. Abdominal aortic balloon occlusion is proven to be reliable and effective， but it may cause fetal asphyxia before delivery. The double incision design of the uterus is not suitable for the placenta to cover the anterior wall of the uterus widely 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. Therefore， for a few special cases， this study combined ultrasound and nuclear magnetic resonance examination to accurately locate the placenta and the umbilical cord insertion end， and choose the appropriate uterine incision to reduce intraoperative bleeding， thereby ensuring the safety of mothers and infants.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】Pregnant woman， 27 years old， 37 weeks gestation， G5P1，A live baby was delivered by cesarean section 6 years ago and 3 abortions were induced. Weight： 65 Kg， height： 155 cm， no abnormalities were found on cardiopulmonary examination. Obstetric examination：Miyataka： 34 cm， abdominal circumference 100 cm， first outcrop， fetal heart rate： 145 bpm， without contractions， no vaginal blooding. Color Doppler Tips： The placenta is located in the anterior wall of the uterus，and the lower edge of the placenta completely covers the inner cervix. The boundary between the placenta and the lower part of the anterior wall of the uterus is unclear， and placental implantation is possible.\n\n【11】The placenta implantation was evaluated based on the ultrasound scoring system and placental MRI results to predict the severity of placental implantation， and the uterus could be preserved 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>. Ultrasound \"three-line and four-zone method\" to scan the placenta position. Three-line definition： The midline of the clavicle on both sides and the midline of the abdomen； four-zone： Below the umbilical horizontalline，the midpoint of the umbilical line is divided into four areas from left to right. Specific evaluation method： The pregnant woman should fill the bladder properly (the volume of bladder urine is estimated by 200 ml ~ 300 ml with ultrasonic volume measurement)， and take a 30-degree head-high lying position before the operation. The vertical probe was scanned from the upper left phase of the pregnant woman to the left midclavicular line， midline of abdomen， right midclavicular line， and upper right phase (the ultrasound image covers the left and right edges of the placenta). Two-dimensional and color Doppler dynamic images ofthe anterior wall andlateral placenta of the uterus were scanned and divided in sequence. The upper edge of the anterior wall placenta at the midline ofthe left and right clavicle and the midline of the abdomen reached the bottom of the palace， and the lower edge was completely covered inner cervix. A relatively thin area of the placenta is measured between the horizontal line of the umbilicus and the inner cervix. The upper edge is 23 mm below the horizontal line of the umbilicus， the lower edge is 36 mm above the horizontal line of the pubic bone， the left edge is 16 mm inside the left midclavicular line， and the right edge is 25 mm to the right side of the midline of the abdomen， the umbilical pedicle is located on the middle placenta in the right posterior wall .\n\n【12】There was no abnormal blood vessel running on the fetal surface at this thin placenta area. Color Doppler showed that the blood flow signal was not abundant， so it was decided to choose a uterine incision there. During the operation， the lower parts of the anterior wall of the uterus were hypervascularity. Plasma tubes were placed under the fetal exposure to tighten the lower part of the uterus to temporarily block the ascending blood supply of the uterine artery. The uterine muscle layer was cut at the placenta where the ultrasound was thin and lack of blood supply， and the placenta was broken up for fetal delivery， cervical lift suture， posterior uterine wall suture， and “COOK balloon” uterine tamponade was performed. The intraoperative bleeding was only 800 ml. Discharged 3 days after surgery， the mother and child had a good outcome.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Complete placenta previa is often subject to adhesion and implantation due to the placenta and uterine wall and cervix， which can easily cause rapid bleeding during operation and even endanger the safety of maternallife.

It is a rare autosomal recessive， inborn error of collagen metabolism manifesting as skin changes， recurrent infections， unusual facial features，organomegaly (hepatosplenomegaly) with elevated liver enzymes and varied intellectual dysfunction. There have been around 70 cases reported worldwide but our case is worth reporting as the patient has all features with portal hypertension and presented as massive upper gut bleed (variceal bleed). We present a 22 year old unmarried male with no underlying comorbidity. The patient was immediately stabilized by securing airway， breathing and circulation and given two units packed cell transfusion with hemodynamic monitoring and intravenous fluids. Simultaneously all base line investigations including were sent. Seeing the nature of bleed， Gastroenterologist was called and an urgent Upper GI endoscopy was done which revealed multiple varices (3 grade 3 and2 grade 2) for which banding was done and patient starts on injection terlipressin 2 mg 8 hourly and pantoprazole infusion at a rate of 8 mg/h for 72 h . While the patient was being managed and after stabilization a complete general physical examination with relevant systemic examination revealed pallor， depressed nasal bridge， hepatosplenomegaly and multiple ulcers on bilateral lower limbs which according to the patient were chronic and present for more than 3 years. These ulcers were typically non-healing and the patient had never sought medical attention for them but was given some local treatment by a quack. Further he gave history that one of his siblings had a similar history of developing multiple ulcers on limbs which heal by atropic scarring. Keeping all these points in mind the possibility of prolidase deficiency was thought of. Thin layer chromatography of his overnight urine revealed marked increase in iminopeptide after gelatin loading (prolidase deficiency).\n\n【2】Discussion\n\nProlidase deficiency is a rare genetic disease with autosomal recessive inheritance first described by Goodman in 1968 in a male patient with intellectual disability and characteristic ulcers on legs通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Prolidase is an important enzyme involved in recycling of proline and hydroxyproline that is approximately one fourth of collagen 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The deficiency of this enzyme results in urinary loss of proline which is in the range of 3 gm per day 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. These patients are intellectually subnormal， have short stature， saddle nose， hypertelorism， narrowed eyes and hypoplasia of jaw. The most characteristic featureremains skin fragility withlegulcerationandpitted scarring通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.Other cutaneous|删除段之间换行|manifestations are photosensitivity， purpura， telangiectasias， and dry crusted lesions on face and fissured erythematous palms and soles 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.

Falciparum malaria a protozoan disease is caused by Plasmodium falciparum， transmitted by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. Acute pancreatitis a rare complication of falciparum malaria which is well documented. It is rare complication because despite having high parasitemia there is no any other system involvement. A case report of a 26-yr old army man infected with falciparum malaria with high parasitemia and acute pancreatitis as a sole presentation was presented here. Only few case reports are available.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nA 26-yr old army man of commandant rank posted in forest belt of Mirzapur district， Uttar Pradesh， presented to the medicine emergency department with a 4-day history of high-grade fever which was associated with chills and rigor， vomiting and generalized abdominal pain. There was no significant past medical history of lipid disorders， no history of biliary tract disease， and no steroids and painkillers intake. There was no history of alcohol intake or any other substance abuse. At the time of presentation on clinical examination， he was febrile (102.2°F) with mild jaundice. His temperature fluctuates over next 2 days， abdominal pain increases and he becomes drowsy. Four days after admission his condition improved. Blood pressure was normal. Systemic examinations reveal epigastric tenderness with mild generalized abdominal distension with normal bowel sounds. Systemic examinations of other system were within normal limits. Laboratory examination revealed hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL with total leucocyte count 6400/mm’(with granulocytes 65.6%)， platelet count 90，000， MCV 84.5 fl， MCH 30.2 pg and hematocrit 23.1%. Serum bilirubin was 4.2 mg/dL， aspartate aminotransferase 402 IU/L， alanine aminotransferase 202 IU/L， alkaline phosphatase82 IU/L and serum albumin 2.8 g/dL with total protein of 6 mg/dL. His serum amylase was 502IU/L and serum lipase 2248 IU/L. His kidney function tests were normal. Peripheral blood smear stained with Leishman demonstrated ring-form trophozoites of P. falciparum with high parasitemia(62%) with rapid antigen test for P. falciparum was also positive. Chest X-ray was normal. Contrast enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) scan of the abdomen showing a bulky pancreas with peri-pancreatic fat stranding suggestive of acute pancreatitis . A diagnosis of severe falciparum malaria with acute pancreatitis was made on basis of investigation. Treatment in form|删除段之间换行|A Ryle’s tube was inserted for bowel rest and acute pancreatitis was managed with analgesics， hydration and supportive therapy. Antibiotic ceftriaxone 1 g twice a day was started and marked improvements in his clinical symptoms was noted， parasitemia load were cleared by more than half after 4th day of therapy， his fever spike came down pain abdomen and jaundice subsided after 84h day. Oral quinine tab was started 8h day up to 15h day. The patient was discharged on 18h day and his condition was good on further follow up. Although abdominal pain is a frequent symptom in malaria， in this patient， the persistent and worsening abdominal pain was related to severe pancreatitis a rare complication of falciparum malaria. Abdominal pain and vomiting were reported to be more commonly associated with falciparum infections than with vivax 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The various causes of abdominal pain in malaria include Acalculus cholecystitis， acute surgical abdomen， splenic rupture， splenic infarction， splenic torsion and hepatitis/hepatomegaly， acute renal failure and algid malaria 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. The presence of abdominal pain if associated with hepatomegaly has higher mortality in malaria. National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme reported about two million malaria cases every year， among them 50% is P. falciparum. The WHO estimates100 million cases in the Southeast Asia Region 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Morbidity and mortality in rural population highest with varying degrees of presentation. Only few case reports are available regarding this complication of falciparum malaria 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-8]</u>. Pancreatitis is an unusual cause of abdominal pain in malaria with less than 10 cases reported worldwide. Theparasitemia in three ofthese patients werelow (0.5%to1.5%). As none of these patients had fulfilled WHO criteria for severe falciparum malaria. There is no acute respiratory distress syndrome either with severe malaria or with acute pancreatitis in this young man. The parasitized erythrocytes bind toreceptors on the endothelial cells by the formation of knobs (electron-dense structures) and cause obstruction of capillary blood flow. Capillary blockage by parasitized RBCs and acute hemolysis was pathophysiological mechanisms that result in pancreatitis. Occlusion of blood vessels of the pancreas with parasitized RBCs and rosettes have been demonstrated in several autopsy studies. Jaundice is probably because of oedema of the head of the pancreas which compressed the intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct. No correlation between the infestation index and the occurrence of pancreatitis has been established.\n\n【7】Encouraging results with successful outcome were seen in patients with acute pancreatitis in previous study and in present patient leads to early diagnosis of pancreatitis in P. falciparum positive cases and management in early stage so as to prevent the life-threatening complication of acute pancreatitis. Incidence of Acute pancreatitis is much higher than that being reported because of failure to report the patient presenting with acute abdomen in malaria patient. In tropical countries it is of utmost importance to look for signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis in a patient presenting with pain abdomen in P. falciparum positive cases. So， a conclusion is drawn from this case and earlier cases that as falciparum malaria is common in tropical countries and it can present as pain abdomen with acute pancreatitis so routine serology testing is done to rule out the diagnosis to prevent dreaded complications and to decrease the mortality and mortality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Of these， Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) accounts for 60% to 70%， followed by basal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma accounting for 30% to 40% and 2% to 6%， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【8】The highly-differentiated Verrucous Carcinoma (VC) is an exophytically growing， rare histological subtype of low-grade SCC first described by Ackermann in 1948 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Most common localizations are the oral cavity and larynx 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Non-mucosal occurrence， such as in the auricular region， is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. VC presents with a slow tumor growth as well as a low tendency of regional and distant metastatic spread.

Extensive sun exposure is another well studied risk factor of SCC of the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. VC predominantly affects elderly white men 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【10】Histopathologicalfeatures comprisehyperkeratosis，acanthosis and papillomatosis. Characteristically， tumor cells lack invasion of the basement membrane， but rather show deep pushing borders. Typical signs of epithelial dysplasia are minimal and rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，9]</u>. Therefore， superficial biopsies may lead to benign differential diagnosis such as seborrheic keratosis， verruca vulgaris， papilloma or keratoacanthoma.\n\n【11】Surgical resection in primary and recurrent VC is recommended as first-line treatment. Radiation-based therapies are controversial， as there is evidence of malignant tumor transformation into higher grade SCC with subsequent worse outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，10]</u>. The five-year relative survival of mucosal VC reaches approximately 80% 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【12】We herein present a rare case of a repeatedly misdiagnosed VC of the auricle， caused by too superficial excisions. In this case， we focus on the specific histopathological and clinical features of the auricular region that are important to properly diagnose VC and discuss reconstruction techniques in case of aesthetic alterations.\n\n【13】Case Presentation\n\n【14】A 79-year-old male presented to the outpatient clinic of the department of Otorhinolaryngology\n\n【15】Results of the superficial biopsy， taken from the auricular masss showed squamous papilloma without dysplasia. Circular radiofrequency-assisted excision of the mass was performed under local anesthesia. The deep surgical excision margin comprised only parts of the perichondrial laver as the tumor was not attached to the cartilage. Postoperative histopathological results revealed seborrheic keratosis of hyperkeratotic type without signs of malignancy (Figure1\n\n【16】Thus， the defect was reconstructed using a full-thickness skin graft from the lateral region of the ipsilateral neck. Six months after the reconstruction，a recurrent exophytic mass of the conchal cavum was detected， located in the inferior border of the skin graft .\n\n【17】Re-excision was performed. Histopathology of the re-excised tumor repeatedly revealed hyperkeratotic seborrheic keratosis without dysplasia. At the next follow-up， three months later， recurrence of the mass was evident once again. Another biopsy (1cm diameter) did not reveal malignant criteria either. Against the background of multiple recurrences of the mass， the patient was recommended a more radical resection of the tumor including the cartilage layer despite the risk of overtreatment with subsequent cosmetic alteration of the auricle. After receiving the patient's informed consent， deep radiofrequency-assisted en-bloc-resection of the mass with the underlying conchal cartilage was performed under local anesthesia. Synthetic wound dressing was used for temporary closure. Eventually， the histopathological findings showed low-grade squamous cell carcinoma of verrucous type .\n\n【18】Sonographic re-staging of the parotideal and cervical lymph nodes was clear. Re-resection was necessary to enlarge the perifocal surgical margins to 4 mm to 5 mm. Upon this， the lateral part of anthelical cartilage could be preserved. On final histopathological examination， all surgical margins were tumor free with minimal margins of at least 4 mm. Reconstructive options， especially in terms of full-thickness skin grafts vs. local skin flaps， were discussed with the patient. According to the patient’s preference， a full-thickness skin graft from the lateral region of the contralateral neck was used for reconstruction under local anesthesia. The 5-weeks post-operative follow-up showed uneventful healing without evidence of graft necrosis or unpleasant scarring. Moreover， the aesthetic result was satisfying， showing a stable auricular cartilaginous rim despite删除1换行subtotal resection of the anthelix and antitragus \n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】We herein present the case of a 79-years-old patient with a verrucous carcinoma of the auricle that was repeatedly misdiagnosed as a benign lesion although multiple biopsies and excisions were serially performed. While the histological structure of most skin regions consists of an epidermal， a dermal and a subcutaneous layer， the anterior auricle is lacking a subcutis with a soft tissue basal lamina通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Thus， the dermis of the anterior auricle is tightly adherent to the perichondrial layer， whereas the posterior auricle contains a thin subcutaneous layer 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. These special features of the auricle's histology fundamentally complicate histopathological assessment. Further， the elastic cartilage is crucial for the auricle's flexibility and its aesthetic appearance. Therefore， surgery of the cartilaginous auricle needs to be performed particularly cautiously.\n\n【21】Nevertheless， sufficient biopsies of skin lesions are crucial for a detailed histopathological assessment to avoid delayed diagnosis due to false-negative histopathological results. Delayed diagnosis typically results in destruction of important anatomical structures and compromises the oncologic and aesthetic outcome. Choosing the appropriate biopsy technique is particularly challenging in presence of auricular VC as it lacks clear histopathological signs of dysplasia in superficial layers and can only be assessed if the invasion border can be detected at or within the underlying cartilage layer.\n\n【22】In the present case， several specimens (biopsies and excisions) including only the perichondrial layer but lacking the cartilage itself revealed repetitive false-negative benign entities such as papilloma and hyperkeratotic seborrheic keratosis. In clinical routine， excisions of auricular cartilage are typically avoided due to the following facts：on the one hand superficial biopsies are usually sufficient to diagnose basal cell carcinoma and1 poorly-differentiated squamouscell carcinoma and on the other hand the excision of auricular cartilage with wound healing by secondary intention can lead to aesthetic deformities. This can be caused by loss of tissue thickness and scarring with subsequent deformity of the auricle’s outline. Additionally， VC of the auricle is extremely rare.\n\n【23】Hence， we are facing two different scenarios that should be avoided. First， a benign auricular skin lesion may be excised including the underlying cartilage with an unsatisfactory aesthetic result representing overtreatment. Secondly， an auricular malignant skin lesion may be excised too superficially to avoid an unfavorable cosmetic result，leading to a wrong histopathological diagnosis.\n\n【24】We recommend that in case of a clinically suspicious history of recurrent or rapidly growing masses of the auricle in combination with a benign histopathology after biopsy， at least an incisional wedge biopsy containing underlying cartilage should be ensured， despite the potential risk of aesthetic alterations.\n\n【25】In respect to the aesthetic subunits of the auricle as well as principles of reconstructive principles the following aspects should be kept in mind： Depending on the aesthetic subunit of the auricle， the size of the excised cartilage can vary in conjunction with the reconstructive options of the auricular defect. Within the conchal cavum and the auricular scapha， loss of tissue thickness will rather be invisible. Skin defects may either get closed by undermining the wound edges or by reconstruction with full-thickness skin grafts. Therefore， more extensive en-bloc resection of cartilage can be performed to increase the likelihood of a correct histopathological删除1换行result. In aesthetically more demanding regions such as the anthelix， fossa triangularis or antitragus， skin defects including the cartilage may require more advanced surgical techniques such as locoregional flaps or skin grafts combined with cartilage transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>[13-15]</u>. Thus， an incisional wedge biopsy should be preferred representing a reasonable compromise between good reconstructive options and histopathological assessability. More extensive cartilaginous defects of the anthelix affecting the stability of the auricle typically need more comprehensive reconstruction. Retroauricular flaps such as the pull-trough island flap can be used in these situations. Depending on the size ofthe defect， these can lead to decreased auricular stability.\n\n【26】In the present case， the mass was originally located in the conchal cavum. Consequently，an en-bloc excision of the underlying conchal cartilage was possible to finally diagnose VC. The presence of remaining tumor cells in the surgical margin led to resection of medial parts of the antitragus as well as medial parts of the anthelical rim. History of ipsilateral mastoidectomy with including retroauricular tissue loss limited the opportunity for retroauricular local flap reconstruction. Moreover， the patient preferred a simple reconstruction with a full-thickness skin graft again. The chosen reconstructive option resulted in sufficient stability of the auricle with only a slightly changed auricular contour.\n\n【27】In case of recurrent exophytic tumor growth of the auricle， VC must be considered. Due to the fact that VC lacks typical signs of epithelial dysplasia， histopathological diagnosis of VC is challenging and often requires excision ofthe auricular cartilage.Depending on the size and auricular region of excised cartilage， various surgical options are available to achieve an aesthetically satisfying reconstruction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

A replaced right hepatic artery arose from the superior mesenteric artery and had distributed into the right liver lobe. Additionally， a large inferior right hepatic vein drained segment VI and emptied into the inferior vena cava was present at the lower border of the liver.

In the classical anatomical arterial pattern， the celiac axis gives rise to Left Gastric Artery (LGA) and then bifurcates into Splenic Artery (SA) and Common Hepatic Artery (CHA). CHA is divided into the Proper Hepatic Artery (PHA) and Gastroduodenal Artery (GDA). PHA bifurcates into the Left Hepatic Artery (LHA) and the Right Hepatic Artery (RHA)通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The internationally accepted classification system concerning anatomical variation of hepatic artery was proposed by Michel 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>， which reported that this classical arterial anatomy was seen at a rate of 55%. Since then， many researchers have reported diverse anatomic variations ofthe hepatic artery making the hepatic surgery complex and difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>.\n\n【5】The hepatic veins drain the deoxygenated blood from the liver into the Inferior Vena Cava(IVC). There are usually three in number， named the Right Hepatic Vein (RHV)， Middle Hepatic Vein (MHV) and Left Hepatic Vein (LHV). Although the liver has a dual source of blood supply from Portal Vein (PV) and hepatic artery， the outflow is only through the hepatic veins. Just like the various variations of hepatic arteries， there are many variations in the venous drainage of the human liver 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. Accurate assessment of the anomaly of the hepatic vein is indispensable for safe liver surgery. Numerous anatomical variations of the hepatic artery have been reported in the literature， however， few reports describe the combined variations ofhepatic artery and vein involved in liver cancer. Here， we aimed to present a case with combined variations of the right hepatic artery and vein complicated hepatectomy. We will discuss the influence of these arterial and venous variations in a clinical setting.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 63-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital， because she was suffering from upper abdominal discomfort. The patient was a lifelong nonsmoker who did not consume alcohol and had no history of inherited diseases. There was no significant history of biliary or liver disease.

The patient was diagnosed as a Michel’s type III hepatic artery variation. A Replaced Right Hepatic Artery (RRHA) arose from the Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA)，traversed posterior to the PV and rose along the right posterior side of the Common Bile Duct (CBD) before entering the right liver lobe. At the same time， a classical LHA originated from the CHA fed into the left liver lobe. A three-dimensional reconstruction was performed to better study the anatomy preoperatively. Additionally， it was demonstrated that a comparatively large Inferior Right Hepatic Vein (IRHV) drained segment VI was present， while the classic RHV dominantly drained in segment VII. The IRHV ran posterior to the right branch of PV and emptied into the IVC at the lower border of the liver. The diagnosis of liver malignant tumor and artery variation was further suggested based on imaging findings of selective hepatic arteriography.\n\n【13】Then， under the clinical diagnosis of T3bN0M0 stage III B primary liver cancer according to the 8th edition of the Union for International Cancer Control staging manual， the patient underwent right hemihepatectomy. Intraoperative the variation of RRHA derived from SMA and the aberrant course of RRHA anticipated by three-dimensional reconstruction was observed after hilar dissection. As well as the large IRHV was confirmed at the lower border ofthe liver when dissection of the third hepatic port is conducted， the ligation of the IRHV was safely completed without injury. The postoperative删除表格换行follow-up was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the8th postoperative day. The histopathologic examination revealed a primary hepatocellular carcinoma.

Michel's 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> published autopsy series about hepatic artery variants in 1966， which originally divided the hepatic artery pattern into 10 types . Nowadays， Michel's classification is still the most commonly used in clinic， it established the difference between replaced and accessory hepatic artery. An accessory hepatic artery refers to an additional artery of the liver， while a normal branch derives from the PHA. A replaced hepatic artery refers to an anomalous origin of artery supplied the liver without a normal branch derived from the PHA 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. We reviewed the literature on the anatomic variations of the hepatic artery by MDCTA， of which 4，047cases were analyzed for anatomic variations of the hepatic artery通用删除6(英):<u>[8-12]</u>. The results showed that 2，966 (73.3%) cases had standard anatomy and 355 (8.8%) cases had RRHA arising from SMA. A RRHA is most commonly branched from SMA， the incidence of RRHA branched from SMA ranged from 4% to 10.6% . Less common rare origins of RRHA include the right gastric artery， celiac axis， abdominal aorta， and GDA 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14]</u>.\n\n【18】Hepatic vein variations are commonly seen similar to variations in hepatic artery； however， hepatic venous anatomic variations are frequently underreported on routine CT 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. The prevailing pattern of the three hepatic veins was the RHV enters the IVC separately， but the MHV and LHV share a common trunk (65% to 85%). In the remaining patients， the RHV，MHV，and LHV drained independently into the IVC. RHV variation is one of the most common hepatic venous variants included early branching of RHV and multiple RHV. In general， the hepatic venous in the right posterior lobe is primarily drained by the RHV. When an IRHV is present， the IRHV and RHV jointly drain venous blood from the right posterior lobe. The IRHV enters directly into the IVC on the right side and drains the inferior part of the right posterior section. The number of IRHV ranges from1 to 4 per liver 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【19】We reviewed the literature on the anatomic variations of hepatic vein 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6，15-19]</u>， the prevalence of IRHV determined by MDCTA ranges from 21% to 64.2% . The RHV and IRHV both belong to the right hepatic vasculature and have intersecting drainage areas. Thus， it is reasonable to expect that their anatomy is correlated. Several studies have determined the diameter of IRHV has a negative correlation with the diameter of RHV 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，15]</u>. Furthermore， a negative correlation was found between RHV diameter and IRHV incidence.\n\n【20】A recent study suggested that IRHV is likely to absent with RHV diameter >8.86 mm， but is likely to present with RHV diameter<8.86mm 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. This provides a theoretical basis for surgeons to predict the presence of IRHV when performing hepatectomy or living donor liver transplantation by only measuring RHV diameter.\n\n【21】The clinical implications of variant anatomy of hepatic artery and vein can be significant. In our case， dissociation of the right and left hepatic arteries made resection of the right liver lobe easier. For the special derive of RRHA， the length of RRHA could potentially make right lobe liver transplant easier. However， the RRHA traversed posterior to the PV and rose along the right posterior side of the CBD. If unrecognized preoperatively， this variant could pose significant risk of injury to the hepatic artery during the course of pancreaticoduodenectomy leading to hemorrhage， hepatic ischemia， biliary stricture or a leak at the bilioenteric anastomosis. To identify the blood supply of a tumor and improve the prognosis， separate angiographies of SMA and hepatic arteries during Transhepatic Arterial Chemotherapy and Embolization (TACE) treatment of right hepatic carcinoma is obligatory 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Traditional precepts of liver surgery stipulate that， if the main hepatic vein cannot be preserved， the liver segment drained by that vein must be completely removed， to prevent acute necrosis or chronic atrophy of liver tissue. However， this precept changes in the presence of an IRHV. When an IRHV is present， it mainly drains segment VI of the liver. Therefore， if the RHV has to be removed， the liver tissue of segment VI can be preserved in the presence of an IRHV，thereby increasing the volume of the residualliver and decreasing the incidence ofpostoperativeliver failure 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.

We present a large epiphrenic diverticulum with clinical andpathological features ofa true diverticulum in apatient with achalasia， which was misdiagnosed as a hiatal hernia.\n\n【2】Clinical Sum mary\n\n【3】A 67-year-old female who had undergone a transabdominal Heller myotomy for achalasia in1973 presented with a 2-year history of progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids， regurgitation， cough， pneumonia and weight loss of 10 lbs. Chest Computed Tomography (CT) without oral contrast at an outside hospital showed a 10 cm pouch filled with debris above the lefthemidiaphragm， diagnosed as a paraesophageal hiatal hernia. The patient was treated with proton pump inhibitors without response. She was then referred by a pulmonologist to thoracic surgery for respiratory symptoms attributed to aspiration caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease and a hiatal hernia.\n\n【4】The videoesophagram at our center showed a dilated esophagus with absence of peristaltic contractions. The distal esophagus was angulated and was connected to a 10 cm pouch in the left hemithorax. The narrowing in the distal esophagus above the pouch resembled the gastroesophageal junction. The pouch was round and filled with debris. The stomach was decompressed and was entirely located in the abdomen. The pouch in the chest mimicked a large paraesophageal hiatal hernia as shown in Figure 1. CT scan with oral contrast showed a pouch filled with debris above the left hemidiaphragm， shown in Figure 2A，2B. Upper endoscopy revealed that the distal esophagus had transformed into a large， round pouch filled with copious fermented food， shown in Figure2C. A repeat endoscopy after 3 days of clear liquid diet， under general anesthesia to protect from aspiration， revealed a large pouch and no evidence ofhiatal hernia， shown in Figure 2D. There were no dual lumens， one into the diverticulum and one into the stomach， as are usually seen in a false/pulsion diverticulum. Biopsies of the cavity showed squamous mucosa. A motility catheter placed under endoscopic guidance showed absence of esophageal contractions and failure of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter consistent with achalasia. Because of the history of prior Heller myotomy via a midline laparotomy and potential adhesions， and the size of the diverticulum， the procedure was planned as a thoracotomy， diverticulectomy and possible partial fundoplication.\n\n【5】A left posterolateral thoracotomy in the 7h intercostal space revealed a distended diverticulum with retained contents， shown in Figure 3A. A nasogastric tube was passed for decompression. There were dense adhesions between the diverticulum and the pericardium， left lower lobe， aorta and diaphragm which were divided. The diverticulum was a large pouch in continuation with the distal esophagus and seemed to contain all esophageal lavers. There were dense adhesions between the esophagus and aorta which continued beyond the gastroesophageal junction possibly as the result of prior myotomy， but there was no visible plane of myotomy in the chest. The adhesions were divided and a completion Heller myotomy was performed distal to the diverticulum， extending beyond the gastroesophageal junction. The diverticulectomy was performed over a 48 French bougie using an endo GIA stapler and the staple line was imbricated with interrupted stitches. As the result of adhesions at the level of gastroesophageal junction in the abdomen， no partial fundoplication was performed. Endoscopy showed an easy access into the stomach， no retained food in the esophagus and no evidence of leak. Pathology showed presence of all three layers， including mucosa， muscular layer an adventitia， which confirmed the presence of a true diverticulum in figures Figure 3B，3C.\n\n【6】Postoperative video esophagram showed obliteration of the pouch， an easy passage of contrast into the stomach and noleak. The patient was started on a clear liquid diet on postoperative day one and was discharged home on a full liquid diet for two weeks. She was seen in our clinic on postoperative day 21， doing well， tolerating PO intake and had gained 2 lbs. She was instructed to have soft diet and advance to regular diet as tolerated. She will be followed in three months and one year after surgery in our clinic.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Epiphrenic diverticulaare false diverticuullaa composed1of esophageal mucosa， caused by a hypertensive or non-relaxing lower esophageal sphincter and associated motility disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. In contrast， true diverticula are composed of all esophageal layers and are usually associated with mediastinal inflammatory processes such as tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【9】Symptoms associated with an esophageal diverticulum could be similar to a hiatal hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In our case， an unusual presentation of a true diverticulum as a roundpouch below the presumed gastroesophageal junction， resembling a hiatal hernia， made the diagnosis more complex. The anatomical location which was thought to be the gastroesophageal junction was probably caused by the combination of distal esophageal angulation and an outflow resistance created by the distended diverticulum filled with retained contents， creating a proximal a high-pressure zone. In parallel， the presence of the diverticulum， a marker of outflow resistance is probably the result of an incomplete myotomy and/or scar tissue at the level of gastroesophageal junction， creating a distal high-pressure zone. The presence of all three esophageal layers in the pathology specimen which proves the presence of a true diverticulum， confirms that the diverticulum did not consist of an out pouching of the mucosa usually seen in patients with epiphrenic diverticulum， but more likely because of gradual dilation of the distal esophagus with all its three layers， possibly as the result of an incomplete Heller myotomy. The rare presentation increases the diagnostic complexity， hence the reason for misdiagnosis as a paraesophageal hiatal hernia.\n\n【10】This case emphasizes the importance of a thorough assessment of patients with esophageal disease. Particularly a true diverticulum without evidence of an inflammatory process in the mediastinum， an unusual location of the presumed gastroesophageal junction， and the transformation of the distal esophagus into a large true diverticulum mandated a comprehensive evaluation. The use of complementary diagnostic tools allowed correct diagnosis and treatment of a raretrue epiphrenic diverticulum， misdiagnosed as a hiatal hernia， which was treated via left thoracotomy， diverticulectomy and completion Heller myotomy with good outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is found more often in the non-bulbar area with worse prognosis compared with Caucasians. No consensus is reached regarding the standard surgical treatment of palpebral CM. We presented a 39-year-old Chinese female who developed CM at her right eye， involving superonasalpalpebral conjunctiva，superonasal bulbar conjunctiva and medial caruncle. We excised the lesion including underlying Tenon capsule and the main part of underlying tarsus with a maximum clear margin of 4 mm， while sparing the tarsus of the eyelid margin. We applied a hemi-depth lamellar incision on the eyelid margin tarsus to preserve the contour of eyelid. Double freeze-thaw cryotherapy was applied to the excision margin， and the conjunctival deficit was closed by an amniotic membrane graft. We provided post-operation adjuvant chemotherapy with 0.02% Mitomycin Cthree times daily for a schedule of three weeks on， one week off. Good cosmetic outcome was achieved with no recurrence in the following 35 months. Tarsus is important in lid function and for aesthetic appearance. To achieve wide-enough safety margin and intact eyelid contour， we presented a new simple approach with good cosmetic outcome and desirable disease control in palpebral CM surgery.\n\n【2】Keywords： Blepharoplasty； Conjunctival neoplasms； Melanoma\n\n【3】Key Messages\n\n【4】Non-bulbar conjunctival melanoma is associated with poor prognosis especially in the Chinese population. The wide excision with externallamellar lid margin tarsus sparing was a simple approach that yielded good cosmetic outcome and desirable disease control.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Conjunctival Melanoma (CM) is a rare and highly recurrent malignancy that primarily affects old Caucasians in their 60s. CM annual age-adjusted incidence rates (1 million person years) for different races were 0.49 for non-Hispanic Whites， 0.18 for Blacks and 0.15 for Asians 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Bulbar conjunctiva is the most common site ofCM， affecting 60% to 92% of cases， and half ofthem involving the limbus 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.CM in Chinese patients， with 70% to 95% of them invading non-bulbar area，leading to a poorer prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. Surgical treatment for bulbar melanoma has long been reported， but little has been discussed on the aspect of reconstruction related to palpebral conjunctival melanoma. Cases reported are mainly limited to those undergoing tarsoconjunctival graft 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， Hughes tarsoconjunctival flap 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> and total-tarsus-sparing surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Here， we demonstrated a novel and relatively simple surgical approach for treating palpebral CM. This surgical method achieves wider safety margin without grafting， prevents donor-induced wound on donor site， as well as a good aesthetic appearance.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 39-year-old Chinese female with no systemic disease presented with a pigmented lesion at the superonasal palpebral conjunctival of her right eye . The lesion existed since her age of 32 years， and enlarged progressively over the recent two months. There were no associated\n\n【9】We performed a wide local excision with a planar clear margin\n\n【10】The patient appeared unable to tolerate the symblepharon ring and symblepharon with shallow upper fornix was observed. We reconstructed， 7 weeks after primary surgery， a superior fornix with a contralateral conjunctival graft. No obvious syndromes of dry eye for diplopia were noted after surgery. Topical adjuvant chemotherapy was applied considering the higher recurrence risk related to pagetoid pattern of pathology. We started the patient on topical chemotherapy删除1换行one week after the fornix reconstruction， allowing the wound to heal. The three-week course of topical chemotherapy was followed by one-week of rest and repeated for 12 cycles. Follow-ups of 35 months showed no recurrence of melanoma with good cosmetic outcome.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】About the surgery for conjunctival melanoma， the \"no touch\"surgical technique was firstly described by Shields et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> and was widely accepted.Wide excision and reconstruction with clean instruments can prevent the tumor from recurrence and metastases related to inadequate surgical treatment or iatrogenic seeding. The excision of underlying Tenon capsule in bulbar CM is widely performed， and lamellar scleral dissection is suggested if the Tenon capsule is involved or scleral adhesion 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In our case， the underlying Tenon capsule was not involved， so we did not perform lamellar scleral dissection.\n\n【13】Different from bulbar conjunctiva， which isloosely attached to the sclera by the Tenon capsule， the palpebral conjunctiva adheres firmly to the tarsus. In palpebral CM， posterior lamellar eyelid resection is often conducted. The defect of tarsus and conjunctiva can be repaired by the Hughes technique or nasal cartilage with mucous membrane通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Some may excise the conjunctival lesion only with tarsus sparing to preserve the eyelid function 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. If the lesions extend onto the eyelid margin or skin， a full thickness eyelid resection is required. In our case， the melanoma invaded both bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva with eyelid margin sparing. We excised the posterior lamellar of eyelid， namely the conjunctiva and the full-thickness of tarsus underneath the palpebral CM， and performed the superficial lamellar tarsal excision at the eyelid margin， leaving hemi-depth of residual tarsus to preserve the normal eyelid contour. The surgical technique in this patient created a larger safety margin than total-tarsus-sparing procedure and was much simpler in reconstruction compared with conventional posterior lamellar evelid resection due to no need of grafting. A good functional and aesthetic outcome was achieved with no tumor recurrence in 35-month follow-up.\n\n【14】Post-operative adjuvant therapy is also important in treating conjunctival melanoma. Topical chemotherapy such as mitomycin C is widely used. There is no recommended dose and treatment cycle duration， but the convention is 0.04% mitomycin C four times a day for 1 to 3 weeks， followed by 1-week rest or topical steroids通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In addition to mitomycin C， others use interferon alpha-2B as an alternative due to its fewer adverse events. Brachytherapy is another adjuvant treatment and has effects on sclera， deeper than the topical mitomycin C. For extensive tumors， proton radiotherapy is used after excision and conjunctival mapping if patients refuse exenteration. At present， no effective systemic treatment is available for CM. Recent studies reported benefits of immunotherapy of CM using checkpoint inhibitors (like nivolumab or pembrolizumab)通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. In view ofthe high similaritybetween cutaneous melanoma and conjunctival melanoma， the efficacies of BRAF/MEK inhibitors are also being evaluated 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. We prescribed 0.02% mitomycin C three times daily instead of 0.04%regarding that higher dose was related to limbal stem cell failure in some cases. Our patient went through topical chemotherapy well and showed no melanoma recurrence in the following 35 months.\n\n【15】For CM， prognostic factors include tumor location， tumor thickness， andits origin and histopathology findings. Bulbar melanoma’s outcome is better than those involving other sites， like limbus， cornea， fornix， palpebral conjunctiva and caruncle. Tumors\n\n【16】>2 mm thick (as measured from epithelial surface to the substantia propria involved) have higher stagings and poorer prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. De novo melanoma develops metastasis and mortality worse than those arising from nevi or PAM with atypia. Histopathology involving epithelioid cells， pagetoid growth， absence of inflammatory response and lymphatic invasion are associated with a poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. In our present case， the tumor was located at palpebral conjunctiva， which is a site with unfavorable outcome. The pathology with pagetoid growth is also associated with poorer prognosis. Apart from the above conditions， our patient's tumor originated from PAM and was <2 mm thick， both of which are associated with a better outcome.\n\n【17】Very few case reports and series of CM are available for Chinese and other Asians. Compared to Caucasians， Chinese patients tend to have poorer prognosis with the younger population， with more cases of de novo origin， or located at the non-bulbar area， showing multifocal lesions， more metastases and tumor related deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Another study on Asian Indians showed the same trend of younger patients， more de novo in origin， and metastasis rate higher than Caucasians， but with fewer local recurrences and more incidents of bulbar melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[151</u>.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】CM in Chinese is found more often in the non-bulbar area with poorer prognosis compared with Caucasians. There are very few studies on the treatment and reconstruction of palpebral CM. We here reported a new and simple surgical technique that achieved good disease control without grafting and donor site wound， as well as desirable cosmetic results. More cases and longer follow-up periods are needed to assess long-term outcomes.\n\n【20】Ethical Approval Statement\n\n【21】All procedures performed in studies involving human participant were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.

She had severe asthmatic attacks without complete recovery while using an inhaled bronchodilator together with inhaled steroid continuously. Her family was living in Iraq. Vital signs were stable. The patient had blisters with erosion and scar formation on the skin，especially at the pressure sites on the patient's extremities. Her toenails and fingernails were thickened and dystrophic. The patient had no respiratory distress on examination， however， inspiratory stridor was determined instead of expiratory wheezing. Laryngoscopic examination was performed in surgery and an inflammatory abscess was detected on the vocal cords.\n\n【3】Conclusion： A patient with an abscess on the vocal cords because of infected blisters due to DEB is presented.\n\n【4】Keywords： Children； Childhood； Dystropic epidermolysis bullosa\n\n【5】Introduction\n\nEpidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a rare hereditary disease characterized by widespread blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. In patientssuffering fromEB，trauma or friction causes separationof the skin from underlying tissue resulting in consecutive painful blisters， scarifications， contractures， and pseudosyndactyly. The prevalence of EB is reported as 11.07 cases in United States， 54 cases in Norway，7.8 cases in Japan， 15.4 cases in Italy， 10.3 cases in Australia and 9.6 cases in Croatia per one million live births 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. EB of the skin results from genetic defects in molecules related to adhesion withloss of adhesion resulting in blister formation. These may occur anywhere on the body but most commonlyappear at friction and minor trauma sites such as the feet and hands. In some subtypes， blisters may also occur on internal organs， such as the esophagus and respiratory tract. The mode of inheritance may be autosomal dominant or recessive but all forms of dystrophic EB (DEB) result from mutations in the gene encoding type VII collagen， COL7A1 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. EB can be described as a genodermatosis. There are three major types of EB based on the site of blister formation within the skin： EB Simplex (EBS)， Junctional EB (JEB) and DEB. EBS results from mutations within either the keratin 5 or keratin 14 gene. JEB-Herlitz (JEB-H) is caused by severe mutations within any of the three genes which encode for laminin删除4-1:<u>-332</u>. A minority of non-Herlitz JEB (JEB-nH) have mutations within the gene encoding for type XVII collagen. However， in DEB，there are no mutations hotspots within the COL7A1 gene. Every family with DEB has its own unique type of mutation. If there is a mutations known in the family， It would facilitate in DNA mutational analysis， especially for prenatal diagnoses using specimens obtained from chorionic villi 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The site of blister formation within skin in DEB is the lamina densa and upper dermis. Mild pseudosyndactyly or flexion contractures of the fingers are present in 6% of those with autosomal dominant DEB. The frequency of Dominant DEB (DDEB) was 68%， with 19% of uncertain inheritance and 13% of recessive DEB (RDEB) 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The prognosis depends on the subtype of the disease. Infants and children with inherited EB，particularly those with JEB， are at significant risk of death as a result of complications通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Cases with EBS and DDEB have normal life expectancies with significant morbidity. Diagnostic tests are biopsy of a blister on the skin or mucous membranes which involves Immunofluorescence Antigen Mapping (IFM) and/or Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，6]</u>. The diagnosis of EB is most obvious for physicians experienced in dermatology. However， some cases will need differential diagnosis. Any blistering disorder in the newborn period may mimic EB. These include|删除段之间换行|Herpes simplex virus， epidermolytic ichthyosis， bullous impetigo and incontinentia pigmenti. Acquired disorders for differential diagnosis are immunobullous disorders， EB acquisita， Linear IgA dermatosis， bullous pemphigoid， cicatricial pemphigoid， pemphigus， infectious diseases， Herpes simplex， staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and bullous impetigo 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【7】Currently， there is no cure for EB. The most important issues in basic care are prevention of blistering and secondary infection of blisters Band-aids， bandages， or tape should not be used on the skin. Skin fragility is characteristically worsened in warm weather. Patients should avoid exposure to heat and humidity. If possible， air conditioned environments should be recommended. Hand deformities can be prevented by meticulous nightly wrapping of the digits. If not performed， surgical procedures will be necessary. There are some experimental approaches； Ex Vivo replacement for autosomal recessive EB， transplantation of allogeneic fibroblasts for RDEB，transplantation of bone marrow-derived stem cells or infusion of recombinant protein (i.e.， type VII collagen for RDEB) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The mucous membranes can also be involved in DEB. The highest risk of upper airway strictures and obstruction occurs in JEB-H. Recurrent esophageal blistering and erosions can lead to stricture formation通用删除6(英):<u>[3，7，8]</u>. However， laryngotracheal involvement is rare in DEB. This case report presents involvement of the vocal cords in DEB in a 4-vear old girl complaining about recurrent respiratory distress.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】The patient had been experiencing episodes of respiratory problems for a longtime and occasionally had severe asthmatic attacks without complete recovery. She was using an inhaled bronchodilator删除1换行together with inhaled steroid continuously. In her family history， her maternal uncle had the same findings since birth. She was the fourth children of the same parents and other children in the family did not have any problems. Her family was living in Iraq and she was admitted to a different hospital for respiratory distress which never completely resolved. The patient was 4-years old when admitted to the pediatric clinic in Baskent University Hospital， Istanbul (Turkey). An examination revealed stable vital signs. The recurrent respiratory distress， skin fragility and nail abnormalities were major complaints. On examination， her weight was 15，500g and height was 101 cm. Failure to thrive and growth retardation were not determined. On inspection， the patient had blisters with erosion and scar formation on the skin， especially on the pressure sites ofher extremities . In the case presented here， blister scars were commonly observed on the feet and hands at pressure sites of friction and minor trauma. She had significant dental decay in the mouth. Her toenails and fingernails were thickened and dystrophic. Milia were not present. The patient had no respiratory distress on examination； however， inspiratory stridor was determined instead of expiratory wheezing. She had used inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled steroids continuously for a long time. She may have complained of long-standing stridor， but not asthmatic attacks. She had minor lymphadenopathies. On auscultation， cardiac pansystolic murmur was determined. An atrial septal defect was diagnosed by a cardiologist. Chest radiography was completed， blood tests including CBC， BUN， creatinine， AST， ALT and urinalysis were evaluated as normal. She did not have anemia.\n\n【10】She was admitted to our hospital for laryngoscopic examination with anesthesia. The mucous membrane in the moth and oropharynx were normal. Laryngoscopic examination was performed by an otolaryngologist in surgery in order to check the supraglottic structures， vocal cords or trachea in terms of separation ofthe mucous membranes from underlying tissue with minor trauma. The fragility of mucous membranes can make laryngoscopic examination risky because shedding by the blisters might be expected to produce upper airway obstruction or strictures of upper airways. The clinicians were aware of the risks. Similar lesions to those on the skin were observed in the larynx and an inflammatory abscess was identified on the vocal cords. Infected materials and tissue in the blister were aspirated and sent to the pathology department. Two hours later， severe respiratory distress suddenly occured because of upper airway obstruction due to shedding of blisters. She was administered oxygen therapy for two hours， recovered with coughing attacks， was monitored for one whole day and then discharged. She was monitored for one week before returning to her country. Pathologic evaluation revealed blister cleavage below the basal lamina and subepithelial separation. Supportive therapies， future risks and genetic basis of this disease were explained to her parents. Genetic analysis could not be performed.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】DEB is a rare hereditary disease involving the skin. However， certain types of EB can also affect the respiratory system. Involvement ofthe oropharynx is more commonthan laryngotracheal involvement. Even if mucous membrane involvement is extensive， airway obstruction does not contribute to mortality in these patients. Recurrent respiratory distress has been wrongly interpreted as asthmatic attacks in some children with EB. A child suffering from inspiratory stridor was diagnosed with a blister abscess on the vocal cords in EB and is presented as a rare case in our paper.\n\n【13】Collagen VII anchoring fibrils are a component of the airway basal membrane. They are an integral part of the supracellular anchoring network that attaches the epithelium to the extracellular matrix. Reduction of collagen VII in EB is associated with sloughing of epithelium 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. This means that respiratory tract involvement can be found in certain types of EB. Lesions can be detected on the mucosa of the respiratory tract from the oral cavity to the bronchi. The oral cavity and oropharynx are involved more frequently than the hypopharynx， larynx and trachea. Involvement of laryngeal and tracheal mucosa is generally associated with increased morbidity and mortality， complications and therapeutic difficulties 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. These are more common in JEB and DEB than in EBS 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. JEB may involve the upper airway， especially in JEB-H. Granulation tissue which is a pathognomonic finding in JEB-H was not present in our patient. In DDEB， blistering is often mild and limited to hands， feet， knees， and elbows， but nonetheless heals with scarring. Dystrophic nails are common and may be the only manifestation of DDEB 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In our case， toenails and fingernails were thickened and dystrophic. Failure to thrive， growth retardation and severe anemia which are characteristic features of RDEB and JEB-H were not determined in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The patient was diagnosed as having dominant DEB on the basis of clinical， familial and histological findings). The diagnosis was supported by biopsy .\n\n【14】Laryngotracheal involvement should be considered for EB in any child presenting with symptoms of respiratory distress and laryngoscopic examination should be considered and performed in the operating room by an otolaryngologist. However， clinicians should be aware of the risks of shedding by the blisters due to the endoscopy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The sensory abnormality is a predominant symptom of herpes zoster virus infection， whereas， motor neuropathy， although uncommon， can also occur in this infection. Segmental zoster abdominal paresis is one of the rare motor complications， mimicking an abdominal hernia. But unlike from the real abdominal wall hernia， it needs no surgery. Here， we report a case with an abdominal protrusion， with typical skin lesions due to Herpes zoster (Hz).\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 50-year-old woman presented with pain on the right side of her lower abdomen for three days， sometimes radiating to the right lumbar fossa. She noticed abnormal swelling on the right side of her abdomen， with hyperesthesia. She had a history of thyroid cancer with surgery in 2020. The patient had no other comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus or hernias. One month earlier， she had received her second injection of SPIKEVAX vaccine against COVID-19. The examination in the supine position  triggered a pain with pressure on the McBurney point. On standing examination， a prominent bulge 10 cm to 15 cm in diameter was present on the right side of the abdomen . The area was hyperesthetic to the touch. Abdominal reflexes were absent on the right side. Skin examination showed a papular， erythematous lesion in the right lumbar region， suggestive of herpes zoster. Treatment with valaciclovir and pregabalin was initiated. Routine laboratory tests were normal， and HIV serology was negative. An abdominal CT scan was performed， which showed no evidence of a Spigelian hernia in the right anterolateral abdominal wall. Thoracic and lumbar MRI showed no lesions in the anterior horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【7】Discussion/Conclusion\n\n【8】In 1895， Taylor described for the first time a segmental abdominal zoster paresis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Since then， only a few similar cases have been described. Herpes zoster mainly affects the sensory nervous system and motor deficits are uncommon and mainly involve the muscles of the head. Abdominal pseudohernia due to segmental denervation is rare， probably because of overlapping innervation. The pathogenesis is thought to be due to a direct viral infection spreading from the dorsal root ganglion to the cells of the anterior horn. Abdominal wall paralysis can be caused by a variety of conditions affecting the peripheral nerves that innervate the abdominal muscles， including Hz， diabetes， lumbar disc herniation or spinal cord injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.

AMR limits the number of therapeutic options， increases morbidity and mortality， lengthens hospitalization and treatment， and places a tremendous burden on healthcare systems and society in general. Annual direct and indirect costs reach approximately 61.5 billion in the EU 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-4]</u>. In 2019， the World Health Organization (WHO) outlined AMR as one of the10 top threats to global health， alongside air pollution and climate change， non-communicable diseases， vaccine hesitancy and others 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. In 2014 the magnitude of the attributable to AMR threat corresponded to 700，000 deaths per year worldwide and is estimated to reach 10 million by 2050 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【9】Inappropriate prescribing is recognized as the factor contributing the most to the development of AMR， especially in primary healthcare 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-9]</u>. Moreover， irrational use of antibiotics is driven by several influential factors such as fear of complications， lack of information， excessive and unnecessary antibiotic prescribing， incorrect dosage or route of administration， antibiotic prescribing for non-bacterial infections， patient demands and self-prescribing 通用删除6(英):<u>[8-10]</u>. Therefore， antimicrobial resistance is an emerging health threat worldwide， making rational antibiotic use an urgent necessity 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>.\n\n【10】Physicians are responsible for making prescribing decisions as well as for the selection of删除1换行the type of antibiotic. Their knowledge， attitudes， believes and perceptions towards antibiotics’ use and resistance are likely to influence their prescribing behavior. Studies have indicated that the fear of complications from infections， the complacent attitude towards patients and the insufficient knowledge regarding AMR are the most significant factors related to antibiotics’ prescribing by physicians 通用删除6(英):<u>[13-15]</u>. It is worth noting here that several studies have shown that physicians generally consider AMR to be a serious global and/or national problem， but not a problem that they are facing in their everyday practice 通用删除6(英):<u>[16，17]</u>. In order to contain the antimicrobial resistance issue，changes in the physicians prescribingbehaviorwould be required regarding their knowledge， awareness and considerations on AMR Any changes introduced in the physicians’ clinical practice and prescribing behavior would obviously contribute to the development of more effective interventions on AMR containment删除4-1:<u>18，19</u>.\n\n【11】Both antimicrobial consumption and resistance are very high in Greece， ranking the country among the highest in Europe. More specifically， Greece is among the top three European countries at the greatest risk and is expected to experience the highest mortality rates by 2050 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Several regulatory measures for the control of antibiotic use and physician prescribing have been implemented by the government at the outpatient and inpatient care， such as e-prescribing， antibiotic prescription guidance and inspection， patient electronic health record， publication of therapeutic protocols and guidelines， ban of over-the-counter antibiotic dispensing from pharmacists 通用删除6(英):<u>[21-24]</u>. However， it seems that no progress has been achieved and the problems still remain. Thus， the aim of this study was to evaluate primary health care physicians’ knowledge and perceptions on antimicrobial resistance and irrational prescribing.\n\n【12】Methodology\n\n【13】A cross-sectional study was conducted in all Primary Healthcare settings (PHC) of the Peloponnese district. The district includes34 healthcare settings and specifically， Health Centers (HC)， Rural Health Centers (RHC)， and Local Health Units (TOMY)， providing explicit primary health care to 1.046.897 residents 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. Outpatient private physicians and consultation offices were excluded from the analysis， given that they do not belong to the NHS. At the period of the study 404 physicians were employed. Before the initiation of the survey， permission was given by the 6h regional health authority as well as by the ethics committee of the University of Peloponnese. The survey was conducted from May to October 2020.\n\n【14】An anonymous， self-administered and updated questionnaire was structured based on previous Greek studies focused on hospital care 通用删除6(英):<u>[26-29]</u>. The tool was distributed to PHC physicians and included questions related to their’ demographic and occupational characteristics as well as on their attitudes， knowledge and beliefs towards AMR and irrational prescribing. The answers are given at a four-point Likert scale， where 1 corresponds to \"very important\"and 4 to \"not important\"， while the remainder of the questions was multiple-choice.\n\n【15】Statistical analysis\n\n【16】Mean values and Standard Deviation (SD) for the quantitative and percentages for qualitative variables were used in the descriptive analysis. The data was not normally distributed， so nonparametric tests were used. The Chi-Square test was performed in order to investigate whether there is any relation between the categorical删除1换行variables. The Mann-Whitney U test was performed in order to compare statistically significant differences between two independent groups and the Kruskal-Wallis test for comparing among three or more groups. Levels of significance were two-tailed and statistical significance was set to p=0.05. The SPSS 25.0 software was used for statisticalanalysis.\n\n【17】Case Presentation\n\n【18】Overall， 306 out of 404 physicians  responded to the questionnaire， reaching a 75.8% response rate. The majority(52.6%) was male with a mean age of 40.7±11.1 years and 60.8%were General Practitioners (GPs). In addition， 24.5% of participants had a postgraduate degree and 53.8% more than 11 years of work experience. As shown in Figure 1， the majority of respondents (96%) stated that antimicrobial resistance is a major public health problem in Greece. Also， irrational prescribing， self-medication， antibiotic administration from pharmacists without prescription and the extended use of broad-spectrum antibiotics were declared as the most important causes of AMR.\n\n【19】According to our results， statistically significant differences were found between participant's socio-demographic and occupational data and their perceptions on AMR. As shown in Table 2， women were more likely than men to consider that bad hand hygiene and antibiotic administration from pharmacists without a prescription were important causes of AMR. Moreover， internal medicine physicians and GPs were more likely to believe that bad hand hygiene was an important cause of AMR compared to physicians with other specialties.\n\n【20】As far as antibiotic abuse is concerned， physicians were asked to prioritize the implications observed， as shown in Figure 2. As first implication was reported the antimicrobial resistance followed by the destruction of beneficial bacteria and weakening of immunity as well as the allergic reactions and last common events， such as diarrhea， Table 1： Physicians socio-demographic characteristics.\n\n| Sample characteristics  | No  | Percentages (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gender  |  |  |\n| Male  | 160  | 52.6  |\n| Female  | 144  | 47.4  |\n| Age group  |  |  |\n| ≤40 years  | 117  | 40.2  |\n| ≥41 years  | 174  | 59.8  |\n| Physicians' Specialties  |  |  |\n| General Practitioners (GPs)  | 186  | 60.8  |\n| Pediatricians  | 32  | 10.5  |\n| Neurologists， pneumonologists， cardiologists  | 25  | 8.2  |\n| Internal medicine physicians  | 14  | 4.6  |\n| Rural physicians (non-specialized)  | 49  | 16  |\n| Total No. of Physicians  | 306  | 100  |\n| Postgraduate qualifications  |  |  |\n| None  | 231  | 75.5  |\n| MSc/PhD  | 75  | 24.5  |\n| Years of work experience  |  |  |\n| ≤ 10 years  | 133  | 46.2  |\n| ≥11 years  | 155  | 53.8  |\n\n【22】vomiting， etc.\n\n【23】(p=0.031). Furthermore， GPs considered that the lack of inspection was a significant cause of irrational prescribing， as already shown in Table 2.\n\nDiagnostic uncertainty stated by 68.9% of respondents， followed by patient/parent satisfaction (55.4%)， lack of inspection upon prescribing (21.4%)， workload (20.8%) and guided prescribing(17.0%) were reported by PHC physicians as the main causes of irrational prescribing. Also， 65% of men declared the workload of higher importance of irrational prescribing than 35% of women|删除段之间换行|In Figure 3， participants' perceptions on the measures that should be taken to control irrational prescribing are presented. The use of therapeutic protocols and international guidelines was found to be of highest importance， followed by the prescription-focused education删除表格换行as well as the regular and systematic inspection of prescriptions. As far as the economic burden of irrational prescribing， 55.5% of respondents highlighted its high cost， 35.7% moderate， while 5.2%reported it as low and 3.6% didn't know.\n\n【25】Table 2： Physicians' perception on the causes of AMR and irrational prescribing.\n\n|  | Bad hand hygiene  | Antibiotic administrationfrom pharmacists without aprescription  | Lack of inspectionupon prescribing  | Prescription-focusededucation  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | mean (S.D)  |  | %  | mean (S.D)  |\n| Gender  |  |  |  |  |\n| Male  | 2.6±0.9  | 1.5±06  |  |  |\n| Female  | 2.3±0.9  | 1.3±05  |  |  |\n| P value  | 0.042  | 0.011  |  |  |\n| Physicians Specialty  |  |  |  |  |\n| General practitioners (GPs)  | 2.4(0.9)  |  | 47.50%  | 1.7(0.7)  |\n| Pediatricians  | 2.6(1.0)  |  | 18.00%  | 2.1(0.8)  |\n| Neurologists， pneumonologists， cardiologists  | 3.0(1.0)  |  | 13.10%  | 1.9(0.6)  |\n| Internal medicine physicians  | 2.2(1.1)  |  | 6.60%  | 2.0(1.0)  |\n| Rural physicians (non-specialized)  | 2.5(0.9)  |  | 14.80%  | 2.1(1.0)  |\n| Pvalue  | 0.048  |  | 0.032  | 0.033  |\n\n【27】In addition， it should be noted that the causes of irrational prescribingVwere relatedwith physicians’Sdemographicand occupational characteristics. More specifically， women (1.2±0.5， p=0.004) were more likely than men (1.4±0.6 and 2.5±1) to believe that the use of therapeutic protocols and international guidelines as well as the extension of etiological prescribing (2.1±1，p=0.002) could contribute to the decrease of irrational prescribing. Furthermore， GPs were more likely to consider that prescription-focused education删除1换行could significantly contribute to the decrease ofirrational prescribing than physicians of other specialties .\n\n【28】Discussion\n\n【29】The aim of the study was to assess the PHC physicians'knowledge and perceptions on antibiotic resistance and irrational prescribing in the region of Peloponnese.\n\n【30】According to our results， the majority of PHC physicians highlighted AMR as a serious public health problem in the country. They reported irrational prescribing， self-medication， antibiotic administration from pharmacists without a prescription and the extended use of broad-spectrum antibiotics， as the main causes of删除1换行antimicrobial resistance. However， it seems that they are not well informed about the other AMR contributors， such as the extended antimicrobial therapy and bad hand hygiene. In addition， they declared the existence of therapeutic protocols and guidelines as well as the prescription focused education as the most effective measures for the reduction of irrational prescribing.\n\n【31】Physicians' high levels of AMR awareness and recognition as a serious public health issue are also reported in the study of Zetts et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> conducted in primary health care settings in the United States， as well as in other studies focused on hospital care 通用删除6(英):<u>[27，31-33]</u>. On the contrary，lower levels were found in the study of Nicholson et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>， where as hospital physicians' recognition of AMR as a serious public health problem reached 70%. Also， in the survey of Labi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>， conducted in a tertiary care hospital，physicians AMR awareness was estimated at 9%. It seems that the misconception toward the severity of the impact of AMR leads to complacency and distancing from this public health threat that obviously influences physicians prescribing attitudes.\n\n【32】In addition， the influence of widespread and inappropriate use as well as the overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics， are also reported by physicians as major AMR drivers in several studies in primary and secondary health settings 通用删除6(英):<u>[34，36，37]</u>. Furthermore， antibiotics’ self-medication and dispensing from pharmacist without a prescription are also reported as significant AMR factors by Rather 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>. It should be noted that in Greece， dispensing from pharmacists of any over the counter antibiotic substance is forbidden 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>， in an effort to restrict self-medication practices.\n\n【33】Bad hand hygiene as a less important cause of AMR seems to be another common finding in the international literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，39，40]</u>， despite the fact that hand hygiene WHO guidelines， are provided to health-care workers and stakeholders with a thorough review of evidence on hand hygiene contribution to reduce transmission of resistant pathogenic 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>. Hand hygiene as a significant AMR prevention measure is identified by almost one out of two respondents in several studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[34，37]</u>. Therefore， the slow endorsement of poor hand hygiene as an AMR contributor may also reflect the lack of physicians’ awareness on the effectiveness of this simple and yet underused practice. Thus， the elimination of such misconceptions might be a prerequisite for effectively combating resistance.\n\n【34】Diagnostic uncertainty as the main cause of physicians irrational prescribing in the primary and secondary healthcare settings， is also demonstrated by studies of Kotwani & Holloway and Geitona et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[28，41]</u>. The fear oftreatment failure could be minimized using Point of Care (POC) tests which can significantly contribute to the decrease of diagnostic uncertainty through ruling out the possibility of viral infections and consequently， the administration of antibiotic therapy通用删除6(英):<u>[42，43]</u>. Furthermore， patient demand and parents' satisfaction are documented as important factors of irrational prescribing in the internationalliterature 通用删除6(英):<u>[28，44-46]</u>. In these studies， the inappropriate use ofantibiotics was found to arise from the behavior of both patients and physicians， indicating that prescribers are sometimes influenced by patient's request， especially on the ground of workload and lack of time. Also， another factor contributing to the irrational prescribing， widely documented in the internationally literature， is the influence that the industry can impose on physicians 通用删除6(英):<u>[47，48]</u>.\n\n【35】Finally， our findings are also consistent with several surveys regarding the measures that could mostly contribute to the control删除1换行and decrease ofirrational prescribing 通用删除6(英):<u>[34，41，46]</u>. These studies report that interventions such as protocols and international guidelines， prescription-focused education and conferences， promote voluntary changes in prescribing behavior and offer the additional advantage of prescribing support to physicians who are insecure about optimal antibiotic use.\n\n【36】Study Limitations\n\n【37】In the current study， there are some limitations that should be discussed. Despite the fact that our sample is representative to Peloponnese region， our findings cannot be generalized in the country. Thus， further similar studies are needed， also extended in other regions of Greece. Additionally， subjective response and recall bias， inherent in all questionnaire-based researches， should be considered as limitations.\n\n【38】Conclusion\n\n【39】Primary healthcare physicians in Greece seem to be aware of AMR as a public health problem and recognize irrational prescribing， self-medication， the over-the-counter antibiotic administration as well as the extended use of broad-spectrum antibiotics as the main contributors to antimicrobial resistance. However， important infection control measures like hand hygiene， tend to be underestimated. Therapeutic protocols/guidelines and continuing education are illustrated as the most significant measures needed for the AMR control in order to decrease diagnostic uncertainty and improve prescribing practices.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However， it may not always be the case when confronting systemic diseases， particularly Autoimmune Connective Tissue Diseases (AICTD). Conditions characterized by the presence of clinical and serological manifestations suggestive of an autoimmune connective tissue disease， but without eventual progression to a full blown specific AICTD is not unusual in clinical practice.\n\n【2】Keywords： Scleroderma； MCTD； SLE\n\n【3】Case Representation\n\nA 24-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a history of severe abdominal pain that started suddenly and was continuous. It was associated with high grade fever， chills and an episode of vomiting. With further questioning， patient stated that 2 months prior to admission， he noticed several different skin changes on his body. These changes started as red non-itching pimples on his face， and then spread to involve the trunk， back and limbs. Later， he noted that his facial skin became tight and with time felt that it also became puffy. The skin tightening of his face lead to changes such as an inward lip retraction as if he had done plastic surgery to his face as per the patient. There was a long-term history of multiple oral ulcers， throat pain and difficulty in swallowing with a total of 5 kg weight loss within three months. Furthermore， he described a 2-years history of bluish discoloration of his fingers when exposed to cold， which he ignored， thinking it was a normal feature of his skin. On physical examination revealed obvious skin pigmentation on his face and a low-grade fever. The facial pigmentation has a distribution of malar rash sparing the nasolabial folds. There are obvious changes to his face when compared to an old photo. His nose became broad and pointed. His lips became retracted . He had difficult and a limited mouth opening. Oropharyngeal examination revealed three ulcers of 2 mm to 3 mm diameter in the buccal mucosa. He has scattered hairless patches on his scalp . There was generalized erythematous rash with old discoid lesion involving neck， trunk and back . Patient had severe Raynaud's phenomenon resulted in digital scarring . When asked to write his name on a paper，he had difficulty in holding the pen and writing due to stiffness ofhis fingers. Other systems examinations were unremarkable. His complete blood count showed a low white blood|删除段之间换行|count 3.35×10° per liter (L) and a normal hemoglobin level 12.8 g/dL with a low platelet count 80，000×10/L. The alkaline phosphatase and Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) were elevated at 245 IU/L and 710 IU/L respectively. The Erythrocyte Sedimentation Ratio(ESR) was high 65 mm/h. The Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA) were positive 1：320 with speckled pattern. Furthermore， his serological panel showed a positive RO (SS-A)， LA (SS-B)， SCL-70 and Anti U1 RN. Normal renal function test and complement levels. The computed tomography of the chest showed an interstitial thickening with a multiple peripherally located bilateral faint nodules of ground glass haziness. No pleural or pericardial effusion seen with a multiple bilateral axillary as well as mediastinal lymph nodes. These findings were suggestive of non-specific interstitial pneumonia . The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) T2 fat suppression images of both proximal and middle thighs showed no evidence of myositis . Ultrasound images of kidneys showed a bilateral increased echogenicity， especially over the medullas， suggestive of a parenchymal disease. His skin biopsy showed an interface dermatitis， which was not conclusive and has a wide differential diagnosis. The transthoracic echocardiography was done to assess pulmonary artery pressure， which revealed a normal left ventricle function， normal right ventricular and pulmonary artery systolic pressure with no evidence of right sided chamber dilatation or pulmonary hypertension. The patient based on the clinical course， examination and results of laboratory results； we concluded that the patient has Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD).\n\n【5】Discussion\n\nMixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD) is a rare connective tissue disease with an autoimmunebackground. It was first introduced in 1972 by Gordon C. Sharp et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Sharp and Co. described MCTD as a distinct entity having a combination of clinical features of systemic lupus erythematous， scleroderma and polymyositis， with positive ENA and negative anti-SM 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. However， debate still exists regarding whether MCTD is a distinct entity， or just represents an overlap syndrome of multiple connective tissue diseases or even just the early phases of an evolving， more distinct CTD 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. MCTD|删除段之间换行|is a rare disease. A population based study from Olmsted Country； Minnesota found that MCTD occurred in about 2 persons per100，000 per year 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Studies were done in Norway and Japan revealed incidence estimated as 3.8 and 2.7 in 100，000 per year， respectively通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. MCTD is more common in Females than males with a ratio of 16：1. It can occur in any age group， but most commonly initial presentation is between 15 to 25 years of age. Symptoms of MCTD develop gradually and it usually takes around 1.7 years to establish a diagnosis from the first symptom， as was shown in a study by Swart and Wolfrat 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Cyanosis of hand especially after exposure to cold， as in our patient， is an important warning and indicator for possible future development of CTD. That fact was introduced30 years back by Golding， who believed that skin manifestations are involved in all cases of MCTD， with Raynaud phenomenon usually being the first 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>. Most common signs and symptoms of MCTD include the following with their frequency： Raynaud phenomenon(96% cumulatively， 74% at presentation)， arthralgia/arthritis (96%cumulatively， 68%a1 presentation)， esophageal上hypomotility(66% cumulatively， 9% at presentation)， pulmonary dysfunction(66% cumulatively， rare atpresentation)， swollen hands (66%cumulatively，45% at presentation)， myositis (51% cumulatively， 2%at presentation)， skin rash (53% cumulatively， 13% at presentation)， leukopenia (53% cumulatively， 9% at presentation)， sclerodactyly(49% cumulatively， 11% at presentation)， pleuritis/pericarditis (43%cumulatively， 19% at presentation)， and pulmonary hypertension(23% cumulatively， rare at presentation). It is noteworthy that none of the features mentioned above are unique for MCTD， which makes establishing a diagnosis challenging， especially in the early phase. To investigate a case with suspected MCTD， most important laboratory request is an anti-U1RNP antibody by hemagglutination test， since删除1换行it is highly characteristic for MCTD 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Other lab manifestations删除1换行include anemia， leucopenia， and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate，hypergammaglobulinemia in 100% of patients， positive coombs test， and rheumatoid factor positive in 50% to 70% of patients. Antinuclear antibody positivity is seen in 100% of patients in high titer with coarse speckled pattern. Many patients make antibodies directed against hnRNP-A2， fibrillin-1， and nucleosomes， but not against RNA polymerases. The absence of anti-Some antibodies and anti-DNA antibodies in a seropositive patient for anti U1RNP is very important to distinguish MCTD from SLE. Antiphospholipid antibodies occur， but are less common than in those with SLE. Several criteria were set 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14]</u>. In all， auto antibodies were of significant value in diagnosis， management and prognosis. The presence of autoantibody to U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 70 kDa， also known as U1RNP， is required. There are several classification criteria is introduced for the diagnosis of MCTD including the Sharp criteria， Alarcon-Segovia Criteria， Kasukawa Criteria and Khan Criteria. The best performance was for Alarcon-Segnovia as described bv Amigus el al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> in 1996 with 62.5% sensitivity and 86.2% specificity通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Using the Alarcon-Segovia diagnostic criteria on our patient revealing a positive serology and three of the five clinical criteria were present， namely； Raynaud's phenomenon，acrosclerosis and myositis. In addition， the patient had dysphagia， skin eruption， alopecia， ulceration of distal finger parts. All of which supported the diagnosis of MCTD. Unfortunately， no control trials were done to guide the management of MCTD 通用删除6(英):<u>[15-17]</u>. The goals of the management are to control symptoms，maintain function and prevent complications such as pulmonary hypertension. For the most common manifestation， Raynaud phenomenon， the patient should be advised to keep his hands warm and to avoid injury， smoking and caffeine. Usage of calcium channel blocker can benefit by increasing blood flow. The preferred therapeutic option for pulmonary hypertension in MCTD is prostacyclin analogs， endothelial receptor antagonist e.g. bosentan， and phosphodiesterase inhibitors e.g. sildenafil can be used 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Furthermore， some of the aforementioned classes can also help in the management of digital ischemic ulcers. Prognosis of MCTD depends on organs involvement. High mortality rate is related to pulmonary hypertension and interstitial lung disease. In Norwegian nationwide cohort with a mean follow-up of 5.6 years， pulmonary hypertension was responsible for approximately 25% of all deaths in patients with MCTD. A Hungarian regional cohort study revealed that a total of50 patients developed pulmonary hypertension after a mean of 14.5years (± 3.7 years) following the diagnosis. In addition， PAH was reported to be the major cause of mortality， causing 41% of the deaths in the study 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，20]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Globally； numerous vaccines have been developed against COVID-19.In Europe and United states， four vaccines have been approved by the FDA. The Majority of people become Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech， although certainly side effect may occur， the benefit greatly outweigh the risks. Adverse cardiovascular side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine include myocarditis/pericarditis， Vaccine Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) and thromboses， which often related to low platelet levels and VITT in the setting.\n\n【2】Case Presentation (History/Examination)\n\n【3】A 60-year-old female presented to our Emergency Department (ED) after cardiopulmonary resuscitation due to asystole at home. She had been having progressive shortness of breath over 2to 3 Months that worsened acutely on the admission day with no significant past medical history. She got the COVID vaccination 3 times. On arrival to ED Patient was intubated. She was afebrile. An electrocardiogram was performed， which showed sinus rhythm with a left axis， normal intervals and negative T wave over II， III，aVFand V1-4. An arterial blood gas showed the following results：pH 6.7 (normal 7.35-7.45)， pCO2 84 (normal 37 mmHg to 43 mmHg)， bicarbonate 6.5 (normal22 mmol/L to 26 mmol/L)，lactate 14 (normal 0.5 mmol/L to 2.5 mmol/L)， sodium 137 (normal134 mmol/L to 144 mmol/L)， potassium 3.8 (normal： 3.5 mmol/L to 5.5 mmol/L)， and anion gap21.9 mmol/L. There was an absence of ketones in the urinary dipstick， but positive for protein and glucose. Laboratory evaluation revealed markedly elevated creatinine level at 2.2 (normal： 0.7 mg/dl to 1.1 mg/dl) and hs-TNI at 2480 ng/l (normal： 2.3 ng/l to 11.6 ng/l). Takutsubo Cardiomyopathy was ruled out with Cardrio-MRT and ventriculography. The patient underwent a chest Computed Tomography (CT) scan that revealed bilateral pleural effusion without pulmonary embolism. Coronary angiogram was without a significant epicardial coronary artery disease. For further evaluation we measured the microcirculatory resistance (IMR=52) and Coronary Flow Reverse(CFR=1.3) which were pathologic. She was immediately started with CVVHDF and after that with the dialysis 3 times weekly for six weeks， which could be stopped， because the GFR was 61ml/min/m’， urine output >100 ml/h and creatinine 1.3 mg/dl. Because of the unclear cause of her accelerated decrease in kidney function with need for the continuous dialysis a kidney biopsy was performed that showed microthrombi and lymphatic infiltrates as an expression of vaccination damage. Brain CT performed on the first day of admission showed a subacute medullary lesion on the left periventricular side. The Brain MR showed multiple small subacute ischemia's， mainly in the centrum semiovale bds.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】The cardiovascular complications have been reported with both COVID-19 and its vaccination通用删除6(英):<u>[1-8]</u>. Vaccination has a significant effort on the prevention of severe SARS-CoV-19 infect and its complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-9]</u>.

Seven cases appeared in 37-dayperiod in premature babies and one died. GLB appeared on average 18 days postnatally， when enteral feeding reached 130 ml/kg/day. The first symptoms were seen 2.4 days before diagnosis， including abdominal distension， vomiting and regurgitation of curd milk. Diagnosis was made by X-ray in each case. Treatment was medical for three cases and surgical in four cases. Prematurity， consumption of Premature Formula milk (PF)，enhanced caloric density， and combining PF with medium chain triglycerides were the main predisposing factors.\n\n【2】Keywords： Bezoar； Newborn； West indies； Enterocolitis； Necrotizing； Enteral nutrition\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】A bezoar is a trapped mass located in the gastrointestinal system， usually in the stomach， classified according to its major constituents： trichobezoar (hair)， phytobezoar (plant material)and lactobezoar (milk). A lactobezoar is an aggregation of mucus with undigested milk constituents. There are several factors that are associated with increased likelihood of lactobezoar formation， including prematurity， low birth weight， an immature gastro-intestinal tract， dehydration， and enteral nutrition with formulas that have a high caloric density or that contain casein or Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Lactobezoar may occur in full term babies that have been breastfed， but this has only been reported very rarely. Gastric Lactobezoar (GLB) is the most common type of bezoar but it is a rare pathology， only described in medical literature around 100 times since 1959通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Classical symptoms ofGLB are abdominal distension， emesis， diarrhea， and an abdominal mass. Diagnosis is most easily made by X-ray， which may show a large radio-opaque mass resembling a “sandwich loaf’ or “gingerbread”located in the stomach； this description is pathognomic for GLB. Diagnosis can otherwise be made using ultrasound， which should demonstrate a large， heterogeneous， hyperechoic mass in the stomach 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Medical treatment comprises discontinuation of oral feeding， intravenous fluids and parenteral nutrition， gastric lavage and N-acetyl-cysteine in order to encourage disintegration of the bezoar 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Sometimes， lactobezoar may result in gastric outlet obstruction and complications such intestinal pneumatosis that require surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，5]</u>.\n\n【5】In 2013 we saw seven cases of this rare neonatal pathology in a time period of just 37 days in our NICU. Four of the affected neonates required surgery and one died. This was a notable event not only for the severity of the outcomes and the rarity of such a cluster， but also that it was the first time we had seen this pathology in our unit since it opened in 1990， despite the fact that there had been no changes to our enteral feeding protocols for four years.\n\n【6】The aim of our study was to analyze each case individually to look for predisposing factors， as well as analyzing the nutritional process to find any anomalies in milk reconstitution or potential sources of contamination， in order to understand the cluster and to prevent further cases.\n\n【7】Case Series\n\n【8】A retrospective analysis was performed for all cases of GLB in our unit. Inclusion criteria for the analysis were defined as any patient with an abnormal radiological picture consistent with GLB， as well as one of the following： gastric perforation， necrotizing enterocolitis (according to删除表格换行of PF and MCT， giving a caloric density higher than 80 kcal/100ml.The rapid increase of high calorie enteral nutrition in the context of prematurity and immature gastrointestinal function could probably explain the sudden onset of this unfamiliar pathology in our unit.\n\n【9】Table 1： Cases of gastric lactobezoar： potential predisposing factors.\n\n| GA  | Type of diet  | Type of Milk  | Duration PF (d)  | Caloric density (Kcal/100 ml)  | ml/kg/d at diagnosis  | Duration MCT+PF(d)  | Surgery  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 27  | 删除8:<u>春 </u> | PF+HM  | 5  | 87  | 153  | 9  | Y  |\n| 30  | C+D  | PF  | 9  | 86  | 129  | 15  | Y  |\n| 33  | D  | PF  | 9  | 80  | 145  | 0  | Y  |\n| 36  | 删除8:<u>春 </u> | PF+HM  | 5  | 87  | 153  | 4  | Y  |\n| 32  | C+D  | PF+HM  | 3  | 80  | 120  | 2  | N  |\n| 33  | D  | PF  | 9  | 80  | 112  | 0  | N  |\n| 35  | D  | PF+HM  | 3  | 80  | 160  | 0  | N  |\n\n【11】GA： Gestational Age； C： Continuous enteral feeding； D： Discontinuous enteral feeding； PF： Premature formula； HM： Human Milk； MCT： Median Chain Triglyceride；Y：Yes； N：No；d： Day； Kcal/100 ml： Kilocalories per 100 milliliters； ml/kg/d： milliliters per kilogram per day删除1换行the modified Bell's stage) 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. We only included neonates that were hospitalized in our NICU (Fort de France， Martinique and French West Indies) between 1 July 2013 to 3m October 2013. We collected the following data for each patient： gestational age， birth weight and size， mode of delivery， neonatal resuscitation， type of nutrition(parenteral or enteral) at the time of diagnosis， abdominal signs at diagnosis (regurgitation， emesis， abdominal distension)， and the need for surgical intervention. We also collected data on some possible predisposing factors： whether enteral feeding was continuous or discontinuous， the type of milk used enteral supplementation， milk composition， use of MCT， discrepancy between the milk composition and medical prescription， possible sources for contamination， and bacteria cultured from the milk or patients. Descriptive statistics comprising counts and proportions， means， medians， were done as appropriate with Excel 2013. IRB approved the study.\n\n【12】Results\n\n【13】Description of cases\n\n【14】Seven cases were diagnosed in a 37 day period， from 24h August to 3r October 2013 . The affected neonates were all male and premature， ranging from extremely premature to moderately premature (mean： 32.3 GA； 27 to 36 GA). We did not find that the mode of delivery was a risk factor： four of the neonates were born by vaginal delivery and three by caesarean-section. Two ofthem required immediate resuscitation， both recovering within a few minutes. On average the diagnosis of GLB was made 18 days postnatally(minimum 5 days， maximum 56 days)； the first signs appeared 2.4days before diagnosis and commonly included abdominal distension， regurgitation and/or vomiting of curd milk (in 5 cases， 71%). X-ray imaging wasperformed in every case，showinga\"sandwichloaf image删除1换行which is pathognomicfor GLB . No gastric ultrasounds were performed because the X-ray results were sufficiently convincing. In terms of treatment， we initially used a medical approach： enteral nutrition was stopped and parenteral nutrition commenced， and we performed gastric lavage with N-acetyl-cysteine. Antibiotics were used in four cases due to suspicion of abdominal sepsis mimicking necrotising enterocolitis. These cases all required surgery as they did not respond despite best medical management. The diagnosis of GLB was confirmed during these surgeries by macroscopic observation. The least premature baby (36 GA) died of multiple organ failure a few days after surgery.\n\n【15】Potential predisposing factors\n\n【16】All the affected neonates were fed before their diagnosis by continuous or discontinuous enteral nutrition using reconstituted milk powder (premature formula，PF)； two of them had breastfeeding in complement. In addition， four of them received MCT enterally(Liprocil). We analyzed the nutritional composition ofthe milk given to all babies in the unit and found no discrepancies between the milk given and the milk prescribed. The typical composition of the PF milk for the neonates on our unit was (by % of total mass) casein 14.5%， total protein 15.8%， with a protein/casein ratio of 0.069 and a sodium content of 0.39 d/100 ml. The diagnosis of GLB was made in these babies whilst the volume of their enteral feeds was being increased， occurring on average when the volume reached 130 ml/kg/day. Three out of the four babies who underwent surgery were fed with more than 80 kcal/kg/day with PF supplemented by MCT . All of the bacterial cultures taken from milk bottles and the affected children's secretions or blood were negative. We did not identify any sources of contamination in the neonatal unit.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】This is the first publication describing a GLB cluster. As it is a rare pathology it usually occurs as an isolated case， in different units and with a long timeframe which introduces many variables to consider. It was for this reason that we decided to investigate the cluster to understand what could be causing it， make changes to our protocols and stop this cluster as soon as possible. The death of one of our patients demonstrates the highly dangerous nature of the condition. It can be difficult to make a diagnosis of GLB because the clinical signs are commonplace in neonates， and many occur in perfectly healthy babies with no underlying pathology. However， early suspicion of GLB is imperative， as the pathology is severe and requires timely management， and the more severe signs that lead to diagnosis may be preceded by subtler clinical signs. The presence of both abdominal distension and vomiting/regurgitation of curd milk should indicate a possible diagnosis of GLB and should be investigated with imaging such as abdominal X-ray or ultrasound.\n\nThe severity and rare nature of the disease and the unusually high number of patients with the condition in our unit in a very short time frame required us to do some detective work to ascertain the most likely culprit. Due to the clinical presentation and the frequency of sepsis amongst the cases， we looked for a bacterial sepsis or contamination of the enteral nutrition that could have led to the formation of a GLB， but were unable to isolate any germs or likely sources of contamination. We then collected data from all the cases on all previously documented predisposing factors described in medical literature， in order to find out if one or more factors could be implicated in the onset of this cluster. Neither dehydration nor were electrolyte disturbances associated. However， we did find a correlation between other classical factors such as prematurity and use of Premature Formulas and MCT 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Interestingly， the more severe cases that required surgery were those fed with a combination|删除段之间换行|To make sure that there was no other explanation； we tracked a potential manufacturingerrorby precisely analyzing milkcomposition and eliminated this as a potential cause. An expert assessment of our enteral nutrition protocols didn’t show any difference between our protocols and international recommendations (European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN))通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. They did however hypothesise that the combination of PF and MCT (Liprocil) could have led to a saponification reaction favoring lactobezoar formation.\n\n【20】We favored this approach to enteral nutrition because in Martinique， as in many other parts of the French West Indies， many children are born with fetal growth restriction due to placental insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Thus， to improve their growth and future development， they are fed with an aggressive strategy， and enteral nutrition is introduced as soon as possible to avoid the risks of central line infection associated with parenteral nutrition 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Despite the risks associated with poor growth， the severity of GLB is such that we decided to change our enteral nutrition protocols. Since the cluster， we have modified our strategies， limiting enteral nutrition to <80kcal/100 ml，prohibiting the combination of MCT and PF， and using pasteurized maternal milk for all premature neonates born at <32 GA or weighing <1500 g.\n\n【21】Since introducing these changes， we have not had any further cases of GLB. To evaluate the impact of our new enteral nutrition protocol on the neonates in our unit， we are currently carrying out a study to analyze their growth and track any adverse effects.\n\n【22】Special thanks to Gemma Wells and Zoe Bothamley， University\n\n【23】删除3:<u>College London， Gower Street， Bloomsbury， London， WC1E 6BT， for proofreading and correction of the English version of this work.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In his history， his preoperative Tc-99m MDP bone scintigraphy， 10 months ago， showed multiple areas of osteoblastic uptake， markedly in the left iliac region， suggestive of multiple skeletal metastases and after that the radiotherapy was performed at the left iliac region， zoledronic acid and goserelin was administrated before his TUR-P operation.

The clinical course suggested that herbal tea gave some influences on the decline of insulin secretion or action. To clarify the causal relation among the herbal tea and the deterioration of insulin secretion or action， in vitro studies were done to examine direct influences of this herbal tea.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】The case 1 was 80-year-old male with obesity for several years. His weight was 91kg， height 169cm，BMI 31.9kg/m’， waist circumference 102 cm，%fat 30 %. The blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg after his home doctor prescribed calcium antagonist. The fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was 119 mg/dl， HbAlc 6.3%，total-cholesterol 191 mg/dl， triglyceride 135 mg/dl， AST 46 IU/l， ALT 43 IUA， and y-GTP 84 IU/. Ultrasonography indicated fatty liver. He started 3 packs/day of herbal tea (trade name： Chinese court anti-obesity tea) for weight reduction. A pack of this tea powder is dissolved in adequate amount of water. Nine days after the start， the tea was reduced from 3 packs/day to 1 pack/day because of diarrhea and was continued for 21 days. His weight was reduced to 81 kg within 3months after the start. On the other hand， his FPG abruptly rose to 549~595 mg/dl， HbA1c to 13.3%， and urine C-peptide reactivity (u-CPR) was 21 ug/day (normal； 24~97 ug/day) one or two months after starting the herbal tea . He stopped the herbal tea a month after the start. Thirty seven days after the stop of the herbal tea， he started and continued SU drug (60-20 mg gliclazide) for 3.5months. Then FPG was 131 mg/dl， HbAlc 7.2 % and u-CPR 327 ug/day. Even after the cessation of SU drug， HbA1c was 6.4-7% and u-CPR 99 ug/day.\n\n【7】The case 2 was 57-year-old female with mild obesity. She had acromegaly 14 years ago， when trans-sphenoidal surgery was done and bromocriptine was prescribed for a short period. The serum GH had been normalized to 0.4~0.7 ng/ml and IGF-I 220~240 ng/ml. Her weight was 77.5 kg， height 162 cm，BMI 29.5kg/m ， and blood pressure 110/62 mmHg. As shown in Table 2， FPG was118 mg/dl， IRI 8 uU/ml， and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) 2.23(normal：<1.6). She started and continued 2 packs/day of the same herbal tea for 1.5 months. Two or four months after the start， FPG gradually rose to 224 mg/dl， IRI 18 uIU/ml and HOMA-IR 9.96. Diabetes did not progress further but was not completely improved after the cessation of the herbal tea.

There was no particular cause except for the herbal tea to explain these changes. The case revealed fatty liver and showed mild elevation of liver enzyme， but no progression of liver dysfunction was found after the start. To elucidate whether the tea deteriorates insulin secretion directly， the in vitro study was done and the results suggested that the tea directly caused a decrease in insulin secretion from RIN-5F.\n\nIn the clinical course of the case 2， FPG was within normal range and rose to 225 mg/dl with HbAlc 8.5 % just after the start to drink the herbal tea. Plasma IRI and HOMA-IR is concomitantly increased， suggesting that the hyperglycemia is caused by decreased insulin sensitivity. This patient had acromegaly， but GH and IGF-I had been normalized.

MODY is the most common form of monogenic diabetes in Europe， accounting for 1% to 2% of all diabetes cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-5]</u>. Tattersall and Fajans proposed in 1975 as clinical criteria for the diagnosis of MODY， who were diagnosed with diabetes before the age of 25 and had diabetes in at least two or ideally three generation 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Some of the molecular pathways that cause MODY have been clarified in recent years improved genetic approaches.MODY is caused by at least fourteen separate genes， and various mutations have been discovered 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.MODY， like many other genetic diseases， is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and refers to a collection of disorders with a wide range of genetic， metabolic， and clinical features 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. MODY has been divided into 14 subtypes， each with its own set of symptoms in terms of gene mutation， onset age， therapy， and hyperglycemia pattern通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Mutations in the genes Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 Alpha (HNF4A)， Glucokinase (GCK)， and Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 Alpha (HNF1A) cause the most common types 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Borowiec discovered that B Lymphocyte Kinase (BLK) is a previously unknown modulator of insulin production and secretion that increases the expression of critical cell transcription factors PDX-1and NKX6.1 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Although case reports of many types of MODY have been published in recent years， this type of diabetes is still rare and much information about the phenotypic characteristics and pharmaceutical approach is unknown.\n\n【5】Mutations in the B Lymphocyte Tyrosine Kinase (BLK) locus are in the very rare group. It is an important point that the number of cases with this MODY type， which is defined as BLK 1 mutation， in other words MODY 11， is low and it has not been reported in childhood. Here， we present a case who presented with hyperglycemia and found a BLK-1 mutation in the follow-up.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】We present a 17-year-old patient who presented with complaints of polyuria， polydipsia and weight loss in the last two months. It was learned that the patient was born 3，600 grams after an uneventful pregnancy and did not have any health problems other than psoriasis until the date of admission. In his family history， it was learned that the mother of the patient was 42 years old，his father was 45 years old， his father was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 23， and his grandfather and aunt were also diagnosed with diabetes. Her grandfather and aunt first used insulin therapy and then followed up with oral antidiabetic. In the physical examination at the time of admission， no additional finding was found except for the height 161.4 cm (25-50p)， body weight 62.1kg (75-90 p)， Tanner stage 5， skin psoriasis lesions.

A regular treatment plan was established for type 1 diabetes， which included basal-bolus insulin . Table 1， 2 and Figure 1detail the patient's clinical features， blood parameters， and treatment at the initial medical examination. It was thought that MODY could be due to the negative autoantibodies， the diagnosis of diabetes in first-degree family members and the relatively low insulin value at the time ofhyperglycemia.\n\n【13】Genetic analysis and clinical follow-up\n\n【14】For analysis， the DNA of the case was isolated by standard procedure. BLK (NM001330465.2)： C.1081G>T  heterozygous mutation was detected by Sanger sequencing method. With the molecular confirmation of the diagnosis of BLK-MODY， insulin treatments were gradually discontinued in the patient and oral sulfonylurea treatment was started. Unfortunately， the sulfonylurea did not improve glycemic levels， so we adjusted treatment with basal insulin in addition to oral sulfonylurea. With this type of treatment plan， glycemic control is significantly improved. Long-acting insulin therapy only once a day was sufficient and blood glucose levels were not required to be measured before and after each meal. A year and a half passed from the first visit to fixed drug glycemic compensation. In the follow-up of the patient， no signs of hypoglycemia and no complications of diabetes developed. Since MODY is autosomal dominant， the patient was informed by her family. His brother and sister did not show any signs of hyperglycemia， and no mutations were found in genetic tests.\n\n【15】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【16】In today's world， Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) enables for the simultaneous sequencing of MODY-related genes. So， very quick results can be acquired at a cheaper cost. In young individuals who haven't insulin resistance and obesity， have a significant family history of diabetes， and with negative beta cell antibodies (although a few cases of MODY with positive autoimmunity have been recorded) Monogenic diabetes should be suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>. In today's world， Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) enables simultaneous sequencing of MODY-related genes. However， genetic testing is still expensive in most hospitals around the world and should only be requested in severe clinical suspicions 通用删除6(英):<u>[13-16]</u>.\n\n【17】To offer adequate prognostic information and regulate the best clinical care and pharmacological therapy for the patient， genetic testing and the discovery of the mutation at the root of the disease are required 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u>. Moreover， due to the autosomal dominant inheritance that characterizes MODY， all patients diagnosed with the MODY diagnose should get family therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. The therapy method varies depending on the clinical characteristics and biological reasons of the various kinds of MODY. Young people with maturity-onset diabetes can be treated for many years by diet alone， and sulfonylureas are also advised to be extremely helpful for maintaining glucose levels for many years 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Patients with GCK mutations normally do not删除1换行require treatment. Patients with HNF1 and HNF4 MODY are more susceptible to sulfonylureas， however they should be supplemented with insulin in the latter stages 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. In HNF1 MODY patients， those on insulin (7.5%) had higher mean A1C levels than those on oral medicines (6.7%). Sulfonylureas are frequently responsive in patients with HNF1 and HNF4 mutations. Low-dose sulfonylureas (20 mg to40 mg gliclazide on a regular basis) can let MODY patients live for decades 通用删除6(英):<u>[22，23]</u>. In HNF1 MODY patients， drugs such Nateglinide and Liraglutide reduce postprandial glucose levels 通用删除6(英):<u>[24，25]</u>. Although insulin might be required in some circumstances to provide better glucose control， some people with MODY benefit from oral hypoglycemic medications (e.g.， sulfonylureas) instead of insulin. The recommended treatment method for those with blk mutation is insulin， oral hypoglycemic agent and diet. We first started short and long-acting insulin therapy for our patient. We switched to oral sulfonylurea treatment after insulin requirement decreased. Since we could not provide adequate regulation， we combined long-acting insulin therapy with sulfonylurea and we were successful. BLK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the SRC family of proto-oncogenes that stimulates insulin production and release in pancreatic beta-cells by interacting with the transcription factors PDX1 and NKX6.1. A genome wide study of 21 extended United States families segregating autosomal dominant MODY not caused by known MODY genes carried out by Kim led finding locus on chromosome8p删除4-1:<u>23</u>. They discovered that diabetic patients with MODY linked to8p23 had a higher prevalence of obesity than diabetic patients with MODY linked to other loci. Mutations in BLK induced diabetes in three families，according to Borowiec. When we look at the literature， the MODY type with BLK mutation reported is very few. MODY should be a diagnosis that must be kept in mind in patients with close family members who have diabetes mellitus， who do not present with severe ketoacidosis despite hyperglycemia， and who have relatively low insulin levels.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Aberrant FAM83D expression was reported in multiple cancers. Here， we summarized the latest researches of FAM83D in recent five years， and discussed the relationship of FAM83D and cancer diagnosis， development and prognosis， aiming to provide new perspectives for the research of FAM83D in tumors.\n\n【2】Keywords： FAM83D；Malignant tumors； Tumor biomarkers\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The FAM83D gene (Family with sequence similarity 83 member D)， also named as CHICA or C200rf129， is located on chromosome 20 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. FAM83D is relative highly expressed during cell division，playing critical roles in mid-plate formation， regulatingthelocation ofhuman Chromokines in Kid to spindle during metaphase and sister chromatid separation 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. Loss of FAM83D leads to dysfunctional spindle， failure of chromatid separation and consequential generation of aneuploidy. Furthermore， researchers have found that FAM83D was co-expressed with many known mitosis-related factors， including Aurora-A， Aurora-B， Plk-1， Plk-4，Cdc20，Cdk1，Nek2， Geminin and CENP protein family， in types of cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. FAM83D belongs to FAM83 protein family (FAM83A-H)， whose functions had long been elusive. The proteins in FAM83 family share a common Domain of Unknown Function 1669 (DUF1669)， which has weak homology to Phospholipase D 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Phospholipase D has been widely investigated in cell proliferation and differentiation. Besides， database analysis showed that the expression level of FAM83D is negatively correlated with overall survival time in various types of cancers. Therefore， FAM83D is tightly related to cell division and may be correlated to cancer development. Here， we summarized the updated cancer-related studies of FAM83D and discuss the possibility of FAM83D as biomarker or target in cancer diagnosis or therapy.\n\n【5】FAM83D and Lung Cancer\n\n【6】Up to date， three independent researchers investigated the relationship of FAM83D expression and lung cancer development. First， through analysis of TCGA LUAD (Lung Adenocarcinoma) datasets， Shi R found that compared to adjacent normal tissues， LUAD tissues showed significant upregulation of FAM83D expression and higher FAM83D expression related to higher DNA ploidy， corresponding well to previous in vitro study that loss of FAM83D leads to aneuploidy. Besides， higher FAM83D expression was associated with shorter survival time. Finally， they performed in vitro assay and showed that FAM83D deficiency inhibited lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1299 proliferation and mobility 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Similarly， Yin C found elevated FAM83D expression levels in high invasive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and in the distant metastasis of clinical samples. Interestingly， they illustrated that FAM83D promoted Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in BEAS2B NSCLC cells but not in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cells， implying the discrepancy of FAM83D functions in different NSCLC cells. Additionally， they showed that FAM83D knockdown increases A549 and H1299 sensitivity to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The latest article concerning FAM83D and lung cancer found that circFOXM1 promote NSCLS development by sponging miR-614， and FAM83D was one of the targets of miR-614. Consequently， they conclude that circFOXM1/miR-614/FAM83D axis may regulate lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis in clinic and cell proliferation and progression in vitro and in vivo 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【7】FAM83D and Digestive System Cancer\n\n【8】In total， four independent researches concerned the relationship of FAM83D and liver cancer.\n\n【9】Table 1： Summary of the rale of FAM83D in cancers.\n\n| Cancer type  | No. of literaturereported  | In vitro  | In vivo  | Pathway regulated  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lung  | 3  | OE： promote growth， mobilityKD： increase sensitivity to cisplatin  | Higher expression in cancer tissues and relatec to shorter OS.  | influencing CCND1，CCNE1 expression  |\n| Liver  | 4  | OE： promotes growth， colonytormation.

KD： inhibits growth and invasion  | higher expression and negatively associatedwith the recurrence-free survival in TNBC， poor relapse-free survival and OS in Luminal A type， poor DFS.  | suppresses ERK phosphorylation；downregulates FBXW7 expression  |\n\n【11】In clinical research， Liao W found the positive correlation between FAM83D levels and Alpha-Fetoprotein Levels (AFP)， the clinical TNM stage and the presence of a Portal Vein Tumor Thrombus(PVTT)， while negative correlation with Disease Free Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS) times no matter in the collected unadjusted group or in adjusted groups according to diagnostic indicators. Soon afterwards， Lin B got the similar results by analyzing 150 clinic samples collected between 2006 and 2013 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Additionally， they found better outcomes of patients with lower FAM83D after liver transplantation. More recently， another research confirmed the role of FAM83D through analysis of TCGA and GEO 通用删除7(英):<u>(33006， 45436，84402)</u> datasets， demonstrating that compared to adjacent normal tissues， liver tumors exhibited higher FAM83D expression， and the higher FAM83D levels implied worse DFS and OS， higher recurrence rate and mortality and more advanced AJCC stages 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Their results indicated that FAM83D may serve as one independent marker for liver cancer progression diagnosis and survival times 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In vitro， Wang D. et al compared 30 liver cancer samples and corresponding adjacent normal tissues and found no differences in expression levels of FAM83A， FAM83B and FAM83C except for FAM83D. Besides， FAM83D levels were elevated in most liver cancer cell lines compared to normal liver cells. Moreover， FAM83D over expression promoted proliferation and colony formation of Hep3B and Focus cell， while FAM83D knockdown inhibited that of SK-hep-1 and YY-8103 cells通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Lin B reported FAM83D deficiency inhibited liver cancer stem cell growth and self-renewal in vitro， as well as tumor growth and tumor metastasis in mice 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. As to pancreatic cancer， only one literature stated that FAM83D levels were up-regulated in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) no matter in TCGA datasets or in collected clinical samples， and related to poor prognosis. Meanwhile， in vitro assay showed that FAM83D knockdown inhibited the growth and increased the gemcitabine sensitivity of PDAC cells BxPC3 and SW1990 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Apart from digestive glands， FAM83D were also related to digestive tracts cancer development. Firstly， one group described FAM83D and esophageal cancer， revealing higher FAM83D expression in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) tissues删除1换行compared to adjacent normal tissues and tightly correlated to poorer clinical outcomes. Furthermore， FAM83D deficiency inhibited ESCC cells ECA109 and KYSE30 growth and increased their radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Secondly， two articles reported FAM83D expression is positively related to Gastric Cancer (GC) cells HS-746T， AGS and SGC-7901 growth， invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo. Besides， clinical samples and database analysis showed that FAM83D upregulation was observed in GC tissues and celllines， and implicated poor prognosis of GC patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，16]</u>. Thirdly， two groups studied the role of FAM83D in Colorectal Cancer (CRC). One reported that FAM83D over expression may promote HCT-15 and HT-29 cells proliferation and invasion in vitro 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. The other study found that FAM83D levels are upregulated in clinical CRC samples and in CRC cells lines. Besides， FAM83D knockdown inhibited proliferation， colony formation， migration and invasion of HCT116and SW480 CRC cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\n\n【12】FAM83D and Female Reproductive System Cancer\n\n【13】In the year of 2019， two groups conducted the research about FAM83D and ovarian cancer. Both groups reported higher FAM83D levels in cancer tissues than normal tissues. Besides， patients with higher FAM83D levels exhibited shorter OS and DFS times and more advanced stages. One of the researches proposed that FAM83D may serve as an effective marker to distinguish low malignant potential tumor from invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. Like in other cancer types， FAM83D over expression promoted growth， migration and invasion of ovarian cells in vitro 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，20]</u>. Similar to ovarian cancer， two groups researches indicated that FAM83D is one ofthe genes that up-regulated in Endometrial Cancer (EC)， and higher expression was related to more advanced stages. It is worth to note that they showed that FAM83D levels in patients’blood would be a efficacious marker to predict the EC prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[21，22]</u>. Through database mining， four studies dig out the correlation between the expression of FAM83D and breast cancer. Zhai X reported that FAM83D expression was negatively associated with the recurrence-free survival in Triplet-\n\n【14】Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) samples by analyzing GSE45827， GSE38959， GSE65194 datasets from GEO， while another research found FAM83D was associated with poor relapse-free survival and OS of Luminal A type of breast cancers by analyzing dataset GDS2250 通用删除6(英):<u>[23，24]</u>. Furthermore， RNA-seq data from GEO showed that FAM83D was one of the most highly regulated genes in TNBC通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. Additional two studies reported that FAM83D was upregulated in breast cancer tissues and related to poor DFS regardless of breast cancer classification 通用删除6(英):<u>[26，27]</u>. Besides， in vitro assays showed that FAM83D over expression promoted human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC and MCF10A) transformation， migration， invasion and Anchorage-Independent Growth (AIG) . One the other hand，knockdown of FAM83D in breast cancer MDA468 and BT549cells dramatically inhibited cell growth and invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>[26，28，29]</u>.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Above， we summarized the role of FAM83D in multiple types of cancers with clinical data and laboratory in vivo and in vitro research data. To get one step further， we compressed all the key information in one table . In the table， we involved the reported cellular pathways that FAM83D may regulate in cancer cells. Collectively， up to date， FAM83D has been reported critical roles to cell proliferation， migration and invasion in nine types of cancers. Through high throughput screenings and validations， the downstream regulating factors/pathways of FAM83D have been identified. Meanwhile， several studies indicated upstream factors that may regulate human FAM83D expression， including circFOXM1/miR-614 axis， miRNA-495 and promoter methylations. However， we found no relationship between promoter methylation status and FAM83D expression levels in mice tissues during development， implying different regulating mechanisms in different physiological or pathological conditions. As one protein that tightly related to mitosis and had highly correlational expressions with CYCLINB1， FAM83D was intensively investigated these years for its mechanisms in regulating cellular behavior. Prospectively， FAM83D may serve as one effective biomarker for cancer diagnosis or prognosis. Furthermore， given that FAM83D deficiency inhibited proliferations and migrations of in many types of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo， it has the potential to be one promising target for cancer therapy. Further studies of FAM83D may focus on three aspects： 1) how it regulates cell division or chromatin separation；2) how it regulates downstream factors or cellular pathways and what is its biochemical features. 3) More retrospective and prospective clinical study to validate its role as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis and its mutations landscape in cancer cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The patients were assigned into two groups： 1) control group who received 4-week home-based daily exercise program and 2) intervention group (weighted kyphorthosis) who performed exercises and wore weighted kyphorthosis for one hour twice a day. Patients were assessed using computerized balance tests by Balance Master (NeuroCom) (Limits of Stability， Step Quick Turn， Sit to Stand and Walk across tests) before and 4 weeks after start of treatment.\n\n【3】Results： Speed in walk across test was improved significantly in both groups compared to baseline from (77.6±25 cm/s to 91.57±30 cm/s and from 72.60±20cm/s to 88.73±18 cm/s) in intervention and control groups respectively. Improvement in right turn time in step quick turn， end point excursion and mean of excursion parameters of Limits of Stability was more significant in orthosis group in comparison with control group (P<0.05).\n\n【4】Conclusion： Applying WKO together with exercise program improved some computerized balance tests in women with osteoporosis.WKO can be suggested as an effective intervention in postmenopausal women in order to reduce the risk of falling.\n\n【5】Keywords： Osteoporosis； Balance tests； Weighted KyphOrthoris； Posture training support\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Osteoporosis is a common disorder characterized by reduced bone mass and by deterioration of the micro architecture of the bone tissues， thereby leading to increased bone fragility. It affects around 55% of the population over the age of 50 years in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. Among common clinical consequences are back pain 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， hyperkyphosis， limitations of physical functioning and impaired health-related quality of life in osteoporotic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-6]</u>. It is characterized by low bone mass and micro-architectural changes of bone tissue， leading to increase in fracture risk 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2，7]</u>. Vertebral fractures can occur in spinal osteoporosis and constitute a major public health burden. The incidence of spine fracture can be as high as 20% in postmenopausal women 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The weakness of paraspinal extensor muscles in osteoporosis accompanied by repetitive vertebral micro fracture results in hyperkyphosis， in osteoporoticpatients 通用删除6(英):<u>[8-10]</u>. Changes in spinal alignment would displace the Center Of Pressure (COP) closer to the limit of stability，thereby making it easier to lose balance， with consequent falls in elderly women with osteoporosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. This postural changes and vertebral fractures can impose physical stress on vertebral bodies leading to acute and chronic back pain通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Furthermore， osteoporosis is associated with deficits of gait and balance， all together resulting in an increased risk of falls 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Falls among the elderly， especially for those with osteoporosis， are associated with high morbidity and mortality and are responsible for hip fracture and are the sixth cause of death among elderly 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>\n\n【8】There are studies indicating that almost one third of falls followed by detrimental consequences are preventable 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Apart from environmental modifications and pharmaceutical and physical rehabilitative measures including muscle reeducation and resistance exercises leading to improvements in static and dynamic posture and balance training are among most precious preventive strategies for reducing the risk of falls and subsequent fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>[13-15]</u>.\n\n【9】Assessment of postural control and stability in osteoporotic patients through posturography is a删除1换行promising and sensitive measurement approach for early detection or pre clinical changes in the postural control system 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【10】Previous studies have shown that wearing a spinal orthosis such as osteomed， spinomed and weighted kyphorthosis result in improvements of posture and back extensor strength. Weighted kyphorthosis [WKO] is among the most known orthosis in osteoporotic patients. In 2005， Sinaki indicated the positive effects of WKO together with spinal proprioceptive extension exercise on balance， gait， and risk of fall assessed by computerized dynamic posturography 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【11】In our previous work ，wearing WKO accompanied by back extensor strengthening exercises lead to significant improvement in functional balance tests including Functional Reach (FR) and Time up and Go(TUG) tests in WKO group compared to exercise group通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\n\n【12】The purpose of the present study is to assess the effects of wearing WKO together with spinal exercises on balance via performing computerized dynamic balance tests including Sit to Stand， Walk Across and LOS， by Neurocom tests in women with osteoporosis. These tests， performed by Neurocom device， are dynamic and much more functional and similar to daily activities compared to clinical balance tests used in our previous work. Considering these facts， they can better evaluate the risk of falling in the elderly.\n\n【13】Case Presentation\n\n【14】This study was conducted between during 2013 in Shahid Modarres hospital， Tehran， Iran. The protocol of this clinical trial was approved by Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences， Human Ethics Research Committee. This study was designed as randomized clinical trial.\n\n【15】Patients voluntarily referredtoOPphysical medicineand rehabilitation clinic were entered the study. Patients were screened initially by an expert physiatrist to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria.\n\n【16】Inclusion criteria were as follows： Women with osteoporosis diagnosed based on low bone mineral densitometry at spine(T-score of <-2.5)， aged between 50-75 years old， thoracic kyphosis angle between 35-55 degree (Cobb's angle of thoracic kyphosis was calculated from lateral radiograph of spine).\n\n【17】The patients with the following criteria were excluded from the study：\n\n【18】Thee presence of secondary osteoporosis due to metabolic diseases (such thyroid disease， etc) evaluated by clinical laboratory tests， the presence of neuromuscular disorders， vertebral fracture in last 6 months， history of spinal or lower limb surgical interventions including arthroplasty， vertebroplasty or discectomy.\n\n【19】Serum level of Ca， P， alkaline phosphatase， 25 HO vitD3， thyroid function tests， Renal function tests， parathyroid hormone were evaluated in osteoporotic patients. The patients with low level of vitamin D and secondary causes of osteoporosis were treated appropriately but excluded from this study.\n\n【20】Patients who met the above mentioned criteria were assigned to two groups (orthosis (intervention) and control groups). At the same clinic， like intervention group， matched controls of comparable age and weight and height were enrolled in the study as control group.\n\n【21】Randomization and Patients'Enrollment\n\n【22】Simple random sampling was used for this study. All patients included in the study received a number then by using random number table they were allocated to two groups (Control and intervention groups).\n\n【23】Equal allocation between groups was performed. Hence， the patients were classified randomly in control and intervention groups. Random allocation sequence， who enrolled patients to interventions were performed by one physician.\n\n【24】Blinding\n\n【25】The assessors supervised and performed NeuroCom balance tests， as well as the statistician were blinded to the group assignment.\n\n【26】Patients in both groups received medications including 1000mg calcium carbonate and 400 IU vitamin E daily and sodium alendronate 70 mg weekly.\n\n【27】Patients in both groups were also instructed to have 30 minutes of daily walking.\n\n【28】All Patients were followed via telephone calls to home to get sure that they were sticking to the exercises correctly as prescribed for them.\n\nControl group： No orthosis was prescribed for this group； but patients were taught to perform daily back extensor strengthening exercises at home according to professor Sinaki program in Mayo clinic 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> as follows：|删除段之间换行|1. In supine position， the patient flexes the knees and then abducts and adducts the shoulders while the elbows are extended and upper limbs are in contact with the floor.\n\n【30】2. In the supine position， the patient flexes the knees and put hands over the head. By contracting abdominal muscles the patient tries to draw the low back to the floor and keep this position for10seconds.\n\n【31】3. In the prone position， the patient puts a pillow under the lower abdomen and gently raises the head and shoulders from the floor as much as possible and keeps this position for 10 seconds.\n\n【32】4. The patient sits on a chair and puts the hands behind the head. Then he/she moves the elbows behind the head while inhaling. The patient will do the opposite while exhaling.\n\n【33】5. Sitting on a chair， the patient flexes the elbows while keeping the arms near to the trunk and then moves the arms back to reduce thoracic kyphosis.\n\n【34】All of the exercise programs were taught by an experienced physical therapist. Also， an illustrated pamphlet describing each exercise was presented to each participant. A paper with a table was given to each patient and she was asked to specify every day if she would do the exercises and bring it on follow up visits. The patients were called by a physical therapist every week to assess exercise performance and associated problems. After 4 weeks， patients were called to return to hospital for re-evaluations.\n\n【35】Intervention group (Orthosis group)\n\n【36】Patients in this group were taught to perform the same home exercises as control group.\n\n【37】Weighted kyphorthosis was also administered for the patients in this group.\n\n【38】Weighted kyphorthosis (WKO)\n\n【39】Weighted kypho-orthosis is an especially designed orthosis (made by Cybernetics Company) with a harness and a 2-pound pouch， which centers its weight on the posterior of the spine at T10 to L4.\n\n【40】The patients were guided to place the weighted kyphosis orthosis over the thoracic spine and adjust the straps such that the bottom of the pouch is located at the waistline.\n\n【41】Patients were instructed to wear the device when ambulating for one hour a day (30 minutes at the morning and the evening) for 4weeks. During this 4 week， patients were followed by telephone calls to assure that they were using the orthosis correctly.\n\n【42】An experienced orthotist instructed the patient regarding the proper usage of orthosis.\n\n【43】Measures\n\n【44】Dual X-ray absorptiometery (DXA) was used for measuring bone mineral density of spine or hip. All patients were referred to one imaging center for bone mineral densitometry. Then DXA scan was carried out using the Hologic QDR-4500 machine (Hologic， Waltham， MA) to determine BMD values of the femur and lumbar vertebrae. TheaccuracyofaDXA，a monthlycalibration measurement， according to the manufacturer's instructions， was performed.\n\n【45】Precision was defined as the reproducibility and the ability of densitometric systems to detect changes in BMD over time. Precision error of the machine and the technologist kept below 1 % in the center we referred our patients for bone densitometry.\n\n【46】The cobb's angle of kyphosis was calculated from perpendicular lines drawn on a standard thoracic spine radiograph (lateral view)：a line extends through the superior endplate of the vertebral body， marking the beginning of the thoracic curve and the inferior endplate of the vertebral body， marking the end of the thoracic curve.\n\n【47】An experienced radiologist ruled out osteoporotic fractures via assessing associated X-rays.\n\n【48】Dynamic balance tests： The NeuroCom Equitest Long Force Plate(NeuroCom International， Clackamas， Oregon) was used to assess the participants’ performance on functional tasks. The Long Force Plate was used to objectively evaluate balance and postural stability under dynamic tests 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. The Sit to Stand， Walk Across， Step/Quick Turn and Limits of stability were selected from the Functional Limitation Assessment Battery due to their ability to target functional characteristics pertaining to lower body strength， flexibility， and balance. These areas of interest were chosen due to their impact on independent Function. All participants performed each task three times and the mean score was used in the analyses.\n\n【49】Subjects were allowed one practice trial for familiarization with the procedure ofthe test.\n\n【50】Testing Protocols\n\n【51】Before starting protocol， each participant received a verbal explanation of the protocols.\n\n【52】Sit to stand test (STS)： During the measurements subjects were positioned on the platform facing the monitor with barefoot. The starting position before each trial was standardized by placing knees at 90 degree flexion by adjusting foot placement.\n\n【53】Subjects were instructed to stand up as quickly as possible when删除1换行start sign appeared on the monitor. They were not allowed to use arms or hands to push off their legs or the seated surface. Subjects were asked to remain stationary until the test was completed (<5 sec after they rose).\n\n【54】The parameters ofthis test are as follows：\n\n【55】a. Weight transfer (in seconds)： time elapsed until the moment of rising，删除1换行b. Rising index (percentage of the body weight)： is the percentage of weight bearing (% body weight)， which is the ratio of the amount of weight borne on both legs to the patient’s total body weight during the rising phase.( Amount of force exerted on the platform during the rising phase)，删除1换行c. Center of gravity (COG) sway velocity (in degrees per second)：postural sway velocity during upright posture，删除1换行d. Left/right weight symmetry (percentage of body weight)：symmetry of the body weight distribution on the lower extremities during the rising phase.\n\n【56】Walk Across (WA)： -Participants were positioned in front of a force plate and were instructed to “Go，\"via an audible prompt. Three gait cycles were completed across the force plate， while outcome measures included Step Width (lateral distance in centimeter)， Step Length (longitudinal distance in centimeters)， and Step Speed(velocity in centimeters/second)\n\n【57】Step/quick turn (SQT)： The patient is instructed to take two forward steps on command， and then quickly turn 180° to either the left or right and return to the starting point.\n\n【58】Limits of stability (LOS)： The NeuroCom LOS test required participants to transfer their COG， while standing on stable force plates， toward 8 targets in a sequential clockwise direction spaced at45° intervals around the body's COG， as represented on a computer monitor. Before testing， subjects were informed that the on-screen COG cursor (i.e.， visual biofeedback) moved in response to the movements of their body COG.\n\n【59】During the test， subjects were required to stand with their arms by their sides and to maintain their feet in the standardized foot position. A reference grid superimposed on the force plate allowed for careful monitoring ofthe feet during the testing procedures. They were instructed to keep their body in a straight line， using their ankle joints at the primary axis of motion and to move toward each target as directly and quickly as possible.\n\n【60】Outcomes include： reaction time， sway velocity， directional control， endpoint excursion and maximum excursion. Endpoint excursion and maximum excursion are calculated as percentages of the subject’s theoretical 100% limit of stability that is a function of their height.\n\n【61】The test was repeated three times and the average values of the measurements were documented\n\n【62】Data analysis： SPSS-18 was used for data analysis. Kolmogorov-smirnov was used for testing normality of variable distribution. Independent T-test and Man whitney tests were conducted to determineifthere was a statistically significant change in demographic characteristics between the two groups and improvement in balance tests after therapy. Wilcoxon-signed rank test was conducted to determine the significant change in balance tests within each group after therapy.\n\n【63】Table 1： Demographic characteristics including age， height， weight and body mass indices compared between two groups.\n\n| Demographic characteristic  | Group  | mean±sd  | P-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Height(m)  | Control通用删除7(英):<u>(14)</u>  | 1.51±4.25  | 0.64  |\n| Height(m)  | Intervention通用删除7(英):<u>(9)</u>  | 1.5±4.62  | 0.64  |\n| Weight(kg)  | Control  | 62±4.62  | 0.63  |\n| Weight(kg)  | Intervention  | 67±5  | 0.63  |\n| Agefyear)  | Intervention  | 62±5  | 0.36  |\n| Agefyear)  | Control  | 66±6  | 0.36  |\n| BMI(Kg/m²)  | Intervention  | 27.1±1.8  | 0.75  |\n| BMI(Kg/m²)  | Control  | 29.6±1.8  | 0.75  |\n\n【65】SD： Standard deviation； Intervention Group； Brace and exercise； Control group； exercise only\n\n【66】Ethics： The patients were enrolled after providing informed consent as approved by the institutional review board of Shahid Beheshti Medical University.

There were no between-group differences at the baseline in demographic characteristics and dynamic balance variables .\n\n【69】At the beginning of the study， 132osteoporotic patients (hip and/or spine) were assessed for eligibility to enter the study. From32 patients with osteoporosis at spine， 26 patients met the inclusion criteria and accepted to participate in the study， and 23 people stayed at the program during the follow up(two persons from orthosis and one person from control group were dropped out of the study due to删除1换行incomplete exercises and not wearing the orthosis completely). The results of 23 patients (14 patients in control and 9 patients in Orthosis group) who remained in the study were analyzed.

Their results excluded from final analysis|删除段之间换行|Patient's satisfaction： All patients completed the study were satisfied with the treatment (both orthosis and exercises).\n\n【86】Adverse events： No adverse events were noticed during the study. Secondary discussion\n\n【87】Based on the results of the present study， improvement in balance was noticed in patients with osteoporosis after wearing weighted kyphorthosis for 4 weeks. According to walk across test， speed improvement was noticed in both groups with no significant between group differences. Right turn time decreased significantly only in WKO group. Two parameters of LOS including the mean of End Point Excursion and Maximal Excursion increased significantly in WKO but not in control group.\n\n【88】Improvement in the above mentioned parameters can be translated as better postural stability in intervention group. Postural stability has been defined as the ability to control the body's COG within a given base of support. The understanding of postural stability control (i.e.， balance) is essential for performing activities of daily Living and decrease in fall rate 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\n\n【89】In practice， the actual LOS of a person may be defined as the distance the patient is willing and able to move without losing balance and taking a step 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. As with the Functional Reach (FR) test， the LOS test has been shown to provide reliable scores that are predictive of fall risk 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>.In our previous work 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> WKOlead to improvement in FR. In essence， LOS should measure similar components of balance as FR. However， Wallmann reports that there is no significant删除1换行relationship between FR measures and anterior displacement on the LOS test 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>.\n\n【90】Decrements in dynamic postural control have been attributed to both age and pathologic changes in parameters associated with movements of the COG. Compared with healthy older adults， osteoporotic patients exhibit smaller voluntary COG excursions， reach maximal lean more slowly， and exhibit less postural control once they have reached maximum lean 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>.\n\n【91】The LOS test provides spatial and temporal measures (e.g.， movement velocity， maximum excursion， directional control) of COG movements as a person volitionally leans to various positions in space 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. LOS test measures one aspect of balance utilized in daily life， and is a measure of improvement in balance resulting from rehabilitation. Considering the high efficiency of LOS test in early identification of falls in elderly， high reliability of its parameters， high test-retest reliability while measured by NeuroCom and its ease of execution， it is popular and confident in global measures of balance21，24\n\n【92】Previous studies suggestedthatposturalcontrol1：among individuals with osteoporosis is different from general elderly population. Individuals with osteoporosis are more likely to present higher sway velocities and greater maximum shift of the COG 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>.\n\n【93】Azadinia 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> evaluated the effects of two spinal orthoses on balance in the elderly with thoracic Kyphosis. Patients were allocated to two groups (Spinomed orthosis and the posture-training support groups). In both groups， significant changes were observed in the studied balance parameters. Authors concluded that both interventions may improve balance in the elderly in a similar manner.\n\nThe ability to transfer from sit to stand (STS) is another most commonly performed tasks of daily living. Accurate control of COG|删除段之间换行|position is critical in controlling the rise movement， as well as to maintain postural stability. Ideally， COG sway velocity during the rise should be minimal. Increased sway velocity can be caused by weak trunk extension or inability to keep the COG movement to a minimum in the elderly. However in our study， no significant change was noticed in this balance parameter.\n\n【95】In normal aging， step length and speed decreased， turn time increased substantially with aging.\n\n【96】Slow gait speed is associated with falls in aged people. Therapeutic exercises to improve gait speed and step length in osteoporotic elderly can reduce the risk of fall 通用删除6(英):<u>[27，28]</u>. In our study， step speed improved in both control and intervention group which can be contributed to extension exercises administered for patients in both groups.\n\n【97】In the present study， another balance parameter changed in intervention group was right turn time. The ability to make a rapid turn in walking is very crucial and sensitive to dynamic balance problems 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>.\n\n【98】There are few studies evaluating the beneficial impacts of spinal orthosis on gait balance 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，29，32]</u>.\n\n【99】In 2005， Sinaki 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> conducted a study to determine the outcome of intervention with a spinal weighted kypho-orthosis (WKO) and a spinal proprioceptive extension exercise dynamic (SPEED) program on the risk of fall in osteoporotic patients. After 4 week ofintervention， balance， gait， and risk of falls assessed by computerized dynamic删除1换行posturography improved significantly with SPEED program.\n\n【100】The role ofexercise in the treatment of osteoporosis is to improve axial stability through improvement of muscle strength and axial posture删除4-1:<u>33</u>.\n\n【101】In our study， wearing WKO lead to improvement in turn quick test， mean of excursion and end point excursion. WKO promotes improvement in posture and increased back extensor strength by two mechanisms： first， the device produces a posterior force below the inferior angle of scapula and reduces anterior compressive forces exerted on the kyphotic spine 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Second， application of the WKO increases a patient's perception of spinal joint position， which plays an important role in static and dynamic posture. It creates a preprioceptive input and enhances the patient's ability to sense the position of the spine 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>. WKO also promotes muscle re-education and decreases painful contractions of the erector spine muscles in kyphosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>.\n\n【102】Besides WKO， there are some studies investigating other types of spinal orthoses in osteoporosis. A trial was conducted in 2012evaluating the influence of ThamertOsteo-med spinal orthosis on gait and physical functioning in osteoporotic women. At a 6-month follow up， the study demonstrated that wearing a spinal orthosis reduced double support time associated with improvement on gait stability 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>. Pfeifer et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> evaluated the efficacy of two spinal orthoses in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Wearing the orthosis Spinomed in that study was associated with increase in删除1换行back extensor and abdominal flexor strength， decrease in the angle of kyphosis and body sway， also decrease in average pain 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>.\n\n【103】In all above mentioned studies， spinal orthosis had positive effects on postural balance which is in agreement with the results of our studies indicating improvement in LOS， step quick turn and speed in WKO group.\n\n【104】In conclusion， applying WKO together with back extensor strengthening exercises in women with osteoporosis leads to improvement in dymamic balance tests evaluated by NeuroCom which can be translated to decreased risk of fall in real life in this population.\n\n【105】The limitations of our study were the relatively small number of cases included and short term follow ups evaluations. Absence of a control group receiving no intervention was another limitation ofthis study； however， due to ethical considerations we had to consider the least routine interventions including exercise and medications for all patients.\n\n【106】We encourage more randomized controlled clinical trials with larger sample size evaluating the effect of WKO on risk of fall in long term via applying clinical functional and para clinical tests in the elderly with osteoporosis. Future studies can also consider power calculation to determine adequate sample size that yielded improved power and effect size which was lacking in the present study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

These tumors may secrete hormones； however 60% are considered ‘non-functional'通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. FunctionalpNETs are known to secrete insulin， gastrin， glucagon， vasoactive intestinal peptide or somatostatin. A small number of case reports have also identified pNETs secreting ACTH in patients who presented with clinical features of Cushing’s syndrome. We report the case of a patient treated for a known pNET believed to be non-functioning， who went on to develop features ofectopic ACTH syndrome(EAS).\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 59-year-old man with type 2 diabetes was diagnosed with a pNET following investigation for unintentional weight loss. The patient was then admitted to hospital for a subtotal pancreatectomy and splenectomy in addition to medical treatment with the Somatostatin analogue“Lanreotide\".He had a complicated post-operative course and remained in hospital for an extended period due to recurrent infections， reduced mobility， confusion and hallucinations of unknown cause. During this time his blood pressure and blood glucose were persistently difficult to control.\n\n【8】Six months after surgery the patient was referred to hospital due to a routine blood test which had found neutrophilia with a White Cell Count (WBCs) of over 46.0 ×10/L. He complained of persistent fatigue and reduced mobility but had no other symptoms. A bone marrow biopsy indicated reactive changes but showed no evidence of a primary hematological diagnosis. He was also found to be hyperglycemic， hypokalemic with a plasma potassium of 3.1 mmol/L and his liver function was deranged with ALP 153 IU/L and ALT 233 IU/L. A recurrence of the pNET with evidence of lymphatic spread was found on CT.\n\n【9】Two months later the patient was readmitted with shortness of breath， cough and leg weakness. His mobility had significantly deteriorated， and he now required a wheel chair to mobilize. He was confused and complaining of hallucinations.\n\n【10】Table 1： The patient's blood results.\n\n| Laboratory  | Results  | Reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Haemoglobin  | 136 g/L  | 130-180 g/L  |\n| Platelets  | 337x109L  | 150-400x10%L  |\n| White cells  | 19.0x109L  | 4-11x10°L  |\n| Neutrophils  | 17.64x10  | 2.0-7.5x10  |\n| Lymphocytes  | 0.67x109L  | 1.0-4.5x10/L  |\n| Monocytes  | 0.61x10%L  | 0.3-0.9x109L  |\n| Sodium  | 142 mmol/L  | 135-145 mmol/L  |\n| Potassium  | 3.4 mmol/L  | 3.5-5.3mmol/L  |\n| Calcium (corr.)  | 2.47 mmol/L  | 2.2-2.6mmol/L  |\n| Urea  | 4.0 mmol/L  | 2.5-6.7 mmo/L  |\n| ALP  | 323U/L  | 30-130 U/L  |\n| ALT  | 48 U/L  | 5-35 IU/L  |\n| Glucose  | 11.0mmol/L  | 3.5-5.5 mmo/L  |\n\n【12】ALP： Alkaline Phosphatase； ALT： Alkaline Transaminase\n\n【13】He also had increased oxygen requirement， thin skin， and reduced tone and sensation in the lower limbs. The patient had persistent hypokalemia. His blood glucose， WBCs and LFTs also remained elevated . A whole spine MRI ruled out cord compression but showed degenerative changes and multiple fractures of the vertebrae. A chest CT revealed consolidation and a new sternal fracture.\n\n【14】Despite improvement of the chest infection after treatment， the patient continued to suffer with confusion， fatigue， poor mobility as well as intractable hypertension， hyperglycaemia and hypokalemia. Tests were， therefore， carried out to screen for Cushing's syndrome. These results are indicative of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome.\n\n【15】A pituitary MRI was carried out， which did not find evidence of a pituitarylesion. Inferior petrosal sampling would normally be carried out to definitely exclude a pituitary source of ACTH； however the patient was not eligible for this invasive procedure due to his poor functional status. As a result of the known neuroendocrine tumour， the very high ACTHleveland the persistent hypokalemia， a diagnosis of ectopic ACTH Cushing's syndrome secondary to metastatic pNET was made. The patient was started on Metyrapone， a reversible inhibitor of 11β-hydroxylase which blocks cortisol biosynthesis， with dexamethasone on a block and replace regimen. He also received a prophylactic treatment for Pneumocystis jiroveci in addition to prophylactic anti-coagulation.\n\n【16】Since initiation of treatment， the patient’s quality of life has greatly improved. He has had a significant reduction in the frequency of infections， his blood sugars have improved， his blood pressure is now well controlled on Spironolactone and he has regained some mobility. However， a recent CT has found marked enlargement of the pNET recurrence and he is now being considered for peptide receptor radionucleotide therapy.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】We report a rare case of EAS in a patient with a complicated post operative course after the resection ofa pNET.\n\n【19】Most of the cases reported to date of this condition were for patients presenting with Cushing syndrome， where the tumour was discovered during investigations for the source ofthe ACTH.\n\n【20】Table 2： Screening for Cushing's syndrome.\n\n| Laboratory  | Results  | Reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mid night Cortisol  | 1583 nmol/L  | fnormal <50 nmol/L)  |\n| ACTH  | 534 pg/mL  | normal range 10-60 pg/mL  |\n| Overnight dexamethasone suppression test： Cortisol level  | 1314 nmol/L  | normal <50 nmol/L  |\n\n【22】We therefore wish to highlight the importance of including cortisol and ACTH levels in screening for neuroendocrine activity in pancreatic tumors. This patient had many of the complications related to Cushing's syndrome and an earlier screening and diagnosis could have helped ameliorating his symptoms and halting disease progression.\n\n【23】Diagnosis of functional pNETs is typically guided by clinical symptoms and confirmed by elevated plasma levels of the hormone通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. An ACTH-secreting pNET will lead to clinical presentation with Cushing’s syndrome. These patients present with a variety of Cushing features such as truncal obesity， hirsutism， bruising， striae， muscle weakness and wasting， fatigue， mood disturbance， recurrent infection，hypertension， osteoporosis and hyperglycaemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>.One case series of ACTH-secreting pNETs reported patients presenting with hypokalemia and severe fatigue before the classical symptoms of Cushing's syndrome， which they suggest is due to a rapid increase in serum cortisol通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【24】Cushing’s syndrome can be screened for using midnight cortisol levels， urinary free cortisol， dexamethasone suppression test and salivary cortisol. If hypercortisolism is confirmed， serum basal ACTH should be measured to differentiate ACTH-dependent or independent causes.\n\n【25】ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome is most commonly caused by pituitary adenomas 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. This should be investigated by pituitaryimaging， inferior petrosal sinus sampling and Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) tests. The CRH test would show a marked rise in cortisol in pituitary-dependent disease compared to ectopic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，7]</u>. Cross-sectional imaging studies and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy can be used to localize tumors which may be an ectopic source of ACTH hypersecretion 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Central and ectopic sources of ACTH may also be differentiated by plasma ACTH level(typically very high in ectopic disease)， high-dose dexamethasone suppression test (basal cortisol suppression more likely in pituitary-dependent disease) and serum potassium (hypokalemia nearly always seen in ectopic disease).\n\n【26】Management of functioning pNETs requires treatment for both the hormone-excess state and the tumour itself. Surgical removal of the tumor is essential as malignant behavior is reported in >50%of pNETs 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Where surgery is ineffective in controlling hormone hypersecretion， medical treatment is essential in reducing morbidity and mortality. Suppression of cortisol hypersecretion can be achieved with inhibitors of steroidogenesis such as metyrapone， mitotane and ketoconazole 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. While these agents offer rapid control of hypercortisolism， there is a risk of cortisol “escape”with long-term use 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. The somatostatin analogue pasireotide may be beneficial in these patients through its direct anti-tumors effects 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. Peptide receptor radionucleotide therapy has also been identified as helpful in controlling EAS 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【27】Conclusion删除1换行for ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome in patients with pNETs especially if they present with non-specific symptoms.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

To our knowledge， platinum and taxane induced isolated common peroneal neuropathy has not been widely reported.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neurotoxicity (CIPN) is an adverse event seen in patients being treated with a number of chemotherapeutic classes ofdrugs such as taxanes， vinca alkaloids and platinum among others. Presentation can vary from mild paresthesia and dysesthesia to debilitating pain often leading to dose reduction， delay or discontinuation of therapy. In clinical practice， a majority of these patients present with sensory symptoms. Motor and autonomic symptoms are less frequent and usually milder 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【6】The common peroneal nerve is a peripheral nerve that arises from the sciatic nerve. Its branches provide motor innervation to the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion and eversion as well as sensory innervation of the skin over the upper lateral third of the foot. Foot drop is the result of peroneal nerve palsy. This is commonly seen due to injury to the nerve at the level of the fibular neck 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The mechanism of injury may be due to compression of the nerve from prolonged lying or direct injury. Severe weight loss has also been hypothesized as a cause of peroneal nerve injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【7】Though rare， foot drop can be a manifestation of central nervous system pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Cerebrovascular accidents and space occupying lesions involving the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-11]</u> or the spine 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> causing foot drop have been reported. Other rare causes include multiple sclerosis， hemorrhagic contusion from gunshot wound 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， head trauma， neurocysticercosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> and brain abscess. Due to the involvement of the upper motor neurons of the parasagittal motor cortex， these patients tend to present with spastic foot drop， usually associated with other neurological signs such as hyperreflexia， clonus and a positive Babinski reflex 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. There are few mentions in the literature of foot drop related to neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. The motor neurons are protected from many chemotherapy drugs by the blood brain barrier， and therefore the likely mechanism of chemotherapy associated foot drop is byaxonal damage to the long peripheral motor neurons of the common perineal nerve.\n\n【8】Here we describe five cases of chemotherapy associated isolated peroneal nerve paresis resulting in foot drop after several cycles with platinum and/or taxanes. We postulate that chemotherapeutic agents contributed to peroneal nerve palsy in all the five cases. In all of these cases， no other plausible explanation was found for the foot drop. No clinically significant weight loss was reported in 4 out of the 5 cases and CNS disease was ruled out with imaging in 4 of the 5 cases. All patients who continued follow up showed complete recovery of motor function on discontinuation of offending agents and supportive treatment. To our knowledge， platinum and taxane induced isolated common peroneal neuropathy has not been widely reported.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 49 year old female with no past medical history presented with long standing hematochezia in April， 2017. On colonoscopy she was found to have a moderately differentiated rectal adenocarcinoma， Microsatellite Stable (MSS)， KRAS mutated. Staging work up revealed a T3N0 tumor with no evidence of metastatic disease. She was started on neoadjuvant therapy with capecitabine 1000 mg/m²and concurrent radiation therapy for 5 weeks with no significant side effects. This was followed by low anterior resection with pathologic staging of the tumor： T3N1cM0. Adjuvant CAPOX (Capecitabine1000 mg/m，Oxaliplatin 130 mg/mevery 21 Day cycle) was initiated. After 4 cycles， Oxaliplatin was discontinued due to progressive sensory neuropathy and debilitating grade 3 motor neuropathy of the peroneal nerves resulting in foot drop on the left. Motor strength of the left ankle dorsiflexion was 3/5 and rest of the motor exam was normal with 5/5 strength. MRI of the Lumbosacral spine did not show any acute findings. Over the next 4 months since discontinuing oxaliplatin， her left ankle dorsiflexion motor strength improved to5/5.\n\n【11】An 85 year old male with a history of right sided colon cancer(T3N0M0) in 2010 treated with hemicolectomy and no adjuvant therapy presented with an elevated CEA of 205 ng/ml(Normal：0.0 ng/ml to 3.0 ng/ml) in 2016. This prompted investigation with imaging which showed colon cancer recurrence in the liver. He underwent segment 5，6 and 7 hepatic resection with pathology showing moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of colonic origin， MSS， KRAS mutated. This was followed by adjuvant FOLFOX(Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m， Leucovorin 400 mg/m， Fluorouracil 400mg/m， Fluorouracil 2400 mg/m²). After completing 5 cycles of chemotherapy he was admitted to the hospital with acute onset diarrhea，weakness and an episode of syncope associated with left foot pain and weakness. On exam， he was found to have a left sided foot drop with a motor strength of 3/5 in the L ankle dorsiflexors. Patient then completed remaining chemotherapy without oxaliplatin and with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin. Patient initiated physical therapy and wore a brace. Over the next 6 months his left sided foot drop resolved.\n\n【12】A 54 year old male presented in March， 2017 with early satiety which prompted an Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). He was found to have a mass in the lesser curvature of the stomach with pathology showing signet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach； MSS. Imaging showed metastatic disease with peritoneal carcinomatosis. He received palliative chemotherapywith FOLFOX for three months， and underwent repeat imaging with progression of disease. He was at this time switched to combination paclitaxel with ramucirumab. Patient received seven cycles of paclitaxel (80 mg/m， Day 1，8，15删除1换行of a 28 day cycle) when he was noted to have developed foot drop with a dorsiflexion motor strength of 3/5 bilaterally. Paclitaxel was discontinued and he underwent vigorous physical therapy with improvement in motor strength of the lower extremities over 4months.\n\n【13】A 77 year old man renal dysfunction presented in April， 2016with hemoptysis and dysphagia. An EGD revealed an obstructing mass in mid-esophagus 21 cm to 25 cm from incisors. He underwent endoscopic ultrasounds with esophageal stenting showing a T3N1tumor with pathology consistent with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. PET/CT imaging showed hypermetabolic mediastinal nodes and hypermetabolic boney lesions in the thoracic spine， ribs and the scapula. He was started on single agent palliative paclitaxelat80 mg/m²(Day 1，8，15 of a 28 day cycle). He tolerated it well and carboplatin was added on cycle 3， following which he developed acute onset bilateral foot drop with a 3/5 motor strength of the dorsiflexion. Imaging of the spine did not show any space occupying lesion. The condition was so debilitating that he could not walk and was admitted to the hospital followed by rehab where he began to regain dorsiflexion strength upon discontinuation of the chemotherapy. However， his overall performance status was declining. He eventually completed external beam radiation therapy to the esophageal mass and was transitioned to hospice per his wishes.\n\n【14】A 75 year old man presented in October， 2018 with new onset severe dyspepsia associated with weight loss. EGD showed an ulcer of the gastric antrum and pathology was consistent with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Staging scans showed mass extending into the serosa with no evidence of lymph node involvement. He was started on perioperative FLOT (Docetaxel 50 mg/m， Oxaliplatin85 mg/m’， Fluorouracil 2600 mg/m’every 14 Day Cycle) which he tolerated well. After completing 4 cycles， patient underwent distal gastrectomy with Billroth II reconstruction with partial resection of left lobe of liver due to local extension. Pathologically the tumor was staged as a T4bN0 moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma， MSS， HER2 negative with positive liver margin. He completed 4 more cycles of FLOT followed by chemoradiotherapy with Capecitabine1000 mg/m’in June 2018. Towards the end of his treatment， he was noted to have lost 25 lbs. of weight over 2 months. He developed L sided foot drop in June 2018 after completing treatment， with a motor strength of 3/5 associated with bilateral lower extremity numbness and tingling. His weakness showed gradual improvement with physical therapy over the next 2 months since discontinuing chemotherapy.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】The incidence of anti-cancer drug associated neurotoxicity remains unclear due to several confounding factors such as preexisting diabetes and nutritional deficiencies but estimated to be 52% to68% 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14]</u>. Chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity tends to be dose dependent， cumulative and reversible though it may be persistent in a substantial proportion of patients. Taxanes and vinca alkaloids cause neurotoxicity by causing axonal damage (Axonopathy) to the large myelinated motor fibers whereas platinum accumulates in the dorsal root ganglion resulting in neuropathy. Motor nerves have the capacity for re-innervation of the muscle fibers， reflected clinically in the recovery of the patients'strength and function 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Although peroneal nerve palsy incidence is not well described for many of the neurotoxic chemotherapy agents， a large body of literature confirms increased risk of neurotoxicity with increasing exposure to the删除1换行neurotoxic drugs. Among the platinum compounds， Oxaliplatin is most commonly associated with neuropathy seen in 85% to 100%of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Cold induced dysesthesia is the characteristic complaint seen in these patients and it tends to resolve within a few weeks to up to 3 months of discontinuation of therapy or may become permanent 通用删除6(英):<u>[17-19]</u>. The high incidence of CIPN in patients treated with Oxaliplatin is reflected in the results of the MOSAIC trial通用删除6(英):<u>20]</u>. A total of 2246 patients who had undergone curative resection for stage II or III colon cancer were randomized to receive FL alone or in combination with oxaliplatin for six months. During treatment，92% of patients on FOLFOX were noted to have neuropathy of any degree versus only 16% on the 5FU arm. At one month follow up， the prevalence of neuropathy in the FOLFOX group was down to 62%and further down to 41% at 6 months. At one year follow up， only 30%of these patients had persistent neuropathy. With increasing dose， this peripheral neuropathy can progress to more severe symptoms including continuous dysesthesia， burning， muscle cramping and jaw stiffness 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\n\n【17】In 2017， the IDEA collaboration published a preplanned， pooled analysis of 6 clinical trials with over 12，800 patients， conducted concurrently to evaluate the non-inferiority of adjuvant therapy with either FOLFOX or CAPOX administered for 3 months， as compared with 6 months with the primary end point of DFS at 3 years. Though the study failed to meet its primary endpoint in its overall population， it did show that a shorter duration of adjuvant therapy was associated with significantly lower rates of neurotoxicity (16.6% with FOLFOX and 14.2% with CAPOX)than alonger duration (47.7% with FOLFOX and 44.9% with CAPOX)，independent of the chemotherapy regimen.

In another study通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>，20% ofpatients continued tohave neuropathy 5 years after completing cisplatin based chemotherapy for testicular cancer. Carboplatin induced neuropathy is similar in presentation to cisplatin but usually milder. It is seen in 6% to 42% patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[16，25]</u>.\n\n【22】The taxanes also cause neuropathy clinically similar to cisplatin induced neuropathic symptoms. Paclitaxel is more neurotoxic and causes CIPN in 57% to 83% of patients， whereas docetaxel in 11%to64% 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. In 50% to 60% of patients， symptoms tend to resolve within3 months with or without residual symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[26-28]</u>. Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX) is a commonly used taxane in the treatment of breast cancer. Severalphases II/III randomized trials have reported a higher incidence of CIPN on nab-PTX compared to paclitaxel and docetaxel with an estimated incidence of 75% 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>. CIPN associated with nab-PTX usually resolved rapidly within 3weeks to a month. Cabazitaxel， a relatively newer taxane used in the treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer has been shows to be less neurotoxic compared to docetaxel with an incidence of11% to 12%通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>.Other agents known to cause neuropathy include vinca alkaloids， Bortezomib，IMIDs and Ixabepilone.\n\n【23】Several cases of foot drop have been reported in the pediatric population after treatment with vincristine for acute lymphoblastic leukemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> with an estimated incidence of 5% to 10%通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. A single case of capecitabine associated foot drop has also been described通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>. To our knowledge foot drop as a manifestation of peripheral neuropathy has been under reported in patients treated with platinum and taxane compounds.\n\n【24】Among the five patients presented in this series， patients 3.4 and3.5  were treated with both a platinum and a taxane and it is therefore difficult to implicate one agent as the cause of foot drop. Literature suggests a cumulative dose of 100 mg/m’ to 300 mg/m²of paclitaxel and 75 mg/m to 100 mg/m’ of docetaxel prior to onset of CIPN， whereas Oxaliplatin can cause CIPN at any dose， though删除1换行it tends to be more persistent at a cumulative dose of 750 mg/m丫to800 mg/m. The cumulative onset dose for cisplatin is 300 mg/m²and800 mg/m² to 1600 mg/m’ for carboplatin 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. In the five patients presented ， the cumulative dose prior to developing foot drop was： Oxaliplatin 425 mg/m to 685 mg/m²， Paclitaxel 560 mg/m²to 1680 mg/m， Carboplatin 335 mg/m\" and Docetaxel 400 mg/m. Time to resolution of symptoms after discontinuation of neurotoxic chemotherapy ranged from 2 months to 6 months . Four of the five patients had CNS imaging to rule out other causes of peroneal nerve palsy. As clinicians become more aware of foot drop as a complication of neurotoxic chemotherapy and with the absence of other symptoms， perhaps there will be less need to perform expensive imaging tests in the work up of this chemotherapy adverse effect.\n\n【25】Treatments of chemotherapyinduced foot drop include decreasing dose and frequency of offending agent and at times， discontinuation may be necessary. The phase 3 MRC COIN trials 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> compared intermittent versus continuous oxaliplatin and 5FU combination chemotherapy for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Though it failed to show non-inferiority， it did show that grade 3or worse peripheral neuropathy was more frequent on continuous than on intermittent treatment (27% vs. 5%). An ankle-foot orthosis splint stabilizes the ankle in stance and helps clear toes in the swing， therefore preventing injury on ambulation and should be used until active movement has recovered 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. As described in the cases above， patients tend to recover full motor function on discontinuation of causative chemotherapeutic agent. Physical rehabilitation under the supervision of a physical therapist to include passive and active range of motion and muscle strengthening is also recommended to hasten recovery通用删除6(英):<u>[25，35]</u>.\n\n【26】No study has specifically looked at pharmacotherapy for the treatment of motor neurotoxicity. In patients with associated sensory symptoms，atrial of duloxetine maybea reasonableoption. Duloxetine has been shown in a randomized， double-blind， placebo-controlled crossover trial of 231 patients to result in a greater reduction in pain compared to placebo among patients with painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy with a modest benefit 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>. Two studies demonstrated safety and modest efficacy of venlafaxine for the management of CIPN secondary to taxanes and platinum 通用删除6(英):<u>[37，38]</u>. Other agents with mild-moderate activity for chemotherapy induced neuropathy symptoms include gabapentin， pregabalin， nortriptyline， desipramine 通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u>. It is unclear if these agents will expedite the recovery of peroneal nerve palsy. None of these agents were used to treat the five patients in this series. In our opinion，pharmacotherapy should be reserved for patients in whom foot drop does not improve with supportive measures.\n\n【27】Currently there are1oo established therapies to prevent development of chemotherapy induced neuropathy. A total of 42randomized controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of various pharmacological agents in the prevention of CIPN. These studies included anticonvulsants， antidepressants，vitamins，Iminerals， and other chemoprotectants. None of these agents are currently recommended for prevention of CIPN due to the paucity of high quality evidence 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>. The only successful strategy to date has been to decrease the cumulative dose and duration of the offending chemotherapy as was seen on the IDEA trial 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> whenever oncologically indicated.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】Foot drop is an underreported complication of taxane and删除1换行platinum based chemotherapy. The motor neurons are protected by the blood brain barrier， and therefore the likely mechanism of foot drop is by axonal damage to the long peripheral motor neurons of the common perineal nerve. Treatment of foot drop includes discontinuation of the offending agent， ankle orthosis/brace to provide foot support as well as physical therapy. No effective strategies have been shown to prevent development of CIPN. Duloxetine or venlafaxine may be used in patients with associated neuropathic pain symptoms， though their efficacy in treating motor neuropathy remains to be evaluated in further studies. Clinicians should be aware of foot drop as a potential neurotoxic complication of platinum and taxane classes of chemotherapeutic agents. Further studies to prevent the development of chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity are warranted.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It occurs most commonly in the ileum， followed by the colon and jejunum. Congenital Segmental Duodenal Dilatation (CSDD)， defined as a localized dilatation of the duodenum without a distal obstruction， is extremely rare， with only 5 cases previously reported in the literature， with none of these originating from Africa. Herein， we describe a case of CSDD presenting to a tertiary pediatric hospital in South Africa.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】Baby X was born via Caesarean section at 31 weeks gestation (birth weight： 1900 g) and required ventilation at birth for neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS). A post-intubation plain chest radiograph noted an abdominal right upper quadrant large dilated air-filled structure in the right upper quadrant . As background， the infant was one of a pair of twins. The sibling， with a birth weight of 2000 g， had no reported perinatal concerns.\n\n【4】The patient was referred to our service at a tertiary pediatric hospital for further investigation and management. A right upper quadrant mass was evidenton inspection ofthe abdomen. This mass was difficult to define on palpation but was noted to be of soft consistency with a smooth surface. It was noted to be mobile， but examiners could not get above or “below'it. Auscultation revealed normal bowel sounds without any bruits. Generally， the abdomen was not distended， soft and non-tender. Plain anteroposterior abdominal radiography  demonstrated a large dilated air-filled structure in the right upper quadrant， with a relative paucity of distal gas. Pneumoperitoneum was not evident， and the tip of the nasogastric tube was in the expected position of the stomach， to the left of the spine. The heart was in the normal position. A plain lateral abdominal radiograph demonstrated no proximal intestinal obstruction， and the air-filled structure could not be differentiated from the gastric bubble.\n\nAbdominal ultrasound demonstrated a sizeable gas-filled cystic mass in the RUQ that was|删除段之间换行|discrete from the liver. The mass could not be further described due to an extensive ring-down artifact in the RUQ. The stomach was demonstrated in the left upper quadrant and the nasogastric tube was confirmed to be within its lumen. All other solid organs were unremarkable. Differentials included an enteric duplication cyst， a peri-hepatic cyst， or a variation of duodenal atresia.\n\nExploratory laparotomy was performed via a supra-umbilical celiotomy. On identification of the duodenum the second， third and fourth segments were found to be massively dilated . Upon opening the cystic dilatation， the downstream intestine was easily cannulated with no evidence of mechanical obstruction. Retrograde cannulation of the stomach with a feeding tube was not possible. Further exploration revealed a web with a pinhole defect immediately distal to the Ampulla of Vater.

There was persistent respiratory distress related to prematurity. Enteral feeding was advanced by building volume in a stepwise fashion over time. The patient was on full-volume bolus feeds at discharge from the hospital on day 19 of life. The patient was reviewed as an out-patient on day 41 of life and， at this point， was tolerating breastfeeding and gaining weight.

SGCE gene encodes epsilon-sarcogly can protein， single pass transmembrane proteins that are part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex， which contribute to mediating the stability of the plasma membrane. According to Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD)， there are 133mutations in SGCE gene reported to be associated with myoclonus dystonia or similar symptoms， including 131 confirmed disease-causing mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. However， no genotype-phenotype correlations have been identified 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Herein we report clinical information and genetic data on a4-generation Chinese family of MDS caused by a deletion， c.360delT， in SGCE gene.\n\n【8】Materials and Methods\n\n【9】Clinical data collection\n\n【10】Clinical information of the proband were collected from medical records and of her family members were recorded through personal follow-up visits. The written consent forms were obtained with the informed consent of all participants.\n\n【11】Further examinations\n\n【12】Physical examination was to check the patient's motor function. Laboratorial assessments were also performed， including complete blood count， urinalysis， stool test， basic metabolic panel， blood lactate and ammonia. Electromyogram (EMG)， brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG) were also applied.\n\n【13】Whole-exome sequencing\n\nWhole-exome sequencing was performed by Running Gene Inc. (Beijing， China) following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood using a blood DNA Isolation Kit(#CW2553， Cwbio， Taizhou， China). Genomic DNA sample was shared by sonication. The sheared genomic DNA fragments were processed by end-repairing， A-tailing， adaptor ligation and a 4-cycle pre-capture PCR amplification. The amplified products were then captured by IDT and xGen Lockdown’ Probes (Integrated DNA Technologies， Coralville， IA) to enrich the exonic DNA. The libraries were first tested for enrichment by qPCR and for size distribution and concentration using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific， Waltham， MA). The samples were then sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq (Illumina， San Diego， CA). Two parallel reactions were performed for each sample.Exon-enriched DNA was sequenced by the Illumina Novaseq platform following the manufacturer's instructions. Raw image files were processed by the Illumina Sequence Control Software (Illumina) for base calling and generating the raw data. The low-quality variations were filtered out based on an in-house algorithm.

The pregnancy was unremarkable and the proband was delivered by caesarean section at gestational 39h week. She developed normally in infancy. Since the age of 2， she began to exhibit exaggerated startle response with or without acoustic and/or tactile stimuli during awake， and her motor development dramatically delayed compared with peers. She could not walk independently because an unexpected startle during walk could make her fall down. During a startle attack， her arms became fully extended and her whole body involuntarily tightened. Each episode lasted for a few seconds， during which she was fully conscious. The frequency of attacks is more than a hundred per day and also depended on the environment around her.

The patient had previously taken valproate， levetiracetam， clonazepam zonisamide and phenobarbital but symptoms were not improved. Until the last follow-up visit， the patient still presents myoclonic and dystonic symptoms without any improvements. The proband (IV-31) is in a large family in which 13 family members are affected by MDS. The proband's brother (IV-30)， grandmother (II-11)， two cousins (IV-27 and IV-28) and distant relatives (II-3，II-5，II-6， III-24，III-26， III-27，IV-8 and IV-18) all presented myoclonic and/or dystonic symptoms to varying degrees. Affected family members in generation II presented with both myoclonus and torticollis. Symptoms in generation III manifested as slight torticollis. In the4 generation， torticollis became not obvious. The proband's mother(III-43)，two uncles (III-38 and III-40) and grandfather (II-10) were asymptomatic. Theprobandsbrother (IV-30)reported a reduction in myoclonus in response to alcohol ingestion. Therefore， this family is fully compliant with the diagnosis of MDS.\n\n【20】Physical and biochemical examinations\n\n【21】The proband (IV-31) was admitted to our hospital for further examinations. On admission， she was conscious with normal facial features and without horizontal nystagmus.The muscle strength of his upper and lower extremities and muscle tone were all normal. Tendon reflexes were active on all extremities and bilateral pathological reflexes were negative. Pain sensation was present symmetrically. Romberg’s sign was negative. No abnormal signs presented in his heart，lungs and abdomen. The results oflaboratorial assessments were within normal limits and unremarkable. The result of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> was normal. No abnormal findings were observed in the results of EMG， brain MRI and EEG.\n\n【22】Genetic analysis\n\n【23】Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous deletion， c.360delT ， in exon 3 of SGCE gene (NM003919， chr7：94257544) in the proband . This deletion will lead to mRNA degradation by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or frame shift causing premature termination of the peptide chain from 462 amino acidsto 130(PVS1). This variant is absent from public databases (PM2). The deletion also co-segregates with disease in multiple affected family members (PP1).

The proband's phenotypes and family histories are highly specific for MDS (PP4). According to HGMD database， this deletion has been reported as a disease-causing mutation in a family with Progressive Myoclonus Ataxia (PMA) but without laboratorial evaluation (PP5)通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Thus， this variant is classified as pathogenic， based on ACMG guidelines. Sanger sequencing verified this pathogenic variant was also carried by her father (III-42)， brother (IV-30)， grandmother (II-11)，two uncles (III-38 and III-40) and two cousins (IV-27 and IV-28). The proband's mother (III-43) and grandfather (II-10) are wild-type at this site. The disease in this family was inherited as an autosomal dominant pattern with maternal imprinting.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】MDS is a rare autosomal dominant neurological disorder. The onset age is usually less than 20 years old and with an estimated prevalence of 1-9/1000000inEuropeanpopulation 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. It manifests as myoclonus and dystonia. Among them， myoclonic jerks mainly occur in the upper limbs and trunk， with a few involving the lower limbs. The myoclonus is not under conscious control and often occurs when stimulated by sound. Other factors eliciting the movement include stress， sudden noise， tactile stimuli and caffeine. Focal or segmental dystonia manifests as writing spasm and/or torticollis and dystonia in the lower limbs is rare. Due to early onset and frequent myoclonic seizures， the normal life of patients is severely disrupted and they are often accompanied by many mental disorders， such as anxiety， depression and compulsive behaviors 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. In addition， patients are often addicted to alcohol since most patients reported alcohol could alleviate myoclonic symptom dramatically 通用删除6(英):<u>[22-24]</u>. However， clinical manifestations of different patients were various. Myoclonic symptoms are prominent and only some patients present dystonia. Some of manifestations are too mild to be noticed. Usually， patient’s intelligence is not affectedandthe results of neurological examinations are normal. No specific abnormality shows in cranial MRI， and EEG findings are not consistent with corticogenic myoclonus. Thus， MDS is often misdiagnosed as Tourette syndrome， epilepsy， or psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. The diagnosis of MDS is usually based on both clinical manifestations and genetic background of patients. Mutations SGCE gene is the causative factor of MDS 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. Pedigree analysis showed that different origin of the pathogenic allele would lead to a remarkable difference in penetrance，indicating the maternal imprinting mechanism of MDS. Although pathogenic alleles with either maternal or paternal origin can be inherited to offspring， only paternal alleles can be expressed and most of maternal alleles will be silenced by DNA methylation 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，25]</u>. Approximately 5% of patients inherited disease alleles with maternal origin but presented milder symptoms. The reason for loss of suppression is unknown. A heterozygous deletion， c.360delT ， of SGCE gene was first identified in the proband (IV-31) and verified in other family members. Variant c.360delT was considered as a causative variant of MDS. Although 126 disease-causing mutations of SGCE have been reported to be associated with myoclonus dystonia， variant c.360delT has been reported in a family with Progressive Myoclonus Ataxia(PMA)， also referred to as dyssynergia cerebellaris myoclonica rather than MDS 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. In the current family， our patient (IV-31) presented involuntary bodytremors in upper limbs and trunk and frequent falls， which result in inability to walk. Other family members presented with mild myoclonus and/or torticollis and symptoms could be alleviated after alcohol ingestion. In the PMA family， the proband suffered from dysmetria and ataxic gait， which did not present in MDS family， and frequent falls and limb myoclonus， which also showed in the present family. Similarly， both patients had normal intelligence and showed normal results in neurological examinations， MRI and EEG. They both did not respond to symptomatic treatments but PMA patient experienced progressive worsening of symptoms. Both families showed an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with maternal imprinting. It is intriguing to note that the identical variant may cause two different， but somewhat similar， diseases. Personal删除1换行genetic background， lifestyle or environmental factor may cause heterogeneity of phenotypes. We also suppose that the inconsistent symptoms， dysmetria and ataxia， were probably caused by other gene(s)， which they missed due to lack of whole-exome sequencing(only a SGCE gene fragment (from intron 5 to intron 7) was sequenced)， irrelevant to c.360delT in SGCE. This hypothesis could also explain why the phenotypes of this PMA family are unique (1 in133) among SGCE mutations in HGMD. However， the correlation between phenotypes and variants should be explored and analyzed with more cases. Currently， no drugs are specifically designed for MDS. Antiepileptic drugs have been reported in individual cases and clinical series with varying responses. A randomized， double-blind， placebo-controlled crossover study showed that zonisamide was the only drug with level 1 evidence of effectiveness in both myoclonus and dystonia 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>.Other antiepileptic including valproate， levetiracetam， clonazepam， gabapentin and topiramate have also been trialed in patients with MDS 通用删除6(英):<u>[27-29]</u>. Only valproate has been reported to be effective in reducing the occurrence of myoclonus in some patients通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. However， levetiracetam has limited efficacy and gabapentin caused a severe worsening the conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>[31，32]</u>. Other than antiepileptic medications， benzodiazepines， anticholinergic agents， dopaminergic agents， serotoninergic agents have been administrated to treat myoclonus and/or dystonia but also with various responses通用删除6(英):<u>[33-38]</u>. Except for medications， surgical treatment， such as deep brain stimulation， has also been reported as an effective and safe treatment for MDS when medications failed 通用删除6(英):<u>[37，39]</u>. In this case， the patient failed in all medication attempts，bilateral implantation of deep brain stimulation could be an opportunity to improve myoclonus and dystonia. To summarize， MDS is a neurological movement disorder which mainly manifested as myoclonus and dystonia. It is genetically characterized by an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with maternal imprinting. In this study， we reported a4-generation MDS family who carried c.360delT deletion in SGCE gene. Affected members presented with myoclonic jerk， involuntary body tremors， frequent falls and torticollis with varying degrees， and alcohol ingestion could help to alleviate symptoms in some patients. However， patients responded to antiepileptic and other symptomatic drugs in varying outcomes. We hope that medications specific for MDS will be developed sooner rather than later.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The boy was finally diagnosed as ALGS and treated by ursodeoxycholic acid as well as fat-soluble vitamins. For patients with chronic and progressive liver damage， ALGS should be taken into consideration.

ALGS is caused by mutations in or deletions of either the JAGGED1 (JAG1) or NOTCH2 gene 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. Traditionally， the diagnosis of ALGS is based on a combination of the presence of intrahepatic bile duct paucity on liver biopsy with at least three of the major clinical features including liver disease (cholestasis)，congenital heart defects， vertebral abnormalities， ocular anomalies and characteristic facial features 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. However， this may cause misdiagnose with atypical or mild ALGS. Here we reported a 12-year-old male patient presented by recurrent transaminase elevation and hepatosplenomegaly over 11 years. There were no jaundice and other system disorders. Liver biopsy showed the patient had liver fibrosis but not the paucity of intrahepatic bile duct. The genome sequencing demonstrated a heterozygous mutation of JAG1 gene. The patient was finally diagnosed as ALGS. The availability of molecular testing led to the diagnosis of ALGS precisely.\n\n【6】Patient Information\n\n【7】A 12-year-old male patient was charged into hospital with chief complaint about recurrent transaminase elevation and hepatosplenomegaly over 11 years， which was the third time of his hospitalization. 11 years ago， the patient was found anorexia， abdominal distention， and mass on the left upper abdominal. There weren’t obvious jaundice， fever， vomits and clay stool. The patient’s liver function showed a mild elevation of transaminase while the CT scanning showed hepatosplenomegaly accompanied with loss of normal ratio of hepatic lobes. The patient also received gastroscopy examination which indicated mild esophageal varix. Finally， the patient was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. His parents rejected further treatment and only treated with Chinese herbal medicine (no details of the herbal medicine). 5 years ago， the patient admitted to hospital again with poor appetite and pale complexion. Likewise， the patient didn't have other symptoms.\n\n【8】The liver function still presented with a mild transaminase elevation. The patient received liver biopsy this time which showed swelling， ballooning degeneration of hepatocyte， focal necrosis and lymphocyte infiltration around portal tract. Neither fibrous hyperplasia nor bile ducts paucity were found. The patient was treated with injected reduced glutathione for a week and then changed into oral formula. The patient's liver function fluctuated continuously afterward and hospitalized for the third time.\n\n【9】The patient was G2P2 and the birth weight is 3.8 Kg. The patient had delayed clearance of jaundice which lasted nearly 6 months after birth. There was neither growth nor mental retardation of the patient. The patient had an elder brother who was health.\n\n【10】Clinical Findings\n\n【11】The patient had peculiar facial features with prominent forehead， bulbous nose， and pointed chin (supplementary data 1). There were no jaundice， pedal edema， purpura， spider nevi， cardiac murmur and lung rale. Abdomen examination revealed enlargement of liver and spleen. The liver was firm in texture and the span was 4.5 cm along the right mid-clavicular line while the spleen was 4 cm below the left costal margin with firm texture.\n\n【12】Diagnostic Assessment\n\n【13】There was slight elevation of liver transaminase， other blood\n\n【14】Table 1： The laboratory parameters of patient's liver function on different time\n\n| Table 1： The laboratory parameters of patient's liver function on different time point.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Time pointItem  | 20/07/05  | 22/07/05  | 8/11/12  | 31/05/16  | 07/07/16  | Normalreterence range  |\n| TB(umol/L)  | 8.6  | 10.7  | 19.1  | 22.3  | 19.4  | 1.8-21  |\n| DB(umol/L)  | 5.6  | 7.0  | 4.1  | 5.7  | 6.2  | 0-6.7  |\n| ALB(g/L)  | 47  | 41.7  | 45.1  | 45.8  | 43.9  | 38-52  |\n| ALT(U/L)  | 40.6  | 121  | 130  | 177.8  | 113  | 0-40  |\n| AST(U/L)  | 97.7  | 212  | 98.6  | 91.6  | 81  | 0-45  |\n| AKP(U/L)  | 440.2  | 448.2  | 304  | 328  | 400  | 100-360  |\n| GGT(U/L)  | 222.4  | 346.2  | 175  | 263.5  | 277  | 0-25  |\n| LDH(U/L)  | 452  | 345  | 242.4  | 243.3  | 256  | 100-300  |\n| BA(mmol/L)  | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | 43.8  | 30.5  | 0-15  |\n\n【16】Abbreviations： TB： Total Bilirubin DB： Direct Bilirubin； ALB： Albumin； ALT： Alanine Aminotran； AST： Aspartate Aminotransferase： AKP： Alkaline Phosphatase， GGT： y-GlutamylTranspeptidase， LDH： Lactate Dehydrogenase， BA： Bile Acid删除1换行tests including Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP)， ceruloplasmin， cholesterol， and triglyceride level， coagulation function test， blood ammonia， Tandem mass spectrometry were normal. The HBsAg， anti-HCV， and autoantibody were all negative. CT scan indicated loss of normal ratio among liver lobes， with lessening of right lobe and enlargement of left and caudate lobe . The portal vein was on the upper limit. Other Imaging examinations including chest X-ray and cardiac ultrasonic were normal. Liver biopsy demonstrated less swelling ballooning degeneration， focal necrosis of liver cells， however， there was mild proliferation of collagen and bile canaliculus around portal areas. The gene analysis found the boy had a heterozygous mutation of JAG1 gene on exon12 with the deletion of cytosine on p1563-1564， which caused frame shift mutation.\n\n【17】Therapeutic Intervention\n\n【18】The patients were diagnosed with Alagille Syndrome (ALGS) and treated with ursodeoxycholic acid and fat soluble vitamins. The patient was asked to follow-up regularly.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】In this case， hepatic disorder  and facial feature were two main manifestations of the patient. No positive found on other systems. There wasn’t obvious jaundice except for prolonged neonatal jaundice. Liver biopsies didn't show paucity of bile ducts， there was mild proliferation of bile canaliculus around portal areas instead. This result indicated that the liver histology of ALGS could be varied. Some patients may not present as paucity of bile duct in histology. In fact， it has been realized that a liver biopsy is no longer considered mandatoryto make a diagnosis of ALGS，and the presence of cholestasis is acceptable to fulfill this criterion. The y-Glutamyl transpeptidase and bile acid level of the patient were kept abnormal， which demonstrated the patients had chronic cholestasis. Except for that， the latest liver biopsy showed fibroplasias， which was not obvious before. This revealed that the liver damage was continuously progressing even if the symptom and liver function not further aggravated. We excluded other chronic liver diseases including Neonatal Intrahepatic Cholestasis caused by Citrin Deficiency(NICCD)， Glycogen storage disease， Wilson’s disease， Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis III (PFIC-III) and Autoimmune liver disease through blood test， imaging examination， and gene test. We also did the gene test of the patient's parents since the patient is删除1换行diagnosed. The result proved that his parents didn't carry the same mutation. The patient had a de novo mutation. Supportive treatment is the main therapy for live damage caused by alagille syndrome. Ursodeoxycholic acid is recommended for cholestasis. It has been reported that liver transplantation for ALGS has an 80% 5-year sur-vival rate， and results in some catch-up growth in 90% of affected individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】Alagille syndrome has complicated clinical manifestations varies from sub-clinical to multisystem disorders. For patients with chronic and progressive liver damage in his early life， ALGS should be taken into consideration. Molecular diagnosis is particularly useful for patients with atypical or mild Alagille syndrome who do not meet classic diagnostic criteria.\n\n【23】Informed Consent\n\n【24】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient's legal guardians for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The post-natal neurosonogram done on day of life 2 showed similar findings of that of the antenatal scan. Child was on regular follow up at the neurodevelopment clinic. She had attained partial neck holding at 3 months， currently she is able to turn to both the sides， has achieved social smile can recognize parents and babble. She has a pattern of head shaking observed since the neonatal period which is intermittent， rhythmic， and repetitive in a pattern of figure of 8.

She had a complex medical history including a cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma， excised at the age of 3， with supplementary radiotherapy. The diagnosis of POF was made at the age of 16 following history and investigation， primarily on the basis of amenorrhoea and low serum oestradiol levels. Hormonal profile was revisited and genital tract imaging was undertaken. The revised diagnosis ofhypothalamic amenorrhoea had been overlooked which had major implications on future fertility. The principles of diagnostics and therapeutic measure are discussed.\n\n【2】Abbreviations\n\n【3】AMH： Antimullerain Hormone； FSH： Follicle Stimulating Hormone； LH： Luteinising Hormone； MDT： Multidisciplinary Team； POF： Premature Ovarian Failure\n\n【4】Patient History\n\n【5】Miss X was only 3 years old when she was diagnosed with a Cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma. Initially， she underwent neurosurgery and further radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n\n【6】Secondary to this she unfortunately developed severe headaches and migraines caused by hydrocephalus and required multiple revisions of a Ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. As a result of her extensive neurosurgical history and the location of the lesion Miss X also suffered from left 4th cranial nerve palsy， however， this did not cause her any physical symptoms and， she has regular follow up by the ophthalmology team.\n\n【7】She subsequently went on to develop epilepsy secondary to the hydrocephalus. In additionally she was diagnosed with Reynaud’s phenomenon and having Thalassemia trait. Miss X subsequently went on to develop secondary amenorrhoea and was referred initially to a paediatric endocrinologist. There was no relevant family history to note.\n\n【8】Multidisciplinary clinical (MDT) management\n\n【9】Miss X was part of a large MDT (multidisciplinaryteam) including neurosurgeons，neurologists， paediatric oncologists， paediatric endocrinologists and reproductive endocrinology gynaecologist she was initially assessed bythe endocrinologist at the age of 16 to investigate her short stature-her height (146 cm) plotted on the 2n centile， and weight (43.3 kg) on the 9th centile for her age and sex. At which time she divulged that since her menarche in 2003 aged 13； she subsequently had1-2 normal menstrual cycles (5-6/28) and had been experiencing amenorrhoea since then. Miss X denies any inter-menstrual bleeding， and was not currently sexually active. On examination Miss\n\n【10】X had normal secondary sexual characteristics for her age and pubertal development was appropriate.\n\n【11】She was thoroughly investigated under the care of the paediatric endocrinologist from this point onwards in view ofher amenorrhoea and previous neuro-oncology history .\n\n【12】On the basis of the above results， she was diagnosed with Premature Ovarian Failure (POF)， at the age of 23 in view of hypo-oestrogenaemia. She was commenced on Loestrin (combined oral contraceptive pill) as a way of hormonal therapy. A conversation was documented with the paediatric oncologist regarding the necessity for； assisted reproduction with the possibility of using her mother/sisters as egg donors in the future for conception.\n\n【13】Reproductive endocrinology investigations\n\n【14】A referral was made to the reproductive endocrinology team at the age of 24 with a view to删除表格换行managing her hormonal replacement. Following a detailed history and examination， Miss X was further investigated； based on two principles. Firstly， to revisit the hormonal profile  and secondly， to investigate genital tract development with pelvic ultrasound scan in view ofthe early onset ofhypo oestrogenaemia.\n\n【15】Table 1： Initial hormone profile.\n\n|  | May 2013  | Sept 2013  | March 20 14  | Reference Ranges 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| FSH  | 12 U/ml  | 8U/ml  | 6U/ml  | Follicular phase (FP) 2.4- 12.6 IU/I Menopausal >30 IU/L  |  |\n| LH  | 40U/ml  | 6U/ml  | 9U/ml  | FP 3.5-12.5 U/  |  |\n| Oestradiol  |  | 85 pg/ml  | 86 pg/ml  | FP 45-854 pmol/l  |  |\n\n【17】Table 2： Revisited hormone profile.\n\n|  | May 14  | Feb 15  |  | June 15  | Normal ranges 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| FSH  | 5.4IU/ml  | 6.6IU/ml  |  | 8.1U/ml  | FP 2.4- 12.6IUA Menopausal 1.0>30 IUA  |\n| LH  | 9.5U/ml  | 7U/ml  |  | 8.6U/ml  | FP 3.5-12.5 U/  |\n| Oestradiaol  |  | 149 pg/ml  |  | 169 pg/ml  | FP 45-854 pmol/l  |\n| Prolactin  |  | 218 mlU/L  |  |  | 102-496 mlU/  |\n| Testosterone  |  | 1 nmol//L  |  |  | <1.5nmol/  |\n| SHBG  |  | 37 nmol/L  |  |  | 18-114 nmol/  |\n| Free androgen  |  | 2.7 nmol/L  |  |  | 7-10nmo/l  |\n| TFT  |  | TSH 2 pmol/L  |  |  | TSH 0.2-5mu/  |\n|  |  | T4 19.7 pmol/L  |  |  | T4 9-24 pmol/  |\n\n【19】Results\n\n【20】The results revealed； pituitary gonadotropins were within normal range. In addition， AMH (anti-Mullerain hormone) levels were also assessed and measured 41.95 pmolA (7-70 pmol/l normal range)， showing optimal ovarian reserve. Further discussion took place within the MDT， regarding the diagnosis of POF who were with the opinion that the results of all the above investigations supported the diagnosis of POF， primarily in view of the low oestradiol levels. The alternative diagnosis， of hypothalamic amenorrhoea， was initially rejected by the MDT in view of the normal (non-reduced) levels of pituitary gonadotrophins. The revised diagnosis was established as hypothalamic amenorrhoea. An ultrasound was performed confirming a small uterine size of 34.1 mm . There after dramatically changing the consequences and management plan for this young lady， who up until now was under the impression she would require In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and oocyte donation to conceive.\n\n【21】Management\n\n【22】The principle of our management was not only of providing删除1换行oestrogen replacement but equally importantly of ensure genital tract maturity， in preparation for future assisted reproduction. Miss X was commenced on high dose oestrogen preparation to stimulate the growth and maturation of her uterus.\n\n【23】She had a course of 6 mg estradiol in the form of a long 90 days cycle， followed by two weeks of progestogen to induce withdrawal bleeding. Subsequent pelvic ultrasound scans were also performed to assess the genital tract， with regular follow up in the reproductive endocrine clinic.\n\n【24】On review of the repeat pelvic ultrasound scans； from March 2015 to October 2015  revealed an initial increase in uterine length from 34 mm to 56 mm and from October 2015  to December 2015  to a fully mature size of 76 mm， a size able to potentially carry a pregnancy . All ultrasound imaging revealed normal ovarian size.\n\n【25】Discussion\n\n【26】Young females presenting with amenorrhoea， whether primary or secondary， would be seriously concerned regarding their reproductive potential. Basic investigations usually include levels of serum oestradiol and the pituitary gonadotrophins； FSH and LH to investigate the pituitary ovarian axis， amongst other investigations to exclude alternative causes of amenorrhoea. The diagnostic criteria of POF， also know and premature ovarian insufficiency， were revised and recommended as； oligo/amenorrhea for at least 4 months， and an elevated FSH level>25 IU/l on two occasions >4 weeks apart\n\n【27】通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>.

While the diagnosis of POF could be readily made by the elevated FSH and LH to menopausal levels， the levels of pituitary gonadotrophin in cases of hypothalamic amenorrhoea could well be misinterpreted. It has always been assumed that the levels should be low. However， Studies have shown that the absence of FSH elevation>10 IU/l， and the absence of LH elevation >6.5 IU/ is diagnostic of hypothalamic amenorrhoea 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. In keeping with the non-elevated levels in this case.\n\n【30】It is well documented that in post cranial radiotherapy as a child， there can be deficient growth hormone levels. However it is less commonly documented regarding the possible thyroid and gonadal effects - as these are thought to come from high dose radiation. However it was shown that 70% of the females involved in a study in 1993 suffered from oligo menorrhoea， and 50% had hypo oestrogenaemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.

Although， it's main consequences are viral pneumonia and respiratory manifestations， both arterial and venous thromboembolic events have also been recognized as potential complications associated with it. Here， we present a case of arterial thrombosis in a young patient with no significant past medical history who had recovered from COVID-19 several months prior to presentation.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)， the latest outbreak of infectious disease， is a viral respiratory illness caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Since its emergence， it has caused enormous medical challenges and an unprecedented global health crisis. Affected individuals mainly present with upper and lower respiratory symptoms in addition to several digestive symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. However， it has also being recognized to include different manifestations including myocardial infarction， seizures， meningitis， and coagulopathy. It has been described to predispose to thrombotic disease in both the venous and arterial circulations， which may lead to serious consequences as duration of anticoagulation in these patients remains unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. However， unlike venous thromboembolism， no sufficient data are available on arterial thrombosis in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\n【4】Here， we are describing a case of upper extremity arterial thrombosis for a patient who recovered from COVID-19 two months prior to presentation， during which time he had also developed a stroke and subsequently completed over a month of anticoagulation.\n\n【5】Material and Methods\n\n【6】By submitting this manuscript， a consent is given for the materials described in the manuscript to be freely available to researchers and scientists who intend to use it for non-commercial purpose， without violating participant’s confidentiality.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】We present a 36-year-old Hispanic male with no significant past medical history presented with left hand numbness and shortness of breath. He recovered from COVID-19 two months prior to admission during which time he developed a stroke with no residual deficits and completed a five-week course of apixaban. The etiology of his stroke was thought to be related to his COVID-19illness as workup of stroke at that time was negative.\n\n【9】On examination， the patient was alert， oriented， and vitally stable. His left hand was warm， with no color changes. Pulses and capillary refill in both hands were equal and symmetrical. Neurologic examination was normal.\n\n【10】Due to suspicion of acute pulmonary embolus given his presentation with shortness of breath in the setting of a recent COVID-19 infection， Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of the chest with contrast was performed. No central or segmental filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolus was noted； however， it revealed a non-occlusive filling defect within the origin of the left subclavian artery .\n\n【11】D-dimer was elevated at 1004 ng/ml (normal range <500 ng/ml). His thombophilic profile including anti-thrombin III level， factor V Leiden mutation， prothrombin gene mutation， protein C and protein S deficiency were all negative. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm.\n\n【12】During hospitalization no arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation was detected on telemetry monitoring. On transthoracic echocardiogram， he did not have any evidence of intra-cardiac thrombus or any intra-cardiac shunt. The patient was started on apixaban and aspirin with significant improvement in his symptoms.\n\n【13】On follow up 4 weeks later， a repeat Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) of chest with and without contrast showed interval resolution of the previously seen filling defect within the proximal left subclavian artery . The etiology of the subclavian thrombus was thought to be related to his COVID 19 infection that he had recovered from two months prior to admission.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Recently， the association between COVID-19 and coagulopathy has gained more interest， mainly due to the increase in number of cases afflicted by it and the fact that hypercoagulability adversely impact prognosis. The reported incidence of various thrombotic events in patients with COVID-19 had a range of 7.7% to 49%， which is significantly higher than the incidence in patients without COVID， with the incidence of venous thrombosis being much higher in comparison to arterial thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. There is a substantial pool of evidence of venous thrombotic events that has been well described； however， data on arterial thrombosis in these patients is still limited.\n\n【16】One of the studies reported that arterial thrombosis develops in approximately 4.4% of severe COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Observed risk factors include older age， male sex， Hispanic ethnicity， history of coronary artery disease and elevated D-dimer levels on presentation通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\nTheexact underlying pathophysiology of thromboembolic events in patients with COVID-19 is incompletely understood. However， several contributing factors including vascular endothelial dysfunction， platelet activation， excessive inflammation， hypoxia， immobilization and diffuse intravascular coagulation are thought to|删除段之间换行|The main dilemma is how to optimally approach management in such high-risk hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the absence of well conducted trials.

However， after giving the anticoagulant for another 4 weeks， the thrombus has resolved completely as confirmed by the repeat of CTA. More data is needed to improve the prevention， diagnosis， and treatment of thrombotic complications in these patients.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】Thromboembolic complications， specifically arterial thrombosis can be seen months after recovering from COVID-19 infection despite over a month of anticoagulation.

Later， we found patient's mucous membrane of double tonsil， palatoglossus arch， palatopharyngeus arch， palatine uvula was covered by white pseudo-membrane. It was suspected as syphilis of the pharynx. Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) and Treponema Pallidum Hemagglutination Assay (TPHA) tests confirmed the pharynx syphilis. After the patient went through the anti-syphilitic remedy， her symptoms and signs completely disappeared. During the 24-month routinely follow-up， no relapse was observed and the pharynx lesion disappear accompany with negative RPR tests results.\n\n【2】Keywords： Pharynx； Syphilis； Secondary syphilis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Syphilis could affect any human organs and tissues and trigger various manifestations. The incubation period of Treponema pallidum is between 15 and 90 days. Recently， the incidence of syphilis is increased rapidly in China， and it is ranked number three among infectious diseases in China， only preceded by tuberculosis and hepatitis. China economy development， imbalance of male and female population， emergence of numerous migrant workers from rural area， the social acceptance of sexual services， and the growth in number of male homosexuality are the major attributions to the increase in incidence rate of syphilis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Such incidence rate grew from 6.43 percent ofevery one hundred thousand population in 2000 to 32.86 percent in 2013 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【5】The typical site infected by syphilis is genital. About 85 percent of patients with primary syphilis have genital chancre， and only 4 percent of them have oropharynx be affected 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The typical site are the genital area but 5% of all chancres are extra genital and the mouth is the most frequent location especially in man who have sex with men. The primary chancre can also occur on anus， fingers， nipples 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The manifestations of syphilis is more complicated nowadays and it is more easily to get missed and misdiagnosed by physicians 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Therefore， pharynx syphilis report is currently quite rare\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 48-year-old female patient had no fever but throat discomfort， mild sore throat， cough， and voice hoarseness three months ago. Her symptom was getting aggravated， and she personaly started taking anti-infective medicine as treatment. However， it did not ease her symptoms， so she visit Tongji Hospital’s otolaryngology department and she was preliminarily diagnose with acute tonsillitis. The doctor in Tongji Hospital treated this female patient by using penicillin and metronidazole intravenous dose， and her manifestations were mitigated. However， once the patient's treatment was discontinued for several days， her manifestations would relapse. On May20，2011， this female patient had first visit of my department for another opinion， and I found that she had throat congestion and lymphadenopathy. In addition， mucous membrane of double tonsil， palatoglossus arch，palatopharyngeus arch， palatine uvula was covered by white pseudomembrane， which did not bleed but was hard to be erased and became painful once it was touched . Three tests were performed： rapid plasma regain circle card test (PRP) had titer of 1：64； Treponema Pallidum Hemagglutination test (TPHA) yield positive reaction； HIV screening test show negative result. Later， dermatology department was also invited for consultation. The female patient denied having any unclean sexual intercourse history after being further inquired of her medical history. The husband of this female patient was advised to see the doctor. It was found that he had genital syphilis and he admitted that he had unclean sexual intercourse history. Based on the test results， this female patient was diagnosed with secondary syphilis. To cure the syphilis， a single dose of 2.4\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Syphilis has four stages， and it may be so inconspicuous as to go unnoticed. It is highly infectious in this stage owing to the prosperity of the spirochetes in the site of primary lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The early stages of syphilis include primary and secondary stage. Besides genital， pharynx is another common site for lesion. In addition to the impact on pharynx， most patients with secondary stage of pharynx syphilis may have their genitals and/or other parts of the body been infected simultaneously. Other manifestations may include skin and mucous membrane rashes， cervical lymphadenopathy， pathological changes on eyes， etc. Primary stage of pharynx syphilis will manifest by painless chancre developed at the site of infection (usually at tonsil) 2to 4 weeks following the exposure.\n\n【10】Patients with secondary stage of pharynx syphilis may manifest by infected mucous membrane. Mucosal plaques are the most common oral manifestation in the secondary stage 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【11】Damages on mucous membrane of pharynx mainly reflect from two aspects： First， mucosa patches are the most common oral manifestation during the secondary stage. Second is flat wart. Patients may or may not have obvious symptom. But， they may experience mild sore throat and sensation of foreign body. Generally， the lesion sites of pharynx syphilis are palatine uvula， soft palate， double tonsil， etc 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Laryngeal syphilis is quite rare.\n\n【12】With the increase in incidence rate of syphilis， more and more patients with infected mucous membrane in pharynx as initial manifestation have their first diagnosis at departments of otolaryngology. But， they may be missed or misdiagnosed by relatively\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Pharynx syphilis of some patients may be alleviated by certain inappropriate treatment， but it may not completely kill treponema pallidur because it is not antisyphilitictreatment. Thus， inappropriate treatments for syphilis will lead to recurrence of symptoms， and it is highly contagious.

The radiological imaging was diagnostic of inflammatory polyradiculopathy involving multiple cranial nerves and the brachial plexus. His neurological symptoms gradually improved following a course of Tamiflu. We hereby present a case of inflammatory polyradiculopathy post Influenza B infection. This case highlights the importance ofconsidering neurological complications in patients with influenza B infection and the need for timely diagnosis and management.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Influenza B is a common cause for upper and lower respiratory tract infection. It mainly presents with upper respiratory tract symptoms like rhinorrhea， dry cough， and nasal congestion along with systemic symptoms like generalized fever， headache， malaise and myalgia. Neurological complication due to influenza B infection is very rare. We report a case of polyradiculopathy post influenza B infection.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 54-year-old gentleman presented to Emergency Department as he woke up with new left-hand numbness and weakness， drooping of left eye associated with double vision and right sided facial weakness. These symptoms were preceded with a two-day history of fever， cough and myalgia. He is generally fit and well with no past medical history. He denied having his annual flu vaccine.\n\n【6】He was initially seen by the stroke team in Emergency Department for a presumed stroke and given aspirin. Initial CT head showed no intracranial pathology and the subsequent MRI confirmed this. He was referred to neurology. Neurological examination showed he had a left cranial nerve III and VI palsy and right cranial nerve VII (LMN) palsy， with weakness of power in his left hand， there was no sensory deficit， ataxia or cerebellar signs. His deep tendon reflexes were normal and plantars were flexor.\n\n【7】Investigations\n\n【8】A nasopharyngeal swab was sent for respiratory viral screen on admission which tested positive for influenza B and was negative for all other viruses including SARS-CoV-2.MRI head and spine with contrast suggested inflammatory polyradiculopathy involving the right facial and right abducens and lower cervical nerve roots (C7 and C8). The subsequent MRI of the brachial plexus confirmed inflammatory polyradiculopathy involving the left C7 and C8 cervical nerve roots， the inferior trunk of the left brachial plexus and the right facial nerve. Nerve conduction studies further reiterated brachial plexus involvement on both sides with medial cord (C8) dysfunction that is mainly sensory on the left， with moderate left median nerve involvement and severe left radial nerve involvement， and sparing of more proximal muscles. The right radial territory (C7) was also involved. He also had a whole-body CT scan which excluded any evidence of malignancy.\n\n【9】His blood results on admissionshowed a normalwhite cell countof7.9×10/L，thrombocytopenia with platelets of 109×10/L and C-reactive protein of <5 mg/L， he also was tested negative for Borrelia， Epstein Barr virus， Hepatitis B， Cytomegalovirus.However， his Hepatitis C virus antibody删除1换行was positive， HCV RNA titer was slightly raised at 5.74 Log IU/mL.

Furthermore， no oligoclonal bands were detected in the CSF.\n\n【10】Recovery\n\n【11】During his inpatient stay， he was started on a course of Tamiflu for 5 days. The cranial nerve palsies improved gradually as well as his left-hand strength. His neurological symptoms completely resolved by day 7 of his admission and he was discharged home.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】We report a unique case of a patient with multiple cranial neuropathies and inflammatorypolyradiculopathy including brachial plexus with Influenza B infection. In view of his smoking history and sudden onset of symptoms he was suspected of stroke but following radiological study did not confirm this hence was investigated further. As he had preceding viral flu like illness， he had nasal swab test for the respiratory virus which confirmed Influenza B. The radiological study， CSF study and nerve conduction study confirmed multiple cranial neuropathy and lower cervical root involvement including brachial plexopathy.\n\n【14】In view of his given symptoms， he was screened for infectious， inflammatory， neoplastic/paraneoplastic and metabolic causes of polyneuropathy.

According to ultrasonographic examination， thanatophoric dysplasia type 1 or ACG2 was suspected. Therefore， we performed three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) which showed the lack of ossification of the fetal vertebral bodies clearly. We diagnosed ACG2， and the parents decided on termination of the pregnancy. Here we report a case of ACG2 that was clearly identified with 3D-CT in the early second trimester.\n\n【2】Keywords： Achondrogenesis； Prenatal diagnosis； Three-dimensional computed tomography\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Achondrogenesis type 2 (ACG2) is a lethal disorder that presents with a large skull， very small and short limbs， and a lack of mineralization of most vertebral bodies. The pelvis has small iliac wings with absent ischia， pubic bones， and sacral elements. The extremities show severe rhizomelia and mesomelia with relative sparing of the hands 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. It occurs in approximately1 in 20，000 births and is caused by a dominant mutation in the type 2 collagen gene (COL2A1) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. However， it is difficult to diagnose it exactly， because there are more than 150 different classification in skeletal dysplasia disease， of which many are extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>.\n\n【5】Recent studies have suggested that three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) is more accurate than ultrasound for prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The morphology of the spine and pelvic bones is often inconspicuous on ultrasound， and an accurate diagnosis can be difficult using only ultrasound. On the other hand， 3D-CT can more precisely evaluate the skull， ribs， pelvic bones， vertebrae， and bone mineralization regardless of fetal position or amniotic fluid volume. Here we report a case of ACG2 that was clearly identified on 3D-CT in the early second trimester.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\nA 23-year-old Japanese woman (gravida 1， para 0) was referred to our hospital at 19 weeks and 0 days gestation with the fetus having severe shortening of the long bones. She had no history of drug or alcohol abuse and no relevant family history. Additionally， she had no complication and any history of infection in the first of pregnancy. She had no screening of fetus by ultrasound scan from 11 weeks to 13 weeks. In 14 weeks gestation， her fetus was scanned only for measuring biparietal diameter. In 18 weeks gestation， severe shortening of the limbs was detected for the first time. In our hospital at 19 weeks gestation， ultrasonographic examination for the fetus revealed severe shortening of the limbs (-5.3 S.D.)， a narrow thorax， nuchal translucency， and no cloverleaf skull deformity. When pressing the skull of the fetus with the ultrasound probe， the skull was not deformed.No heart defects or other obvious structural abnormalities were identified|删除段之间换行|Based on these findings， thanatophoric dysplasia type 1 (TD1) or ACG2 was suspected. Therefore， we performed 3D-CT at 19 weeks of gestation. CT was performed with a multi-detector row CT unit (Aquillion ONE； Toshiba Medical Systems， Tokyo， Japan) with 3D adaptive iterative|删除段之间换行|Radiological evaluation of the fetus after the delivery showed findings consistent with ACG2 . It showed metaphyseal flaring and cupping of long bones， absence of talus and calcaneal ossification were observed more clearly than 3DCT. In addition， the molecular analysis of DNA obtained from placenta demonstrated mutation for a c.3427G>A transition (P.G1143S) in exon 40-54 of the COL2A1 gene.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Our case demonstrates that， even in the early second trimester， ACG2 is characterized by a lack of vertebral body ossification. Moreover， 3D-CT contributed to a precise diagnosis of ACG2. Ossification occurs at a relatively early human gestational age： the clavicle and mandible are ossified by 8 weeks； the appendicular skeleton， ileum and scapula by 12 weeks； and the metacarpals and metatarsals by 12-16 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Secondary (epiphyseal) ossification centers can be seen by radiographs by 20 weeks gestation. Since bone is echodense by ultrasound， the fetal bone is relatively well visualized by two-dimensional ultrasound in the second trimester of pregnancy通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. However， the morphology of the spine and pelvic bones is often inconspicuous on ultrasound. In previous studies， 33-88% of ACG2cases were correctly diagnosed by ultrasonography in the prenatal period 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\nIn this case， it was difficult to distinguish ACG2 from TD1. Both disorders are characterized by severe shortening of the limbs and a narrow thorax， but with ACG there is a lack of vertebral body ossification. However， the spine could not be clearly visualized in our case because the fetus was in the spine position. Accurate prenatal diagnosis allows physicians to provide appropriate counseling to families about perinatal lethality， consideration for focused molecular analysis， prediction of neonatal complications， recurrence risk， and maternal management 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. In addition a timely specific prenatal diagnosis is important because of termination laws. In Japan， the|删除段之间换行|Ultrasound examination is useful because it is minimally invasive and easy； however， the resolution depends on the fetus position and amniotic fluid volume. On the other hand，3D-CT is able to provide a precise diagnosis even if there is almost no amniotic fluid 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Recent studies have suggested that 3D-CT is more accurate than ultrasound for prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【11】This case showed a precise prenatal diagnosis of ACG2 by using3D-CT in the early second trimester. On the other hand，ACG2 was diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound at 12 weeks by Soothill in1993 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The authors showed that the fetus had severe generalized subcutaneous edema and short limbs by ultrasound scanning. In addition， radiological evaluation of the fetus after termination showed marked limb shortening with flaring and cupping of the metaphyseal ends of the long bones and ribs but no rib fractures. Immunocytochemistry showed the presence of type 1 collagen. They diagnosed ACG2 by those findings. However， the fetus in that case clearly had ossification of the fetal vertebral bodies； therefore， that casemightnot conform to the current ACG2 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Including molecular analysis， we considered the possibility of osteogenesis imperfecta. Except for the above-mentioned case report， our report is the first report of a precise prenatal diagnosis of ACG2 in the early second trimester.\n\n【12】This is the first report of a precise prenatal diagnosis of ACG2using 3D-CT in the early second trimester.

Histologically， there is scarred parenchyma and dense intraluminal collagen present within the airways， which is not present in OP. It is unclear why this architectural destruction occurs， and unfortunately to date， seems to be less steroid responsive when compared to OP. The prognosis of CiOP is unknown. We highlight this case to bring awareness to a new histologic variant of organizing pneumonia， where there is limited case series to direct potential therapies. There is growing concern that this variant portrays a worse prognosis than OP， although this is not yet proven in clinical studies. Additional studies are warranted for more information for both providers and patients.\n\n【2】Keywords： Cicatricial organizing pneumonia； Fibrosing interstitial pneumonia； Organizing pneuonia\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Organizing pneumonia (OP) is an inflammatory reaction defined histologically by the presence ofloosely organized fibromyxoid granulation tissue (Masson bodies) in the lumen of small airways， alveolar ducts， and alveoli 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. It is classified as cryptogenic or secondary to a number of known causes including infection， medications， autoimmune diseases， hypersensitivity pneumonitis， or aspiration 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，4]</u>. Clinically patients present with non-resolving respiratory complaints and pulmonary infiltrates usually after a trial of antibiotics， steroids， or both. They may present sub-acutely with a secondary worsening of symptoms most commonly including dyspnea， dry cough， and fatigue after an initial improvement. It can be difficult to diagnose OP based on chest imaging alone as it can present in a varietyof patterns including nodules， reticulations， ground glass opacities， consolidative disease with subpleural or peribronchovascular distribution， or crazy paving. There is preservation of background pulmonary architecture without interstitial or dense airspace fibrosis通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. These radiographic findings are traditionally steroid responsive 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 65-year-old male with a remote four pack-year smoking history presented to the hospital with four months of progressive dyspnea on exertion with associated chest tightness. Initial evaluation including basic laboratory data， electrocardiogram， and chest radiograph were normal. An echocardiogram revealed a dilated aorta which prompted a chest Computed Tomography (CT). This was abnormal and he was referred to the pulmonary clinic for further evaluation.\n\nHe reported MMRC grade 1 dyspnea without cough， sputum production， or chest pain. His symptoms started about four months prior and were progressive in nature. He had no symptoms or clinical manifestations of autoimmune disease and an extensive serum autoimmune work-up was negative. His occupational and social exposures included a remote history of working on a farm and transporting sand crates approximately 45 years prior to presentation. He also endorsed a 25-year exposure during his childhood and as a young adult to wood dust and coal ash with a|删除段之间换行|B) The palypoidal plugs of arganizing pneumonia consist of collagen/fibrous tissue highlighted as blue (circled) (Masson Trichrome stain， scanning magnification， 4x).\n\n【8】C) The polypaidal plugs of organizing pneumonia consist of myafibrablasts highlighted as brown (circled) (Smooth muscle actin stain， scanning magnification， 4x).\n\n【9】D) Conventional polypoidal plugs (circled) of organizing pneumonia seen along with the transition to fibrotic areas (arrow) (hematoxylin and easin stain， low power magnification， 10x).\n\n【10】E) Conventional polypoidal plugs (circled， pale blue) of organizing pneumonia seen alang with the transition to fibrotic areas (arrow， deep blue) (Masson Trichrome stain， low power magnification， 10x).\n\n【11】F) Conventional polypoidal plugs (circled， lighter areas) of organizing pneumonia seen along with the transition to fibrotic areas (arrow， magenta)(Elastic Van-Gieson stain， low power magnification， 10x).删除2换行sampling. He underwent right sided Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) wedge resection. The predominant histologic feature was that of peribronchiolar and subpleural fibromyxoid plugs transitioning into fibrosis . This airspace organization(Masson bodies) shows varying degrees of fibrosis， demonstrated as deep blueish and light magenta areas on the Masson Trichrome and Elastic Van-Gieson histochemical stains respectively. Smooth muscle actin immunohistochemical stain showed the presence of myofibroblasts. There was also evidence of chronic pleuritis， but no granulomata， food， or foreign material were present. There was no microscopic honeycombing or fibroblastic foci.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】The term Cicatricial OP (CiOP) was recently introduced within the last six years to describe a histologically discrete subtype of OP通用删除6(英):<u>[2，4]</u>. First described by Yousem et al. in 2017， there are only a small number of case reports to date reviewing clinical， radiographic and histologic data of this condition 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，4，6-8]</u>. Symptoms are similar to those in OP and range from dyspnea on exertion to dry cough， reported in up to 80% of individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，4，7]</u>. On imaging， findings typical of OP such as subpleural， peribronchial or nodular consolidations， as well as reticulations with associated ground glass are common 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，6，7]</u>. Chronic fibrotic changes， including traction bronchiectasis or honeycombing are uncommon in CiOP 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，7，9，10]</u>. The radiographic similarities between OP and CiOP make it difficult删除1换行to diagnose without tissue sampling. Histologically， OP fills the small airways and develops into patchy airspace disease with loose connective tissue， occasionally with mixed fibrin and alveolar filling， without scar or honeycomb formation 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. A key pathologic finding in CiOP is the presence of scarred lung parenchyma and dense intraluminal collagen within the fibroinflammatory mass 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. There is distortion but not destruction of the parenchymal architecture because intact septal elastin is drawn inwards toward the central eosinophilic fibrotic tissue. These architectural changes make it appear as if the center of the fibroinflammatory mass is scarred while the periphery of the nodule displays typical loose fibromyxoid buds of connective tissue consistent with OP 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，8]</u>. Cicatricial features are common in OP and can be present more than 50% of the time； however， a cut-off of equal to or greater than 50% cicatricial changes has been proposed to define CiOP 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【14】Our patient had greater than 60% cicatricial features on biopsy.\n\n【15】The pathogenesis and development of cicatricial features is unclear. Potentially OP has gone too long under recognized and under treated， or perhaps there is a specific immune mediated reaction within these patients that puts them at increased risk. There is limited data on the prognosis of CiOP， with mixed results to date regarding the effectiveness of steroid therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，4，6-8]</u>. Given the ambiguity of symptoms and lack of characteristic imaging findings， the diagnosis of CiOP requires a lung biopsy. Current potential treatments include oral steroids with doses ranging from 40 mg/day to 120 mg/day for greater than 2 months. Yousem et al. reported45% of 12 patients had resolution of their radiographic infiltrates and were without symptoms at 110 months of follow up while the remaining 55% had progressive or persistent radiographic disease despite steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Similarly， in a Canadian cohort， 60% of patients had radiographic improvement or stability with steroids between 2and 49 months 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> and in a cohort from Mayo Clinic， 67% of patients were alive after a median follow up of 47 months 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Our patient was started on prednisone at 0.5 mg/kg daily； however， after 6 months of treatment， there was no subjective or radiographic improvement in disease； therefore， steroid therapy was discontinued. There was also no worsening of symptoms or CT findings. To date， his pulmonary function testing and imaging findings remain stable， one year after completion of steroid therapy.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】Prior to presentation our patient was a very active man， and although his imaging findings were subtle， his new symptoms affected his daily activities. There were no previous imaging studies to compare the chronicity of his CT findings. While he did have a significant inhalational exposure in his distant past， it is unknown删除1换行if this had any contribution to his current radiographic findings or symptoms. We postulate that given the remote exposure； his disease is more consistent with a cryptogenic entity. He also had a significant family history of reported idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. He was referred for genetic counseling； however， deferred additional testing at the time. We highlight this case to raise awareness of this histological form of organizing pneumonia which so far seems to be less steroid responsive than traditional OP. CiOP is an increasingly recognized variant of organizing pneumonia， which requires tissue diagnosis. Histopathological findings include those of organizing pneumonia intermixed with the presence of intra-alveolar fibrosis and dense intraluminal collagen， to a degree more than 50%. The treatment of CiOP is not well characterized and neither are the prognostic indicators of a favorable outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It usually develops in the retroperitoneum and lower limbs. Although this tumour usually metastasizes to various sites such as the lungs， chest wall and retroperitoneal space， cardiac metastasis especially to the pericardium is extremely rare. This may prove to be a diagnostic and treatment challenge with regards to other types of lesions in the pericardium. An accurate diagnosis， identifying the location， tissue composition and nature of the mass is vital in deciding on early surgical treatment. We report a case of metastatic pericardialliposarcoma that presented with cardiac tamponade after 25 years of the initial liposarcoma in the popliteal fossa.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 55-year-old gentleman with underlying hypertension and dyslipidaemia presented to us in December 2015 with increasing shortness of breath for the past 2 weeks. He has a history of left knee liposarcoma at the popliteal fossa and underwent complete surgical excision in 1990， with no evidence of recurrence since then. Chest radiography  revealed an enlarged cardiac shadow with some widening of the mediastinum and atelectasis of the right lung in the mid zone. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm and the cardiac enzyme markers were within normal limits. An echocardiogram was also performed and showed global pericardial effusion with features of pericardial tamponade. There was also a mass noted lateral to the left ventricle. Urgent pericardiocentesis was done and 1.3 litres of haemorrhagic fluid was drained.\n\n【4】A CT thorax with contrast  done a week later revealed left posterior pericardial mass measuring 4.6 cm x 4.7 cm x 5.0 cm with minimal right pericardial effusion and scattered non-specific lung nodules in both the lung fields (<5 mm). An initial diagnosis of pericardial cyst was made and patient was kept under surveillance. Hence a repeat surveillance CT thorax  was performed 6 months later and showed the mass had enlarged in size to 6.9 cm x5.0 cm x5.7 cm with resolved pericardial effusion and stable non-specific lung nodules. He subsequently underwent a left Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) biopsy of the mass which turned out to be a myxoid liposarcoma of intermediate grade. The mass was found to be densely adhered to the pericardium.\n\nHe then underwent a cardiac MRI  which showed a soft tissue mass arising from|删除段之间换行|the pericardium adjacent to the left ventricle with involvement of the descending thoracic aorta， thoracic oesophagus and left hemidiaphragm. As the lesion was invading surrounding structures he was then subjected to 25 cycles of neoadjuvant radiotherapy in November 2016 and a repeat CT scan  a month later showed significant reduction in tumour size to 2.1 cm x5.6 cmx4.5cm with a clear fat plane between the mass and adiacent structures plus no evidence of distant metastasis. The non-specific small lung nodules (<5 mm) remain unchanged. In view of this， we planned for a curative resection of his tumour. To further clarify the nature of the lung nodules， we carried out a PET-CT scan which confirmed no FDG-avid lesions elsewhere.\n\nIn January 20177 patient underwentLca leftposterolateral thoracotomywith en bloc resection ofthe left pericardial mass (Figure|删除段之间换行|6) and implantation of a prolene mesh over the pericardial defect with plication of the left hemi-diaphragm . The tumour which had a solid and cystic component was densely adhered to the lateral epicardial surface of the heart. A portion of the epicardium of the lateral wall of the heart was taken together as en bloc resection with the mass. An on table frozen section of the epicardial surface adjacent to the tumour showed no evidence of malignancy with just hypertrophied myocytes . Enlarged lymph node samples taken from stations 6， 9， and 10 also showed no evidence of malignancy. The histopathology result of the tumour itself confirmed a myxoid liposarcoma. The patient recovered well from his surgery and was discharged home within a week. He has remained well since. He is currently on a 6-monthly follow up under the Oncologist and his latest repeat CT thorax  in June 2018 which showed no evidence of tumour recurrence.\n\n【7】LL： Left Lung； Ao： Aorta； LV： Left Ventricle Exposed； D： Diaphragm\n\n【8】Discussion\n\nLiposarcoma has been classified by WHO into four distinct histological subtypes as follows： well-differentiated， myxoid/round cell，pleomorphic and dedifferentiated 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. They have a propensity for local recurrence in about 40% of the cases， but very rarely metastasise通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Despite metastatic lesions ofextracardiacliposarcoma being more common than the development ofprimary cardiac liposarcoma itself， the incidence of metastasis to the pericardium remains extremely low， with only ten cases that have been reported in the literature up to the year 2015 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-31</u>. The time interval between the initial presentation of liposarcoma and the cardiac metastasis can be quite long， ranging from 7 to 25 years 3|.\n\n【10】The initial presentation of cardiac metastasis of liposarcom depends on the part of the heart involved and the size of the tumour. Mostly they remain undiagnosed until patients develop symptoms mainly due to compressive effects on the heart chambers which could manifest as congestive heart failure， arrhythmia，pericarditis，angina， syncope and sudden cardiac death 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>. Pericardial invasion may also lead to effusions of various sizes that can result in tamponade and diastolic cardiac impairment， as what we experienced with our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，6]</u>. This could turn out to be a critical and life-threatening situation if not addressed in a timely manner.\n\n【11】The first-line treatment for primary liposarcoma is surgical excision with complete resection of the tumour whenever possible通用删除6(英):<u>[1-2]</u>. Local recurrence or distant metastasis can occur many years after treatment of the primary tumour， hence the past history of删除1换行liposarcoma is important here 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，4]</u>. Although there is no standard treatment for cardiac or pericardial metastases， radical surgical resection of the metastatic tumour provides the highest chance of long-lasting survival 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，4，6]</u>. When combined with neoadjuvant radiotherapy， this may significantly reduce the rate of disease progression and recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，5，6]</u>. Chemotherapy has been shown to be effective in a fraction of cases of metastatic or unresectable soft tissue sarcoma，however the overall response rate was only 46% and it is still lacking in evidence 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，4，5]</u>.\n\n【12】In our patient，transthoracic echocardiography initially identified the mass， which was further delineated by CT thorax. However the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) demonstrated that the mass had invaded the surrounding structures， which was in keeping with the feature of a malignant tumour. This was significant in presurgical planning as it enabled the patient to have neoadjuvant radiotherapy. MRI is a well established imaging modality in assessing any suspected cardiac lesions， plus it can be useful for tissue characterization and differentiation between benign and malignant tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. The integration of all the information provided by various imaging methods enabled us to provide the most appropriate treatment for this patient.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Metastatic pericardial liposarcoma can prove to be a diagnostic challenge and multimodal imaging is highly recommended for optimal preoperative assessment to evaluate the differential diagnosis and deciding on appropriate treatment. Aggressive surgical resection with the intention of resolving any cardiac impairment is thetreatment of choice and combination with perioperative radiotherapy may help to prolong survival and avoid recurrence. However， continued surveillance and long-term follow-up with serial imaging is required for all cases of cardiac liposarcomas.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The association between HbE heterozygous with development oftransient cold agglutinin disease in COVID-19 infection is yet to be ascertained.\n\n【5】Keywords： Autoimmune hemolytic anemia； COVID-19； Heterozygous HbE； Cold agglutinin disease\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】COVID-19has entered its third year since its beginning in 2019. The various strains have affected the world having different virulence and infectivity. Initially starting from the Chinese province of Hubei and is still rapidly spreading throughout the world. With time we are becoming more aware of the various complications of the disease. There have been a few case reports of Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) associated with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. This will be the first report of an AIHA-cold agglutinin disease associated with this viral infection and subsequently the presence of HbE phenotype to the best of our knowledge. It is important for us to be aware of the various presentations of COVID-19 which are not typical and can cause problems for the physician initially.\n\n【8】Acquired hemolytic anemia can be caused by mechanical destruction of cells as seen in paraprosthetic valve regurgitation and march hemoglobinuria， infection caused by malaria (most common infectious cause of hemolytic anemia) and other bacterial and viral infections， immune hemolytic anemia's， favism， drug induced and transfusion related hemolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【9】Autoimmune hemolysis consists of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia， paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria， cold agglutinin disease and drug or toxic agent induced. Two mechanisms are defined to explain the pathophysiology of autoimmune hemolysis. The first mechanism is known as innocent bystander effect in which the antibody is directed against certain molecule (drug/toxic substance) and in subsequent action leads to destruction of RBCs. The second mechanism consists oftrue autoantibody against the RBC s 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.删除2换行cited. Unlike acquired， primary cold agglutinin disease is a rare disease. Countries of northern Europe删除1换行and Atlantic have the incidence of approximately 1 to 1.8 per million and the prevalence at approximately 13 to 16 per million. Females have slightly higher prevalence than males. Median age of diagnosis is in the 60s and 70s 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【10】Cold agglutinin disease is less common than warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia， approximately one-fifth to one-quarter of patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The disease is also known to occur in association with lymphoid malignancies and autoimmune disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【11】Cold agglutinins frequently occur during the course of M. pneumoniae and Epstein-Barr virus infection. Case reports have described cold agglutinins with other viral infections such as rubella virus， HIV， COVID-19 infection， influenza viruses， or varicella-zoster virus 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【12】All individuals who have these infections does not develop cold agglutinins and will not have clinically significant hemolysis. It usually occurs approximately two weeks after onset of the primary infection. This condition is reported to resolve spontaneously after the resolution of infection. The blood parameters return to normal limits in few weeks to months. Cold agglutinins have also been reported in individuals with autoimmune disorders，i.e.， rheumatoid arthritis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【13】Case Presentation\n\n【14】The 45 years old lady who is resident of Meghalaya， India was referred by primary care hospital for severe anemia of unexplained origin to our hospital on January 3m， 2022.

On routine urine examination RBCs and urobilinogen and bilirubin was reported.\n\n【21】The patient's blood was sent for blood grouping and matching but initialy the test showed unequivocal results due to agglutination ofred blood cells. After washing and incubating RBCs at 37·C， blood grouping was performed which was reported to be A1B positive. The patient's direct coombs test came positive. Cross matching was done and compatible blood was issued and transfused to the patient.\n\n【22】Hemoglobin chromatography was sent to rule out hemoglobinopathy which came out positive for HbE heterozygous. ANA profile was sent to rule out association with other AI disorders which came out to be negative for common antigens. The patient was not evaluated for lymphoid malignancies as the history， examination and laboratory investigations were not demonstrating any characteristics of the disease.\n\n【23】Cold agglutinin disease was suspected in view of COVID-19 and algorithm followed for processing of blood in laboratory. The patient was given supportive treatment. She was kept in warm environment with the help of blankets and room heater and was advised to avoid exposure to cold. She was transfused with 3 units of whole blood. The hemogl obin levels reached 8.2 g/dL after the initial management. Oral glucocorticoids were started in view to prevent further deterioration of COVID-19 infection. The patient also received folate supplementation for her hemoglobin phenotype.\n\n【24】The patient was discharged with advice for home isolation in warm environment on the fourth day of admission and was asked to follow up after isolation.\n\n【25】Discussion\n\n【26】The patient was going through her first episode of autoimmune hemolysis in association with viral infection. Cold agglutinin disease is recognized as a chronic disease with predilection in old age population. It can also present as acute exacerbation on chronic condition in association with bacterial or viral infection. The antibody is predominant in the disease is IgM type and reacts poorly or not at all at 37·C， whereas it reacts strongly at lower temperatures that cause complement-mediated hemolysis by binding the I antigen on the red cell surface 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The average temperature in Meghalaya in December-January， 21-22 was 12.1C； while minimum was 7.4C and maximum being 16.9C. The patient must have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2virus in the preceding 2 weeks as the average incubation period of presentation is 9 days.\n\n【27】The pathophysiology of COVID-19 is not a fully established， cytokine storm with a hypercoagulable state， and an increased incidence of venous thromboembolism has been postulated. This hematologic dysfunction with proinflammatory infection conditions， as seen in COVID-19， leads to hemolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【28】Primary cold agglutinin disease and secondary cold agglutinin syndrome may be suspected in a patient with symptoms induced due to cold such as discomfort in the extremities with exposure to cold. Cold Agglutinin Disease should also be suspected in a patient with hemolysis or red blood cell agglutination in a blood collection tube which is cold when the peripheral blood smear reports the same. Presence of very high mean corpuscular volume is a spurious result caused by RBC agglutination which is seen in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The present case demonstrated transient cold agglutinins and acute anemia in a patient diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 Infection. This case has unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia as conjugated bilirubin was less than 15% of total bilirubin. The hemogram reported high reticulocyte count further confirming hemolysis. Cold agglutinin titer was not measured due to unavailability of the test but the symptoms of the patient， results of direct Coombe’s test and peripheral blood smear， processing ofthe blood samples in warm temperature and subsequent supportive treatment given to the patient indicates towards the cold agglutinin phenotype.\n\n【29】Few case reports and case series have been published having cold agglutinin induced hemolysis in presence of COVID-19. In these cases， three fourth survived but one fourth expired due to hemolysis induced anemia and subsequent circulatory failure. According to reports those who improved were treated with Rituximab and DMARD's in addition to supportive care， while those who were managed with only blood transfusion did not survive 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The severity of anemia and hemolysis was not specified in few cases but this case further gives positive result with conservative treatment with blood transfusion alone that to in presence of severe anemia. Rituximab was not used for treatment as it can further impair the response of B cells against the SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【30】Table 3： Peripheral smear finding.\n\n| RBC Series  | RBC series show clumping with an anisocytosis， normocytic normochromic in nature with few macrocytes， ovalocytes， target cells， spherocytes， polychromatophilic cells and nucleated red blood cells.  |\n| --- | --- |\n| WBC Series  | WBC series are normal in total number and distribution.  |\n| Platelets  | The platelets are adequate in number with a normal morphology.  |\n| Parasites  | No parasite seen in the smear examined.  |\n| Impression：  | The peripheral blood smear， showing a normocytic normochromic blood picture with macrocytes， spherocytes， increase polychromasia and a few Howell jolly bodies.  |\n|  |  |\n\n【32】HbE variant is increasingly prevalent in South East Asia； a region endemic in malaria has been hypothesized to be providing survival advantage to the carriers of the trait with resistance to malaria， dengue virus， and very recent addition of COVID-19 infection by a study 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.

Since its first description in 1886， many clinical signs of appendicitis， with varying specificities and sensitivities， have been introduced. In recent years， ultrasound-and Computer Tomogram (CT) -scans have made confirmation of clinical suspicion more reliable.

Although a well-known and mostly straightforward clinical entity， some patients with acute appendicitis may pose a diagnostic challenge， especially in the emergency setting 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【17】The retro-coecal position of the appendix presumably precluded sonographic visualization. In such cases where clinical signs are non-specific and sonography is negative or yields confusing findings， CT-scan may prove diagnostic. We describe a young adult with an atypical and non-specific presentation of appendicitis， probably due the retro-coecal position of the appendix. To our knowledge， no case of pneumobilia associated with acute perforated appendicitis has so far been described.删除2换行with necrotizing appendicitis evolving to generalized enteritis/colitis， which resulted in portomesenteric air (but no pneumobilia) most probably as a result of extensive Pneumatosis intestinalis 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【18】The pathophysiologic mechanism in ourcaseremains obscure，but since both pneumobilia and hyperbilirubinemia promptly resolved after surgery， we postulate that the pneumobilia was associated with acute appendicitis.\n\n【19】Our first clinical hypothesis was that a fistula had formed between the perforated appendix， whose tip reached the epigastrium， and the left biliary tract. The connection would have allowed passage of intestinal air into the biliary tract， impairing biliary flow and causing indirect hyperbilirubinemia. However， this hypothesis could not be confirmed， neither by imaging nor during laparoscopic surgery.\n\n【20】A second hypothesis， most plausible in our case， is that increased pressure in the small intestine (resulting from paralytic ileus) caused passage of air through an intermittently insufficient papilla of Vater into the biliary tract. With restored intestinal motility after surgery， intestinal pressure dropped and Vater’s papilla regained its normal function， leading to disappearance of pneumobilia and hyperbilirubinemia. Descriptions of retrograde passage of air into morphologically normal biliary tracts have been reported in the literature通用删除6(英):<u> 9，10]</u>.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】Acute appendicitis in a youngadult is often a straightforward，easy to recognize and treat condition. Yet， at times， clinical presentation can be confusing， and ultrasound imaging unreliable. This may delay diagnosis with possible unfavorable consequences for the patient.\n\n【23】This case report is to our knowledge the first description of acute appendicitis correlated with pneumobilia and may suggest adding acute perforating appendicitis to the differential diagnosis of otherwise unexplained pneumobilia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Therefore， WGS has increased potential to identify some microorganisms within the clinical sample which might have clinical significance 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. However， the value of integrating pathogen analysis in clinical WGS in prenatal diagnosis remains poorly defined.\n\n【15】Case Presentation\n\n【16】The patient (a 30-year-old-woman) received voluntary TORCH screening 9 weeks before pregnancy and diagnosed as CMV IgG positive (17.74 U/mL) and IgM negative . The patient conceived naturally and was normal during routine pregnancy examination. At 21 weeks gestation， the patient developed cough and flu-like symptoms. Ultrasonographic examination was offered at 23 weeks ， FGR was determined with an Estimated Fetal Weight (EFW) equivalent to 0.2 percentile for gestational age according to the Hadlock formula 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Additionally， fetal tachycardia (183 bpm) and increased Middle Cerebral Arterial Peak Systolic Velocity (MCA-PSV) (>1.5 MoM) were determined. Fetal anemia was suspected. Four days later， the patient was transferred to Fetal Medicine Department of our hospital. Similar diagnoses were made， and the fetus was determined as severe FGR (EFW less than 3rd percentile for gestational age)， tachycardia (175 bpm)， and increased MCA-PSV (2.15-2.37 MoM). Due to fetal anemia， intrauterine blood transfusion was provided at 25 weeks gestation with an initial fetal hemoglobin of 4.8 g/dl， and hematocrit of 17.2%. The couples were not consanguineous marriage and denied any genetic disorder within three generations.\n\n【17】To investigate the genetic cause of fetal abnormalities， karyotype and CMA were offered and got no definitive findings. Trios WES and trios WGS were further offered. The sequencing depth of WGS was 59.66X and the ratio for targeted regions with ≥1X coverage was above 99% and that with ≥ 10X coverage was above 98% . After bioinformatic filtering， we identified a total of 421 variations， including 3 nonsense， 176 missense， 9 indels， and 233 other types of variations. However， no causal variants responsible for the clinical删除1换行presentations were identified. Interestingly， when interpreting the sequencing variants， we noticed some long insertions. We observed that reads were partially mapped to the reference human genome at the insertion sites. We speculated these reads were generated from other organisms， due to sequence similarity， these reads were interpreted as human reads and partially mapped to the human genome. Thus， the remaining unmapped fragments were classified as insertions by our bioinformatic pipeline. To test our assumption， we extracted these reads and blasted against nt/nr database and determined these reads showed 100% similarity to CMV reference genome . We then discarded all human reads and aligned the unmapped reads(32，978 reads in total) to CMV reference genome using BWA method. We determined the unmapped reads covered 96.29% of CMV genome with a 14X average coverage. The above results suggested the presence of CMV within the sample. We confirmed the presence of CMV using qPCRand determined the viral load was 5.73×10 copies/mL . We further provided TORCH screening to the patient and determined CMV IgG positive (500 U/mL) and IgM negative， which indicates nonprimary CMV infection. An additional sonographic examination was offered at 29 weeks.FGR continued in the fetus with EFW at 3.2 percentile for gestational age. Fetal heart rate was 155 bpm and MCA-PSV was normal. However， the fetus developed severe microcephaly with reduced biparietal diameter (BPD=67.2 mm)， occipitofrontal diameter (OFD=86.8 mm)， and head circumference(HC=241.9 mm). Given the severed fetal manifestations and poor estimated prognosis， the patient decided to terminate the pregnancy at 30 weeks.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\nWe report the identification of intrauterine CMV infection by WGS in a fetus with FGR at 23 weeks of gestation.

Due to the non-genetic nature of the pathogenesis， karyotype， CMA， and WES failed to yield a diagnosis. WGS， which detects nearly all forms of genetic variations， was provided. However，no chromosomal numerical disorders， pathological CNVs， SNVs， or InDels were determined. Interestingly， we accidentally detected the genetic materials of CMV. Furthermore， the possibility of intrauterine CMV infection was reconsidered and diagnostic tests were offered. Our experience shows WGS is an effective tool in diagnosing the etiologies of FGR. Ideally， when FGR was detected， the possibility of fetal CMV infection would be considered and diagnosed with viral nucleic acid tests. This could have been the most efficient and economical practice to achieve a diagnosis in the present case. In this case， the clinical management was complicated by the maternal prior immunity to CMV. By applying WGS， we determine the limited fetal growth potential was caused by CMV intrauterine infection. Given the time-sensitive nature of prenatal diagnosis， this case demonstrates the potential of WGS as a first-line comprehensive diagnostic tool in prenatal diagnosis. Our experience also indicates nonprimary CMV infection should be considered in a growth-restricted fetus even preconception maternal immunity was established.\n\nApart from CMV and other TORCH agents whose clinical manifestation1exhibitsi asimilartashion withSscreening measurements routinely provided， there are other pathogens challenging reproductive health. These pathogens include Human|删除段之间换行|Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)， influenza virus， vaccinia， Epstein-Barr virus， malaria， listeria， and Zika Virus (ZIKV). Generally， the clinical presentations of these pathogens are distinctive from TORCH and their diagnostic measurements are highly diversified. In perinatal settings， rather than inferring each agent individually， which is labor-intensive and time-consuming， there warrants a synergistic approach to simultaneously detect all candidate pathogens. Metagenomic Next Generation Sequencing (mNGS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify the potential cause of an ongoing infection in a comprehensive manner 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. However， the application of mNGS in prenatal samples is limited. In the present study， we identified intrauterine CMV DNA by WGS， in which the sampling processing， library preparation， and sequencing steps are similar to mNGS. Our experience demonstrates the incorporation of pathogen analyses in WGS data interpretation is of substantial clinical value. However， it should be noted that pathogens such as RNA viruses and fungi/bacteria with a thick cell wall are not detectable by the current analytic process in our study. In future studies， fine adjusting of the experimental protocols such as the nucleic acid extraction and RNA sequencing process may be required.\n\n【25】In conclusion， our experience suggested nonprimary CMV infection should be considered in FGR fetuses even prior immunity was established. By incorporation of pathogen analysis， WGS is promising to serve as a first-line diagnostic tool in the prenatalsetting.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We report a case of a CTD-ILD patient with DNAH5 mutation，wondering if DNAH5 mutation involves in CTD-ILD.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】In October 2019， a 66-year-old male with a smoking history of 360 pack-years was admitted for rapid progression of dyspnea and dry cough for last two months. He has been diagnosed to be a case of ILD on basis of HRCT with no obvious symptoms for five years. On physical examination， erythema keratodes were observed on his upper limbs and light Velcro rales atbilaterallowlobes. But no Clubbed- finger， no Raynaud， and no morning stiffness. Immunological and serological results showed anti-KU-antibody， anti-Signal Recognition Particle (anti-SRP) Antibody and Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) were positive. Laboratory investigations suggested serum Immunoglobulin G(IgG) was 17.3 g/L (normal level7 g/L to 16 g/L)， Immunoglobulin E (IgE) was 230 IU/mL (normal level 20-200 IU/mL)，relatively at high level. Thoracic HRCT showed distributions of the pulmonary fibrosis were diffuse bilaterally and symmetrical . Additionally， the level of Krebs von den Lungen (KL)-6 in his blood significantly increased 1180 U/mL， normal range 0 U/m L-500 U/m L). His SpO， maintained at 95% to 97% range either at the rest or at exertion. Pulmonary function test revealed dispersion function decreased slightly. The result of 6 Minutes Walking Test (6-MWT) was 661 m. The patient was diagnosed with CTD-ILD. Of note， a WES analysis followed by Sanger sequence identified a heterozygous missense mutation (c.2047C>T) of DNAH5. After a week oforal prednisone 20 mg/day and quetiapine 200 mg/day for treatment， he’d relieved from dyspnea and dry cough.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】ILD is a group ofheterogeneous diseases distinguished by fibrosis or inflammation of the pulmonary parenchyma 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Existing major categories ofILD include environmental exposures related ILD，CTD-ILD， sarcoidosis， and IPF 通用删除6(英):<u>[12-14]</u>.Meanwhile， CTD-ILD frequently occurs in identified CTD patients (SSc， RA， PM/DM，SLE and so on) or Interstitial Pneumonia with Autoimmune Features (IPAF) patients通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. According to Angelo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> there are different histological patterns in CTD-ILD， consisting ofNon-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP)， Organizing Pneumonia (OP)， usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP)， Lymphocytic Interstitial Pneumonia (LIP) and Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD). Furthermore， the prevalence， diagnostic criterion， clinical presentations and treatment of CTD-ILD are varied by CTD types. Since the heterogeneity of diseases， there is no specific management guideline of CTD-ILD until now. For some acute and subacute CTD-ILD patients， rapidly progressive ILD may be the first or only manifestation of an underlying CTD with poor prognosis， so treatment is always earlier than definite diagnose of CTD 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. All CTD patients are at risk of ILD， however， the necessity of targeting underlying ILD in CTD-ILD patients with immunosuppressive therapy lacks unified expert consensus 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Whether occult or probable forms of CTD-ILD are associated with a better outcome is uncertain. Therefore， prior ascertainment will help a lot. In daily clinical work， we are used to combining auto-antibodies， laboratory abnormalities， histopathology and HRCT image with symptoms or clinical features to diagnose CTD-ILD. But this method is short of specificity to guide treatment scheme， just like our above case. Collectively， find a stable biomarker， which suggests that common and rare genetic variants may play a significant role， may contribute to overcome the limitations 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\n\n【9】DNAH5， which encodes Outer Dynein Arm (ODA) components， has been proven clearly to be the PCD disease-causing gene and leads to a total deficiency of ODA and its function when it mutates通用删除6(英):<u>[9，19，20]</u>.ODA functions as a force-generating protein of respiratory cilia with ATPase activity 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In PCD patients， respiratory cilia do not move normally，which brings out that mucus and debris in airway can’t be incompletely cleaned， leading to repeated sinopulmonary infection and small airway obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>[21，22]</u>. Hence， DNAH5-mutation patients may suffer from manifestations of PCD， for instance， bronchiectasis， chronic sinusitis， chronic oto-sino-pulmonary diverse and even respiratory failure caused by irreversible lung damage 通用删除6(英):<u>[23，24]</u>.According to Lee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> DNAH5 variants may contribute to develop hyperinflation in patients with COPD， with Residual Volume(RV) and RV/Total Lung Capacity (TLC)ratio通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Besides， it was confirmed that TRA2B-DNAH5 fusion becomes删除1换行a novel oncogenic driver in human lung squamous cell carcinoma删除4-1:<u>25</u>.\n\n【10】These results suggest DNAH5 variants significantly influence the structure and function of pulmonary. Herein， although further investigation is warranted to confirm the connection of DNAH5 and CTD-ILD， our case provides a new vision and idea to predict the occurrence of ILD in CTD patients as to improve prognosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is only present in a small subset of patients with ectopic thyroid tissue. A patient with two different foci of ectopic thyroid tissue， one in the mediastinum and in the thymus， is an even rarer presentation. We discuss our clinical case as well as review theliterature and present a table with cases of double and triple ectopic thyroidtissue.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： In our case report， we present a patient with an ectopic thyroid tissue of the mediastinum and thymus. Our patient originally presented with a multinodular goiter. This was resected unremarkably. The patient presented later with symptoms of continued cough， which prompted a CT scan chest showing a thymic mass and retained thyroid tissue of the anterior neck. This was found to be a mediastinal mass upon surgical exploration. A joint cardiothoracic and general surgical approach was planned for resection of both masses. Pathology of the masses showed thyroid tissue in both the mediastinal and thymic resection sites. The masses were not connected in any way， having us believe that the patient had a multinodular goiter， ectopic thyroid tissue of the mediastinum and ectopic thyroid tissue of the thymus.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Generally speaking， surgical excision of a mediastinal mass is warranted. This proves beneficial in terms of diagnosis and potentially primary treatment. When considering a mediastinal mass， the diagnosis of ectopic thyroid tissue should be in the differential. Patients with thyroid disease are more likely to have ectopic thyroid tissue， and a presentation of two different types of ectopic thyroid tissue is very rare.\n\n【4】Keywords： Ectopic thyroid； Mediastinal thyroid； Thymic thyroid tissue； Mediastinal mass； Thyroid goiter； Multinodular goiter\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Ectopic thyroid is defined as thyroid tissue in any location other than its position in the anterior neck. The thyroid gland usually sits between the 2nd and 54 tracheal rings 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Ectopic thyroid tissue is the result of abnormal gland migration from the foramen caecum to its ectopic location 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Dual ectopic thyroid has been described 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. This is described as having a focus of ectopic thyroid tissue also with a thyroid gland in its normal function and anatomical location 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The most common ectopic thyroid location is the lingual region 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. There are very few cases of dual ectopic thyroid. There are even fewer cases of triple ectopic thyroid cases reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Embryologically the thyroid originates from the 1 and 2n pharyngeal pouches. The first case of ectopic thyroid tumor was reported in 1869 by Hickman. The prevalence in the general population is 1 per 100，000 to 300，000. Patients with thyroid disease have a much higher prevalence than the normal population at 1 per4，000 to 8，000.\n\n【7】Ectopic thyroid tissue is rare， and mediastinal ectopic thyroid tissue is a small subset of this population. In fact， ectopic intrathoracic thyroid tissue is 5.8% of all mediastinal masses 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> and only around 1% of ectopic thyroid tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. Several cases have been reported including intracardiac， intrapericardial，lateral chest wall，pulmonaryand the ascending aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，7-9]</u>. In our case， we present a patient with ectopic mediastinal thyroid tissue abutting the trachea. There was no connection to the cervical thyroid gland in our case.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\nA 30-year-old female with past medical history of fibromyalgia， chronic anxiety， bipolar depression， migraine， neuropathy， restless leg syndrome，and asthma presented with a multinodular nontoxic goiter. She had a known history of hypothyroidism and goiter for 5 years. She was referred|删除段之间换行|to our general surgery clinic by her endocrinologist when the patient was complaining of cough and obstructive symptoms. She presented in 2017 with an enlarging thyroid mass. She has no history of neck radiation. No family history of thyroid cancer.\n\n【10】On physical examination there was a palpable， enlarged thyroid with the left side being larger than the right. US guided biopsy was ordered and showed indeterminate architecture with more nodules noted on the left lobe than on the right. The patient was consented for surgery and a total thyroidectomy was performed. In surgery the left and right lobe were identified as well as the isthmus. The entire weight was 19 grams. Pathology report showed left lobe with multinodular goiter. The left lobe measured 6 cm x4.5 cm x2.4 cm. The right lobe showed multinodular hyperplasia and measured 4 cm x2.2cm×1.2\n\n【11】cm. The specimens were negative for any malignancy.\n\n【12】Patient performed well postoperatively and was discharged home. However， one month after her initial surgery she continued to have symptoms of neck tightness and non-productive cough. A CT chest was ordered to assess for any abnormalities. The CT chest without contrast showed a 3.5 cm mass of the left cervical trachea causing displacement of the trachea to the right. Also， of note on the CT chest was a thymic mass. It was decided to proceed to a CT guided biopsy of the thymic， as this was more easily accessible. CT guided biopsy of the thymic mass revealed residual benign thyroid parenchyma with Hurthle cell metaplasia， degenerative changes， and dystrophic calcifications. No frank papillary carcinoma was noted. The CT scan was read as residual thyroid tissue in the neck， but IR biopsy noted the mass to actually be behind the manubrium and删除表格换行entering the mediastinum. A bronchoscopy was completed， and there was no invasion into the trachea.\n\n【13】Table 2： Examples of Ectopic Thyroid Tissue Locations 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n| Year  | Author  | Country  | Title  |  | Diagnosis  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016  | Cao L， et al.  | China  | Clinical Characteristic and molecular pathology of skullectopic thyroid cancer  |  | Skull Ectopic Thyroid Cancer  |\n| 2013  | Ko HH， et al.  | Korea  | Ectopic intrapulmonary thyroid： a case report  |  | Intrapulmonary Ectopic Thyroid  |\n| 2013  | Wang SC， et al.  | Taiwan  | Ectopic Thyroid Tissue in the Adrenal Gland Mimicking aPheochromocytoma  |  | Adrenal Ectopic Thyroid  |\n| 2017  | Tamaki S， et al.  | Japan  | Laparoscopic resection of retroperitoneal ectopic thyroid tissue  |  | Retroperitoneal Ectopic Thyroid  |\n| 2003  | Gamblin TC， et al.  | USA  | Ectopic Thyroid  |  | Thoracic Ectopic Thyroid  |\n| 2004  | De Felice M， et al.  | Italy  | Thyroid development and its disorders： genetics and molecular mechanisms  |  | Sublingual Ectopic Thyroid  |\n| 2007  | Ozpolat B， et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>  | Turkey  | Ectopic thyroid gland on the ascending aorta with a partial pericardial defect： report of a case  |  | Ascending Aorta Multinodul arGoiter  |\n| Table 3： Triple Ectopic Thyroid.  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【15】Table 3： Triple Ectopic Thyroid.\n\n| Year  | Author  | Country  | Title  | Diagnosis  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2011  | Santosh， Konde， et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>  | India  | Triple Ectopic Thyroid  | Lingual (foramen cecum)， Sublingual， Infrahyoid  |  |\n| 2011  | Sjit Nilegaonkar， et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>  | India  | Triple eectopic thyroid： A rare entity  | Base of tongue， Hyoid， Suprahyoid  |  |\n| 2013  | Kuramoto R， et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>  | Japan  | Triple Ectopic Thyroid： A case report andreview of literature  | Three ectopic thyroid glands located near the hyoid bone withnormally positioned thyroid  |  |\n\n【17】It was decided that removal of the aforementioned masses was necessary in the treatment and diagnosis for this patient. These masses pose concern as they could have malignant potential or foci of malignancy not seen on biopsy. A combined general surgery and cardiothoracic surgery approach through a median sternotomy was decided upon. The left paratracheal mediastinal mass was removed by the general surgery team and the thymic mass was removed by cardiothoracic surgery team. Of note， these two masses did not communicate with each other. They were however removed in one en bloc segment connected by lymph tissue and fibrous tissue. The thymic mass was 9.2 cm x 5.0 cm ×2.2 cm. The histology showed benign thyroid tissue with nodular hyperplasia and benign thymic tissue. The paratracheal mass was 5.0 cmx3.0 cmx2.8 cm in size. The histology showed benign thyroid tissue with nodular hyperplasia and benign lymph nodes.\n\n【18】As was the case with the first operation， the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. The patient on follow up had well healing incisional sites and improved symptoms. The patient no longer had a cough or obstructive symptoms. The patient will continue postoperative follow up with her primary care physician for any recurring symptoms.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\nMediastinal ectopic thyroid is a rare entity and account for only|删除段之间换行|1% of mediastinal masses 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Very few cases are reported yearly. When there is no connection between the cervical thyroid， it is termed PMG or primary mediastinal goiter 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. The blood supply for primary mediastinal goiters are derived from intrathoracic vessels and not from cervical thyroid vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. A large percentage of PMGs originate in the anterior mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【21】Approximately 90% of all ectopic thyroid is found on the wall of thyroglossal duct cysts. This means that the majority of ectopic thyroid tissue will be located in the neck. Occasionally there will be ectopic thyroid tissue present in the mediastinum. The thyroid may or may not be in continuity with the original thyroid tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Often times they present alongside a normal sized thyroid in the neck 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Ectopic thyroid tissue has been described in the presence of benign删除1换行and malignant thyroid cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【22】In the absence of thyroid disease， a PMG is generally an incidental finding 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Today， many CT scans are ordered on a regular basis in the emergency room or other settings. The increased availability of high-resolution imaging is responsible for the increased incidence of incidental mediastinal masses found on imaging. If there is enlargement of the glandular tissue there could be a symptomatic presentation. If a PMG was to press against the trachea， like in our patient， the patient could present with symptoms such as cough， shortness of breath，dyspnea， stridor or others. In our case，the patient presented with a cough 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Patients could present with many other possible symptoms depending on the exact location and nearby anatomy.\n\n【23】A reasonable differential diagnosis for this condition would be lymphoma， lymphadenopathy， teratoma， thymoma， neurogenic tumors， primary esophageal tumors， primary trachealltumors， vascular malformation & aortic aneurysm dilatation 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. This is a short list of some common mediastinal mass diagnoses； however there are many other possible etiologies for a mediastinal mass.\n\n【24】In a primary mediastinal goiter， there is concern for potential canceridevelopmenitt.Theree are minimalguidelines for the management of PMG 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，14]</u>. If a mediastinal mass is encountered incidentally， a specific tissue diagnosis should be attained 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>. Depending on the location of the mass， a percutaneous tissue biopsy can be performed. This will give definitive histological diagnosis and help differentiate between the many possible causes. Management will depend on the final diagnosis， whether the lesion is benign or malignant， whether there is atypia， dysplasia or signs of a high-grade lesion. Ifabenign，low risklesion in an asymptomatic patient is found， there is an argument that could be made for regular imaging and watchful waiting. However， several authors who have treated patients with PMG state that surgical resection is the gold standard 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>. Most authors state that primary mediastinal goiter is an indication for surgical resection 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，6，10，14，15]</u>. Most surgical resection will be performed through either a sternotomy or thoracotomy depending on the location and other factors. Some authors have advocated for a cervico-mediastinal approach for successful removal of large thyroid masses extending from the cervical region to the mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In our case， the cervical thyroid tissue was removed initially， and then a secondary sternotomy was performed to remove the other two ectopic tissues. If three foci of ectopic thyroid were known initially， a cervico-mediastinal approach would have been an excellent option as it provides excellent visualization and ability to remove multiple foci 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【25】A literature review of PubMed for the last ten years revealed 7reported cases ofectopic thyroid tissue in the mediastinum. Although rare， the most common site outside of the neck for ectopic thyroid tissue is in the mediastinum. Typically， these are reported to be treated with resection due to the broad differential of cancers that can present as mediastinal masses 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. However， most of the reported cases of ectopic thyroid tissue in the mediastinum are benign without hyperplasia or concerning features. Thus， if a tissue diagnosis of thyroid tissue can be obtained prior to excision， serial monitoring by radiographic imaging may be appropriate in patients in whom thoracic surgery is a high risk .\n\n【26】Of interest， although ectopic thyroid of the mediastinum is rare， other cases have been presented this last century in even more rare删除1换行locations. Below is a table extracted from a literature review by Metere et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> discussing other ectopic thyroid locations both in and out of the mediastinum .\n\n【27】Dual ectopic thyroid gland presentation is rare. There are however several cases of triple ectopic thyroid tissue that have been presented.

We present a case of a 64- year-old female treated with radioiodine therapy for toxic adenoma and subclinical hyperthyroidism， whose antithyroid peroxidase and TSH-Receptor Antibodies (TRAbs) were negatives. She didn’t smoke. After therapy， the patient became hyperthyroid and presented ophthalmopathy with positive TRAb. She underwent to corticosteroid and anti-thyroid treatment. After eighteen months of treatment， she maintained asymptomatic and TRAb were negatives.

GD is an autoimmune disease due to elevation of TSH-receptor antibodies (TRAbs) and/or Antithyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb)， whereas TMNG and TA are caused by autonomous function of thyroid nodules that can be evidenced on scintigraphy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Actual guidelines suggest treating with Radioiodine Therapy (RAI) or surgery hyperthyroidism caused by Toxic Adenoma (TA). Overall， the success rate of RAI (definitive hypothyroidism or euthyroidism) is 93.7%. However， following RAI therapy there have been reports of new-onset GD (up to 4% prevalence) as well as concern for thyroid malignancy and a very minimal increase in late non-thyroid malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【5】Clinical Case删除1换行cited.\n\n【6】We presented a 64 year old woman with primary hyperthyroidism. She was referred by digestologist who treated her for cholelithiasis and positive Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA). She didn’t have symptoms of thyroid hyperfunction or local compression. TSH， Free T4， TRAbs and TPOAbs values are summarized on Table 1. Two solid hypoechoic nodules on right lobe of 14 mm x 12 mm x20 mm and 23 mmx 17 mm x 23mm， well-defined， with peripheral and intranodular vascularity were described on ultrasound. Therefore we performed a scintigraphy99mTc pertechnetate that showed focal enhancement on right lobe and suppression of extra nodular tissues. After discussion of treatment possibilities， the patient underwent to RAI therapy without immediately adverse effects. However， forty five days after RAI she complained about palpitations， insomnia， excessive tearing and ocular pain. On physical examination we found elevated cardiac rate， swelling of eyelids， redness of conjunctiva and chemosis. We assessed activity by the Clinical Activity Score (CAS) as 4/7. Exophthalmos plus thickening of both inferior rectus were described by orbital MRI . At that moment， she had clinical hyperthyroidism with positive-TRAbs on laboratory tests . We started tiamazol 2.5 mg per day， selenium supplementation and propanolol. After no-improvement， she needed i.v. methylprednisolone bolus (protocol 0.5 g i.v. methylprednisolone once weekly for 6 weeks， followed by 0.25 g once weekly for 6 weeks). However due to adverse effects she only received 2.5 g of methylprednisolone， with clinical complete ocular response (CAS 0).

New-onset GD following RAI therapy is infrequent (less than 4%) and its risks factors are the presence of TPOAbs (incidence up to 22%)通用删除6(英):<u>[1-10]</u>. The presence of circulating TRAbs in patients with TMNG or TA points to a diagnosis of Marine-Lenhart's syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> and it should be excluded before RAI therapy. Other rare causes of new-onset GD are percutaneous ethanol injection， parathyroidectomy or thyroid surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[11-13]</u>.

Furthermore radiation would deteriorate balance between T-helper and suppressor lymphocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Although the patient had negative TPOAbs or TRAbs prior to RAI therapy， she had autoimmune background as ANA were positive. New-onset GD was treated with anti-thyroid drugs along 18-months due to the presence of GO and patient'preferences. On the other hand， it is well- known that RAI-treated GD patients are at risk of progression or de novo development of GO. To date， risks factors are smoking， severe/unstable hyperthyroidism and high serum TRAbs 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，14，15]</u>. In these cases， guidelines recommended concomitant short-term course of oral prednisone in order to prevent RAI-associated 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.Nevertheless the patient described did not have any risk factors but she developed of moderate-to-severe GO after RAI therapy for non-GD disease.

However， that patient turned positive-TRAbs after first dose of I-131 and developed OG after second dose of I-131.\n\n【12】As conclusion， clinicians must be aware of risk of GD and GO development after RAI therapyofthyroid dysfunction even in subjects with negative TPOAbs and TRAbs.

We report the efficacy of endoscopic stenting for the anastomotic stricture of hepaticojejunostomy after PD in a child.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】An 8-year-old boy was in a traffic accident in his family car in which he sat in the passenger seat with his seat belt fastened. Atadmission， a contrast-enhanced CT revealed in jury ofthe pancreashead and transection of the pancreas body with peripancreatic fluid collection . Subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed pancreatic duct disruption not only at the pancreas head with fistula to intrapancreatic bile duct， but also at pancreas body . We diagnosed the patient with grade Vpancreatic trauma according to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma classification 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. We decided to perform a life-saving laparotomy， as endoscopic pancreatic stenting across the duct disruption failed. We performed subtotal stomach preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with modified Child's reconstruction.\n\n【10】The early postoperative course was uneventful. However， 8 months later， he was readmitted to our hospital with cholangitis demonstrated by his symptoms and laboratory data. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed intrahepatic bile duct dilation ， suspecting anastomotic stricture related to hepaticojejunostomy.\n\n【11】Double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) showed a stricture of the hepaticojejunostomy， followed by a cholangiography that showed filling defects in the distal biliary tree and dilation of the intrahepatic bile duct . The anastomotic stricture region was dilated using a balloon catheter and his postoperative course was uneventful. Nevertheless， he had repeated cholangitis due to recurrence\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Pancreatic injury itself is generally rare in children； moreover， it accounts forless than 10% ofblunt abdominal injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.Nonsurgical management is commonly selected for minor pancreatic injury. However， some authors have suggested that operative management reduces complications and reduces the length of hospital admission in cases where the main pancreatic duct has also been damaged 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，21</u>. Therefore， it is important to assess the status of the pancreatic duct in determining the management of pancreatic injuries. Moreover， complex pancreatic head injury sometimes requires PD 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【14】The complication rate of after PD in adult cases has been reported as 40% or more， while the incidence of postoperative biliary strictures after PD in adult cases is reported as 2.6%通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. However even in adult cases， surgical intervention for patients with bilio-enteric anastomotic strictures is difficult and it has a high morbidity rate of 25%， and a mortality rate of 2-13% 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>. On the other hand， balloon dilation and stent insertion for patients with bilio-enteric anastomotic strictures were considered effective and less invasive compared with surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【15】There are two access routes to anastomotic strictures： DBE and the percutaneous trans-hepatic approach. The success rates of percutaneous trans-hepatic biliary intervention (PTBl) are reported to be 52.3%-81%， with morbidity rates of 4%-38.1%， including conditions such as hemorrhage， cholangitis， and cholestasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[12-14]</u>. In contrast， the success rates of DBE are reported to be 80%-94%， with morbidity rates of 0%-0.7%， including conditions such as pancreatitis and periprocedural bacteremia 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，16]</u>. Consequently， DBE is preferred to PTBI because of its less invasive nature， better success rates， and reduced morbidity.\n\n【16】Recently， alongwith advances of endoscopic techniques， DBE has become possible to be performed safely， even for small children.

Mentioned criteria were met by 74-year-old man with a history of COVID-19 a few weeks earlier， previously not treated cardiologically， however admitted due to angina chest pain and increasing dyspnea on exertion with elevation of troponin level. The coronary angiography on the day of admission showed the occluded Right Coronary Artery (RCA) and the critically stenotic distal Left Main (LM)， Left Anterior Descending artery (LAD) and the significantly narrowed Circumflex Artery (CX) [Panel A]. An ineffective attempt was made to open the RCA， confirming the chronic nature of the occlusion. Echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (mainly in the area of LAD vascularity) with an LVEF of 15%. The patient was qualified for Heart Team consultation. In addition， due to the signs of bilateral pneumonia visible also on X-ray， and disseminated changes such as cobblestones and frosted glass found in chest CT，pharmacological treatment was initiated， resulting in partial stabilization of the clinical condition. Due to too high periprocedural risk， the patient was disqualified from coronary artery bypass grafting. In view of the above， with the protection of the Impella CP system [Panel B]， effective angioplasty of the LM and LAD was performed using rotational atherectomy under IVUS control with the implantation ofthree drug-eluting stents in district hospital in Sandomierz [Panel C， D]. The patient on the 25h day of hospitalization in good general condition was discharged from the department for further outpatient treatment.\n\n【10】删除3:<u>University of Rzeszow， Rzeszow， Specialist Hospital of the Holy Spirit， Sandomierz， Poland， Tel：+48602261717</u>\n\n【11】删除7:<u>Received Date： 04 Aug 2023Accepted Date：21 Aug 2023Published Date： 25 Aug 2023 Citation：Kos M， Wanczura P， Stecko W Wisniowski M.

A strategy implementing autologous Stromal Vascular Fraction(SVF) cells from adipose tissue represents a novel approach in this chronic and devastating disease. Here we present a case study of a 71 year old woman who underwent SVF cell therapy during one surgical procedure. Clinical status of the patient was closely monitored with regular spirometry before and up to 14 months after SVF cell therapy. Nine months after SVF therapy patient did not require anti-fibrotic drugs and spirometry showed improvements that continued further at14 months. SVF therapy is a rapid， safe， and cost-effective method which can be easily applied in patients with pulmonary fibrosis and other chronic lung diseases.\n\n【2】Keywords： Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis； Chronic lung disease； Chronic asthma； Stromal vascular fraction； Stem cells\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and disabling lung disease characterized by irreversible loss of lung function due to scarring of the lung tissue ultimately resulting in death通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The median of survival is 3-5 years after diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Typical pathological features of IPF are scarring and fibrosis of the interstitial lung tissue due to activation of fibroblasts and accumulation of myofibroblasts into the alveolar space， leading to dysfunction and failure of the lung. Clinical manifestations include respiratory deterioration， dyspnea on exertion and heart failure eventually leading to death. Aging， smoking， bacterial or viral infection， industrially processed food and air pollution are the most critical risk factors of IPF. Physical， environmental and genetic factors may also contribute to the pathogenesis and development of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Current conventional therapy relies mainly on the reduction of symptoms or slowing the progression of the disease， including corticosteroids and beta-mimetics， unfortunately is frequently associated with various side effects. Oxygen supplementation is needed for patients with advanced IPF. Typically， conventional medicine cannot cure IPF. A promising novel strategy implements regenerative medicine based on Mesenchymal Stem/stromal Cells (MSCs) which can be easily obtained from adipose tissue together with other regenerative cells as Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) cells. MSCs have strong homing effect to the sites of injury and ischemia， inhibit chronic inflammation， and contribute to tissue restoration 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> and so have potential to be used for the treatment of IPF. SVF cells can be readily isolated from adipose tissue obtained by a standard liposuction， and administered during one surgical procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Previously， we described that SVF cells containing MSCs have a great regenerative potential in a large cohort of 1128 patients with osteoarthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> including elderly 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Here we demonstrate how autologous SVF cell therapy can contribute to lung regeneration and cure of a patient with IPF without any serious side effects.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Seventy one years old female ex-smoker suffering from IPF for 2 years underwent autologous SVF cell therapy after signing the informed consent. Adipose tissue was obtained by tumescent liposuction under local anesthesia. SVF cells were isolated from adipose tissue and treated as previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. Briefly， 150 ml of adipose tissue was obtained， SVF cells isolated and resuspended in normal saline and administered intravenously during one surgical procedure. Clinical status of the patient was closely monitored during said procedure. For the long-term删除1换行follow-up， data including spirometry with objective measurements of the Functional Vital Capacity (FVC) of the lungs as well as Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) were monitored closely. These data were measured starting 2 months before through 14months after SVF cell therapy.\n\n【7】Results\n\n【8】Seventy one years old female， ex-smoker with IPF for 2 years preceded by 4 years of chronic asthma， had been suffering from a chronic dry and stifling cough， tiredness， shortness of breath and significant decrease in her quality of life. Her lung functions were also objectively monitored by spirometry on a regular basis. During last 2 years， she was on continuous oxygen therapy via nostrils， and underwent pulmonary rehabilitation. She received standard medications including inhaled corticosteroids and beta-mimetics， oral prednisolone 10 mg to 80 mg per day， and omeprazole 20 mg/day. She was also taking supplements with calcium 2 mg x 500 mg daily and Vitamin D3 800 IU daily. Her situation was complicated with pneumonia 5 months before SVF cell therapy. Pneumonia required hospitalization and intensified medical care including oxygen， antibiotic and other supportive therapy. After that acute pneumonia resolved， she remained quite weak， in a wheelchair and unable to walk more than about 10 meters due to severe dyspnea. She remained on her medications above and on continuous oxygen delivery at 6 1/min. via nostrils. Chest X-ray demonstrated progression of the lung fibrosis with diffuse alveolar changes. Due to constant deterioration of health， the patient decided to undergo autologous SVF cell therapy during one surgical procedure. She underwent autologous intravenous SVF cell therapy using 2.38×10/kg ofher body weight of nucleated SVF cells with viability 99% isolated from 150 ml of adipose tissue. No serious side effects were documented in association with the cell therapy procedure. Besides SVF cell therapy， she received recommendations to avoid calcium supplementation and initiate magnesium supplementation together with trace minerals containing zinc， selenium and manganese (Anti-Aging Minerals) and vitamin supplementation containing vitamins B1， B2， B3， B6， B12， folic acid， pantothenic acid， vitamin C， D3， and K2 (Anti-Aging Vitamins) for12 months. One month after the SVF therapy， she was able to reduce her standard prednisolone and beta-mimetic medication， and her spirometry showed mild improvement . She was constantly improving further. She was able to stop inhaled beta-mimetics and corticosteroids 5 months after SVF cell therapy， and was able to wean herselfoff oral prednisolone by 9 months after SVF cell therapy. Nasal oxygen was reduced to 3-4l/min. At 12 months after SVF celltherapy， she became independent of oxygen only when inside her house， may be psychologically dependent， as she tended to use it when walking outside the house. Spirometric examination 9 months after SVF cell therapy revealed dramatic improvements in lung functions (FVC104%， FEV1 92%) and similar and stable results were documented at14 months after SVF cell therapy (FVC 102%，FEV1 97%) . Clinically， the patient felt very good， was able to walk without oxygen， and without a need for anti-fibrotic or anti-asthmatic medications. Her quality of life had improved dramatically. No respiratory tract infection was documented during the 14 months period since SVF cell therapy.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\nBecause current conventional treatment of IPF is limited and ineffective， including serious side effects and the disease progressively|删除段之间换行|Stem cells have pleiotropic effects in the place of lung injury that include anti-inflammatory， immunomodulatory， anti-fibrotic and paracrine effects 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. They are able to differentiate into various local cell types， including cells in bronchioles， alveoli， and pulmonary vasculature and also contribute in activation of the resident stem cells. Typically， large amounts of SVF may be obtained from 200ml of adipose tissue (10° nucleated SVF cells per each ml of the adipose tissue) when CT-SVF-03 Kit is used 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u> leading to clinical application of more than 2×10/kg of body weight nucleated freshly isolated SVF cells. Based on our clinical experience， this amount leads to optimal clinical result， i.e. complete cure of chronic and debilitating disease such as IPF. These non-manipulated autologous SVF cells may be directly administered intravenously to the patient with no serious side effects. Another route， i.e. endotracheal application of SVF cells in IPF patients has also been described 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Here we were able to demonstrate that only one application of SVF cells is sufficient to initiate the immunomodulatory and regenerative processes in the lung. Obviously， other parameters may affect the clinical results of the cell therapy， including age， disease stage， extent of tissue damage， and删除1换行other diseases of the patient.\n\n【11】Here we document for the first time to our knowledge， the IPF cure using autologous SVF cells isolated and administered during one surgical procedure. This treatment is safe with no serious side effects. It may represent a promising new therapeutic approach for the treatment ofIPF. Definitely， this method is still at an experimental stage and large multicenter randomized trials should be performed to further evaluate the efficacy of SVF cells as a treatment for this devastating chronic lung disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

There is an increasing trend in the in incidence of IE caused by uncommon microorganisms with low pathogenicity. Weherein report a case of IE caused by Neisseria mucosa (N. mucosa) in a young boy with Chronic Rheumatic Heart Disease (CRHD) with previously damaged mitral and aortic valves. The IE was successfully treated with intravenous penicillin G and gentamicin. More cautious efforts to detect and identify this unusual opportunistic pathogen should be made. Despite its rarity， clinicians should consider IE due to N. mucosa as a severe infection， especially in young patients with underlying valvular disease and treat with appropriate and adequate antibiotic therapy.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】IE remains a serious disease that carries a considerable risk of morbidity and death. While Streptococci or Staphylococci species are the most common pathogens causing endocarditis， occasionally non-pathogens， such as Non-gonococcal non-meningococcal Neisseria species have also been reported and remain unrecognized as a cause of severe disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【4】Non-pathogenic Neisseria species comprise part of the commensal bacterial microbiota of the human and animal oropharynx. These commensal Neisseria spp. have generally been regarded as harmless organisms oflittle clinical importance 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-4]</u>. Majority of these organisms colonize mucosal surfaces， usually without causing overt pathology， and are therefore regarded as components of the host normal microbiota. Hence， their isolation is usually not considered relevant to a pathological process 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. However， several clinical reports have shown that they can occasionally disseminate from their commensal niche and occupy， survive and proliferate in other anatomical niches and cause serious infections in a wide variety of anatomical sites. Including the heart， nervous system(meningitis).Invasion of the bloodstream by Neisseria from the oropharynx may lead to en docarditis and meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【5】In the present case， IE due to N. mucosa was diagnosed in a young boy with CRHD and damaged mitral and aortic valves. N. mucosa was repeatedly isolated from the Blood cultures， indicating a significant bacteremia 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The clinical case fulfilled the Duke criteria for clinically definite endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. However， the primary source of these organisms could not be established in the patient. The IE was successfully treated with adequate antibiotic therapy. Theliterature was reviewed for similar reports of IE due to N. mucosa. O the best of our knowledge， the present case is probably the first report of IE due to N. mucosa from India.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 16-year-old male presented to the emergency department of Kamineni Hospitals， Hyderabad， Telangana， India， with a history of intermittent fever for the past 10 days， associated with cough with mucoid expectoration. There was no history of cold， burning micturition，chills， rigors， abdominal pain， and vomiting， loose motions. The patient did not give any history of drug abuse， smoking or alcoholism. He was not a known diabetic. At the age of 6 years， the patient was diagnosed to have mitral regurgitation with IE. However， no further case details could be obtained due to the unavailability of the treatment records. The patient also gave a history of jaundice， one month ago. On physical examination， the patient was found to be well built， conscious， and coherent. There was no fever， pallor， edema， clubbing. His temperature was 980F， pulse rate was 76/mt and regular with no missed beats， blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg， respiratory rate was 18/mt and regular.\n\n【8】On examination of the cardiovascular system， all peripheral signs of aortic regurgitation were present. S1， S2+， prominent carotid pulsations were present， pansystolic murmur grade 3/6 was present at apex radiating to the axilla and early diastolic murmur of moderate intensity at aortic area was present with a loud P2. There were neither skin lesions nor any nodules. The lungs were clear， abdomen was soft with no masses and central nervous system was normal. The patient had no other risk factors for endocarditis. All the joints were supple with no swellings or effusions. His oral hygiene was well preserved with no stomatitis， gingivitis nor cavities. With a provisional clinical diagnosis of Chronic Rheumatic Heart Disease (CRHD) with severe Aortic (AR) & Mitral Regurgitation (MR) and IE， the patient was transferred to the General Medicine Department， Kamineni General Hospital， for further workup and management. Laboratory investigations revealed hemoglobin of 10.6 gms %， total count 8670cells/cmm， ESR 30 mm for 1 h， Liver function tests and a complete urine examination were within normal limits. The Electrocardiogram(ECG) showed Left Ventricular Hyperplasia (LVH). A 2D ECHO was reported as CRHD with thickened aortic valve with severe AR， thickened Mitral valve with moderate eccentric MR， Left Ventricular(LV) and atrial dilatation with concentric LVH， Global Hypokinesia， mild LV dysfunction， mild Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR) with mild Pulmonary Artery Hypertension (PAH) and minimal pericardial effusion. There were no LV clots. Chest radiography showed dilatation of the main pulmonary artery and left atrial appendage. Dual valve replacement was advised after 10 days by the consultant cardiovascular surgeon. Three sets of blood culture (each set had BacT/Alert FA aerobic and FA anaerobic bottle) were collected over 24 h and incubated in the BacT/Alert 3D (bioMerieux， Marcy Etoile， France) system in Microbiology Department. The patient was empirically started on intravascular Cefoperazone-sulbactam 1.2mg thrice daily with other supportive care and management.\n\n【9】Blood cultures： All the three sets of blood culture bottles flagged positive within 24 h of incubation. A direct Grams stain from the broth showed thin short Gram-negative Diplococci. Subculture of the blood culture broth was done on 5% sheep blood agar plates(COS，bioMerieux， Marcy Etoile， France)， CromID agar plate (CPSE， bioMerieux) and MacConkey agar and incubated at 37C for 24 h. The following day， the blood agar plate showed pale， about 1 or 2mm in diameter， circular， convex with a flat border， smooth， moist， non-pigmented and non-hemolytic colonies. Minimum growth was obtained on CromID agar after 48 h of incubation， with similar colony morphology as described on blood agar. There was no growth on MacConkey agar. Grams stain of the colony from blood agar showed thin short Gram-negative Diplococci， similar to the direct examination from the blood culture broth. The isolate was non-motile and positive for Oxidase and Catalase enzymes. The culture was processed in the VITEK2 (bioMerieux， Marcy Etoile， France) using the IDGN. The VITEK2 gave a report as unidentified species. The antibiotic susceptibility was done by the disc diffusion method. The isolate was found to be susceptible to Ampicillin， Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid， gentamicin， amikacin， cefazolin， ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. For a definite identification， the isolate was processed on Vitek-MS (Mass spectrometry microbial identification system)(bioMerieux， Marcy Etoile， France) and was identified as N. mucosa.\n\n【10】A final diagnosis of IE due to N. mucosa was made. Based on the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolate， the patient was administered intravenous Co-Amoxiclav (Amoxicillin 1000 mg and Clavulanic acid 200 mg) 6 hourly. The patient's status rapidly improved and删除1换行after 10 days， the infection completely resolved with no residual vegetations. Repeat blood cultures 3 days before discharge were sterile. He was discharged with an advice to take oral therapy with capsule Augmentin 625 Duo (Amoxicillin 500 mg/clavulanate potassium 125 mg) twice daily for the next 10 days. At the follow-up review after 10 days， patient was free of the infection.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Despite advances in management， IE remains a serious disease that carries a considerable risk of morbidity and death 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. While Streptococci or Staphylococci species are the most common pathogens causing endocarditis， occasionally other organisms such as non-pathogenic Neisseria have also been reported and remain unrecognized as a cause of severe disease by the clinicians 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【13】Over the years， there have been occasional case reports of several commensal Neisseria， of the oropharynx with a high propensity to cause serious systemic infectious， such as meningitis， bacteremia， endocarditis， pericarditis， empyema lung， pneumonia，as opportunistic pathogens in immune suppressed patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[9-11]</u>.\n\n【14】The first recorded case of endocarditis caused by a presumably commensal Neisseria species was probably from Coulter in 1915通用删除6(英):<u>[6，12]</u>. Schultz described the first confirmed case of endocarditis as a consequence of infection with a commensal species of Neisseria in1918 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Species of non-pathogenic Neisseria that have been shown to be associated with IE include B. bacilliformis， N. elongata， N. mucosa， N. cinerea， N. sicca， N. flava， N. flavescens and N. subflava. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6，3]</u>. A case of Neisseria sp. group AK105 induced pacemaker endocarditis that resolved after a combination of antibiotic and surgical treatment was also reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. From an epidemiological perspective， infections with commensal Neisseria spp. occur as singular events rather than as outbreaks 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. There is minimal person-to-person transmission. Development of the disease may probably be due to endogenous spread of the organism from a primary infected site (oropharynx). The outcome of the disease is determined by the hosts'immunityand/or enhanced virulence of the particular infective strain 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Neisseria-induced endocarditis usually results in acute febrile endocarditis with large vegetations and a destructive process that often causes severe cardiac and systemic complications， as was seen in our patient. Surgical valve replacement is required in half of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Pilmis et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> reported a case of IE with secondary arthritis due to N. mucosa and reviewed similar case reports available on Pubmed. They found 20 published reports between January 1966and August 2013 in 17 articles from Europe， North America，Oceania， Asia and Latin America. There were no reported cases of IE due to N. mucosa from India. The present case is probably the first case of IE due to N. mucosa reported from India. With the present case， the total number of IE cases due to N. mucosa， reported between 1971 to 2020， would increase to 22.\n\n【15】N. mucosa (Diplococcus mucosus) was described in 1906 but was not recognized again until 1959， when Veronetal characterized five bacterial isolates from the pharynx or sputum of patients and named it N. mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. N. mucosa is an encapsulated Gram-negative Diplococcus， belonging to the family Neisseriaceae 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，12，13]</u>. Like the rest of the members of this family， N. mucosa also has a high affinity for mucosal membranes and is known to be a normal part of nasopharyngeal flora in human 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Recently it has been reported as a probable urinary pathogen 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. N. mucosa optimally grows under aerobic conditions (35°C to 37°C) as large， mucoid， non-pigmented adherent colonies. N. mucosa was established as an independent删除1换行species and differentiated from other Neisseria by the characteristics of encapsulation， mucus production and the very active reduction of nitrates with gas formation 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. It demonstrates pathogenicity to mice following intraperitoneal inoculation. This species appears capable of colonizing a broad range of hosts in addition to the environment. N. mucosa has been cultured or identified in dogs， cats， ducks， the woodlouse， water and sediment 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Thus， Animal isolates can rarely act as zoonotic pathogens and cause disease in humans 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【16】N. mucosa inducedIEhas distinctive identifiable clinical characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，15]</u>.Patients areyounger thanthosewith endocarditis due to other pathogens. Median age is 40 years and reaches 58 years. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. The symptoms manifested by an infected individual with N. mucosa include myalgia， fatigue， arthralgia and intermittent fever.\n\n【17】The incidence of IE by N. mucosa is 38% following a recent and or extensive dental manipulation or infection. This is higher than that for endocarditis caused by Viridans streptococci 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，16，17]</u>. The Neisseria probably enter the blood stream following a minor trauma in the oropharynx. A case of a patient developing bacteremia after undergoing a flexible bronchoscopy procedure， which in turn led to endocarditis， was reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. A case of N. mucosa IE following tongue piercing was reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. The patient had no other risk factors for IE. He had a healthy oropharynx， gums and teeth and no manipulations were done in the oral cavity prior to the episode of IE.\n\n【18】N. mucosa survives in the blood and escapes killing as they may resist the bactericidal action of the blood or the patient's blood is defective in killing the organisms 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. After an initial adhesive interaction between the bacterium and the mucosal epithelial cell，the bacteria aggregate and form microcolonies and a biofilm resulting in a heavy colonization of the endothelial surfaces of the valve leaflets通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The adhesion of Neisseria to the exposed epithelia depends on an abundant repertoire of diverse adhesion/invasion molecules(Opacity-associated (Opa) embedded within the bacterial Outer Membrane (OM) and their interplay with specific host cell receptors. Opa protein is abundantly expressed and regulated in N. mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【19】Though a few cases of N. mucosa IE involving normal valves were reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，17，20]</u>， N. mucosa predominantly causes IE in patients with previously abnormal cardiac valves due to its low pathogenicity通用删除6(英):<u>[2，15]</u>. Majority of the patients report underlying cardiopathies， especially rheumatic heart disease (as in the present case)， unlike in IE due to other pathogens 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. The incidence of underlying heart disease is 77%， which is at the high end of the range of 60% to 80%通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. N. mucosa generally involves abnormal mitral or prosthetic valves. The aortic valve was reported to be involved in only 8% of patients with N. mucosa endocarditis compared with 38% of those with endocarditis in general 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In one case a previously damaged tricuspid valve was involved 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Both the mitral and aortic valves were involved in the present case.\n\n【20】Systemic antibiotic regimen and duration for N. mucosa endocarditis are not defined 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. There is no available Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST) interpretative criteria for N. mucosa. It has an intermediate susceptibility to penicillin， amoxicillin， cefotaxime， ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. Due to its variable susceptibility profile， the choice of antibiotic therapy should be supported by an in vitro AST 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，17]</u>. The most commonly used treatment in N. mucosa related endocarditis is a combination of a beta-lactam and an aminoglycoside， which is recommended in this删除1换行setting， given its efficacy in endocarditis.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】A prompt recognition of IE due to N. mucosa， an uncommon pathogen， in a young patient with underlying CRHD and valvular disease was possible with meticulous microbiological processing， including multiple sets of blood cultures and advanced identification systems for bacteria， have contributed to the successful diagnosis and outcome. The infection successfully resolved with prompt and appropriate antibiotic therapy. Despite its rarity， clinicians should consider IE due to N. mucosa as a severe infection， especially in young patients with underlying valvular disease and treat with appropriate antibiotic therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

An alternative treatment is repeated re-resection.\n\n【5】Keywords：Hamartoma； Leiomyoma； Metastasis\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Multiple Pulmonary Fibroleimyomatous Hamartoma (MPFH) is a diagnosis first described in literature by Logan 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. They are slow growing spherical lesions based on a few available case reports of long-term monitored patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. From the histological point they are a mixture of smooth muscle tissue and glandular elements which are sharply bordered and they do not have connection either with the bronchial tree or vascular structures of the lung. MPFH diagnosis is typical for women of middle age. Due to their indolent nature they are always in practice a coincidental finding. Tumors occur without lung lobe predominance. Their size ranges from small up to several centimeter tumors and they are in the amount of from several to hundreds of nodules in one patient 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-6]</u>. For a long time， a controversial theory was valid that two clinical-pathological units， Benign Metastasizing Leiomyoma (BML) and Multiple Pulmonary Fibroleimyomatous Hamartoma(MPFH) were identical 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-10]</u>. A number of facts give evidence against this theory. Quite a few case reports in women patients were described where they had not undergone hysterectomy and ovarian leiomyoma had not been diagnosed during long-term monitoring 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Furthermore， MPFH case reports in men and also in children were described 通用删除6(英):<u>[11-13]</u>. The potential occurrence of leiomyoma in any unexamined organs (for example a digestive tract) is a question.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 72-year-old patient underwent chest X-ray during preoperative examination before arthroscopy. A few spherical shadows (coin lesions) of a metastatic nature and hiatal hernia were observed in the clinical image . The patient did not have any troubles， was without dyspnoea， pains， weight loss， temperature or cough.\n\n【10】The patient was also a non-smoker\n\n【11】Family History： Father HCC of liver\n\n【12】Work History： Weaver\n\n【13】Patients History： Gonarthrosis， Hypertension， Repeated Pancreatitis， Statusafter GallbladdeerrRemoval， Statusafter Hysterectomyand Unilateral Ovarectomy， Status after Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for nephrolitiasis.删除2换行anthracosis and skeletal muscle tissue .\n\n【14】Spirometry： Normal Finding\n\n【15】Based on this history， a colonoscopy was performed without greater pathology as early as about 2 years ago during screening.\n\n【16】Bronchoscopy： Normal Finding\n\n【17】CT examination was performed with the finding ofeight spherical tumors in the lungs of a metastasizing nature affecting all lung lobes. The patient consulted a pneumologist indicating transparietal biopsy of one of the tumors .\n\nA CT guided needle biopsy of the tumor was performed without an unambiguously evaluated finding： pulmonary parenchyma with|删除段之间换行|CEA， CA 15-3 and CA 125 tumor markers were not positive. Thoracoscopic resection of one of the tumors was indicated and plannedat an interdisciplinary tumorboard(pneumologist， oncologist， surgeon， radiologist and anesthetist). A macroscopically tiny whitish elastictumor freely releasable from pulmonary parenchyma of the upper lobe of the left lung with cystic component of clear contents was removed surgically\n\n【19】Histology\n\n【20】Collapsed lung tissue with ligamental pleural thickening and a tiny tumor 8 mmx7mmx5 mm. Microscopic spindle cell tumor with small tubules and cysts are filled by cuboidal epithelium. Neither cartilageous， myxomatous nor fat tissue is present.

CK，EMA，TTF-1 positive in epithelial part and CD34 negative， the finding evaluated as fibrolipomatous hamartoma .\n\n【21】Examination of the tissue for estrogen and progesterone receptor positivity with a significantly positive result was done after targeted inquiry .\n\nAs the patient was without troubles， had also undergone a hysterectomy in the past with one of the ovaries being removed and there was no current pathology found during the gynecological examination， a conservative approach and dispensary care was recommended.After eight months aspiral CT examination|删除段之间换行|operation was the same.\n\n【23】(\"watchful waiting) was performed which showed the stability of most of the tumors and surprisingly also a regression of the size of one of the bigger tumors of the right side-apical paramediastinally (27mm × 14 mm) . After five years a spiral CT examination was performed again which showed multiple lesions in both lung wings， number of stationary， variable in size， some with regressive size and some with progression， all still with size of moderate degree.\n\n【24】The patient was again handed over to the pneumologist for long term dispensary care without any subjective difficulties. Gastroscopic examination with endoscopic ultrasound was recommended as suitable (to exclude unlikely upper gut leiomyoma) but the patient rejected this.\n\n【25】Clonality analysis\n\n【26】For clonality analysis of tumour we used HUMARA clonality assay based on PCR method. Each female somatic cell contains two X-chromosomes. This lethal constitution of double dose of genes on X-chromosome is prevented by inactivation of one of them. Inactivation proceeds in early stage of fatal development. Chemical modification of DNA-methylation-involve many genes on X-chromosome. Gene for human androgen receptor is also regulated bythis mechanism. In addition， this geneincludes highlypolymorphic repetitive sequence， such there is high probability for heterozygous constitution in assessed material. Methylation site is located near this repetitive sequence. One can detect methylation using suitable restriction enzyme which is methylation sensitive. In this case for example HpaII. In the presence of methyl group enzyme cannot cleave DNA. Clonality can be assessed performing PCR of sample digested by restriction enzyme and without. Random inactivation of X-chromosome (polyclonal origin of sample) results in two amplicons of different length (in case of heterozygous constitution of woman cells). On the other hand， inactivation of identical X-chromosome in nearly all cells in sample (monoclonal origin) results in just one amplicon .\n\n【27】Materials and Methods\n\n【28】DNA isolation\n\n【29】We used FFPE 5 um thick section of tumor and another 5 um thick section of surrounding healthy tissue. Isolation was done using BiOstic FFPE Tissue DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories).\n\n【30】Hpall digestion\n\n【31】Digestion of DNA was done using enzyme HpaII (New England Biolabs) in Buffer CutSmart. A reaction condition was as follows： 1 pl HpaII (10U)， 20 pl DNA， 5 pl Smart Cut Buffer， 24 pl water for PCR.

It represents heterozygous constitution usable for clonality analysis. There was no difference between digested and undigested samples， so we supposed that origin of tumour is polyclonal.\n\n【39】Discussion\n\n【40】Pulmonary hamartoma can be manifested as a solitary pulmonary nodule， so called“coinlesion， and also as multiple tumors on a usual chest X-ray image. Coincidental finding is normally indicated for CT examination. Age-old benign hamartoma is often with ossifications and its benign character is usually vivid. Its size does not progress over time and if a patient does not ask or it is not abnormally large， operations are not usually performed. A mini invasive thoracoscopic wedge pulmonal resection should be preferred if there is a solitary tumor and multiple affliction as well. Histologic finding of fibroleimyomatous hamartoma is a great surprise especially in multiple afflictions. Multiple Pulmonary Fibroleimyomatous Hamartoma (MFHP) is a very rare disease and it is not possible to be clinically distinguished from Benign Metastasizing Leiomyoma(BML) and low-grade leiomyosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>. If some of the examinations (abdominal CT， gastroscopy， colonoscopy， gynecological examination) were not performed before the operation， it is recommended to do so.

Leiomyomatosis in women occurs in women of reproductive age and has no connection with uterine leiomyoma and is always hormonally sensitive. Lung tumors appear even several years after a hysterectomy for leiomyoma. Some authors consider those extremely well differentiated low-grade leiomyosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[21，22]</u>.\n\n【43】MFHP is a very rare disease. As it occurs also in men and children， thus not all cases can be explained by metastasizing uterine leiomyoma. Furthermore， clonal analysis showeddnodules are polyclonal in some cases. Metastasizing affection is supposed to be monoclonal 通用删除6(英):<u>[23，24]</u>. If a tumor of the smooth muscle of the uterus is not proved， this tumor should be excluded after targeted inquiry(endoscopy， endosonography) in another location as well， especially in the gastro-intestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，23]</u>.\n\n【44】Lung lymphangioleiomyomatosiscomparedtO MFPH is a completely different disease during which there is a diffusive proliferation of smooth muscle tissue in lungs especially in women of reproductive age and where tumorous formations are not created.

A thorough clinical， radiological， and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of oral verrucous carcinoma.\n\n【2】Keywords： Oral； Hard palate； Verrucous； Carcinoma； Histological examination\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Verrucous Carcinoma (VC) is an uncommon subtype of low-grade， well-differentiated Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) that develops mostly in the skin， genitalia， esophagus， and oral cavity. Oral Verrucous Carcinoma (OVC) accounts for 2% to 12% of all oral cavity carcinomas and mostly affects the buccal mucosa， followed by the hard palate， the floor of the mouth， and the gingiva 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-4]</u>.\n\n【5】Clinically， OVC appears as a painless， white-grey， warty， exophytic mass that resembles cauliflower 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. It presents a strong predisposition for local invasion and a low predisposition for diffusion in neighboring structures， which varies depending on the lesion size and the evolution period. Metastasis from OVC is uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，6，7]</u>.\n\n【6】Histologically， OVC exhibits a well-differentiated squamous proliferation with a papillary or verrucous epithelial surface and clear hyperkeratosis， invading the subjacent stroma with well-defined， pushing margins. Minor cellular atypical is usually seen 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【7】This report describes a case of VC of the hard palate in a 75-year-old female patient.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 75-year-old female was referred to our Department of Oral Medicine and Maxillofacial Radiology for evaluation of a lesion on the left side of the palate dating back more than a year. Her medical record revealed controlled diabetes with no other specific health conditions； she didn’t report taking any systemic medications.She has had ahistory ofsmoking a minimum of 10 cigarettes per day for at least 40 years. Her physical examination disclosed no extra-oral abnormalities.\n\n【10】Intraorally， the patient presented a painless verrucous exophytic white lesion that covered the whole left maxillary alveolar ridge and reached the palate beyond the midline .\n\n【11】The Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the facial bones， with a focus on the hard palate， showed an increase in the left palatal mucosa thickness， cortical irregularity， and osteolysis of the inferior border of the maxillary sinus .\n\n【12】An incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia and sent for histological assessment.\n\n【13】The anatomopathological examination showed papillary tumor proliferation covered by an acanthotic and keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. The interpapillary buds are enlarged and grow in depth. Minimal cellular atypia and lymphocyte infiltration were noted .\n\n【14】These findings support the diagnosis of an OVC.\n\n【15】The patient was referred to an oncologist， and a whole-body evaluation was performed using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans after intravenous injection of 6.8 mCi of lF-FDG and a high-resolution CT scan with an appropriate PET scanner. Diffuse hypermetabolic thickening at the left maxillary aspect with no evidence of active distant metastasis was detected.\n\n【16】An MRI-1.5T examination showed an expansile lesion of the ill ex hard palate on the left side measuring 3.7 cm x3.6 cm ×1 cm and extending to the bony floor of the left maxillary sinus. The lesion had intermediate signal intensity and showed enhancement after intravenous gadolinium administration. No neck lymphadenopathy or evidence of extension into the sinus or the nasal cavity was noticed.\n\n【17】These investigations confirmed the VC of the hard palate.\n\n【18】Considering the patient’s age and the lesion’s size， treatment by radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be adopted rather a surgical one.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】OVC is a rare tumor affecting the oral cavity； it is more frequent in patients between 40 and 60 years old with a male preponderance通用删除6(英):<u>[2，9，10]</u>. The etiology of OVC is unknown； however， tobacco smoking， alcohol drinking， and chewing betel nuts are established major risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>. Additionally， other conditions， including chronic inflammation， ulcers， poorly fitting removable dentures， poor oral hygiene， and immunosuppression， have been reported as causal factors in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In comparison to SCC oncogenesis， the human papillomavirus has a much smaller impact on OVC oncogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，11]</u>. Moreover， it is suggested that OVC may arise in potentially malignant lesions， dysplasia， and carcinoma in situ 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【21】While OVC is not generally considered to have a racial predilection， many studies conducted on Asian patients reported a higher occurrence in men， with incidences as high as 77.4% 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>and94.9% 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>； this seems to be related to the consumption culture of betel nut and tobacco chewing 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【22】The diagnosis of OVC is challenging. In fact， it is very difficult to distinguish OVC from other lesions， such as OSCC，Oral Verrucous Keratosis (OVK)，and Oral Verrucous Hyperplasia (OVH) 通用删除6(英):<u>[13-15]</u>.\n\n【23】OVH has been referred to as an early stage or precursor to OVC andis believed to have similar biological potential 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Additionally， many authors raise the problem of the differentiation between “pure”OVC and“hybrid”OVC which has foci of SCC 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Therefore， it is essential to differentiate OVC from all these lesions through meticulous histopathological assessment. Recent researches have recommended using biomarkers to identify OVC. Since it might be difficult to distinguish OVC from other lesions such as OSCC and OVH based on the histopathological findings， Hosseinpour et al. highlighted via a comprehensive review the value of using biomarkers like Ki67 and P53 to help with the final OVC diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【24】OVC has a better prognosis than other types of cancerous tumors that might be fatal 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.

Diagnostic workup resulted in Computed Tomography (CT) scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed PVT extends to the superior mesenteric vein. A diagnosis of PVT was made，and antibiotic as well as anticoagulant were administrated. However， obesity retard the recovery in this patient compare to general patients with normal weight. In addition to presenting risk factors of obesity in PVT， we offer a review of literature and draw important precise mechanisms to assist in the diagnostic workup and treatment of PVT in obesity.\n\n【2】Keywords： Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT)；Obesity； Abdominal infection\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT) refers to the development of thrombus within the portal vein and can extend to splenic and the superior mesenteric veins. PVT， a well-known complication of cirrhosis， mainly due to rebalance of coagulation-anti-coagulation system and reduction of portal venues velocity (<15 cm/s). Acute PVT in non-cirrhosis patients is of low incidence while with a high mortality. Risk of non-cirrhosis related PVT including inherited gene mutation， like Factor V Leiden or Prothrombin G20210A mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Moreover， other causes of intraabdominal inflammation (colitis， pancreatitis， cholecystitis， appendicitis) and myeloproliferative disorders(thrombocythemia， polycythemia Vera， myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia) may as risk factors for PVT development. Obesity， which will cause cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases via induction of atherosclerosis， now has been a public health challenge worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Several studies have observed obesity as a risk factor for venous thromboembolism， abdominal obesity in particular， due to visceral fat accumulation， appears to be a major risk factor for VTE 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. However， risk of obesity on PVT is still controversial. Here we present a case of portal vein thrombosis in obesity，and review the available mechanisms of obesity involved in PVT.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 66-year-old female presented with persistent mild abdominal pain for 4 days. Four days before her admission， she had mild pain in the right upper abdomen without any obvious cause， accompanied by diarrhea， and passed yellow loose stools twice， accompanied by nausea and vomiting. She took berberine and Montmorillonite powder as symptomatic treatment， but without success. The patient reported aggravated abdominal pain and persistent fever up to 39.3℃ with chills and rigor. For this reason， she was admitted to our hospital.\n\n【7】Her past medical history was one of asthma and hypertension， but her blood pressure was well controlled. On physical examination， the patient is obese with a weight of 78 kg， a height of 158cm， and a BMI of 31.24 kg/m . Abdominal palpation suggests right upper abdominal pain. No enlargement of the liver or spleen was found during inspiration.\n\n【8】Laboratory tests showed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC： 13.75×10/L)，predominantly neutrophils (94.1%)， a marked increase in c-reactive protein (CRP： 286.22 mg/L)， and a marked increase in D-dimer concentration (D-D， 18.64 ug/ml).

After 4 days of the above treatment， the patient still had mild abdominal pain， loss of appetite， and nausea， and the infection was considered not significantly controlled， so intravenous vancomycin1 g q12h was added as a combination anti-infection. After a week of continued treatment， her clinical symptoms of diarrhea disappeared， but her temperature was between 37.5℃ to 38.0°℃. Color Doppler ultrasound showed echogenic， organized thrombotic material in the lumen of the portal vein and superior mesenteric vein. She was continued treated with intravenous imipenem and Cilastatin sodium1 g q8h and vancomycin 1 g q12h and oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban at 20 mg/d. On day 14 of treatment， the patient was downgraded from imipenem and cilastatin to moxifloxacin 0.4 g QD and metronidazole0.5 g q12h. After 18 days oftreatment in the hospital，her temperature删除1换行got too normal， and relief of clinical symptoms such as abdominal pain， poor appetite， and nausea. After that， she was treated with rivaroxaban at 20 mg/d for six months. At the 9-month follow-up，the patient's repeat Doppler ultrasound showed that the main trunk and the left and right branches of the portal vein were thin， but the blood flow was smooth and there was no thrombosis， while the splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein were suspected of thrombosis and there is portal vein spongiosis . At the 4-year follow-up， the patient has no symptoms， but Doppler ultrasound showed patent portal venous flow and spongy portal veins.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Acute Portal Vein Thrombosis (APVT) is defined as thrombosis of the main portal vein and/or the left and right branches of the portal vein， with or without mesenteric and splenic vein thrombosis. Acute portal vein thrombosis can lead to serious adverse outcomes such as删除1换行mesenteric ischemia and even intestinal necrosis， with a mortality rate of up to 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. A large study found a 1%population prevalence of PVT， with most cases associated with cirrhosis and hepatobiliary malignancy， and a low incidence of portal vein thrombosis in non-cirrhotic livers 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Another Japanese study showed that the incidence of PVT was 0.05% in patients without cirrhosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. We report a case of a 66-year-old obese female patient with abdominal pain and fever as the main symptoms and review the available literature. The clinical characteristics of these 10 PVT cases are summarized in Table 1. Bv reviewing the literature， we found that these 10 patients were aged 22to 66 years， with a 7：3 male-to-female ratio， and 2 of them presented with intestinal infarction and underwent emergency surgery. However， one of these patients developed short bowel syndrome after surgery because of the extent of the intestinal infarction.\n\n【13】There are three elements to portal vein thrombosis， including a hypercoagulable state， endothelial injury， and stasis of blood flow， known as Virchow s triad. Any one of these elements may be affected to promote portal vein thrombosis. In our case， the main risk factors considered for portal vein thrombosis were obesity and abdominal infection. Obesity is a worldwide health problem that induces cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases， such as coronary syndrome， cerebral embolism， and encephalorrhagia. The contribution of obesity to vein thrombosis is large evaluated删除1换行and obesity is a known risk factor in venous thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Obese individuals have nearly doubled the risk of both pulmonary embolism and Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and obese patients less than 40years of age have nearly a five-fold risk than those with normal weight.\n\n【14】However， there is limited knowledge about the risk of PVT in obese patients. Previous studies mainly focus on risk factors for PVT development in liver disease patients with obesity. A cohort study in a single center indicated that obesity was an independent risk factor for pre-transplant portal vein thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【15】Mechanisticaly， severall pathways could underlie a causal relationship between obesity and increased risk of DVT. Studies showed upregulation of inflammation factors， such as IL-6，TNF-a， and IL-1B were observed in obese individuals. These inflammation factors， which trigger the upregulation of procoagulant activity by promoting the synthesis of tissue factors， and suppressing fibrinolytic function via increased PAI-1 expression， facilitate the formation of DVT通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【16】Furthermore， adipose tissue is not only a storage site for excess energy but also a multifunctional organ that secretes numerous hormones and cytokines， thus influencing cell functions and gene expression. As a consequence of overnutrition， adipose tissue undergoes remodeling： Adipocytes grow in size and number，删除1换行accompanied by altered secretion， angiogenesis， and inflammation. Adipocytes are stimulated to secrete tissue factor (the trigger for blood coagulation)， plasminogen activator inhibitor (which impairs fibrinolytic function)， and substances responsible for local vessel degradation， all of which may promote clot initiation and formation and increase the risk of developing DVT. It has been found that leptin receptors are expressed on platelets and endothelial cells and can accelerate thrombosis by inducing platelet activation， inhibiting vasodilation， and increasing oxidative stress 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. From previous studies， it appears that obesity is a prothrombotic factor， favoring chronic inflammation， impairing coagulation and fibrinolysis， increasing hypercoagulability， and thus promoting the formation of venous thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[11-13]</u>.\n\n【17】Infections may induce three factors of the Virchow's triad. Pathogenic microorganisms or their endotoxins can activate monocytes， vascular endothelial cells， etc.， causing them to release a variety of inflammatory factors， and the local inflammatory response can form portal phlebitis， which promotes endotoxin entry into the blood and damage vascular endothelial cells， thus promoting thrombosis.\n\n【18】According to a review of the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， acute portal vein thrombosis can be symptomatic or asymptomatic， with the most common clinical presentation being mild to severe abdominal pain and fever， but also bloating， diarrhea， nausea， vomiting， anorexia， and ascites， with the severity of symptoms depending on the extent of the thrombus. Acute extension of the thrombus into the superior mesenteric vein is more likely to produce intestinal ischemia and infarction， and the development of intestinal infarction is associated with high morbidity and mortality if there is persistent severe abdominalpain， organ failure (shock， renal failure， metabolic acidosis， and elevated arterial lactate)， massive ascites and rectal bleeding all suggest infarction. The diagnosis of APVT is made clinically primarily based on clinical presentation and imaging examinations. A severely obese patient with no specific history who suddenly presents with mild to severe abdominal pain with fever should not be missed as a suspicion for APVT.\n\n【19】Its diagnosis is often delayed due to non-specific abdominal symptoms， low incidence， and low awareness among clinicians. However， portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis are being increasingly diagnosed due to the improvement and widespread use of the Computed Tomography (CT) scan technique. The typical abdominal ultrasound presentation of acute portal vein thrombosis is hypoechoic or isoechoic material occupying the lumen of a mildly dilated vein. Enhanced CT or MRI of the abdomen shows an unenhanced filling defect in the lumen of the vein. The presence of features associated with cavernous hemangiomas， venous collateral circulation， or portal hypertension suggests a prolonged period of vessel formation.\n\n【20】The differential diagnosis of acute portal vein thrombosis focuses on differentiating benign from malignant PVT. The first thing to consider is portal vein thrombosis due to malignant tumors in the abdomen (most commonly such as hepatocellular carcinoma)， and secondly， tumor encapsulation or compression of the portal vein (such as pancreatic or bile duct cancer)， both of which can be secondary to malignant intraportal thrombosis. Imaging can help to differentiate between benign and malignant PVT.\n\n【21】Treatment includes subcutaneous anticoagulant injections or删除1换行direct oral anticoagulant therapy and intravascular thrombolysis or surgical intervention. EASL recommends anticoagulation as the first-line treatment for acute non-cirrhotic non-malignant PVT 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. The AASLD guidelines also recommend that all patients with acute PVT， whether symptomatic or not， should be given conventional anticoagulants. Anticoagulation is usually availabllee with low molecular heparin， vitamin K antagonists， and new Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs). Recent data 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，15，16]</u> suggest that the oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban is a reliable and safe treatment for abdominal vascular thrombosis and is increasingly used in patients with abdominal vascular thrombosis. Early anticoagulation is used on the one hand to prevent the thrombus from extending into the mesenteric vein and thus leading to mesenteric vein infarction； on the other hand， to achieve portal vein recanalization，but if intestinal ischemia and intestinal infarction develop， surgical intervention is required.\n\n【22】In Figure 4， we summarize our diagnosis and treatment process based on available guidelines and literature. In our case， the patient was an older obese woman for whom obesity and abdominal infection may have been risking factors for her morbidity， with significant abdominal symptoms and systemic inflammatory manifestations， supported by imaging findings， we diagnosed APVT. She opted for conservative treatment and the patient was discharged after 18 days of combined anti-infective and rivaroxaban anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】Portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis is a serious but relatively less common complication associated with intraabdominal infection in non-cirrhosis patients. CT scan is an accurate method with excellent sensitivity for the diagnosis of abdominal vein thrombosis， especially as clinical presentation is emergency but vague.Oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban is a reliable and safe treatment for abdominal vessel thrombosis. What is more， endovascular thrombolysis is also a viable option and emergency surgery is required in case of patients with intestinal infarction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is a difficult crime to investigate as well as to prove it， mainly when its victims are children and adolescents. Most of the time， the victims feel ashamed and embarrassed of denouncing this kind of tragedy. This creates an unfavorable scenario and increases the difficulty to help the victims and their families with their multiple pains， including the physical as well as the emotional harms 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Child Sex Abuse (CSA) sets up also as a gender and race problem， because it affects mainly girls and black girls； in addition， the crime is committed more than 90% of times by males 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-8]</u>.\n\n【9】Every day， thousands of children are abused in places that were supposed to be safe. Several studies show that the most common places where this kind ofcrime occurs were at home and school， not to mention that such atrocity is perpetrated by those who are close to the victim 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3，4，6，7，9]</u>.\n\n【10】Sexual abuse is a harmful， humiliating， and traumatic experience to the physical and mental health of men and women with immediate and late consequences. When it comes to immediate repercussions victims usually experience suicidal thoughts， mental disturbs， behavioral disturb， Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PT'SD) 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>， and regarding the late consequences， they stumble upon senile depression， and high risk of suicide in elder individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Thus， the aim of this study was to analyze the psychiatric and psychological repercussion of children and adolescents， victims of CSA in Brazil.\n\n【11】Methods\n\n【12】A systematic literature search was performed according to guidelines in the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. Searches were conducted in PubMed. Keywords included combinations of the words \"sex offenses\" and children and Brazil.\n\n【13】Studies were considered if they were published between January 2015 and September 2020and appeared in peer-reviewed， English， Portuguese， and Spanish language journals. Further articles were identified by a manual search of reference lists from retrieved papers. Studies were删除1换行included if they (i) appeared in peer-reviewed journals； (ii) were published in full； (iii) were not dissertation papers， editorials， letters， conference proceedings， books， and book chapters； (iv) had primary and sufficient data derived from longitudinal， cross-sectional， case-control， or cohort studies. For the aim of this systematic review， only reviews that investigated prevalence， psychiatric symptoms or disorders following CSA in Brazil were included.\n\n【14】Results\n\n【15】The search strategy yielded 121 hits in PubMed. Titles and/or abstracts of these records were screened， and 84 did not meet eligibility criteria. Out of the remaining 38 full-text articles， 22 were excluded for various reasons. Thus， our systematic review includes 15publications .\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】As it is known， Child Sex Abuse (CSA) is a difficult crime to investigate and prove. Children and adolescents'dependence on their parents aggravate the problem， once victims usually take too long to report the crime， and when this occurs， it is still difficult to find physical evidence to confirm the rape. It is important to remember that parents generally have no knowledge regarding the abuse， and when they notice it， they fear about the consequences of notification通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【18】Despite this， according to Gaspar and Pereira 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> from 2009to 2013 there was an increase on the number of notifications of CSA. Sexual abuse notification tripled， due to a real increase in the number of cases， to greater awareness of the victims and/or health professionals， or even to better structuring and the number of删除1换行reporting units. It is clearly observed that girls are the most affected. In almost all the studies， the number of girls who suffered a sexual abuse was bigger than the number of boys 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-8]</u>\n\n【19】Machismo is still - in the 215 century-a very big social problem. It affects all social spheres of most of the Latin-American countries which could explain the underreporting of CSA in boys. The low notification of sexual violence against men is partially due to the toxic masculinity. Men fear having their virility questioned， which leads them not to seeking for health services after having suffered sexual violence 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Machismo perpetuates a mistaken conviction that men who are victims of violence tend to homosexuality. This stereotype causes a delay on reporting the abuse. As a result ofthis delay，they may experience more severe CSA over time 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. No one believes that boys may be victims of CSA which decreases the visibility of these cases. In the familiar context， the possibility that boys may suffer unbelief and even physical punishment after reportion shows how difficult it is to individuals to understand that boys may be victims of CSA. In the social context，these cases are permeated by misconceptions regarding gender identity or sexual orientation of the victim， contributing to a lesser visibility of male sexual abuse as a public health problem 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Besides that， da Silva and Roncalli 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> affirm that men tend to have less access to health services when compared to women. Although a tremendous amount of men suffers this type of violence， women are still the main victims in all age groups which characterize marked gender violence 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【20】The socioeconomic conditions of families are a risk predictor for CSA. Significantly higher rates of sexual violence were observed among black-skinned students from public schools， children of mothers with low levels of education， students who did not live with their mother and/or father， and among those who were already working and receiving retribution for that. Associated and protective factors as for the occurrence of CSA included attending to a private school， being son of a highly educated mother，living with the mother and/or father and having family supervision 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【21】Victim's residence was alarmingly the most frequent place of abuse， and the aggressors were mostly men who in most of the cases were known by the victims. Even scarier than this， only the fact that the own children’s parents were the most common perpetrators通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4，10]</u>. The violations generally occurred in situations understood as affection， when the aggressor and the child were alone. The moments ofplay，a characteristic activity ofchildhood，were favorable situations for adults to practice sexual violence. The aggressors took advantage of childhood situations such as playing to perpetrate the crime. Thus， the victims cannot immediately recognize the violence， which prevents the aggressors from being reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Home， which should be a place of protection and care， has become a place of violence and child victimization.\n\n【22】A curious contradiction exists in the literature as to the safety of children at school. While some studies show that the number of cases of CSA within educational institutions is increasing 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> others describe schools as a protective factor for CSA 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【23】Regarding the types of sexual violence， the following were identified： Rape， sexual harassment， indecent exposure， sexual exploitation， child pornography and others. It was observed that， among the types of sexual violence， rape was the most frequent， possibly related to the fact that other types of sexual violence are not recognized as violence.

There were signs of recent abuse such as hematomas， drops of blood and edema in 30%in which the hymen was ruptured. Two girls of this study， both aged11， were already pregnant and despite abortion being authorized by law in cases of sexual abuse， there are still a lot of girls who have to carry on with an undesired pregnancy， this because legal abortion in Brazil，has become a religious and moral debate.\n\n【42】It is well known that children whohavebeen sexuallyabused suffer the negative effects of this throughout their lives. The most common manifestations are inadequate school performance， psychological problems (depression， anxiety， suicide attempt and post-traumatic stress disorder) and personal relationships 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Among the immediate consequences， the impact of CSA on the mental health of the victims stands out， according to Platt et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. From all analyzed children in their study， four of them (1%) attempted suicide； five(1.3%) developed mental disorder； 90 (22.4%) showed behavioral disorders； and 77 (20.0%) had PTSD.

Agreeing with this idea， Fontes et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> found that abused young people were more likely to use illicit drugs， alcohol and have friends who already did. Sexually abused students appear to be less likely to continue their studies in high school and graduation and are more likely to be already working. The victim of sexual violence avoid staying at home and tries to spend as much time as possible outside their house to feel more secure. Insomnia can be explained by the presence of nightmares， fears and mood disorders such as depression. The lack of friends and loneliness can be associated with aggressive behaviors or the withdrawal from the creation of new social bonds， as well as characteristics of low self-esteem and bullving.\n\n【44】Finally， Gomes Jardim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> claims that all childhood maltreatment types were significantly associated with the risk of suicide， and an emphasis is placed on sexual abuse， which， unlike other mistreatment subtypes， is more strongly associated with the risk of suicide in the elderly.\n\n【45】Conclusion\n\n【46】CSA is a rarely notified crime， due to this， it is necessary to learn how to identify behaviors that the victims show， in order to be able to act in aprecocious way and prevent more serious consequences of this crime.

Without saving that， the religious polarization， surrounding governmental decisions and important debates such as abortion， is being harming and will continue to harm the future of more young people. More studies are needed， so health professionals， teachers and especially families can recognize early signs of CSA， besides that， public policies need to be implemented urgently in order to reduce these egregious cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Sparing this anomaly is considered important as it frequently is part of the venous drainage of normal brain parenchyma. We present a case in which a developmental venous anomaly of the third ventricle associated with a thalamic cavernous malformation increased the degree of difficulty of successful endoscopic third ventriculostomy for management of hydrocephalus. Through a conventional approach with careful pre-operative planning we were able to successfully fenestrate the floor of the third ventricle and spare the abnormal venous complex.\n\n【2】Keywords： Cavernous malformation； Developmental venous anomaly； Endoscopic third ventriculostomy\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】It has been well-documented that cerebral cavernous malformations (CMs) can be associated with a developmental venous anomaly (DVA)， as often as 20% of the time by some estimates 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The DVA is typically spared at the time of surgery to avoid disruption of venous drainage of normal associated tissue. Depending on the location of the DVA， this can either be straightforward or can present significant challenges to successful operation. We present a case in which an intraventricular DVA associated with a thalamic CM increased the difficulty and influenced surgical decision making for endoscopic third ventriculostomy(ETV).\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】History and examination\n\n【7】A six-year-old boy with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department and was admitted complaining of one week of headaches with associated nausea and vomiting. In the 24 hours prior to admission， he became slightlylethargic and his parents noted gait instability， which prompted the visit to the emergency department.\n\n【8】On admission， he was noted to be lethargic but arousable to voice without any focal neurologic deficits. Laboratory evaluation was unremarkable， and an MRI of the brain was obtained. The MRI demonstrated a 1.5 x1.2 cm mass in the posterior third ventricle and a small amount of hematoma within the aqueduct causing obstructive hydrocephalus . Intra-lesional hemorrhage and a DVA identified in the left wall of the third ventricle suggested the diagnosis of a cavernous malformation of the posterior thalamus.\n\n【9】An external ventricular drain (EVD) was placed on admission and the patient was taken to the operating room for ETV on hospital day 2 based on the presence ofhematoma within the aqueduct that may not have been visualized and removed with resection of the lesion from a posterior approach. This procedure would then be followed by resection of the lesion. In deciding to move forward with ETV to decrease the patient’s risk for post-operative shunting， the location of the DVA was taken into consideration to avoid injury. A more medial and anterior entry point with frameless stereotactic navigation was therefore planned to allow for more rightward navigation and fenestration as well as avoiding working against or directly adjacent to the anomaly\n\n【10】Operation\n\nThe patient was taken to the operating room and positioned supine with the head neutral in|删除段之间换行|Postoperative course\n\n【12】The patient was taken to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) post-operatively and returned to the operating room on post-operative day (POD) 1 for resection of the cavernous malformation by a supracerebellar infratentorial approach. He was neurologically intact and monitored in the PICU post-operatively and the EVD was removed on POD 3， at which time the patient was discharged home.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Cavernous malformations are indolent， vascular lesions that most frequently present clinically with seizures or neurologic deficits associated with hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. DVAs are thought to occur in approximately 20% of pediatric patients with CMs， and represent an independent risk factor for hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Thalamic CMs occur in fewer than 10% ofall CMs and are grouped with those occurring in the brainstem as a higher risk category as hemorrhage more frequently results in permanent neurologic injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-6]</u>. Furthermore， CMs ofthe brainstem and thalamus identified in childhood have been observed to be larger， with a higher risk for hemorrhage and recurrence than those in other locations 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. While surgical approaches to these lesions are not without risk， many advocate definitive management when surgically feasible to avoid permanent morbidity from hemorrhage， particularly given the life expectancy of pediatric patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Surgical approaches have been well documented in the published literature， with the supracerebellar infratentorial approach favored for reaching posterior thalamic/pineal region CMs 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，6]</u>. However， in some cases删除1换行temporizing management such as CSF diversion may be needed prior to definitive management.\n\n【15】Th1eeCMCdescribed d in thisCcasereport presenteddwith hydrocephalus， an uncommon presentation， caused by hemorrhage resulting in obstruction of the aqueduct of Sylvius. Prior to definitive management of the CM， CSF diversion was undertaken in the form of an ETV， as this clot was not necessarily accessible via the surgical approach to the lesion. This case illustrates a situation in which a DVA associated with a CM of the posterior thalamus increased the complexity of operative planning and the technical difficulty of achieving adequate CSF diversion for obstructive hydrocephalus. The presentation of the patient， and initial management， are typical for a pineal region lesion， if not a CM 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Recognition of the DVA， however， was important for operative preparation. In this case， the DVA resulted in a narrowing of the interval between the bilateral hypothalami in the anterior third ventricle. The planned entry point， trajectory， and subsequent potential sites of fenestration in the floor were limited， therefore， and required preoperative consideration. Upon entering the third ventricle through the foramen of Monro with a rigid endoscope， the DVA was identified along the wall of the hypothalamus. The initial perforation was straightforward given that the entry pointprovided the abilityto navigate laterally and anteriorly. However， dilation of the ventriculostomy using an embolectomy catheter was limited by the narrowed interval between the bilateral hypothalami due to the presence of the DV A. This limitation required additional care to be taken in expanding the ventriculostomy and necessitated leaving a smaller perforation， but had no impact on the outcome of the operation. The ETV was successful， and the patient recovered well following resection of the cavernous malformation.\n\n【16】We demonstrate a case in which a thalamic CM was found to be associated with a thirdventricularDVA.Identification ofthis anomaly pre-operatively was essential in operative planning， most importantly for CSF diversion in the form of an ETV. While the presence of the anomaly increased the degree of difficulty for performing the ETV， careful preoperative planning with respect to trajectory， fenestration site into the prepontine cistern， insufflation on entering the ventricle， and modification of approach intra-operatively when creating the stoma resulted in successful completion of the procedure without complication.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1.

This is a consecutive series of 4 patients， from King Hussein Cancer Center-Amman-Jordan between first of August 2016 and 24h of January 2017. Patients details illustrated in Table 1. Median follows up of 13.25 months (range： 8 to 18 months).\n\nThe median age at the time ofrecurrent/refractory disease was 39years (range， 20-43)， and the median Karnofsky Performance Status(KPS) was 70% (range， 60 to 90). Four patients had stage IVB disease associated with disease bulk， and pleuropericadial involvement in 2 patients； one patient had thyroid gland and localized bone|删除段之间换行|involvement (T11 vertebrae).\n\n【12】All patients were treated with standard-of-care regimens and had no other available options. All 4 patients were Refractory to First Line Treatment (RCHOP)，andhad multiply recurrent disease； one patient relapsed with diffuse bone and pulmonary involvement. All 4 patients received a median of 4 previous chemotherapy lines (range： 3-5)， 1patient required re-irradiation to mediastinal disease bulk due to recurrent mediastinal disease associated with compressive pulmonary symptoms. Salvage treatments including GDP， ICE， and DHAP chemotherapy regimens. All 4 patients received pembrolizumab at fixed dose of 200 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks at a median of 5 cycles(range： 4-6). All 4 patients had objective response and achieved complete remission at a median of 4 cycles (range： 3-4). Three patients received high dose chemotherapy consolidation (BEAM) conditioning after Pembrolizumab (patients 1-3) and patient 4relapsedafterABMT received salvage Pembrolizumab andplanned for allogeneic Hematopoietic Transplantation (allo-HCT) consolidation. He achieved complete remission and continued in remission at 18months of follow up after the last dose of pembrolizumab.\n\n【13】All 4 patients were symptomatic prior to start of Pembrolizumab. All patients improved clinically with improved KPS. Objective metabolic and radiological responses (PET-CT) to treatment with Pembrolizumab were achieved in 4 patients . Responses were confirmed by PET CT and no disease recurrence identified at last follow up. The median number of pembrolizumab treatments to objective radiographic response was 4 (range， 3-4)， .\n\n【14】The median duration of follow-up was 13.25 months. At last follow up， 3 patients after ABMT were alive and continued in complete metabolic remission at 8+， 5+ and 28+ months； 1 patient who relapsed after ABMT， received 5 doses of pembrolizumab， achieved complete remission， but unfortunately discontinued due to pulmonary toxicity grade 3. He declined allo-HCT fairing of complications. He continued to have complete metabolic remission at 18 months follow up.\n\n【15】Pembrolizumab was well tolerated in 2 patients. The toxicities of pembrolizumab， including grade 2 pneumonitis， that may have exacerbated by previous radiation in 1 (patient 4) with moderate to severe restriction and decreased diffusion capacity， which prompted discontinuation of Pembrolizumab after the fifth cycle and improved with inhalers and steroid treatment； grade 2 fatigue in another patient， both thought to be drug-related.

Menstrual cycles resumed3 month post-partum and was regular until her 2n conception. After her 1 delivery she has been complaining of weakness， lethargy， fatigue， weight loss and anorexia. After her 2\" conception she had been having nausea and vomiting. Her Random blood sugar was 22 mg/dl，TSH： 4.18 uIU/mL； T4：9.77 ug/dL； T3：1.410 ng/mL； electrolytes (Serum Sodium and potassium 130.43， 4.45 mmoll respectively) and Liver aminotransferase levels were normal.Random plasma cortisol was <0.4 ug/dL. Urine specific gravity 1030. Ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis did not reveal any significant finding other than a gravid uterus. No adrenal lesion could be seen.\n\n【6】删除10:<u>1A 1C</u>\n\n【7】2A 2B 2C\n\n【8】Basal paired ACTH and cortisol levels， an ACTH stimulation test was performed to assess the adrenal glands reserve and MR imaging of the Sella without contrast (because of pregnancy)， was performed. The results revealed low cortisol and ACTH levels (Paired8 AM plasma cortisol 0.13 ug/ml-ACTH- 4.87 PG/ML)， lack of incremental response in plasma cortisol after ACTH stimulation(Basal and stimulated cortisol every 30 min for 2 h was <0.4 ug/ML). The Anti Adrenal antibody-negative， Antibodies TPO：<0.8 IU/ml and Anti Thyroglobulin Antibody (Anti Tg)： <6.4 IU/ml. MRI findings showed a small pituitary gland (AP 7.4× CC 2.8 × ML 9mm)， signal changes in the pars intermedia and infundibulum and lack of normal posterior pituitary signal (interpreted as a sequel of prior apoplexy or autoimmune hypophysitis) . Further hormonal tests of anterior pituitary function showed； TSH： 4.18 uIU/mL； serum Prolactin - 42.71 ng/ml； Growth Hormone (GH)-0.83 ng/ML； IGF Bindingprotein-3-4.73 ng/ml； IGF-1-71.8 ng/ml. The GH， IGF levels and serum prolactin were normal. She had normal HbAlc and parathormone levels.\n\n【9】The constellation of findings， lethargy， weight loss from the peripartum period of first pregnancy， resumption of menstrual cycles and subsequent conception along with low paired cortisol-ACTH values， favored a diagnosis of peripartum Autoimmune Hypophysitis(AIH)which had presumably started after the first pregnancy. She was supplemented with high dose steroid (up to 40 mg ofhydrocortisone/day). She carried the pregnancy to 33.4 weeks and spontaneously delivered a healthy male child (Weight 1.63 kg. Length 42 cm； Head circumference 30.5 cm.APGARSCORE l and 5 min-8/10 and 9/10)， and is being breast fed. After 8 months her menstrual cycles resumed. MRI of the Sella was performed 6 weeks post-partum with contrast which showed an increase in size of the pituitary gland with normal posterior pituitary signal and mild increased stalk enhancement(AP：12.2x CC 4x ML 12.2 mm) . CT scan of the adrenal glands showed significantly small sized adrenal glands with删除1换行the limb thickness measuring only 1mm and body thickness of 1 mm to 1.5 mm.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】The clinical presentation of anorexia， weakness， lethargy， fatigue， weight loss， and lack of stamina， along with hypotension， mild hyponatremia and hypoglycemia typically suggest adrenal insufficiency. Some of the symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are mirrored by pregnancy. In this background biochemical diagnosis of mild adrenal insufficiency can be challenging. Hypercortisolism may be primary or secondary. Paired early morning ACTH along with cortisol is recommended for diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. A value of<5 mcg/dl of cortisol confirms hypercortisolism accompanied by>2-fold the upper limit of ACTH.\n\n【12】The total and free plasma cortisol， ACTH， CRH， urinary free cortisol and Cortisol Binding Globulin (CBG) increases by 12 week ofpregnancy until mid-gestation in healthy pregnancy. The values are three-fold above the levels ofnon-pregnant women. Maternal adrenal reserve accounts for 90% to 95% of free cortisol up to 33 weeks of gestation. There are trimester specific cut-offs for stimulated cortisol values 25， 29 and 32 ug/dL in the first， second and third trimester respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The low paired cortisol-ACTH levels with lack of adrenal response to ACTH could be explained as secondary adrenal insufficiency as a result of autoimmune hypophysitis untreated for a long period leading to “lazy adrenals\". Also， hyponatremia is less pronounced in secondary adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【13】This patient conceived spontaneously， had normal thyroid function and no adreniaall pathology o11ultrasoundd imaging autoimmune polyglandular syndrome was initially ruled out. This left the possibility of a hypothalamus-pituitary axis aetiology with the possibilitiesbeing Sheehan ssyndromeandautoimmunehypophysitis. The preserved gonadal function as evidenced by uneventful previous删除1换行pregnancy， breast feeding post-partum， resumption of menstrual cycles and a spontaneous second conception made the possibility of Sheehan's syndrome unlikely. Her autoantibodies to adrenal and thyroid glands (to further rule out autoimmune polyglandular syndrome-APS) was negative. A Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) of the sella was performed . Contrary to autoimmune thyroid diseases in the puerperium， autoimmune adrenal failure in puerperium has not been reported. Though in Addison’s disease there is chronic anovulation leading to infertility unless properly treated， there are reports of fertility in untreated Addison’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【14】Typically， AIH presents with hypopituitarism and pituitary mass. AIH is rare in children and seniors. It affects the reproductive age group and has a temporal relation with pregnancy-late pregnancy and early post-partum.The anterior pituitary deficiencies are in order of ACTH>TSH>LH/FSH in AIH. In pituitary tumors， surgery or radiotherapy the sequence of deficiencies is GH>LH/FSH>TSH=ACTH 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Autoimmune hypophysitis is classified based on，\n\n【15】A. Anatomy (morphology) whether inflammation involves anterior pituitary (Lymphocytic Adenohypophysitis： LAH)， posterior gland and stalk (Lymphocytic Infundibulo Hypophysitis： LINH) or entire gland Panhypophysitis- Lymphocytic Pan Hypophysitis(LPH)通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Inflammation involving only anterior pituitary occurs in65% of cases. It is six times common than involvement of anterior and posterior pituitary together. More than 50% of them are present during pregnancy and post-partum. Involvement of anterior and posterior pituitary are twice as common in women (25%) and neurohypophysis involvement occurs equally in both sexes (10%). AIH commonly presents in the peripartum period beginning with the 3r trimester of pregnancy. Common symptomatology is headache (40%) and visual disturbances (enlarged pituitary gland-related) in one third of patients or symptoms of anterior pituitary insufficiency in 44% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Autoimmunity leads to acinar cell destruction which causes the hormonal deficiency resulting in hypoadrenalism， hypothyroidism and hypogonadism. Posterior pituitary may be affected by compression from the anterior pituitary and stalk or directly due to autoimmunity and this leads to polyuria and polydipsia (31% cases) and hyperprolactinemia (18% cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The most common hormonal deficiency in AIH is ACTH followed by thyrotropin and gonadotropins 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>.\n\nB. Aetiological classification is P primaryy and secondary hypophysitis. Primary refers to isolated inflammation of pituitary and secondary refers to cases associated with-immunotherapy drugs， rupture of sella cyst and rarely pituitary adenoma or systemic inflammatory process involving the pituitary gland|删除段之间换行|C. Histological classification includes subtypes oflymphocytic， granulomatous，xanthomatous and plasmocytic.\n\n【17】MRI characteristics of AIH are usually a sellar mass typically symmetric and homogenous with an intact sellar floor， suprasellar extension， stalk thickening， precontrast homogeneous signal with homogeneous enhancement with loss of normal posterior pituitary signal. MR imaging follow up of patients with AIH usually showed decreased pituitary volume， a concave pituitary aspect or an empty sella turcica 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. In pituitary macroadenoma， there is asymmetric sellar mass， often non homogenous with supra sellar extension， stalk displacement， erosion of sellar floor and non-homogenous enhancement on contrast 4.\n\n【18】AIH may spontaneously resolve. Some cases are refractory to treatment and may relapse 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. In our case， the patient had an AIH peripartum in her 1 pregnancy which probably resolved spontaneously and relapsed in 2nd pregnancy or missed diagnosis in the first pregnancy. During the first trimester of her second pregnancy， her cortisol deficiency was exaggerated and presented as hypercortisolism. The long duration of ACTH deficiency of 4 years between her first and second pregnancies had made her adrenal glands “lazy\"and there was no incremental response of her adrenals by the ACTH stimulation. A lack of initial imaging in our case， during peripartum period of the first pregnancy was unfortunate； however the MRI of the pituitary gland in the first trimester did reveal the findings which were inferred to be the sequel of a prior hypophysitis event. Biopsy may not always be necessary for an effective clinical treatment删除4-1:<u>7，8</u>.\n\n【19】Natural history of AIH is variable. Most patients (72%) improve with high dose glucocorticoids or mass reducing surgeries (rarely)，17% need no medications， 7% die because of irreversible adrenal insufficiency and a few (4%) improve spontaneously. Radiological follow up of AIH show reduction or disappearance of mass (88%)， no changes in 12% and empty sella in 10% of patients.\n\n【20】Fertility and pre-conceptional consideration are outlined for patients with primary adrenal insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> with steroid dose adaptation(hydrocortisone/fludrohydrocortisone) fordifferent trimesters of pregnancy and during parturition1.There are no treatment guidelines for patients conceived with AIH. In this patient， the electrolytes were normal and blood pressures maintained with supplementation of glucocorticoids. Also， hyponatremia is less pronounced in secondary adrenal failure.\n\n【21】Steroids form the mainstay of treatment in AIH. High doses of steroids given during pregnancy to our patient indirectly aided the recovery of AIH as was evidenced by the changes in the pituitary gland on follow up imaging after her 2nd delivery. In some cases， where there is no symptomatic relief of mass effect symptoms， immune suppression (azathioprine， methotrexate， mycophenolate)， biological therapies (Rituximab) and even radiotherapy may be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Majority of patients recover within 6 to 9 months with therapy and surgical removal is rarely required 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. AIH has no adverse effects on pregnancy or ability to conceive in future. There are reports of conception after successful treatment of AIH with steroid therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. There are no reports of conception in patients with missed diagnosis of AIH， later presenting with hypercortisolism in subsequent pregnancy.\n\n【22】In a retrospective analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>通用删除7(英):<u>(1988-2006)</u> of 15 patients of AIH， there was female preponderance (14 females and one male)， with commonest hormone deficiency being ACTH (67%)， TSH (53%) and gonadotropin deficiency (40%). Imaging revealed enhancing sellar mass (87%) with stalk thickening (33%). On serial monitoring sellar mass regressed/disappeared without any immunosuppressive treatment. Three patients underwent surgery.\n\n【23】The important points that we would like to highlight in our case are： the importance of a good clinical history coupled with an understanding of the relevance of hormonal tests， supplemented by appropriate imaging will lead one to the diagnosis of AIH. With our patient being pregnant and in her first trimester， we needed to be judicious and careful to come to the diagnosis after having considered relevant differential diagnoses， we had to rely on non-invasive删除1换行diagnostic practices (hence she was not subjected to a biopsy) and our primary goal was for our patient to have a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby.\n\n【24】To the best of our knowledge， this is the first reported case of untreated AIH resulting in a successful spontaneous conception， which was then appropriately diagnosed and treated， to lead to a normal delivery with resumption of menstrual cycle's post-partum.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However， it is uncommon the association of the infiltrate with specific renal histopathological alterations， such as a Granulomatous Interstitial Nephritis (GIN)， with severe kidney function impairment. We describe a patient with progressive TP53 mutated CLL who developed acute renal failure due to leukemic infiltration associated with GIN during treatment with ibrutinib， the new inhibitor of the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase. After stopping ibrutinib， the patient obtained a complete remission with high doses of prednisone plus chemoimmunotherapy， but recently he underwent relapse treated now with venetoclax plus prednisone.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Chronic LymphocyticLeukemia (CLL)。alow grade malignancycconsistingof CD5+CD23+CD200+ small Blymphocytes， is the most frequent leukemia in the western world. The treatment landscape for CLL is rapidly evolving. Combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens like FCR (Fludarabine， Cyclophosphamide， Rituximab) and BR (Bendamustine， Rituximab) have been the frontline therapies for CLL， whereas Chlorambucil remained the standard frontline therapy for older patients (65 years or older) with CLL until recently 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Targeted therapy with small molecule inhibitors against Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) such as ibrutinib and acalabrutinib are playing a major role for treatment of patients with either treatment-naive or refractory/relapsed CLL 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>.\n\n【4】The Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib showed an impressive and sustained Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) benefit both in first line and in relapsed or refractory CLL. Nevertheless， patients with specific high risk features like TP53 mutations showed a trend toward shorter PFS， and altogether， only half of the enrolled patients were still receiving ibrutinib at the end of the observation period 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Here， we report a peculiar case of acute renal failure associated with leukemic infiltration and Granulomatous Interstitial Nephritis (GIN) occurring in a CLL patient with TP53 gene mutations， refractory to ibrutinib in first line， but subsequently responding to chemoimmunotherapy.\n\n【5】In February 2014， a 59-year-old male patient presented with asymptomatic widespread lymphadenopathy (cervical， axillary， supraclavicular， mediastinal and inguinal) and splenomegaly(18cm onimaging). His white cell count was higher than normal with differential count showing 16.0x10/L lymphocytes. The immunophenotypic study carried out on peripheral blood lymphocytes by flow cytometry showed a CD19+/CD20+/CD5+/CD23-/CD200+ homogeneous phenotype with a IGL-Lambda clonal restriction， confirming the diagnosis of atypical (CD23-) CLL. The prognostic biomarker CD38 was negative (10% of positive CLL cells). FISH analysis revealed the deletion of the long arm ofchromosome 13 (del13q-) and the deletion ofthe short arm of chromosome 17 (del17p-). Clonal mutations of the TP53 gene were also found (variant allele frequency， VAF， 78%， mutation on exon 8 c.916C>T，p.R306X). This pathogenic variant is denoted TP53 c.916C>T at the cDNA level and p.Arg306Ter (R306X) at the protein level. The substitution creates a nonsense variant， which changes an Arginine to a premature stop codon (CGA>TGA)， and is predicted to cause\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Cases of GIN associated with kidney leukemia infiltrate are uncommon. Sometimes they may occur with acute kidney failure pictures that improve under corticosteroid treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[11-14]</u>. Our patient developed GIN framework associated with leukemic infiltrates leading to an acute renal failure during treatment with ibrutinib. According to the current literature， granulomatous reactions may be caused by concomitant mycobacterial infections and rare tumors including malignant lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，16]</u>. The participation of T cells， as in our case， in granulomatous reactions is well established， but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been yet elucidated. Noteworthy， Interleukin (IL) 17， a cytokine secreted by T-lymphocytes has been established as an important factor in T-cell-mediated IFN-gamma production and granuloma formation 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Moreover， the pathogenesis of GIN in patients with CLL/SLL is unknown. There is great evidence that CLL patients have T-cell dysfunction which contributes to infectious and auto-immune complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. The fact that our case of GIN was accompanied by CLL interstitial infiltration suggest that GIN may be a local hypersensitivity reaction to tumor-derived antigens， which may stimulate antigen-presenting cells to produce cytokines involved in granulomatous inflammation， such as IL-12， IL-18 and/or IL-27 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Moreover， our patient had not evidence by immunofluorescence of monoclonal protein or immune-complex-type deposits， providing evidence against paraprotein-mediated or immune-complex-mediated interstitial nephritis. In our patient， both the kidney function and the hematological disease improved on high dose steroids and on CLL-directed Chemoimmunotherapy(R-CHOP). It may be hypothesized that the refractoriness to ibrutinib with the subsequent GIN may be partly due to the above mentioned pathogenic variant of the TP53 mutation. B-lymphocyte clone had an immunophenotypic pattern (CD23-/CD200+/Cyclin D1-/CD10-)删除2换行that excluded mantle cell lymphoma (Cyclin D1 negative)， follicular lymphoma (CD10 negative) and marginal lymphoma (CD200+). It is possible to suppose that it is an atypical CLL refractory to ibrutinib. The vast majority of CLL patients respond to ibrutinib， as reflected by the aggregate observation of PR， CR or prolonged stable disease with nodal response despite peripheral lymphocytosis. However， there are currently no upfront clinical biomarkers to predict sensitivity or resistance to ibrutinib therapy in CLL 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Finally， it may be hypothesized that this clone of expanded B lymphocytes CD23-CD200+ infiltrating the kidney may have caused the histopathology of the GIN as well as the clinical picture of the next renal failure. Noteworthy， ibrutinib， by depressing some populations of B lymphocytes in CLL， may allow the expansion of other non-sensitive clones which are responsible for kidney damage as in this case. This assumption may be indirectly supported by the fact that the subsequent R-CHOP chemotherapy， eliminating the clone both in the peripheral blood and in the kidney， brilliantly resolved renal failure and allowed to obtain complete remission of the disease. This is the first CLL case reported in literature in which the appearance of GIN is described during therapy with ibrutinib. However， larger clinicopathologic studies are needed to determine the incidence and risk factors of GIN in patients with CLL.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The symptoms had reportedly started 1 year ago， evolved over few weeks and were further accompanied with left plantar dysaesthesia and numbness， gradually including the posterior-outer part of the left calf.\n\n【5】Personal history included frequent episodes since infancy with fever， gastrointestinal infections and bronchitis， as well as recurrent ear infections and tonsillitis. At the age of 4 she underwent tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. She also suffered from frequent urethritis， pharyngitis and skin infections. At the age of 7， laboratory investigation showed combined IgA and IgG hypogammaglobulinemia while the rest of the investigation was reported to be within normal limits(common variable immunodeficiency-CVID). The patient received immunoglobulin replacement therapy (0.5gr/kg/month) over a period of 6 years. During treatment she remained free of infections and all immunoglobulin class values returned to normal range.\n\n【6】Upon neurological examination on admission the patient exhibited reduced left ankle reflex， reduced muscle strength on knee flexion (4/5)， plantar flexion (4/5) and dorsiflexion (2/5). There was reduced sensation of the dorsal surface of the foot and the outer surface of the calf. The rest neurological examination was normal. Serology including CRP， ESR and serum albumin and CSF examination including screening for viruses， showed normal findings， however， reduced IgG (684mg/dl， reference range 751-1560) as well as increased IgE (289 mg/dl， reference range 10-100) were found. Serum free kappa chains was also reduced (471 mg/dl， reference range 629-1350).\n\n【7】Nerve conduction studies showed total absence of the left sural and superficial peroneal nerve action potentials. The compound muscle action potentials of the left common peroneal and posterior tibial nerve were severely reduced indicating substantial axonal loss. A mild prolongation of the distal motor latencies， as well as a minor slowing of motor nerve conduction velocities in the above nerves， were consistent with the degree of axonal loss. Electromyographic sampling showed severe denervation confined to the territory of the left sciatic nerve. MRI examination of the pelvis-hips revealed thickening of the left sciatic nerve .\n\n【8】The patient was treated with a 5 days course ofintravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)， followed by a monthly single injection.

It should be as a complex endpoint of the interplay between microbial pathogens， host microbiota， and the influence of these on host regulation of inflammation and adaptive immunity. Abnormalities in immune regulation could predispose to bronchiectasis both the response to the initial insult that induces the disease process and the ongoing inflammatory process. The processes involve manykinds of cells， including of T-lymphocytes， cytokines and immunoglobulins. According to the newest BT'S Guideline for bronchiectasis in adults， it is essential to investigate whether raised serum immunoglobulins are polyclonal or monoclonal. Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignant proliferative disease with monoclonal immunoglobulin secretion. There are few literatures on concurrent association of bronchiectasis with multiple myeloma. The rarity prompted us to report the two bronchiectasis patients were diagnosed with multiple myeloma.\n\n【2】Keywords： Bronchiectasis； Immunoglobulins； Multiple myeloma； Tlymphocytes\n\n【3】Case Series\n\n【4】Case 1\n\n【5】A 78 years old man was admitted in neurology with one-sided weakness 1 year ago and loss of transientconsciousness3hago. The patient was found fever andleft chestpain duringhospitalization. Past history revealed bronchiectasis in his 30s. He had abnormal physical examination with remarkable moist rales heard over the left lower part of the chest and left limb muscle strength decreased. The patient's hemoglobin was 107 g/L， total serum protein 108.5 g/L (reference range60 g/L to 80 g/L)， serum globulin 81.5 g/L (referen cLeE Irange 20 g/L to 40 g/L) and abnormal kidney function. Chest CT showed bilateral lower zone cystic and columnar bronchiectasis and low density imaging of bilateral scapula and thoracic vertebrae . During antibiotic treatment for bronchiectasis，the patient had still sustaining low-grade fever. So， further examination was needed. Quantification of serum Immunoglobulin (Ig) levels showed a high IgGlevel of 61.20 g/L (reference range， 7.51 g/L to 15.6 g/L) and low IgA of 0.41 g/L (reference range， 0.71 g/L to 3.82 g/L) and IgM of 0.33 g/L (reference range， 0.63 g/L to 2.77 g/L).

Therefore， the patient was admitted in hematology department. His past history revealed bronchiectasis in childhood and renal failure for nearly 1 year. Similar to the previous one，he had also moist rales over both lung and the right dominated. The patient's serum globulin was 54.3 g/L. Chest CT showed multiple cystic and columnar bronchiectasis with tree-in-bud pattern in the bilateral lung and multiple chiseled low density imaging of bilateral RIBs， clavicle and thoracic vertebrae . Quantification of serum immunoglobulin levels showed a high IgA level of 38.40 g/L. Serum free kappa light chain was 26.0 mg/L (normal 3.30 mg/L to 19.40 mg/L)， free Lambda (l.c) 0.63 mg/L， and kappa/lambda41.56. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a monoclonal band， shown by immunofixation to be IgA k. Bone marrow aspiration showed 4.5% plasma cells， which is 2% immature ones .

However， after operation， her clinical symptoms and biochemical parameters got worse despite being on usual supportive therapy， including ursodeoxycholic acid. An oral omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids agent was started on day-77 after the operation. After this treatment， her clinical symptoms and biochemical parameters， including bilirubin and aminotransferase， improved. We report that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids might work as a potent choleretic agent in infants with biliary atresia after Kasai operation.\n\n【2】Keywords： Omega-3 fatty acids； Biliary atresia； Cholestasis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Lipid emulsions with omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) appear to improve cholestasis and， reduce hepatic triglyceride synthesis and inflammation in Intestinal Failure-Associated Liver Disease (IFALD) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.

It is necessary to delay liver transplantation as much as possible after the Kasai operation because liver transplantation is known to affect the patient’s age 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Here， we present a case of biliary atresia， getting worse of cholestasis even after the Kasai operation， where omega-3 PUFAs improved cholestasis from a clinical and biochemical perspective.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】An 8-week-old female infant was admitted our hospital due to jaundice and acholic stool. She was born at the gestational age of 39 weeks， with a birth weight of 3900 gm. She has been jaundiced since two days after birth； her stool was acholic since she was 6 weeks of age. Upon physical examination， the sclera and skin color were icteric and the liver was palpable. Laboratory tests revealed the following results： Total Bilirubin (TB) 10.18 mg/dL； Direct Bilirubin (DB) 4.87mg/dL； Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) 271 IU/L； Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) 202 IU/L； Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) 613 IU/L； Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) 465 IU/L； Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) 71.776 ng/ml； and bile acid >150 umol/L. Some tests for viral markers (HBV， HCV， rubella， toxoplasma) and syphilis were negative； however， tests for cytomegalovirus and herpes virus IgM were positive. Ultrasound revealed that the gallbladder was ovoid shape and mild diffuse intrahepatic duct dilatation was observed. On Hospital Day 2 (HD#2)， Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography(MRCP) revealed a collapsed gallbladder and non-visualized intrahepatic duct. On HD#3， a hepatobiliary scan showed no intestinal activity until the 24-h delayed image.\n\n【7】She was diagnosed withbiliaryatresia； the Kasaioperation was performed on HD#6. An excisional biopsy showed the proliferation of many bile ducts with no bile plugs. Cytomegalovirus was found to be negative in the lesion. Steroid administration started on Post-Operative Day 9 (POD#9) and was tapered gradually. After the operation， acholic stool became normal and biochemical parameters，\n\n【8】T. Bilirubin： Total Bilirubin； D.

The results from POD#15 were as follows： TB 4.97 mg/dL； DB 2.76 mg/dL； AST219 IU/L； ALT 313 IU/L； ALP 257 IU/L； and GGT 467 IU/L. She was discharged and prescribed Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA) and multivitamins. However， after 2 months， her stool became acholic again and her biochemical parameters worsened， despite being on the usual supportive therapy， involving UDCA. Laboratory tests revealed the following results： TB 8.60 mg/dL； DB 5.10 mg/dL； AST 786IU/L； and ALT 845 IU/L. An oral omega-3 PUFAs agent， Omacor(omega-3 acid ethyl ester 90； Kuhnil Pharmacy Co.，Cheonan， Korea；840 mg， comprising EPA-ethyl ester (460 mg) and DHA-ethyl ester(380 mg) per 1-g capsule) was administered， starting on POD#77at 500 mg， four times per day. After this treatment， the stool color returned to normal， the jaundice disappeared， and the biochemical parameters improved. The final laboratory tests， after 5 months of the omega-3 PUFAs treatment， revealed the following results： TB 1.40mg/dL； DB 0.85 mg/dL； AST 199 IU/L； and ALT 178 IU/L . Since then， she has been treated with omega-3 PUFAs and UDCA.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Biliary atresia is a progressive fibro-inflammatory disease of the extrahepatic biliary tree that presents with biliary obstruction. Kasai operation， to correct the biliary obstructions， should be completed within 8 weeks of birth to improve the long-term prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. However， Kasai operation for biliary atresia is not a definite cure； it serves as temporary treatment that allows time for future liver transplantation. As liver transplantation in children with biliary atresia is more successful after 2 years of age， it is necessary to delay the liver transplantation to increase the rate of success 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【13】Steroid and UDCA treatments following the Kasai operation have been used traditionally； however， this method is limited for删除1换行improving the prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-9]</u>.\n\n【14】Recently， there have been attempts to use Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy， instead of steroid treatment， but the results have not been successful 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. IVIG is theoretically a therapeutic agent with several advantages (e.g.， suppressing the ongoing injury of the intrahepatic bile ducts， delaying the progression of biliary cirrhosis， and maximizing bile excretion by reducing anastomosis inflammation after operation 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> or reducing immune-mediated bile duct injury by modulating the immune system 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>). Lately， the concept of early diagnosis of biliary atresia and early initiation of IVIG therapy， with less tissue damage， has emerged 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. However， this warrants further studies. The level of TB within the first three months after the Kasai operation is valuable to predict the outcome of the first two years of life 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Infants with biliary atresia who achieved a TB of <2.0 mg/dL， within 3 months of the Kasai operation， showed a significantly reduced risk of complications of progressive liver disease， liver transplantation， or death by 2 years of age. This notion could be changed with omega-3 PUFAs， which might have a more potent choleretic effect than UDCA.\n\n【15】Omega-3 PUFAs have multiple functions， including anti-inflammatory effects. In addition， omega-3 PUFAs have shown to resolve cholestasis in several diseases， including IFALD， but the mechanism is unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2，13]</u>. However， they improved bile flow in an animal model 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. In a previous case reports， omega-3 PUFAs showed the possibilityofactingas a potent choleretic agent in children with interlobular bile duct paucity and inspissated bile syndrome通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. There are some mechanisms that could be considered. In one study， it was postulated that omega-3 PUFAs may induce the D-site binding protein and X-receptor alpha， which upregulates cholesterol7-a hydroxylase， the enzyme in bile acid production and cholesterol删除1换行excretion 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. In another study， it was suggested that the hepatic induction of bile acid synthesis in mice with fish oil through sterol27-hydroxylase (Cyp27a1) may upregulate the expression ofbile acid transporters in the liver and intestines 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【16】There are reports that state the use of omega-3 PUFAs did not prevent the progression of fibrosis in IFALD 通用删除6(英):<u>[21</u>； some experts underrated the benefits of omega-3 PUFAs by claiming this. However， we think that even though omega-3 PUFAs cannot prevent the progression of fibrosis in biliary atresia， they can improve bile flow， delaying hepatocyte injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Delayed hepatocyte injury can delay liver transplantation to a more appropriate age， and in turn， it can increase the possibility of a successful liver transplant.\n\n【17】In this case， we improved cholestasis，clinically and biochemically， in an infant with biliary atresia after Kasai operation， through the administration of omega-3 PUFAs. We do not expect omega-3PUFAs to cure biliary atresia. However， we postulate that omega-3PUFAs， acting as supportive therapeutic agents， can effectively delay the need for liver transplantation. This treatment should be better regarded， given that the results of liver transplantation in patients over 2 years old are superior to those below this age 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The primary lesion is a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon. Microscopic tumor thrombus from a colorectal cancer is quite rare compared to a tumor thrombus arising from a primary Hepatocellular carcinoma. Prognosis of patients having such tumor thrombus from a primary colorectal cancer is still unknown， but the primary surgical management is still liver resection with resection of tumor thrombus.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Macroscopic portal vein tumor thrombus are usually seen in patients with primaryhepatocellular carcinoma with an incidence rate of 22.5% on the other hand macroscopic portal vein tumor thrombus arising from a primary colorectal carcinoma is quite rare with an incidence of 2.8% and no case has yet to be reported in our country 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-2]</u>. In this paper we present a case of a patient diagnosed to have mucinous adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon with a macroscopic portal vein thrombus on left portal vein positive for metastatic tumor cells.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】This is a case of S.W. a 30/F who was referred to our institution due to multiple liver masses on segments 7， 8 4 and 5 seen thru whole abdominal CT scan. Her history started around december2012 when the patient suddenly experienced abdominal pain crampy in character not relieved by pain medications， not related to food intake radiating to right lower quadrant， she then consulted a local hospital in their province， initial assessment during this time was ruptured appendicitis. The patient then underwent explore laparotomy， intra operatively appendix was noted to be congested， but there was an incidental finding of mid ascending colon mass， hence underwent right hemicolectomy. Histopathology report of the mass showed a mucinous adenocarcinoma， eight of thirteen lymph nodes positive for tumor. Further work ups were done， whole abdominal CT scan was done and showed multiple masses on Segments 7，8，4 and 5 of the liver，largest on segment 711.6x 1.5 x 1.5， segment 81.2x 1.1x 1.5， segment 40.9 x0.8 x 1.0， segment 50.9x0.7 x0.6. Patient was then referred to a medical oncologist and was started on oxaliplatin and xeloda. On repeat CT scan， initially the liver masses responded to the treatment， but on surveillance CT scan done January2015， there was a note of recurrence of the liver masses hence was referred to our institution.\n\n【6】On admission， repeat triphasic whole abdominal CT scan was done which showed hyperdense mass in segment 6 and 7 of right lobe and a hypodense mass in segment 6 measuring 4.1 x5.1x3.8cm with associated dilatation of intrahepatic ducts in segments 6 and 7. Liver ultrasound was also done which showed a solid heterogenous mass in segment 8 measuring approximately 6.4 x 6.0x 5.4 cm. The mass has invaded and occluded the right portal vein. Patient then underwent right hemihepatectomy with excision of nodules at segments 2 and 3 and left portal vein thrombectomy. Intraoperatively there was a note of a 7 cm mass on segment 5 encroaching the right portal vein， tumor thrombus noted at left portal vein and 1 cm nodules noted at segments 2 and 3 .\n\n【7】Post-operative histopathology\n\n【8】1. Right lobe： metastatic Colonic adenocarcinoma moderately differentiated with mucinous features，resection margin negative for tumor.\n\n【9】2. Positive for tumor thrombus Potral vein.\n\n【10】3. Left portal thrombus -positive for tumor (metastatic)\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Tumor thrombus in the portal vein is common in patients having hepatocellular carcinoma. Tumor thrombus in the portal vein is seen in 64% of patients having HCCA. However metastatic lesions in the liver derived from colorectal cancer rarely invade the portal vein macroscopically， it is more associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Colorectal liver metastases are usually accompanied by microscopic tumor invasion into the intrahepatic portal vein and incidence of macroscopic tumor thrombus in the portal vein is rare.\n\n【13】Microscopic tumor invasion into the intrahepatic portal vein is detected in 20% of cases of liver metastases from colorectal cancer however for macroscopic tumor thrombus in portal vein is only 2.8%.\n\n【14】In this paper we present a rare case of colorectal liver metastasis with portal vein tumor thrombus. As mentioned in a recent study done by Yamamoto et al 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> most reported cases of portal vein tumor thrombus from colorectal cancerhad concomitant metastatic nodules in the liver parenchyma as seen in this patient.

However， there is still a problem with rotation. A large degree of rotation results in the recurrence of astigmatism and decreased visual acuity. Rotation can be treated with relocation； however，rotation may recur.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 26-year-old man presented to our clinic complaining of decreased visual acuity in his left eye. He had undergone TICL implantation in his left eye， and experienced spontaneous TICL rotation five times and underwent relocation five times to correct it at another clinic. The Uncorrected Visual Acuity (UDVA) was 20/100， the manifest refraction (MR) was +2.0D -3.0D x 150°， and the TICL was rotated 52°. In our clinic， he underwent TICL explantation， followed by implantation of a Spherical ICL (SICL) combined with astigmatic keratotomies， requiring 4.1 mm and 2.8 mm incisions. Three months postoperatively， the UDVA was 20/18，and the MR was-0.25D-0.25Dx170°.\n\n【3】Conclusion： The combined implantation of an SICL with astigmatic keratotomy after TICL explantation is a safe effective treatment for recurrent astigmatism due to TICL rotation.\n\n【4】Keywords： ICL； Toric ICL； Rotation\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】The Visian Toric Implantable Collamer Lens (TICL) (STAAR Surgical， Nidau， Switzerland) is safe， stable， and effective for correcting myopic astigmatism but there is still a potential problem with rotation 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. The position of the TICL in the eye is stable with an average rotation angle of3.39±2.36°， but there are reports of decreased vision due to spontaneous rotation of the TICL more than 30° 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. Repeated rotation after relocation to treat TICL rotation has also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. There is another option for correcting myopic astigmatism： Implantation of a Spherical ICL (SICL) combined with an astigmatic keratotomy. This combined surgery has shown good results in terms of astigmatic correction and improved visual acuity 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-9]</u>.\n\n【7】We present a patient who had five episodes of recurrent astigmatism due to TICL rotation despite relocations to correct it. He underwent TICL explantation， followed by implantation of an SICL with simultaneous astigmatic keratotomy.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 26-year-old man presented to our clinic because of decreased vision in his left eye due to astigmatism that recurred repeatedly after TICL implantation performed elsewhere. He had undergone SICL implantation in the right eye and TICL implantation in the left eye 5 years previously. In the 5 years after the surgery， he underwent five TICL relocations to correct five recurrences of astigmatism in his left eye. The first TICL rotation occurred about 1 year after the surgery， and the subsequent rotations occurred after 9 months，9 months， 1 week， and 3 months； each relocation was performed at the clinic where the TICL had been implanted. According to the patient's medical records， the Manifest Refraction (MR) of the left eye was -6.0D -2.5D×176°\n\n【10】In the ocular examination performedin1our clinic， the Uncorrected Distance Visual Acuity (UDVA) was 20/18 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left and his Corrected Distance Visual Acuity(CDVA) was 20/18 in both eyes. The MRs were +0.25D -0.25D×25°and +2.0D-3.0D×150° in the right and the left eyes， respectively. The删除1换行respective keratometry readings were K1 44.75D ×11°/K2 45.25D x 101° and K1 43.25Dx180°/K2 45.75D ×90°. In the left eye， the Intraocular Pressure (IOP) was 18 mmHg， the vault was 0.63 mm， and the Endothelial Cell Density (ECD) was 2907 cells/mm. Slit-lamp microscopy revealed three small incision scars at 10：30，12：30， and 1 o'clock and onelarge incision scar from 1：30 to 3 o'clock on the peripheral cornea； the TICL was rotated 52°counterclockwise from the horizontal meridian .\n\n【11】All surgeries were performed under topical anesthesia by the same surgeon (KBK). Explantation of the TICL was performed first. A peripheral corneal incision was made with a 2.8 mmkeratome at 12o'clock. After the haptics were dislocated with an intraocular spatula， the TICL was extracted through the incision. On ocular examination1 month after explantation， the following were measured： MR-6.0D-2.5D× 180°， keratometry reading K1 43.5Dx2°/K2 45.5D×92°， IOP 15 mmHg， ECD 2924 cells/mm， Anterior Chamber (AC) depth3.62 mm， and horizontal white-to-white diameter 11.3 mm.\n\n【12】A combined SICL implantation and astigmatic keratotomy were performed 6 weeks after the TICL explantation. After marking corneal incisions at 12 and 6 o'cock， a 7.5 mm diameter ring was marked . The main incision was made at 12 o'clock with a 2.8 mm keratome approximately 0.75 mm outside the ring . After inserting an Ophthalmic Viscoelastic Device (OVD) into the AC， a model V5 SICL was inserted， and four footplates were placed between the crystalline lens and iris and rotated horizontally. An additional incision was made at 6 o’clock with a 2.8mm keratome approximately 0.75 mm outside the ring . Two incisions were made in a single plane， and the incision tunnel length was about 1.0 mm. After removing the OVD，the main incision was widened with a 4.1 mm keratome . After confirming that the incisions had not leaked with a Merocel sponge ， the operation was completed. The SICL had a diameter of 12.1 mm with a refractive power of -8.0D. The expected spherical equivalent was -0.35 D.\n\n【13】On postoperative day 1， the UDVA was 20/20， MR 0-1.0D×80°， keratometry reading K1 43.0D × 70°/K2 44.25D×160°，IOP14 mmHg， vault 0.48 mm， and ECD 2924 cells/mm. Three months postoperatively，the UDVAand CDVA were 20/18， MR-0.25D-0.25D x170°，keratometry reading K1 44.0D×170/K2 44.5Dx80°，IOP14mmHg， vault 0.53 mm， and ECD 2849 cells/mm². Two incision scars were observed at 12 and 6 o'clock with slit-lamp microscopy . The angles to the anterior corneal surface were 35°and 36°， with an 1154 um main incision and 1163 um additional incision. Both these incisions were longer and had lower angles than the previous incision for ICL insertion. Endothelial misalignment was observed in both incisions but was more prevalent in the main incision .\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Rotation in the cylinder axis of morethan 30° is enough to decrease the optical effect of a TICL 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>. Postoperative TICL rotation is related to several factors， including intraoperative misalignment during TICL implantation and a low vault caused by an undersized ICL 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. However， according to the medical records， the astigmatism was nearly zero immediately after the initial surgery， and the vault was 0.63 mm， which was estimated to be sufficient. TICL rotation is also correlated with the diameter and structure of the ciliary sulcus-to-sulcus 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. If the TICL rotates for this reason， re-rotation occurs in the same direction and degree despite relocation. Zhang et al.\n\n【16】Therefore， we decided to implant an SICL combined with an astigmatic keratotomy after TICL removal. When the patient presented to our clinic， the TICL was rotated by 52° from the horizontal meridian and the MR was +2.0D -3.0D × 150°. After TICL removal， the MR was -6.75D-2.5D×180°， while it was 0.25D-0.25Dx170°3 months after the combined SICL implantation and astigmatic keratotomy.\n\n【17】Astigmatic keratotomy， consisting of corneal relaxing incisions at the steep meridian， is effective for reducing astigmatism 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Because a corneal incision is required for ICL implantation， if the position， length， width， number， and so forth of the corneal incision are adjusted in the same way as for an astigmatic keratotomy， good refractive results can be obtained with an SICL. Kamiya et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> reported that patients with an average with-the-rule astigmatism of0.69 ±0.73D before surgery had an average astigmatism of 0.21 ±0.27D after an SICL was inserted using a 3.0 mm superior corneal incision. Sekundo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> reported that a 6.0 mm main incision and opposite partial thickness limbal relaxing incision during iris-claw intraocular lens implantation resulted in an average decrease in astigmatism of 2.2D. In our case， 2.25D astigmatism was reduced through 4.1 mm and 2.8 mm corneal incisions， and the UDVA was20/18 at 3 months postoperatively.\n\n【18】We used a single-plane incision with a relatively long tunnel. Compared to a tri-planar incision， a single-plane incision is more effective at correcting astigmatism because the anterior cornea slides more easily to the posterior cornea in the incisional plane 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>. A long-beveled incision is more prone to corneal sliding than a short perpendicular incision 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. In our case， the two astigmatic删除1换行keratotomy incisions had longer tunnels than the existing corneal incisions， and sliding was more prevalent than with the previous main incision .\n\n【19】In conclusion， we report a patient who experienced recurrent astigmatism due to TICL rotation despite relocation. This patient was successfully treated with combined SICL implantation and astigmatic keratotomy after TICL explantation. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first report ofthis surgical technique.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Left sided are the most common， comprising 75% of all reported cases. Most patients describe a history of chronic intermittent colicky abdominal pain but can also present acutely with a small bowel obstruction.\n\n【8】Diagnosis is often delayed and difficult due to the intermittent herniation and egress of bowel， a low index of suspicion and non-diagnostic imaging. As a result， many patients proceed to the operating room for exploration due to continued symptoms without a formal diagnosis and a majority undergo open exploration 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Due to the rarity of this condition， there is no consensus regarding standard of care for the surgical treatment of these hernias. Few cases with laparoscopic repair have been described but we report a successful laparoscopic repair of a left sided paraduodenal hernia with a modified technique involving plication of the hernia sac along with a literature review to establish the feasibility of a laparoscopic approach for repair of these hernias.\n\n【9】A 36 year old female presented with a one year history of intermittent crampy abdominal pain that resulted in several visits to the emergency department. The episodes were associated with nausea and non-bilious vomiting but she denied any history suggestive of strangulation. All删除1换行imaging studies done during these episodes over a period of several years were non-diagnostic except for one CT scan with oral contrast which revealed a large internal hernia to the left of the duodenum under the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV)， consistent with a left sided paraduodenal hernia . The patient subsequently presented to us and was taken to the operating room after a thorough discussion. A diagnostic laparoscopy confirmed the diagnosis and revealed a large paraduodenal hernia with a majority of her small bowel herniating posterior to the proximal IMV， lateral to the ligament of Treitz，into a hernia sac posterior to the descending colon . Several adhesive bands tethering the bowel to the hernia sac were noted and divided. The hernia was completely reduced following which the leaflets of the hernia sac (posterior aspect of the left colonic mesentery and the retroperitoneal tissues) were approximated with interrupted silk sutures. The mouth of the hernia defect just lateral to the IMV was subsequently closed with interrupted sutures using an Endostitch device. Patient tolerated the procedure without complications and was discharged on postoperative day 3 on a regular diet. The patient continues to do well without any evidence of recurrence at 24 month follow up.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】In this study， we report the diagnosis and successful laparoscopic repair of a left sided paraduodenal hernia with plication of the hernia sac as an added deterrence to future recurrence and seroma formation. A literature review is also done to demonstrate the efficacy of a laparoscopic approach for repair of these hernias.\n\n【12】Small bowel internal hernias account for almost 1% of all cases删除1换行of intestinal obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>， of which 50% are either due to left orright sided paraduodenal hernias 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-4]</u>. These typically arise in the fetal life due to malrotation of the midgut and left sided are the most common， comprising 75% of all cases， in which the small bowel prolapses through the Landzert’s fossa， a congenital opening present in approximately 2% of people 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，6，7]</u>. This opening is a peritoneal fold formed by the inferior mesenteric vein and the ascending left colic artery. In contrast， right sided paraduodenal hernias are formed by prolapse of the small bowel through the Waldeyer’s fossa， a small aperture behind the superior mesenteric artery and 3 or 4h portion of the duodenum 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. This opening is congenitally found in less than 1%of people and compared to left sided hernias， the right sided hernias are often larger and more tethered 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，5]</u>.\n\n【13】Paraduodenalhernias do nothave a typical presentation and most ofthe patients present with vague symptoms of intermittent episodic abdominal pain， nausea and vomiting which makes diagnosis difficult as was the case with our patient. A minority present to the emergency room with signs and symptoms of acute small bowel obstruction. Upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through or CT scans may reveal an oval hernia sac or a cluster of small bowel loops posterolateral to the duodenum， as it did with our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. However， these imaging modalities are typically non diagnostic either due to being done during a period of non-herniation or due to the presence of very subtle imaging findings which are easily overlooked. This was evident in our case by the numerous non-diagnostic imaging studies and the patient remaining undiagnosed for more than a year. Of note，the patient had a normal CT scan the dayprior to her surgery while intraoperatively， a majority of her small bowel was found to be herniated which further exemplifies the intermittent nature of this disease and underscores the difficulty in radiologic diagnosis. A high index of suspicion and review of the imaging studies with an experienced radiologist is paramount for the diagnosis of this disease.\n\n【14】Most patients are diagnosed in the operating room upon surgical exploration and as a result have an open procedure as is the norm for a majority of small bowel obstructions operated on， in an acute setting in USA. We had diagnosed the left sided paraduodenal hernia preoperatively due to a combination of her symptoms， radiologic imaging and a high index of suspicion. We accomplished a successful laparoscopic repair despite the presence of significant adhesions to the hernia sac and having herniated a majority of her small bowel. Due to the lack of national guidelines and best practices for treatment of this disease which is a reflection of the rarity of the disease， in addition to reducing the hernia， we decided to approximate the leaflets of the hernia sac (posterior aspect of the left colonic mesentery and the retroperitoneal tissues) and close the mouth of the hernia defect laparoscopically with interrupted sutures to further decrease the chance of a recurrence and a seroma， which has not been done before. The patient continues to not have a recurrence at 24 months but in the absence oflarger studies with longer follow up， the best approach to these rare hernias will likely continue to remain uncertain.\n\n【15】Literature review\n\n【16】A thoroughliterature review was done using Pubmed and Medline databases looking for laparoscopic paraduodenal hernia repairs to evaluate its frequency and efficacy and to try to find best practice guidelines for their surgical repair. No randomized trials exist for this condition so level one recommendation cannot be made， however， few case reports that do exist 通用删除6(英):<u>[8-21]</u> have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of a laparoscopic approach for both left and right sided删除表格换行paraduodenal hernias . Twenty threelaparoscopic cases in18 publications between 1998 and 2014 have been reported， of which fourteen patients (61%) were left sided hernias. The mean age of diagnosis was 44 years and 53% patients were female. The symptoms at diagnosis were reported in all but two publications (89%) and when reported， the symptoms included abdominal pain (81%)， nausea and vomiting (62%)， constipation/obstipation (19%)， bowel obstruction upon presentation (12%) and an asymptomatic incidental mass(6%). The chronicity of the symptoms was not specifically addressed in all publications but 25% of cases were reported to have chronic symptoms (Range： Two months to six years).\n\n【17】Table 1： Published case reports and limited case series reporting laparoscopic repair of paraduodenal hernias.\n\n| Authors  | Year  | # of Patients  | Age of pt  | Sex  | L or R side  | Hospital Los(D)  | Closure  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Uematsu 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>  | 1998  | 1  | 44Yo  | M  | Left  | Unknown  | Unknown  |\n| Brunner 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>  | 2004  | 1  | 60Yo  | M  | Right  | 14  | Intracorporeal stitch  |\n| Antedominico 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>  | 2004  | 1  | 24Yo  | F  | Right  | 3  | Unknown  |\n| Fukunaga 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>  | 2004  | 1  | 51Yo  | M  | Left  |  | Endostitch  |\n| Moon 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>  | 2006  | 1  | 18Yo  | M  | Left  | 1  | Intracorporeal stitch  |\n| Dassinger 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>  | 2007  | 1  | 13Yo  | M  | Right  | Unknown  | Unknown  |\n| Shoji 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>  | 2007  | 1  | 60Yo  | M  | Left  |  | Intracorporeal stitch  |\n| Jeong 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>  | 2008  | 2  | 52 and 58 Yo  | F and M  | Left  | 5  | Intracorporeal stitch  |\n| Palanivelu 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>  | 2008  | 4  | Unknown  | F and M  | 3) Left /通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Right  | 1-5 days  | Intracorporeal stitch  |\n| Poultsides 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>  | 2009  | 1  | 67Yo  | F  | Left  | Unknown  | Unknown  |\n| Uchiyama 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>  | 2009  | 1  | 80Yo  | F  | Left  | 7  | NO  |\n| Bittner 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>  | 2010  | 1  | 26 Yo  | F  | Right  | 1  | Defect not Closed  |\n| Khalaieleh 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>  | 2010  | 1  | 53Yo  | F  | Left  | 3  | Intracorporeal stitch  |\n| Nam 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>  | 2012  | 2  | 12 Yo and 3 Months  | F and M  | Left  | 4 and 5  | Intracorporeal stitch  |\n| Hussein 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>  | 2012  | 1  | 59 Yo  | F  | Left  | 3  | Intracorporeal stitch  |\n| Eradas 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>  | 2013  | 1  | 32 Yo  | F  | Right  | 4  | Intracorporeal stitch  |\n\n【19】In allcases (100%) including ours， bowel was reduced laparoscopically with adhesions being taken sharply. The details of operative closure were mentioned in 78% of the publications. Of the ones that reported operative details， most patients (92%) had the mouth of the hernia defect closed with a permanent suture using either an Endostitch device (only one patient) or intracorporeal suturing (most patients) while in two patients (8%) the defect was not closed. Most cases were successfully repaired laparoscopically with no reported cases of conversion to an open procedure in the literature， regardless of the acuity of presentation or the presence of small bowel obstruction which is likely due to the proximal nature of the obstruction with these hernias. Only one case (4%) had to be converted to an open procedure in the current literature via an upper midline laparotomy 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.

This is the first reported case with this technique modification， however， its efficacy in avoiding future seroma， recurrence and other complications will likely never be able to be objectively assessed due to the rarity of this condition. While a randomized trial would be ideally required to determine the best approach and technique for repair， the rarity of these hernias makes that unlikely.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】Paraduodenal hernias account for 50% of all cases of internal hernias associated with small bowel obstruction. A high index of suspicion is needed for diagnosis due to the intermittent nature of the herniation， vague symptomatology and lack of sensitive diagnostic tests. Laparoscopic repair is associated with good outcomes in the limited numbers of published case reports.

However， its side effects have seldom been mentioned. Hereby we report an impressive case of post-operative hemorrhage， which were probably caused by miss-chosen and mal-positioned CSD system. Meanwhile， invasion of vertebral venous plexus should also be taken into consideration when unexpected hemorrhage happened. After adjusting the type and position of the CSD system， this patient healed without any complication.\n\n【2】Keywords： Closed suction drain； Post-operative hemorrhage； Cervical surgery\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Closed Suction Drain (CSD)， a medical drainage system consisting of an internal drain tube that connected to a pre-vacuumed container or grenade-shaped bulb， is commonly used as a direct and effective method to achieve evacuation of liquids or debris from cavities or wounds in surgical procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Generally，CSD has been a routine procedure in orthopedics practices 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. However， seldom studies have recognized the possible hazardous consequence bought by this technique. Recently， our institution confronted a case of unexpected post-operative iatrogenic hemorrhage caused by CSD system.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 50-year old female patient was admitted to our institution with a diagnosis of atlantoaxial dislocation and paraplegia on basis of conventional physical examination， CT scan， and MRI. She accepted posterior cervical surgery soon after. A posterior reduction of atlantoaxial dislocation and internal fixation with rod-and-screw system was then performed as described before 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> . Both sides of vertebral venous plexus were invaded when placing the C1 lateral mass screw， and led to profuse bleeding， which was stopped by pressing and stuffing with gel-foam. Prior to closure， any existing bleeding was stanched with bipolar cautery， and the wound was irrigated copiously with saline to clean away all the debris， blood and devitalized tissue. A pre vacuumed closed wound drainage system (Medinorm， Germany) was applied to avoid problems caused by potential bleeding and no vacuum suction was used before closure. The wound was then conventionally closed by intradermal suture after obtaining a dry wound. To our surprise， a profuse and rapid blood flow into the drainage container occurred right after the tube was connected to the 600 ml pre-vacuumed container and filled up to more than 200 ml in 60 sec. The vacuum suction was terminated immediately and incision was re-opened to the surgical field. However， no active bleeding could be found. The tip of drainage tube was found right point to the left side of invaded venous plexus. The drainage tube was then repositioned to keep away from both sides of venous plexus and gel-foam area， and incision was closed as above. A French JP drain was used instead. Finally， no more sustained blood loss occurred. The drainage tube was removed 48 h after surgery and the incision healed without any problem. No more complaint during the 10 months postoperatively.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\nAs described by Dougherty and Simmons， CSD mainly shows its values in reducing wound hematoma and post-operative edema， which would help to decrease the morbidity of infection and external contamination 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Nevertheless， side effects， such as multiple intracranial hemorrhages due to the over-drainage of cerebrospinal fluid 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， increased total blood loss and higher homologous blood transfusion rate 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>， should also be given enough significance during daily applications. Hence， the application of CSD could be a potential risk for post-operative blood loss. In our case，|删除段之间换行|3%通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Post-operative hematoma can be resulted from either patient-or surgical-related factors. Among those， the injury of venous plexus is a predisposing element. With its thin and fragile wall， venous plexus is vulnerable even to blunt traction. In addition， lack of valve deteriorates the local hemostasis and leads to disastrous hemorrhage eventually. The reported number of incidence and mortality of pre-sacral venous plexus injury were 9.4% and 4.3%， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. Various hemostasis techniques have been introduced to clinical practice， including package of glue (gel-foam， fibril collagen， surgical and bone wax)， thumbtacks and coagulation. However， unexpected blood loss in certain structures still takes places 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. The invasion of vertebral venous plexus is another important factor contributing to post-operative hemorrhage in our current case . The vertebral venous plexus， accompanying with deep cervical veins and anterior internal vertebral venous plexus， is a composition of vertebral venous system. Its initial portion starts from the atlanto-occipital space and connects with the anterior internal vertebral venous plexus in the manner of an intervertebral vein 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. To our knowledge， neither clinical research nor case report could be found to convincingly clarify the occurrence or treatment of post-operative hemorrhage caused by this venous plexus system. This may result in deficient understanding to many spine surgeons and inevitably leads to unconscious damage as well as inadequate treatment. Summary， we present a new view of the merits of CSD system， which is not only for the prevention of post-operative hematoma，but also accompanying by accidental stimulation of iatrogenic hemorrhage. Mal-positioned drainage tube and miss-chosen aspiration system are two significant considerations. Besides， to master the local anatomy also should be kept in mind for orthopedic surgeon. We believe that improvements of above will benefit both orthopedic surgeon and patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We report a case with lumbar vertebra MS admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University in June 2022. This patient hospitalized at local hospital several times. After receiving medication， his symptoms had worsened. MRI examination shows the symptom was caused by the tumor compressing the nerve root. After surgical treatment， the patient’s pain symptoms had improved significantly. The patient discharged 5 days after surgery. The patient has been living normally so far.\n\n【2】Keywords： Melanocytic Schwannoma； Lumbar vertebra； Epidural\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】MS is very rare， which was first reported by WG Millar in 1932， accounting for less than 1%of the total number of schwannomas 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. A cytogenetic analysis related to MS showed that the karyotype of the tumor cell was diploid with obvious chromosome aberration， mainly showing trisomy of chromosome 6 and ring of chromosome 11. The long arm (6p) gain of chromosome6 and the short arm (11q) gain of chromosome 11 are common genetic features of malignant melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Compared with MS， the common schwannoma is mainly the loss of genetic material on chromosome 22， which leads to the inactivation of NF2 allele 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， while the abnormality of chromosome 6 and 11 has not been found in cases with traditional schwannoma. Therefore， MShas also been considered as a separate melanoma in recent years， which is different from a schwannoma previously considered.\n\n【5】MS is common in young and middle-aged people， with a median age of 38 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. There is no significant difference in the incidence of MS among different genders. MS originated from neural crest， which is a kind of cells with differentiation potential of melanocytes and nerve sheath cells at the same time. It is common in spinal nerve roots and sympathetic ganglia， cervicothoracic segment， and other parts such as skin and soft tissue of head and neck， digestive tract， cervix and retroperitoneum have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Its clinical manifestations are nonspecific， mainly manifested as shoulder， neck， waist and back pain. MS is mainly caused by tumor stimulating spinal nerve root， and sensory and functional disturbance of corresponding segments occurs when spinal cord is compressed， which is similar to compression symptoms caused by disc herniation or other space-occupying lesions in spinal canal.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\nThe patient， a 56-year-old male， was admitted to the hospital with aggravation ofright lower limb numbness and pain for more than 1 year and 15 days. The patient suffered from right lower limb numbness and pain without obvious inducement 1 year ago， which was aggravated after activities and could be relieved after rest. However， no attention was paid to the disease at that time. In the last half a month， the patient felt that her symptoms had worsened and her pain was unbearable at night (VAS score： 7 points). The lumbar enhanced MRI scan of local hospital hinted that： L5-S1posterior intravertebral canal mass on the right side， considering neurogenic tumor. The patient came to our hospital for further treatment. The physical examination hinted that： Cranial nerve tests were negative， normal muscle force and muscle strength， pathological signs were negative， Achilles tendon reflexes were normal， right Straight leg lifting test was positive， with significant pain with slight numbness on the lateral side of the right calf and the dorsum of the foot. The lumbar enhanced MRI scan of our hospital demonstrated that： Hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2  on the right side of the spinal canal at the level of the L5 vertebra，|删除段之间换行|with significant enhancement ， the size of about 3.5 cm ×1.7 cm， enlargement intervertebral foramen， which is closely related to the right L5 nerve root， with dumbbell-like change. Lumbar spine CT scan showed that： strip-like shadow of soft tissue density on the right side of the vertebral canal at the level of L5 vertebral body， The vertebral body is deformed due to compression. X-ray of lumbar hyperextension and flexion showed that： No lumbar instability. Complete preoperative examination was improved； after eliminating surgical contraindications， surgery was performed under general anesthesia. During surgery， C-arm fluoroscopy located the L5 and S1 vertebra， 3 cm posterior median straight incision， paravertebral muscles were separated， L5 spinous process and vertebral body were exposed， L5 spinous process was removed. By grinding drill， milling cutter was used to remove L5 lamina and expose Dural sac. Exploration and investigation showed that the tumor was located outside the spinal dura mater， with clear boundary， complete capsule and black surface， extending to L5 and S1 intervertebral foramen. Under the surgical microscope， black viscous tissue was found in the capsule， which was tarry . Rapid pathology during the operation suggested melanoma. First of all， most of the tumor\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Total surgical resection is recognized as an effective means to treat MS at present， and radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be supplemented after total resection. Currently， it is difficult to predict the prognosis of this disease. By retrospectively analyzing40 cases， a literature pointed out that the recurrence rate in situ is35% and the metastasis rate is 44%通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. According to the reports of a few recurrent patients at home and abroad， it is speculated that the recurrence， metastasis and malignant transformation of the disease may be related to tumor residue， morphological heterogeneity and infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Therefore， during the operation， the surgeon should try his best to cut the tumor completely and decompress it fully on the premise of protecting the peripheral blood vessels， spinal cord and删除1换行nerves. There is no unified conclusion on adjuvant treatment except surgery. It has been reported that radiotherapy has certain effects on tumor treatment and prevention of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>， which provides some basis for the follow-up treatment of patients after operation. Italiano reported a case without radical surgery in 2011. The patient found tumor recurrence two months after operation， and after chemotherapy， the tumor progression was delayed to a certain extent通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【10】Plain and enhanced MRI scan plays an important role in preoperative diagnosis； CT examination can understand the invasion of tumor to vertebral body and whether the intervertebral foramen area is enlarged， which is helpful for the formulation of surgical plan. The MRI features of MS are complicated， which is related to the different location and content of melanocytes in the tumor. The paramagnetic radical of melanin in cells can reduce the relaxation time of T1 and T2 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， namely short T1 and short T2. According to the melanocyte content in tumor and T1 and T2 manifestations of MRI， foreign scholars divided MS into four types： Melanin type， non-melanin type， mixed type and hemorrhagic type， most of which are melanin type in clinical practice 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. The histological features of common melanin type are >10% melanocytes in lesions， and MRI features are short T1， short T2， that is， high signal intensity in T1 and low signal intensity in T2， which are mostlyround， oval or dumbbell-shaped. Enhanced examination can indicate mild， moderate or obvious enhancement.\n\n【11】The diagnosis of MS mainly depends on microscope， electron microscope observation and immunohistochemistry.Microscopically， MS showed epithelioid， spindle-shaped cells arranged in bundle， wheel or interweaving， which were similar to Antoni A area of schwannoma. The nucleus was round or oval， with obvious nucleoli and unusual mitosis. If obvious atypia， more division and necrosis infiltrated surrounding tissues were found， malignancy should be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Fontana-Masson melanin silver staining was positive and PAS staining was negative in tumor cells. Under electron microscope， macrophages rich in mature melanin bodies were scattered， and a large number of glycogen granules were deposited in the nucleus. In ultrastructure， continuous basement membrane，long-spaced collagen fibers and other Schwann cells were found， and some of them contained melanin bodies 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In immunohistochemistry， most patients showed positive S-100， HMB-45，Melan-A， Leu-7 and NSE detection results. Tumors may be accompanied by hemorrhage， cystic degeneration， necrosis， calcification and sandy bodies. MS can be distinguished from primary or metastatic melanoma， melanoma， pigmented neurofibroma and cellular blue nevus according to their microstructure and immunohistochemistry.\n\n【12】In conclusion， MS is a potentially malignant tumor， and its etiology， treatment and prognosis are unclear， which remains to be further studied. At present， the only recognized effective treatment删除1换行is total surgical resection. Radiotherapy can play a certain role in preventing recurrence after operation and patients without total tumor resection during operation. Due to the high recurrence rate and metastasis rate of this disease， regular follow-up and reexamination play an important role in understanding the disease condition， determining the treatment plan and evaluating the prognosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The main ectopic site is the proximal gastrointestinal tract. The majority ofectopic pancreas is asymptomatic， whereas some subjects cause diseases such as bleeding and luminal obstruction. The distal bowel obstruction caused by ectopic pancreas is rarely reported. Herein， we reported a newborn presented with distal bowel obstruction complicating bowel gangrene 31 h after delivery. Surgical resection cured this disease.\n\n【2】Keywords： Ectopic pancreas； Intestinal obstruction； Neonate\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Ectopic Pancreas (EP) is pancreatic tissue which is not anatomically connected to the primary pancreas. It is commonly found in the upper gastro intestinal tract and the Meckel's diverticulum. EP has also been reported in other locations such as the gallbladder， the biliary tree， the mesentery and even the fallopian tubes 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Almost all patients are asymptomatic， although some rare complications such as bleeding， intussusception， and ectopic pancreatitis have been observed 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The prevalence of ectopic pancreas ranges from 0.55% to 13.7% in autopsy series 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Symptomatic ectopic pancreas has rarely been reported in neonates according to our literature review. Here we present a rare case with intraluminal bowel obstruction， caused by ectopic pancreas in the ileum after birth.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A full-term female newborn that had undergone uneventful prenatal examinations was transferred to our department at31-h old after experiencingbilious vomiting. Aphysicalexamination upon arrival revealed mild distention of her abdomen which was otherwise soft without tenderness. Hypoactive bowel sounds were recorded. She had passed meconium within 24 h after birth with the laboratory data showing unremarkable findings. There was continuous bilious drainage from the nasogastric tube. A KUB X-ray revealed dilated small bowel loops compatible with mechanical ileus . An emergent abdominal CT scan showed no evidence of volvulus. A follow-up KUB taken 24 h later showed persistent ileus. A pediatric surgeon was consulted and an exploratory laparotomy was performed to investigate further the unknown etiology of mechanical obstruction.\n\n【7】The operation revealed an intraluminal mass measuring 1.2 cm occupying most of the lumen in the terminal ileum located about 10 cm from the ileocecal valve. The adiacent sections of the small bowel exhibited poor perfusion. The mass lesion and ischemic bowel (25 cm in length) were resected， and primary small bowel anastomosis was performed. The pathology report a lobulated mass composed of variable-sized ducts， which is compatible with ectopic pancreas .

Its prevalence is approximately 0.54% in children，according to a recent retrospective study carried out in a single center 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Two prevailing pathogenetic mechanisms have beenproposed to explain the development ofectopic pancreatic tissue. One is that fragments of pancreatic tissues separate from the developing pancreas during the rotation of the foregut， and the other is that the pancreatic metaplasia forms from multipotent stem cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The Gaspar-Fuentes modified classification identifies four types of ectopic pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>： Type I is typical pancreatic tissue， with ducts， acinar cells and islet cells， and is similar to the normal pancreas； Type II (the canalicular variety) contains pancreatic ducts only； Type III (the exocrine pancreas) contains acinar tissue only； and Type IV (the endocrine pancreas) contains islet cells only. CT scans have shown that acinus-dominant lesions exhibited an enhancement similar or greater to that of the orthotopic pancreas， whereas duct-dominant lesions were shown to be hypovascular with fewer enhancements 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.

We present a remarkable case of neuropsychiatric SLE， and provide advice on steps in the diagnostic process of this disease.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 59-year old male patient of Moroccan origin was admitted because of loss of appetite and body weight， and dehydration. His medical history included arthritis of a knee (1.5 years ago)，type 2diabetes，hypertension and a depression. He did not smoke. Laboratory analyses yielded an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate， microcytic anemia，leucopenia and mild elevation of liver enzymes. He did not use medication toxic for the liver. Blood cultures were negative， as were serology and polymerase chain reaction for viral hepatitis， infectious mononucleosis， and HIV. An interferon gamma release assay for tuberculosis (Elispot) was negative. Chest and abdominal CT-can showed no malignancy or lymphadenopathy. No abnormalities were found at gastroduodenoscopy with biopsy.\n\n【6】We considered an auto-immune disease with liver involvement as one of the differential diagnoses， and found a positive anti-ds DNA test (147 iU/mL)， which pointed towards Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Additional laboratory tests were performed . On patient's request， further management was done as an outpatient. One month later， four months after the start of his illness， he presented with an acute state of confusion， hallucinations and muscle weakness. Physical examination revealed apathy， hypertonia and a tremor in the face and right arm. The anti-dsDNA titre was higher than before (169 iU/mL). A brain CT and MRI showed a specific white matter hyperintensities. The Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) contained an elevated protein concentration (1.26 g/L， normal value <0.80 g/L) without leucocytosis (4/uL). Infectious encephalitis was ruled out by negative PCR testing on CSF for several neurotropic viruses， and negative cultures. Borrelia serology was negative. An Electro-Encephalogram (EEG) showed signs of diffuse encephalopathy. Serum paraneoplastic antibodies were absent. A chest CT scan， performed because of persistent tachypnea， showed hilar node enlargement and a consolidation in the left lower lobe with pleural effusion. The pleural fluid was an exudate with negative cultures. SLE was diagnosed based on the clinical symptoms  and exclusion of other diagnoses He was treated with methylprednisolone 1000 mg/day intravenously for 3 days， followed by oral prednisone 60 mg/day and cyclophosphamide as induction treatment. His mental and physical state improved substantially over the first 3 days. Currently， he is treated with low dose prednisone and hydroxychloroquine and his illness is in remission.\n\n|  | Clinical criteria  | This case  | Reference values  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Acute cutaneous lupus  |  |  |\n|  | Lupus malarrash  |  |  |\n|  | Bullous lupus rash  |  |  |\n|  | Toxicoepidermal necrolysis  |  |  |\n|  | Maculopapular lupus rash  |  |  |\n|  | Fotosensitive lupus rash  |  |  |\n| 2  | Chronic cutaneous lupus  |  |  |\n|  | Classic discoid rash  |  |  |\n|  | Hypertrophic lupus  |  |  |\n|  | Lupus panniculitis  |  |  |\n|  | Mucosal lupus  |  |  |\n|  | Lupus erythematasus tumidus  |  |  |\n|  | Chillblains lupus  |  |  |\n| 3  | Oral or nasalulcers  |  |  |\n| 4  | Alopecia  |  |  |\n| 5  | Synovitis of ≥ 2 jaints， or pain in ≥ 2 joints with ≥ 30 min morning stiffness  |  |  |\n| 6  | Serositis  |  |  |\n|  | Pleuritis  |  |  |\n|  | Pericarditis  |  |  |\n| 7  | Renal disorder  |  |  |\n|  | ≥ 500 mg urine protein/24 h  |  |  |\n|  | Red bloodcell casts  |  |  |\n| 8  | Neurologic  |  |  |\n|  | Seizures  |  |  |\n|  | Psychosis  |  |  |\n|  | Mononeuritis multiplex  |  |  |\n|  | Myelitis  |  |  |\n|  | Peripheral or cranial neuropathy  |  |  |\n|  | Acute confusional state  |  |  |\n| 9  | Hem olytic anemia  |  |  |\n| 10  | Leukopenia <4.0 10%L  | 1.1x10L  | 3.0-10.0x10/  |\n|  | Lymphopenia <1.0 10L  | 0.1x10%L  | 0.8-3.7x109L  |\n| 11  | Thrombocytopenia <100 10/L  |  |  |\n|  | Immunologic criteria  |  |  |\n| 1  | Anti-nuclear antibodies  | Positive  | Negative  |\n| 2  | Anti-ds DNA antibodies  | 169  | ≤15iU/mL  |\n| 3  | Anti-Sm antibodies  |  |  |\n| 4  | Antiphospholipid antibodies  |  |  |\n|  | Positive lupus anticoagulant  | Negative  | Negative  |\n|  | False positive test for syphilis  | Negative  | Negative  |\n|  | Anticardialipin antibadies (IgA， IgM of lgG)  | IgG：24  | <10 GPL-U/mL  |\n|  | Anticardialipin antibadies (IgA， IgM of lgG)  | IgM： 28  | <10 MPL-U/mL  |\n|  | Anti-beta 2 glycopratein1 (IgA， IgM of lgG)  | lgG：6，7  | <71/ml  |\n|  | Anti-beta 2 glycopratein1 (IgA， IgM of lgG)  | IgM： 13  | <7U/mL  |\n| 5.  | Low complement  |  |  |\n|  | Low C3  | 0.77  | 0.90-2.05 g/L  |\n|  | Low C4  | 0.06  | 0.15-0.45 g/L  |\n|  | Low CH50  |  |  |\n| 6.  | Direct Coombs test without hemolysis  |  |  |\n\n【8】Table 2： Neurapsychiatric SLE symptoms according ta the American Callege of Rheumatology 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【9】Central nervous system\n\n| Aseptic meningitis  |\n| --- |\n| Cerebrovascular disease  |\n| Demyelinisation syndrome  |\n| Headache (including migraine en benigne intracranial hypertension)  |\n| Movement disorder (chorea)  |\n| Myelopathy  |\n| Epileptic insults  |\n| Acute consfusional state  |\n| Anxiety disorder  |\n| Cagnitive dysfunction  |\n| Mood disorder  |\n| Psychosis  |\n| Peripheral nervous system  |\n| Acute inflammatory demyelinating ppolyradiculoneurapathy (Guillain-Barre syndrome)  |\n| Autonomic dysfunction  |\n| Mononeuropathy/multiple mononeuropathy  |\n| Myasthenia gravis  |\n| Cranial nerve dysfunction  |\n| Plexopathy  |\n\n【11】Polyneuropathy\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】ThetypicalSLEpatientis a 15 to 50 year's old female withcutaneous manifestations.

Table 2 presents all possible cerebral SLE manifestations. Cerebral involvement early in the disease process is uncommon， especially for a male patient aged 59 years. In the work-up of a clinical presentation with cerebral symptoms， one should therefore exclude an electrolyte/metabolic disturbance， acidosis， uremia， and infection； including a lumbare puncture to exclude punctureto exclude encephalitis or meningitis. An intoxication or psychiatric illness should also be considered. If these examinations do not lead to a diagnosis， an EEG and cerebral MRI are indicated to exclude demyelination， thromboembolic process。or ischemicevent. Neuropsychiatric SLE should be considered at this stage. The SystemicLupusInternational Collaborating ClinicCsS(SLICC) classification criteria are not diagnostic， but may guide further examinations. There is not a single test， or combination of tests， which proves or rejects the diagnosis neuropsychiatric SLE with sufficient certainty. For example， a recent Chinese study found that34% of patients with neuropsychiatric SLE did not have any abnormalities on an MRI of the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The presence of specific antibodies in the liquor makes the diagnosis neuropsychiatric SLE more likely. Besides antiphospholipid antibodies， previous studies found anti-ribosomal1P， anti-neuronaland1：anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies to be present in patients with neuropsychiatric SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. However， the cornerstone in the diagnostic process remains anamnesis and physical examination. Excluding differential diagnoses is crucial In our patient， anticardiolipin antibodies删除1换行were present. Antiphospholipid antibodies are detected in 20% to 30% of patients with SLE， especially those with neuropsychiatric involvement. Their presence gives an absolute yearly risk of thrombosis of about 5%通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is defined as repeatedly detected antiphospholipid antibodies， and thrombotic manifestations. In the absence of thrombosis， the diagnosis APS was not made in our patient. SLE patients have a 3 times higher risk of premature death compared to the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Most important causes of death are end-stage renal failure and infections， potentially partly due to nephrotoxic medication and immunosuppressants.

However， relapses occur in up to 50% of patients通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】This case shows that neuropsychiatric SLE should be considered if a patient presents with inexplicable neurologic symptoms， even if the patient does not fit the typical SLE profile (i.e. young female with cutaneous manifestations).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "b9cb9393-917b-47aa-8c85-5dacc142b7d1", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Loneliness is a commonly seen in individuals of all ages these days. Its growing ration in elderly is very huge as there are fewer opportunities of interaction and activities in daily routines. This makes them more prone to remain alone. Especially these cases come from nursing homes， even there is lot of people living together. Due to issues， life circumstances the increase in loneliness can also be witnessed. The paper shares a case study and overall encounter of an elderly resident at a community nursing home for elderly care. The paper will give you concept of what are the major connections where elderly are vulnerable to this very common problem. Theoretical concepts integrating to the client’s case will help to know the basic reasons and needs that make attachment and interaction with other people difficult. There are potential interventions shared which can make it possible to bring a change. Many of these relate to the case scenario， where these were actually implemented as well. However， it is a difficult concept and tasks for care takers but it is possible to be resolved with suggested directions and strategies.\n\n【2】Keywords： Loneliness； Elderly； Nursing home； Care\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Loneliness is an apparent hardship of social contact， or absence of ability to share social and enthusiastic encounters. It may prompt physical and emotional illness related results and it is one of the fundamental elements prompting sadness and suicide among elderly people 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Many word meaning compositions， literally describe Loneliness as a feeling developed because of having no company， or living solitary 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The feeling is similar and common among all age groups and has variations in risk factors and results across life span. In this paper we focus on elderly as it relates the case scenario we encountered in a nursing home during our mental health clinical few weeks back. The scenario apparently describes presence of loneliness in an older male adult residing at a nursing home.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】The case study is of a 69 years old male with partial blindness post to cataract and has weakness in lower limbs. Separated from family， wife is in another nursing home and son is a drug addict. Because he was alone he was kept in the nursing home. He is alone and doesn’t interact， on asking him relevant details he shared that because of physical issues he can’t walk and can’t see so what is the use of interaction. He is disappointed because of what happened in his life and he prefers death on living. He used to sit all the time at the room alone and lonely. His interaction was poor with other residents and most of the time it is even lesser with the staff of nursing home. With passage of time there is increase in his alone presence at his room， as noticed and shared by other residents and staff.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Loneliness was identified in elderly was relating to poor mental alteration， disappointment with family and social connections. As age increases， the chance of loneliness also increases. Such misfortunes may obstruct the upkeep or obtaining of wanted connections， bringing about higher occurrence of loneliness. Numerous individuals encounter depression either because of living alone， absence of close family ties， diminished associations with their way of life of beginning or powerlessness to effectively take an interest in the neighborhood network exercises. At the point when this happens in mix with physical disablement， unsettling and sorrow are normal backups通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Presence of perceived loneliness contributed strongly to the effect of depression. The elderly regularly experience and feel alone and isolated. Situational factors like separation， moving to new删除1换行area， separation or passing of companion (death)， low confidence， absence of fearlessness brings loneliness and ultimately depression. It impacts physical and psychological well-being 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【9】It may incorporate the risk of deep sorrow and suicide， cardiovascular sickness， expanded feeling of anxiety， poor sense of leadership，addiction， drug use syndrome or Alzheimer’s 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. A recent Pakistani literature highlighted that lack of social interaction in elderly and increased loneliness is common at community level where we have issues with elderly in homes， hospice or nursing residences 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Long term residents at elderly homes are more prone to loneliness as they are frustrated of the routines that are strictly followed and have nothing innovative to improve their motivations 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，5]</u>. It was highly seen in researches that elderly living in nursing homes suggested by themselves that loneliness is also becoming a common component of their later is because the care givers or nurses lack sensitivity of connecting themselves to us and they really need to understand the real significance of social needs for elderly along with basic care 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【10】It was logically suggested through a clinical experience of working with elderly in community that facilities are comparatively less and challenges are high in terms of improving elderly loneliness and enhancing their social wellbeing 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Thus on other hand Pakistan was highlighted as a state of opportunities for elderly that need to be looked own despite of its high challenging environment for elderly通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【11】Theoretical Relation\n\n【12】Attachment theory was the foundation for an influential psychological theory of loneliness developed by the sociologist Robert S. Weiss. Weiss identified six social needs that， if unmet， contribute to feelings of loneliness. Those needs are attachment， social integration， nurturance， reassurance of worth， sense of reliable alliance， and guidance in stressful situations. As would be predicted by attachment theory， Weiss maintained that friendships complement but do not substitute for a close， intimate relationship with a partner in staving off loneliness 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【13】Integrating the concepts of theory with client's status I can relate that there were issues of attachment as he was physiologically not coping to become part of the circle. Socially nonintegrated as he feels others are mentally retarded and I can't join them. Sense of reliability was missing because of improper environment of the nursing home thus creating worthless sense for client. Nurturance highlighted from patient’s attitude of isolation reflecting his pre morbid personality. As a nurse we played our role in guiding him about the stressful situations.\n\n【14】Strategies and Interventions\n\n【15】Interventions are decided on individual need bases. As the elderly we were caring had visual impairment and walking difficulty. We read the newspaper for him and he felt better and gave positive response. In addition， we involved him in activities that require less standing so that he feels less pain in legs. As nursing students we were the witness of his situation and become advocate for him. We suggested his involvement with other elderly residents as well and encourage bringing him out of the room. An example for this kind of involvement would be playing chess. As playing chess will improve neuronal firing so elderly can prevent dementia， it requires sitting on chairs， and residents can participate with partial vision where require need nurse/nursing student can tell the position of the chess items.\n\n【16】Also few more examples will include Poetry or singing activities so that they can listen and participate and inclusion is promoted and loneliness in decreased. Bubble tub activities where all elderly can sit together and put feet in bubble tub so they can enjoy， interact and have pain free feet. Activities those promote sensory involvement like touching cards， smelling perfumes or viewing beautiful scenes of nature etc. Group laughter therapy with assistance is one of the good strategies for the elderly peoples to engage them with other peoples in senior citizens home. It improves the muscle strength and provides relaxation and decrease anxiety to prevent loneliness 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【17】Elderly residing in nursing homes are occupied of human crowd but their personality and nature resists them of jiving with other residents or staff that is why befriending is unclear as an effective step in elderly loneliness. However， most common evidenced based and tested strategies around many nations includes working on education， health assessment and social support circle development for improving episodes of inclusion in elderly and preventing loneliness 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【18】Recommendations\n\n【19】On individual level please don't judge elderly， support them， and improve nursing care and daily interaction with them. Take name of client so she/he feels familiar and involved and this reflects respect an inclusion thus giving sense of value and connectedness. On a group level work to create activities where all elderly can work together in a single group and support each other， create a system of group therapy so eating， dining， talking， working and leisure all would be in group and they feel less alone. Institutional level is a key level for promoting good education of nurses and care givers that directly affects elderly experiences at the nursing home. The institution must provide the infrastructure of nursing home that promote inclusion and social interaction like shared rooms and responsibilities， changing roles and leadership of elderly， inclusion of activities in groups using individual and group capacities of the residents.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】The right to live and the right of inclusion is universal and thus elderly cherish the same. Residents in nursing homes are promoting to feel out of these rights like other individuals living in hospice care， homes or in community. As nurses and direct caregivers， we should work on preventing loneliness in elderly through our own capacity building", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

He was referred to secondary care for further evaluation and management. Blood test confirmed deranged hyperbilirubinemia of 262 (Direct 217)， Alkaline Phosphatase 386， ALT 267， AST 132.\n\n【6】Abdominal ultrasound showed thickened walls of the gallbladder with a calculus suggestive of cholecystitis.

Bad news can be defined as a cognitive， behavioral， or emotional deficit in the person receiving the news that persists for some time after the news is delivered. The delivery of bad news is a subjective topic， and it is difficult to anticipate a particular impact on each patient and their families because patients respond differently to bad news； studies showed that patients diagnosed with cancer could react to the bad news with shock， fright， tWacceptance，sadness， or not worried. Also， the language barrier can result in a misunderstanding and contribute to distress after delivering bad news. Physician training represents a crucial element of breaking bad news， and the lack of proper delivery can negatively impact the patient and their families and the subsequent treatment plans. Despite the enormous amount of information available about breaking bad news， many peer-reviewed published studies showed a lack of adequate training in communicating bad news to the patients and their families. The functional decline at the end of life is significantly different between patients diagnosed with cancer and other advanced organ diseases.Patients diagnosed with terminal stage cancer may experience various physical and psychiatric symptoms that can negatively affect their awareness about the progression of the disease and their prognosis. We reported a case diagnosed with advanced-stage colon cancer at the time of admission to the hospital， which results in a negative impact on patient behavior and perception.\n\n【12】Discussion.Ann Clin Case Rep.删除11:<u> 2021； 6：1937.

Her vital signs were within the normal limit. Fecal occult blood was positive； hemoglobin level was 6 mg/dl； other complete blood count parameters were normal. Carcinoembryonic antigen was elevated. Further workup revealed metastatic lesions in theliver andlung from adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. Hematology/Oncology specialists were consulted and decided the patient will not benefit from curative therapy as her Karnofsky scale was 30 and advised for palliative care. A long discussion was conducted with the patient about her diagnosis and prognosis， and the patient decided to go for home hospice. The next day， the patient returned to the hospital because she删除1换行had a mechanical fall not complicated by injury. The physical exam was normal， and her lab results were not changed compared to the previous results. The patient was admitted for observation. During her stay at the hospital， she inquired about the reason for her fall and asked if it could be related to the side effect of chemotherapy. The patient claimed that she received chemotherapy at our hospital. We had a lengthy discussion with her， and the treating physicians explained that she is not eligible for chemotherapy； however， the patient insisted that she got chemotherapy at our hospital， and she is due for the next cycle of chemotherapy. A psychiatric specialist was consulted and screened her for depression or hallucination， no need for psychiatric intervention as she is not experiencing any psychiatric issues， and her behavior probably due to the denial of her diagnosis. Unfortunately，\n\n【16】The patient died on the same day from cardiac arrest.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Advanced cancer patients commonly have misunderstandings about the intentions of treatment and their overall prognosis. Several studies have shown that large numbers of patients receiving palliative care hold unrealistic hopes of their cancer being cured by such therapies. This review aimed to explore the factors associated with patients developing unrealistic expectations； the implications of having unrealistic hopes and the effects of raising patients awareness about prognosis， and patients and caregivers perspectives on disclosure and their preferences for communication styles. This could be due to doctors reluctance to disclose terminal prognosis or using facts and logic to distance themselves from the patient，and the patient’s ability to process or accept such information 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-10]</u>. The major factors have profound effects on patients' comprehension of the presented information including Patients barriers and communication style 通用删除6(英):<u>[11-14]</u>. Barriers were classified into four subgroups： structural and physical (inadequate access to care and public transportation)， supportive (lack of support， resources and technology， and less access to healthcare)， or culture barriers(language differences， illness beliefs， and low levels of cancer care knowledge). The proper approach to communicating the information can clarify the patient's confusion about the diagnosis， treatment plan， or prognosis. The patient and family-centered approach are more reliable to communicate information about patient condition， in this approach， the physician focus on and respect the values and needs of the patient and their support system including cultural， spiritual， and religious belief， besides， inpatient and family-based approach， the patient is involved in the discussion about the goals of care， this is in contrasts with the emotional centered approach in which the physician focus on the sadness of the information by demonstrating excessive sympathy. Early palliative care improves patients quality of life，less end-of-life treatment，and decreased medical costs； also，early palliative care reduces depressive disorder and improves outcomes in a cancer patient. Early palliative care improves the quality of life of the patient's family and ameliorates end-of-life care aggressiveness. Palliative care， unlike hospice， can be used simultaneously with disease-modifying or curative therapies. This is in contrast to hospice， which is a model of palliative care offered to patients at the end oflife when life-prolonging Therapy is no longer indicated.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】Earlier referral to hospice for advanced cancer patients is highly recommended because this approach is associated with fewer hospitalizations and visits to emergency departments and lessens the need for invasive， aggressive treatment at the end of life. Although physicians often feel challenged by the need to deliver difficult prognostic information to patients， especially for those with a life-limiting illness， while at the same time support their hopes， the use of patient and their family-centered approach is more reliable to reduce the negative psychiatric impact of the unwanted news， as such approach is more aligned with patient's values and wishes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We present a case of a patient who underwent hypothermia post-cardiac arrest and had absent EEG reactivity even 3 weeks after cardiac arrest， but had good neurological outcome at discharge.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Our consensus on prognosis after cardiac arrest is based upon data from pre-HACA era and include absence of pupillary or corneal reflex on day 3， bilateral extensor posturing or absent motor responses on day 3， clinical myoclonic status epilepticus within 24 hours， serum neuron-spicific enolase greater than 33 ug/L on days 1-3 and SSEPs showing bilateral absent N20 responses 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. However， based upon studies done after hypothermia-era we have data to support that motor examination 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>， serum neuron-specific-enolase 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>，early myoclonus 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>and pupillary or corneal通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> cannot provide fool-proof prognostication in HACA patients. The same studies have provided support for absence of EEG reactivity as an additional marker for poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. We present a case of a patient who underwent hypothermia after an out of hospital cardiac arrest， went into myoclonic status epilepticus andhad absence of EEG reactivity，but had good neurological outcome.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 67 year old man collapsed inside the car was found to be in cardiac arrest when the EMS arrives and was defibrillated seven times at the scene， during transport， and in the ED with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after 33 minutes of resuscitation. He underwent therapeutic hypothermia， initiated within 6 hours after ROSC and controlled rewarming was done after 24hours. The patient had reactive pupils immediately post resuscitation. On day 6， after discontinuation of sedation， the patient remained unresponsive EEG showed background suppression with generalized slowing but no epileptiform activity. SSEPs showed bilateral cortical responses. On day7， myoclonic jerking of the face and arms were noted intermittently.Keppra was started without any improvement. Myoclonus increased in frequency， intermittently responding to lorazepam. Repeat EEG showed rhythmic polyspike and wave consistent with status epilepticus， accompanied with facial myoclonus. MRI of the brain showed only subtle T2/FLAIR hyperintensityalong caudate and bifrontal cortical ribbon.\n\n【6】The patient was transferred to the neuro-ICU and EEG monitoring was started for burst suppression therapy with midazolam which was switched to pentobarbital infusion Pentobarbital was successfully weaned after 15 days and AEDwas were tapered.\n\n【7】The patient remained comatose 3 weeks after resolution of status epilepticus with subsequent EEG showing no reactivity to auditory ortactile stimuli. On day 60，repeat EEG showed reappearance of posterior dominant rhythm with reactivity and presence of sleep activity during sleep state. Eye opening was noted with verbal stimulation but no regard and no volitional movement was noted. On day 64， the patient was noted to track and answer yes and no with head nodding. Next day， he was consistently following commands and was able to mouth words. The patient was discharged on day 70 to sub-acute rehabilitation facility， with ability to communicate and move his extremities purposefully.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Absence of patient's spontaneous circulation for 33 minutes was sufficient enough to cause diffuse brain injury. The patient developed myoclonic status epilepticus after 7 days of the sentinel event In addition to being in status for over 2 weeks thereafter， patient's EEG did not show any reactivity to auditory or tactile stimuli.\n\n【10】Patient’s myoclonic status (even though not early) and absent EEG reactivity predicted poor prognosis on one hand， the presence of bilateral N20s on SSEP clouded our judgment regarding prognosis on the other. However， patient's significant recovery at the time of discharge showed that further studies are indicated to find better prognostic signs in anoxic brain injury patients who undergo therapeutic hypothermia. Recent studies have already successfully disputed conventional markers of prognosis in the hypothermia-era通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>.

It is subdivided into primary and secondary， which is a manifestation of other underlying pathologies or stressors such as result of an imbalance between vasoconstriction and vasodilation. In most cases， conservative medical treatment gets good control in most cases. Thoracic sympathectomy is indicated as the last therapeutic option in refractory cases. We report a case of a 58-year-old male with digital ulcers on the left hand due to Raynaud's syndrome resistant to conservative treatment who underwent thoracic sympathectomy.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】We present the case of a 58-year-old male， smoker， with arterial hypertension and systemic sclerosis. VATS sympathectomy is indicated for secondary Raynaud's syndrome with digital ulcers on the left hand resistant to conservative treatment. We have your consent for the publication of the data. After basic monitoring， to which thermal monitoring was added in the second finger of both hands， intravenous anesthetic induction was performed with propofol 170 mg， fentanyl150 ug， and rocuronium 60 mg. A 37 Fr left double-lumen tube is inserted to use right one-lung ventilation. The patient is placed in the semi-Fowler's position with the upper limbs abducted at 90°. Anesthetic maintenance is performed with propofol 6 mg/kg/h and fentanyl 150 ug. It is accessed through a miniport in the fourth left intercostal space， the sympathetic chain is identified and it is sectioned at the level of T3. At that time， an increase in skin temperature of 1.3C was observed in the left hand (usually increasing by 1·C to 3·C)， with no changes in the right hand. Once the efficacy of the procedure had been verified， thirty minutes before surgical closure， dexamethasone 8 mg paracetamol 1 g， dexketoprofen 50 mg， and ondansetron 4 mg were administered. After reversal of the muscle block with sugammadex 150 mg， and once he regained consciousness， he was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthetic recovery unit. No perioperative incidents were recorded. The sequence of the procedure is represented in Figure 1.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery of the thoracic sympathetic nervous system is a minimally invasive technique that has shown good therapeutic results with less morbidity than more aggressive techniques. Although it has been studied mainly in primary hyperhidrosis， it has also been used in Raynaud's syndrome， facial flushing， and abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis， reflex sympathetic dystrophy or anginal syndromes.

Father was known to have a heart murmur as a child that had resolvedspontaneously.TTherewasnosignificant family history of heart disease. Maternalserologyduring pregrancy and antenatal scans were normal On examination， the child was pink， warm and well perfused with saturations of 98% on air. Heart sounds I+II were normal with a harsh ejection systolic murmur (grade 3/6)，loudest at the left sternal edge but heard throughout the precordium. Femoral pulses were palpable bilaterally with normal character. Respiratory examination was unremarkable with no signs of increased work of breathing. No respiratory distress， sweating or colour change was observed during bottle-feeding. Abdomen was soft， non-tender， no organomegaly， and bowel sounds present. As per unit protocol， the baby was observed overnight on the postnatal ward and reassessed the following morning. Failure of the murmur to resolve over a 24 hour period led to further assessments， in line with hospital guidelines， to identify the aetiology. Pre and post-ductal saturations (98% and 96% respectively) and pre and post-ductal blood pressure (78/52 mm and 97/46 mm respectively) were checked and were normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was also done and reported as normal.\n\n【11】删除13:<u>删除1:<u>Copyright @ 2016 Idowu O.

Although this would have been the recommended action， a clinical decision was made to undertake an echocardiogram in view of the character and grade of murmur， which suggested the possibility of a pathologic murmur secondary to a congenital heart defect.\n\n【13】The echocardiogram revealed normal sitils， normal atrioventricular and ventriculo- arterial connections. Atrial septum and ventricular septum were intact and arterial duct was not patent. No left ventricular outflow obstruction was noted. However， turbulence and acceleration of flow at the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) was detected， suggesting narrowing of the RVOT. The RVOT Doppler was 3.4m/sec leading to a diagnosis of moderate pulmonary stenosis.\n\n【14】Although the echocardiographic diagnosis by itself did not prompt an early review in view of the age of the child， an earlier follow up of two weeks was arranged.\n\n【15】At followup， the patient remained clinically well and asymptomatic. Saturations were 97% on air and cardiac and systemic examinationwas as before. However， repeat echocardiogram revealed that the narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract had删除1换行increased significantly with a RVOT Doppler of more than 4m/sec. Moreover， the right ventricular out flow tract was noted to be narrow and elongated with an abnormal squashed appearance . The accelerated change in the degree of stenosis combined with the unusual appearance of the RVOT，led to the patient being referred to a tertiary paediatric cardiology centre for urgent assessment.\n\n【16】Investigations\n\n【17】At the tertiary centre a repeat echocardiogram confirmed the suspicious findings and furtherurgent radiological investigations were arranged. Chest X-ray showed a prominent superior mediastinum. The CT scan revealed a single， discrete mass lesion lying in the anterior mediastinum measuring 17x20x27mm. The mass was seen to be compressing the RVOT and sub-valvar pulmonary trunk . Differential diagnosis for the mass was a thymic cyst or teratoma(although no intralesional fat or calcification was visible). MRI scan was requested for further information however， the origin of the mass was inconclusive. Neither imagining could determine whether the mass was intra or extra-cardiac in origin .\n\n【18】Treatment\n\nIn1light of theaccelerated d growthhof the mass and failure to determineits originnandprimary source， surgical exploration and excision of the tumour Was decided with patch repair of the rightventricular outflow tract|删除段之间换行|The procedure involved creating a median sternotomy in order to gain access and visualization. A subtotal thymectomy was then performed. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established between the ascending aorta and bicaval cannulation. Upon establishment， the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested with cold crystalloid cardioplegia administered via the aortic root. The RVOT was identified and the tumour completely excised using sharp dissection and diathermy. Consequently， a large defect remained in the RVOT， immediately beneath the pulmonary valve. This was repaired using a patch of bovine pericardium. Finally， the heart was de-aired and the cross clamp removed with a vent on the aortic root. The heart was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass， following rewarming， in sinus rhythm. No inotropic support was required.\n\n【20】Findings from the procedure revealed that the thymus was normal in appearance and the mass clearly arose from within the myocardium of the RVOT with the left arterial descending artery to the left and a marginal branch of the right coronary artery to the right of the mass. The tumour was noted to have a bosselated surface， to be well demarcated and closely adherent to the myocardium at the edges with no true plane between them. Histology report revealed that the mass was a cardiac fibroma.\n\n【21】Outcome and follow-up\n\n【22】Surgery was successful and on post-op review the child was fit and well. On examination he was pink and well perfused. Saturations of 98% and heart sounds I+II present with no added sounds. Echocardiogram showed good biventricular function with laminar flow in the right ventricular outflow tract. No compression was detected and there was no evidence suggestive of cardiac tumour or pericardial effusion.\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】Primary cardiac tumours within the paediatric community are rare， with a prevalence of 0.0017 to 0.02%通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. They are particularly uncommon in infancy with a handful of case reports describing them. Most of the tumours are benign with rhabdomyomas， fibromas and teratomas accounting for the majority of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【25】Due to the rarity and variability in presentation of cardiac tumours， they pose a clinical challenge to diagnose. Heart murmurs on the other hand are verycommon in children and infants (including neonates) and are often innocent or secondary to congenital heart disease. It is not usual for a diagnosis of cardiac tumour to be considered by the clinician who on auscultation discovers that a child has a heart murmur.\n\n【26】Presentation depends on the size and location of the mass rather than the histologic type as they have a tendency to produce obstruction of the inflow or outflow tracts or induce arrhythmias通用删除6(英):<u>[2-5]</u>. Cyanosis， breathlessness and ventricular arrhythmias have all been described as presenting features 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The symptoms and signs created by the cardiac tumour can also be used to clinically speculate whether it is arising from the right or left hand side ofthe heart. Right-sided cardiac tumours are likely to present with associated syncope， cyanosis， vena-cava shunt syndrome， pulmonary embolisms and/or pericardial effusions 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. On the other hand， left sided tumours are likely to result in embolisation causing transient ischaemic attacks， seizures， and/or peripheral vascular and/or cerebral vascular accidents 通用删除6(英):<u>[21</u>.删除2换行with the above mentioned symptoms as it often leads to a thorough assessment including cardiac imaging. It is a much greater challenge in the asymptomatic child where the clinical condition is unlikely to trigger prompt cardiac imaging. Worryingly， sudden death is recognized as a presenting feature suggesting that children with cardiac tumours may have no clinical clues before presenting with Lrecc catastrophic collapse. Certainly fibromas have been recognized to present with significant cardiac compromise including sudden death. A very similar， but symptomatic case (with cyanosis and progressive dyspnoea)， has been described involving an 8-month old infant with RVOT obstruction secondary to a large cardiac fibroma (5x4.5cm)通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【27】In our case， although the baby was asymptomatic，the pathologic nature of the murmur and the age at presentation prompted an early echocardiographic assessment and early diagnosis.\n\n【28】Echocardiogram， CT and MRI scans are first line in providing diagnosticCinformationforevaluation of cardiactumours. Echocardiogram allows for a dynamic， structural view of the heart aiding in identifying any masses alongside evaluating the mobility of the tumour. In addition， it allows one to view the effect that the tumour is having upon the surrounding structures 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. MRI is generally a better imaging modality than CT although both are of value. Diagnosing the type of tumour can be more reliably made with a MRI scan as the T1 and T2 weighted sequences can give clues about the microenvironment within the tumour 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，5，8-10]</u>. PET scan， coronary angiogram and transvenous biopsy are also useful diagnostic tests depending on the clinical context 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Histological diagnosis however， remains the gold standard for determining the type of tumour.\n\n【29】Fibromas are the second most common cardiac tumours in infancy but rank first in surgical series 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. They often arise within the ventricular muscle， most commonly the ventricular septum although can also arise from within the free walls of the ventricles 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Unlike rhabdomyomas， they do not spontaneously resolve 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. They can cause obstruction to blood flow， valvular dysfunction， arrhythmias， syncope and/or sudden death in 10-30% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[13-15]</u>. Of arrhythmias associated with cardiac fibromas， ventriculartachycardia accounts for50% 13. Although for many cardiac tumours， especially rhabdomyomas， watchful waiting is an acceptable management option， surgery， if needed， is usually safe and definitive 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. However， watchful waiting is not applicable to fibromas which are not known to undergo spontaneous regression 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. In fact， in the case of cardiac fibromas， surgery should be offered early because of their tendency to grow fast and cause severe haemodynamic complications. Ideally complete surgical resection with chamber reconstruction using pericardial patch should be done and this was achieved in our case. However， excellent midterm results have been achieved even with partial resection and hybrid procedures using BT shunt or bidirectional cavopulmonary connection to offload the right ventricle 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，17，18]</u>. In cases with persistent arrhythmias in the setting of a non- resectable tumour，ICD implantation may be needed. Rarely the only treatment option possible may be cardiac transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，19]</u>.\n\n【30】Learning Points\n\n【31】1. Although rare， cardiac tumours should be considered in the differential diagnosis of paediatric cases presenting with unexplained murmurs， heart failure or arrhythmia.\n\n【32】2. Once a diagnosis of a cardiac tumour is suspected prompt and thorough assessment using a variety of cardiac imaging modalities including echocardiography， CT and MRI scanning should be arranged in a tertiary cardiac centre. This is important as some of the cardiac tumours can grow rapidly with significant development of cardiac compromise and even sudden death.\n\n【33】3.

A thorough knowledge of the structure and function of the parotid region is essential in management of these injuries. We report a case of an 18-year old malewitha discharging sinus and swelling in the left parotid region with ipsilater allower motor neuron facial palsy who failed to respond to conservative management.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】We report a case of an18 year old male patient who presented to our outpatient department with a history oftrauma to the left side of face six weeks back，which he sustained after a wooden log fell from a height of about 10 feet. At that time patient had a small laceration over the left parotid region. A small piece of wood was removed from the wound site by a physician at a primary care Centre and started on oral antibiotics. Two weeks later patient started having purulent discharge from the wound . Patient developed delayed onset weakness over the lower part of face after three weeks of trauma for which a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered by the physician and subsequently referred to our Centre. Clinical examination revealed purulent discharge from the sinus with diffuse induration over left parotid region， which was extending into left side neck as well. Patient had House-Brackmann Grade III lower motor neuron facial palsy involving the buccal and marginal mandibular division of facial nerve on the left side . Oral cavity， neck and otological examination were unremarkable. MRI revealed a linear fluid distended sinus tract in left intra parotid region involving the deep and superficial lobe of parotid reaching up to skin surface. A contrast enhanced computed tomography scan (CT) was done after discussing MRI with the radiologist. CT scan revealed the possibility of a foreign body within the sinus tract .\n\n【8】Patient was then taken up for surgical exploration under general anesthesia. Modified Blair’s incision was made including the sinus tract.Intra-operatively， a piece of wood was found embedded in the parotid parenchyma and was removed into . Cavity was thoroughly irrigated with diluted antibiotic solution and wound was closed over a corrgated rubber drain. Patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged on oral antibiotics after five days . At four week follow up facial palsy had recovered completely (House Brackmann Grade I) .\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Injuries to salivary glands remain uncommon， with the number one cause being penetrating trauma. Other causes of acute injuries include blunt trauma and blast injuries. Salivary gland injuries are relatively uncommon， only a few large series exist. A great deal of experience comes from injuries sustained during World War II 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\nOptimal outcome requires early recognition with an adequate evaluation， directing proper management. Athorough history must be obtained whenever possible. Important questions include timing and nature of injury as well as other injuries. Valuable information can be gathered by determining if the patient has been able to eat删除1换行after sustaining the injury and the effect this has on the salivary tissue. Additionally， if there has been drainage from the wound， the character of this drainage can be suggestive. Examination requires inspection of the gland and surrounding structures while comparing it with the contralateral side for symmetry. Surrounding structures include overlying skin， oral mucosa， and dental structures and complete otological examination is indicated. Electroneurography and electromyography represent a more sophisticated means of|删除段之间换行|evaluation of facial nerve trauma. If degeneration of the facial nerve exceeds 90% on electroneurography and it is within a period of three weeks after the injury，surgical exploration may be indicated. After the three-week period， electromyography may be indicated to determine it a nerve is recovering 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> .删除2换行imaging study of choice for trauma to the parotid gland. Both CT coronal and axial provide the best evaluation of the bony structure. Additionally， CT can give excellent soft tissue delineation.\n\n【12】Penetrating injury to the parotid gland， in addition to involving the parenchyma of the gland， also can involve Stensen's duct or the facial nerve. The anterior border of the master muscle is an important land- mark because lacerations posterior to this can injure the duct.

The ELF-EMF is Non-Ionizing Radiation (NIR) and does not carry enough energy per quantum to ionize atoms or molecules. The ELF-EMF are generated by electrical devices and power systems (1 Hz to 300 Hz). In recent decades， exposure to ELF-EMF has emerged potential concerns on public health. Exposure to ELF-EMF has an adverse biological effect depending on the current intensity， strength of the magnetic field， and duration of exposure. Accumulated epidemiologic evidence indicates a correlation between exposure to ELF-EMF and childhood cancer incidence， Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)， and miscarriage 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Data on the effects of Extremely Low Frequency Electromagnetic Fields (ELF-EMF) on pregnancy outcomes (Condition of the fetus or newborn after termination of pregnancy， including preterm birth， stillbirth， low birth weight， miscarriage， small for gestational age， etc.) are inconclusive 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. For example， a report showed ELF-EMF has been studied as a potential risk factor for miscarriage (pregnancy loss at<20 weeks of gestation) and other adverse reproductive health outcomes. This research priority arose from reports of miscarriage and birth defect clusters among Video Display Terminal (VDT) operators in the U.S. and Canada. Although several studies have demonstrated that ELF-EMF is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes， other studies have shown no删除1换行evidence of associations 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. A recent study by Wilson reports that personal magnetic fields exposures were not associated with fertility treatment outcomes or pregnancy outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Prematurity or small for gestational age is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity in developed countries， and also increase the risk of chronic diseases in adult life. Both are multifactorial phenomena associated with fetal， maternal， placental and environmental factors， and though several risk factors are now well known，the effect ofELF-EMF on it remains unidentified 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In this context， we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of ELF-EMF on pregnancy outcomes and provide evidence-based medicine evidence on the need for epidemiological research.\n\n【10】Methods\n\n【11】Search strategy\n\n【12】删除3:<u>We searched PubMed， Embase， Cochrane Library and Web of Science from inception to March 10h， 2021 using the following searchterms： (\"Electromagnetic waves\" OR \"Electromagnetic Wave\" OR \"Wave， Electromagnetic\"OR \"Waves， Electromagnetic\"OR \"Electromagnetic Energy\" OR \"Electromagnetic Energies\" OR\"Energies， Electromagnetic\" OR \"Energy， Electromagnetic\" OR\"Radiation， Electromagnetic\"OR\"electromagnetic radiation[mesh]\") AND (“maternal\"， pregnancy[mesh]\"OR “pregnant\" OR\"pregnancies\"OR \"gestation\"OR \"pregnancy\") AND (\"Abnormality， Congenital\" OR \"Congenital Abnormality OR Deformities OR Deformity OR \"Congenital Defects\"OR \"Congenital Defect\" OR“Defect， Congenital\" OR \"Defects， Congenital\" OR\"Abnormalities， Congenital\"OR \"Birth Defects\" OR “Birth Defect\"OR“Defect， Birth\" OR \"Fetal Malformations\"OR \"Fetal Malformation\"OR“Malformation， Fetal\"OR\"Fetal Anomalies\"OR\"Anomaly， Fetal\"OR\"Fetal Anomaly\"OR\"abortion\"OR\"stillbirth\"OR \"chorioamnionitis\"OR \"congenital anomalies\" OR\"microcephaly\"OR \"neonatal death\"OR \"neonatal infection\" OR \"preterm birth\" OR \"low birth weight\"OR \"maternal death\" OR \"small for gestational age\" OR “outcome\"OR \"complication\"OR \"Congenital Abnormalities[mesh]\").

It may be associated with neurodegenerative diseases， specifically Alzheimer’s disease； however， limited evidence was found to suggest that ELF EMFs are associated with several types of cancer， CVD， and reproductive outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Many research studies regarding the impact of low frequency electromagnetic fields on residents living close to very high voltage overhead power lines were carried out. A review study has shown that childhood leukemia is associated with exposure to magnetic field. Many other studies suggest the role of this exposure and the increased risk of birth defect. In addition， the results from some studies have indicated that exposure to magnetic field may be associated with the increased risk of adverse birth outcomes such as low birth weight and miscarriages. Some studies， however， did not find a statistically significant increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight in relation to exposure to electro-magnetic field during pregnancy reproductive outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Most residents living in close proximity to overhead power lines are more concerned about the outcome of their pregnancy. The scientific evidence for other outcomes of pregnancy such as preterm birth is quite weak. A total of 7 studies were included for meta-quantitative analysis. Miscarriage， stillbirth， birth defects， and preterm birth were included in the analysis as bad pregnancy outcomes. there was no statistically significant between the exposed group and the non-exposed group. Birth defects， preterm births， miscarriages and stillbirths were analyzed separately， and no statistically significant differences were found. The results showed that there was no statisticaly significant in pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women who lived near electromagnetic fields compared with those who lived far away from magnetic fields. We conducted subgroup analyses by European region and non-European region. The results suggest that different regions may be one of the sources of its heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the删除1换行source of heterogeneity in combined effect sizes for bad pregnancy outcomes is KG Blaasaas 2004. Sensitivity analysis showed that the KG Blaasaas 2004 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> study had a greater impact on the heterogeneity of combined studies. However， after careful evaluation， there was no sufficient reason to exclude this literature study， so it was included. The limitations in this study are listed as follows. First， the definition of magnetic field exposure was not consistent across studies included in the meta-analysis. Second， the distance assessment method used is not completely consistent. Third， birth defects are also defined differently， for example， Elisabeth Robert 1993 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> and Nathalie Auger 2019 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> have a more comprehensive description of birth defects. While Manoochehr Mahram 2013 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> only mentioned congenital malformations. The population of birth defects included in the original literature may vary， which may have some impact on the pooled results. Due to the small number of included studies， the publication bias ofthe studies could not be fully evaluated. In addition， most of the maternal and neonatal conditions are not clearly recorded in the literature， so it is impossible to explore confounding factors such as birth defects and preterm birth through multivariate analysis ofother influencing factors of pregnant women. Electromagnetic field exposure is flowing everywhere， and wherever there are wires， motors and electronic equipment， electromagnetic fields are generated. This is one of the reasons why it is difficult to assess the effects of electromagnetic fields on human health. For research consistency， this study pooled mainly electromagnetic exposures to residential high-voltage lines. Eventually， larger sample size and higher quality studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms ofthese magnetic fields. Although there is no direct evidence from the current study that ELF-EMF has an effect on pregnancy outcomes， studies， empirical observations， and patient reports clearly indicate interactions between EMF exposure and health problems. On the one hand， there删除1换行is strong evidence that long-term exposure to certain EMFs is a risk factor for diseases such as certain cancers， Alzheimer's disease， and male infertility. On the other hand， the Emerging Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EHS) is more and more recognized by health authorities， disability administrators and case workers， politicians， as well as courts of law. It is very important to take the individual susceptibility into account. The primary method of treatment should mainly focus on the prevention or reduction of EMF exposure， that is， reducing or eliminating all sources of high EMF exposure at home and at the workplace. The reduction of EMF exposure should also be extended to public spaces such as schools， hospitals，public transport， and libraries to enable persons with EHS an unhindered use (accessibility measure). At the same time， individuals should strengthen their physique and maintain homeostasis in order to increase their ability to resist disease and thus resist the bad effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【30】Table 1 evaluates the cohort studies using the coding manual for cohort study. The quality of the included articles was evaluated from ten aspects in the following table. The total score of the coding manual is 10 points.

The results showed that there was no statistically significant between the two groups. There was no significant increase in bad pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women who lived near electromagnetic fields compared with those who lived far away from magnetic fields .\n\n【35】Birth defect： A total of 4 studies were included. P<0.00001， I=99%， A random effects model was used. Total effect Z=0.85， P=0.39，[RR=1.29，95% CI (0.72，2.33)]. The results showed that there was no statistically significant between the two groups.

Even though the slight elevation in biochemical markers， 23I metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy confirmed the abnormal uptake in the right adrenal gland， the patient was submitted to laparoscopic adrenalectomy.

Pheochromocytomas are usually suggested by paroxysmal symptoms such as headache， sweating， palpitation and hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Although sporadic pheochromocytomas are most common， there is a growing incidence of genetically driven cases possibly secondary to widespread availability of genetic testing in some parts of the world通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.

Here we report a case of 17-mm in the largest dimension pheochromocytoma detected byI-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy without significant excessive production of catecholamines. Postoperatively，her blood pressure was well controlled with half the number of antihypertensives and paroxysmal hypertension disappeared.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A. 77-year-old woman was referred to a local hospital for investigation of sudden and striking blood pressure elevations. She had 17-year history of hypertension well controlled with several antihypertensive agents， but she became to have recent symptom of paroxysmal hypertension. On first visit， a screening abdominal computed tomography (CT) with 1-mm thin slices revealed a 17 x 9 mm sized homogeneous mass with soft tissue density (approximately 30-40 Hounsfield units) in right adrenal gland . Biochemical tests revealed that plasma norepinephrine concentration was slightly elevated (824 pg/ml)， however， the levels were not within the threshold range suggested for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma  通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Plasma renin activity， plasma aldosterone concentration and adrenocorticotrophic hormone were all in normal range. Additionally， plasma cortisol was under 1.00 ug/dL after low dose (1 mg) dexamethasone overnight suppression test. Six months later， a follow-up anatomic test coupled with biochemical measurements (plasma catecholamines and urine fractionated metanephrines) were performed. An abdominal CT demonstrated that the tumor size was no change. Biochemical tests showed that plasma norepinephrine concentration (976 pg/ml) and urinary normetanephrine excretion(713 ug/gCre) were modestly high . Although the elevation of biochemical markers for pheochromocytoma was slight， the patient still had the symptom of paroxysmal hypertension， a functional imaging was performed. The 1\"I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (\"I-MIBG) planar image showed abnormal uptake in the right adrenal gland indicating that the tumor was a potential pheocormosytoma. Then， she was admitted to our hospital for further evaluation for possible pheocormosytoma. During testing at hospitalization， she had the paroxysmal hypertension. Plasma catecholamine levels were within normal limits， whereas 24-hour urinary excretion rates删除1换行of norepinephrine， VMA and normetanephrine were higher than upper limits of normal rang， especially the urinary norepinephrine excretion elevated to more than three times the normal value . On the basis of the symptom， the positive 123I-MIBG scintigraphy and the significant elevation of biochemical markers， the patient was subjected to laparoscopic right adrenalectomy. Postoperative pathologic findings confirmed pheochromocytoma . Histologically， well demarcated area was detected within the adrenal medulla. The region was composed of adrenal medullar cells with clear/eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in zellballen pattern . Immunohistochemically， the tumor cells stained positive for Chromogranin A . The tumor cells exhibited a low Ki-67 index . Postoperatively， her plasma cathecolamine levels were all in normal range. She remained free from symptom of paroxysmal hypertension even though she still11needed antihypertensive agents to control her hypertension.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Pheochromocytomas arecatecholamine-secreting tuimors arising from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. They are rare but clinically important tumors， whose failure to diagnose can result in sudden and lethal complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Based on autopsy studies，删除1换行however， many cases are probably missed than are diagnosed. At the Mayo clinic in the 50-year period 通用删除7(英):<u>(1928-1977)</u>， 40，078 autopsies were performed and pheochromocytomas were present in 54 patients. Among these patients， 13 patients were diagnosed during life， and41 patients were unsuspected autopsy findings 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. On the other hand， even among patients suspected to have a pheochromocytoma， the diagnosis is rarely confirmed 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Because pheochromocytomas can have a highly variable presentation and an overlooked clinical entity， the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas is difficult， especially when a tumor size is small. In the present case， there are several practical points related to the diagnosis and management of small pheochromocytomas. First， small pheochromocytomas did not always have excessive catecholamine production. Marlon et al showed a direct correlation between tumor size and hormone level that was independent of the clinical presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Run Yu et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> showed that most of the patient with small pheochromocytomas exhibits modestly elevated or normal biochemical marker levels， resulting in underdiagnosis. Other study showed that small tumors have slower turnover rates and release free catecholamines into the circulation that lead to hyperadrenergic symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In our case， repeated biochemical measurements of plasma catecholamines and urinary catecholamines or fractionated metanephrines yield false-negative results. Plasma norepinephrine level (976 pg/ml) and urinary excretion of fractionated metanephrines (713 ug/gCre) were modestly high (plasma fractionated metanephrines are not available in Japan)，however，the levels were not within the diagnostic threshold for pheochromocytoma. Therefore， referred to the recommended testing algorithms， pheochromocytoma should have been excluded in the present case 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Currently， there exist several guidelines based on which biochemical tests should be used to confirm or exclude a suspected pheochromocytoma， but no guideline address the importance of tumor size in the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>. Our case suggests that it is essential to pay sufficient attention to the influence of tumor size on biochemical measurments because small pheochromocytoma often exhibits modestly elevated or normal biochemical marker levels， resulting in underdiagnosis.\n\n【8】Secondly， small pheochromocytoma exhibits same suspicious删除表格换行(A，B) Hematoxylin and Easin staining.

They are important for long-term therapy requiring continuous vascular access. The use of central catheters may also be extremely helpful in the therapy of children with chronic kidney diseases， such as atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS). In the past， the treatment of this syndrome required regular supplementation of fresh frozen plasma in the chronic phase of the disease， or substitution of red blood cells during relapse and plasmapheresis application. Eculizumab registered worldwide for the treatment of aHUS is injected intravenously every 2 weeks.\n\n【2】The manuscript presents a retrospective evaluation of the use of TIVAPs in 4 children treated due to aHUS. A total number of 6 ports was used， each 4.3 ± 1.7 years of duration on average. Ten complications were reported， 30% of which included staphylococcal infections. Infections with encapsulated organisms were not recorded.\n\n【3】Conclusion： The use of vascular ports in children with aHUS seems to be safe provided that close monitoring and early detection of complications are carried out， allows to maintain repeated painless long-term access to the venous system， make available vascular preservation in patients with a significant risk for end-stage kidney disease.\n\n【4】Keywords： Totally Implanted Vascular Access devices (ports； TIVAPs)； Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome； TIVAPs complications； Eculizumab\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Totally Implantable Venous Access devices (ports； TIVAPs) are subcutaneous systems that provide permanent， easily accessible and long-term access to central veins. They are the most convenient and safest way of intravenous therapies for chronic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. TIVAP consists of two basic elements： a catheter， which is inserted into one of the central veins， usually in the area of the clavicle， neck or arm， and whose tip is placed close to the opening of the superior vena cava to the atrium. The second element is the ventricle， connected to the catheter， placed under the skin通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The ventricle is equipped with the silicone membrane， which enables multiple punctures while maintaining the system tightness. It is estimated that the membrane strength ranges from 1000 to over 2000 punctures depending on the needles used 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Contraindications for TIVAP implantation include generalized infection，local skin lesions/inflammation， active vein thrombosis at the site of planned implantation， treatment with acetylsalicylic acid derivatives， clotting inhibitors and oral anticoagulants (when the treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin is necessary， its last dose should be administered at least 12 h before the planned procedure)通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The implantation should take place in the operating room with surgical sterility conditions. The procedure takes 30 min to 40 min on average. In children， the procedure is performed under general anesthesia. After implantation， chest X-ray is obligatory to assess the ventricular position， catheter path， position of the catheter tip and presence of possible hematoma or pneumothorax created during the complicated procedure. In most cases pneumothorax does not require drainage. The optimal position of the catheter tip (at the borderline of the superior vena cava and right atrium) reduces the risk of complications such as thrombosis or catheter occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The care of central access is the factor determining the删除1换行incidence of infections. Although the use of fully implantable systems reduces the risk of complications compared to external catheters， septic complications are still a serious clinical problem 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>.\n\n【7】With proper care， the TIVAP can perform its function for many years and bring an unquestionable convenience for patients. In addition to reducing the pain associated with frequent punctures， it also reduces the risk of local inflammation and the risk of the drug being vascularized. It enables the patient to move freely without the risk of accidental catheter damage， which is particularly important in children 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【8】Permanent intravenousaCCesss is widely used， suchas administration of chemotherapy， blood products， liquids， antibiotics， parenteral nutrition. The necessity of frequent and repeated long-term administration of the drug is the main indication of port implantation. For this reason， TIVAPs are used in oncological patients， patients with cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as in palliative medicine 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In pediatrics， TIVAPs have been used in children with cancer and hemophilia requiring continuous administration of blood coagulation factors formulas.\n\n【9】The use of TIVAPs may also be extremely helpful in the therapy of patients with chronic kidney diseases， e.g. atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS). aHUS usually has a serious prognosis and multi-organ clinical symptoms may differ depending on the mutation found in a given patient 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. In the past， the treatment of this syndrome required regular， long-term supply of fresh frozen plasma during the chronic phase of the disease or transfusion of red blood cell concentrate during relapse and plasmapheresis. In2011 worldwide， and in 2018 in Poland， eculizumab， a humanized， monoclonal antibody directed against the C5 component of the complement system， which is also injected intravenously every 2weeks， was registered for the treatment of aHUS 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>.\n\n【10】This manuscript describes the course of aHUS treatment in four children using TIVAPs . All the parents have given informed written consent for TIVAPs placement and usage. According to the Polish law the Ethical Committee approval for this procedure was not necessary.\n\n【11】Case Series\n\n【12】Case 1\n\n【13】Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome was diagnosed in a boy at 5 months of life. From the beginning the boy required renal replacement therapy (peritoneal dialysis continued further for 7months) and repeated infusions of fresh frozen plasma. On day 215during pneumonia， the disease was blown again with the need for ICU treatment and mechanical ventilation. On day 33r the first TIVAP was established (size 4.5 Fr). On day 6\" after insertion， the needle was accidentaly punctured out from the port with edema of skin layers and hematoma formation. The condition was treated conservatively while maintaining the port’s patency.\n\n【14】On the 41s day of hospitalization， again the child's condition deteriorated. After a double incident of cyanosis with saturation decrease to 70% and an increase in body temperature， as well as after finding elevated inflammatory markers the antibiotic ceftriaxone was applied empirically. A culture was taken from the TIVAP's blood sample and peritoneal fluid. Due to a positive result of the culture from the port - the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis Methicillin-Resistant Strain (MRSE)-vancomycin was implemented.\n\n【15】Two weeks later (55h day of hospitalization)， the boy underwent acute post-transfusion lung damage (TRALI) requiring another ICU treatment. The MRSE strain was cultured in the port blood sample collected on day 61 of hospitalization - therapy with teicoplanin followed by linezolid was implemented. The patient was discharged in good condition. A month later a third MRSE infection occurred， which was manifested by an increase in temperature， pale skin and chills. Due to the colonization of the TIVAP with MRSE， it was planned to remove the port in the antibiotic cover (vancomycin). A week later the patient was discharged home in a good general condition.\n\n【16】After three months (patient at the age of 14 months) it was decided to establish a new port due to the necessity of transfusion of plasma every 1 to 2 weeks. The procedure underwent without complications.\n\n【17】At the age of 2.5 years the patient was admitted to hospital due to fever up to 38.3 and vomiting. Similar symptoms occurred in the boy's brother the previous week. After performing additional tests， consecutive relapse of the underlying disease was diagnosed. A control blood culture from the port showed growth of MRSE and Staphylococcus hominis strains. After the application of vancomycin and topically urokinase， a sterile blood culture was obtained. The patient could return to standard aHUS treatment with plasma infusions every 2 weeks.\n\n【18】In December 2017 (age 2 years 8 months) the patient was qualified for treatment with eculizumab. The boy has been taking the preparation through the port regularly since December 215，2017， which resulted in the lack of subsequent symptomatic relapses of aHUS and improvement of his health. There were no TIVAP inflammatory complications on eculizumab.\n\n【19】Case 2\n\n【20】Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome was diagnosed in a girl at the age of 4. She did not require renal replacement therapy.\n\n【21】Initially treatment with plasma transfusions was undertaken. In the absence of remission plasmapheresis was implemented-5sessions were performed. After two months in remission after TPE， the girl was admitted to the ward due to aHUS recurrence.\n\n【22】The treatment with fresh frozen plasma infusions was started.17 days later it was decided to establish the TIVAP. During the procedure the artery was punctured， which resulted in the formation of a hematoma in the area of venous confluence on the cannulated side. The patient did not report any complaints and the control chest X-ray taken after the surgery did not show any abnormalities.\n\n【23】The therapy was continued with regular plasma infusions for the next 2 years until the girl was qualified for treatment with eculizumab(at the age of 6 years)， which is still administered through the TIVAP. The child remains in aHUS remission. There were no TIVAP inflammatory complications on eculizumab.\n\n【24】Case 3\n\n【25】A 22-month-old girl was admitted with suspicion of typical HUS in the oligo-anuria phase. The child on admission was in a medium general condition， fatigue， pale and apathetic. The Tenckhoff catheter was inserted and peritoneal dialysis was started urgently and continued for 17 days. Thirty days later the patient had a relapse of aHUS. The girl was again in general medium condition， conscious but with limited logical contact， poorly responsive to stimuli. The treatment with plasma infusions and Therapeutic Plasma Exchanges删除表格换行(TPE) was applied with the improvement of girls condition in following days.\n\n【26】Table 1： Characteristics of the studied children with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.\n\n|  | Patient 1  | Patient 2  | Patient 3  | Patient 4  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age of diagnosis [months]  | 8  | 4  | 22  | 5  |\n| Current age years  | 5  | 9  | 10.5  | 10  |\n| Sex  | M  | F  | F  | M  |\n| Body weight at diagnosis [kg]  | 9.1  | 16  | 13  | 7.9  |\n| Height [cm]  | 75  | 104  | 97  | 69  |\n| Blood pressure at diagnosisSBP/DBP[mmHg]  | 125/72  | 107/60  | 80/60  | 130/100  |\n| Type of dialysis  | peritoneal dialysis  | None  | peritoneal dialysis  | peritoneal dialysis  |\n| eGFR at diagnosis [ml/min/1，73m²1  | 9.31  | 66.61  | 17.11  | 6.41  |\n| Serum creatinine [umol/]  | 294  | 57  | 207  | 393  |\n| Hemoglobin concentration [g/dl]  | 6.4  | 5.8  | 7.7  | 8.2  |\n| Serum urea [mmol/  | 41  | 10.4  | 34.8  | 56.5  |\n| C3[g/L]  | 0.77  | 0.84  | 0.93  | 0.68  |\n| C4[g/L]  | 0.14  | 0.16  | 0.18  | 0.25  |\n| Platelets count [x 10/卜]  | 36  | 67  | 45  | 70  |\n| LDH [UA]  | 783  | 813  | 1281  | -  |\n| Hypotensive medication onadmission  | amlodipine， enarenal，acebutolol， clonidine，carvedilol， furosemide  | furosemide， amlodipine  | amlodipine， dihydralazine， furosemide  | amlodipine，acebutolol  |\n| Current hypotensive therapy  | amlodipine， ramipril， clonidine， metoprolol，carvedilol， furosemide  | None  | amlodipine，ramipril  | amlodipine，ramipril  |\n| Underlying conditions  | secondary hypertension，cardiomyopathy，hypothyroidism， history ofpulmonary edema  | secondary hypertension  | Dandy-Walker syndrome， gallbladderstones， selective IgA deficiency  | Allergies  |\n| Type of mutation  | Mutation in the DGKE gene homozygous c.966G>A  Two variants of the CFH (H3) haplotype，heterozygous c.1204C>Tand heterozygous c.- 331C>T  | Mutation in the CFHR1/CFHR3 gene homozygous for c.His402Tyr andC.-311C> T.

Thrombocytopenia and elevated renal function indices were observed. Plasma infusions， parenteral hydration， antibiotic therapy， antiemetics were applied. Due to increasing values of renal function parameters， hypercalcemia and decreased diuresis on the2nd day of hospitalization； decisions were made to start hemodialysis as a matter of urgency. On the following days， therapeutic plasma infusions and hemodialysis procedures were continued. After 4h TPE the number of platelets increased to 113 ×10/uL， so only plasma infusions were continued.\n\n【31】Due to the displacement of the catheter tip during the procedure of inserting the \"acute\" central catheter， the decision was made to remove the TIVAP (she used it for 3 years and 321 days).\n\n| Table 3： Overview of TIVAPs.  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Patient 1  | Patient 2  | Patient 3  | Patient 4  |\n| Age of first implantation  | 9 months  | 4 years  | 3 years  | 3 years  |\n| Complications of TIVAPimplantation  | Three needle punctures witha hematoma formation， Three times a Staphylococcus infection  | Arterial puncture with haematoma tormation  | Breathing disorders after generalanaesthesia during the portinsertion procedure  | Port dislocation Bleeding from the puncturesite  |\n| Total number of complications  | 6  | 1  | 1  | 2  |\n| Duration of use of the first port  | 2 months  | For 4.5 years to the present  | 4 years  | 5 years  |\n| Cause of port removal  | Infection of the portStaphylococcus epidermidis methicillin-resistant strain  |  | Port dislocation  | Replacement for larger  |\n| Duration of use of the second port  | From 4 years to the present  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> | From 3.5 years to the present  | 1 year fremoved due to termination ot treatment)  |\n| Total duration of vascular  | 4 years 262 days  | 4 years 346 days  | 7 years 345 days  | 6 years 16 days  |\n| Total duration of vascular  | 4 years 262 days  | 4 years 346 days  | 7 years 345 days  | 6 years 16 days  |\n| Total duration of vascular  | 4 years 262 days  | 4 years 346 days  | 7 years 345 days  | 6 years 16 days  |\n\nAfter 26 days， a new TIVAP was implanted.

Plasma infusions were administered at the rate of 2 transfusions/24 h， intravenous antibiotic therapy， antiemetics， analgesics and diuretics. The child's medium-heavy condition was recorded despite adequate diuresis. From day 5， the biochemical parameters were gradually improved， followed by the stabilization of clinical condition.\n\n【34】On February 2018 the patient was qualified for treatment with eculizumab (at the age of 6 years)， which is still administered through the TIVAP. The child remains in remission of aHUS. There were no TIVAP inflammatory complications on eculizumab.\n\n【35】Case 4\n\n【36】Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome was diagnosed in a boy at the age of 5 months - admitted at that time in the anuria phase. Three days earlier he had a fever up to 39°C， weakness， lack of appetite， aversion to drink and symptoms of gastroenteritis. Peritoneal dialysis (conducted during the first 5 days of hospitalization)， symptomatic treatment and plasma infusions were initiated. Due to peritoneal dialysis catheter dysfunction and lack of effective dialysis fluid outflows， the renal replacement therapy had to be changed to hemodiafiltration. The course of disease was complicated by severe hypertension and pulmonary edema. In the following days， the clinical condition was systematically improved， which allowed to finish dialysis after 19 days of hospitalization. On day 36， the boy in good condition was discharged home.\n\n【37】Two years after the first hospitalization， the boy was urgently admitted to the hospital due to aHUS relapse. The week before the hospitalization weakness， rhinitis， coughing， fever and vomiting were present. Due to the need of TPE a central venous catheter was inserted under general anesthesia. After the procedure， breathing disorders occurred and the boy was transferred to the ICU.\n\n【38】To confirm the diagnosis percutaneous kidney biopsy was performed. The biopsy showed lesions corresponding to diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis without features of microangiopathy.\n\n【39】Three months later the boy was admitted because of proteinuria to 3.9 g/l， diuresis limitation and thrombocytopenia during upper respiratory tract infection. Treatment with plasma infusions was started， without initiating steroid therapy -proteinuria was reduced，删除1换行platelet count was normalized. To ensure adequate venous access TIVAP was established. Due to the satisfactory clinical effect of plasma therapy， continuation of infusions every 21 days was planned.\n\n【40】Two and a half years later， antihistamines were recommended before the next transfusions due to an allergic reaction during the plasma infusion. Periodically， chest X-rays were taken to assess the position of the vascular port which did not show any abnormalities.\n\n【41】Four years and 11 months after the TIVAP was established， within the operating block， the TIVAP was replaced with a larger one with a diameter of 6.5 FR (to the right subclavian vein).\n\n【42】Three months later 通用删除7(英):<u>(2018)</u>， due to a remission of the underlying disease lasting more than 4 years， the boy was qualified for treatment with eculizumab only in the case of aHUS relapse and plasma infusions were also interrupted.\n\n【43】After another 10 months TIVAPwas removed. The child currently remains in remission of aHUS.\n\n【44】Discussion\n\n【45】In the chronic treatment of aHUS， eculizumab is currently used， administered intravenously every two weeks in infusion lasting 25min to 45 min in adults and 1 h to 4 h in children 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Therefore， the use of central access in this therapy seems to be justified. Repeated necessity of venous access is burdensome for children due to their narrow veins， lower willingness to cooperate with the medical personnel and relatively easy possibility to damage the vein integrity通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. This is particularly important in the youngest children and infants. Also in patients with a significant risk for ESKD， including patients with aHUS， vascular preservation would be very important， actually highlighted as the new “Save the Vein” initiative 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. The TIVAPs increase patient’s well-being during long-term treatment. They permit to avoid regular， frequent and painful punctures into the peripheral veins and related complications. They also facilitate the infusion itself. A single TIVAP can serve for many years.\n\n【46】In the assessment of the presented patients， it should be noted that all of them remained in aHUS remission after introduction of eculizumab. TIVAPs have been successfully used in current and previous plasma infusions therapies. This type of catheters is of great importance in the treatment of patients with diseases requiring chronic therapy such as aHUS or hemophilia， as it does not limit daily activity. aHUS patients might be at increased risk of infection vs. other patient populations using TIVAPs， mainly linked to applied complement inhibition. However， catheter infections including encapsulated organisms were not recorded during eculizumab删除1换行application in described patients.\n\n【47】Despite its high utility， the usage of TIVAPs is not free of complications. The cases in which the central venous catheter should be removed include TIVAP displacement， blood clotting without the possibility to be unblocked with the application of fibrinolytic drugs， improper size or colonization by bacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，13-15]</u>.\n\n【48】Ten complications directly and indirectly related to the use of TIVAPs were observed in described by us children with aHUS. The commonest complication observed was hematoma formation. Hematoma in the subcutaneous pocket area is also the most comrion complication described in literature， occurring after port implantation 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. To reduce the risk of hematoma formation directly after the procedure， ice packs are used. Analgesics and topical formulas containing heparin are used in the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【49】All elements of the TIVAP are placed under the skin； no part is in contact with the external environment. This reduces the risk of infection spreading along the catheter， which is often a big problem with traditional methods of access to both central and peripheral veins 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，13]</u>. Despite this， the incidence of infections may be even4.1% 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Catheter-related infections may be directly related to patients non-compliance or improper skin disinfection by patients and/or personnel 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. They may be the reason for TIVAP removal. Catheter reimplantation may be performed no earlier than 7 days after the symptoms of infection have subsided and negative results of blood cultures have been obtained 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Beck et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> evaluated the incidence of catheter infections at 7.4% in the cohort of 296pediatric oncology patients (of which 128 ports were implanted). The most frequently isolated pathogens in blood cultures of oncological patients with catheter infections are Gram-positive bacteria， particularly coagulase-negative Staphylococci. The author's stress that these complications can be successfully treated 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Shim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> noted that 2.3% of ports were removed due to infections.\n\n【50】In patient 1， the TIVAP was colonized with Staphylococcus epidermidis strain， which involved additional hospitalization and antibiotic treatment burden， and finally removal of the TIVAP. The infections with this strain are the most common as it can migrate from the skin surface during injection 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\n\n【51】One of the complications during catheter insertion was an arterial puncture with hematoma formation (patient 2). The use of ultrasound imaging during catheter insertion largely prevents such complications. They are relatively rare (frequency 0.2% in the retrospective cohort study of 500 cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. During catheter placement， patient 4 developed respiratory disturbances after general anesthesia. This may have been influenced by the patient`s age -3years， general condition， underlying disease or previous infection. The incidence of airway complications under pediatric anesthesia is7.87% and increases in children after recent airway infections and in children below 6 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>.\n\n【52】One case of mechanical displacement of the TIVAP catheter tip after 3 years and 321 days of use was observed during insertion of the hemodialysis catheter， resulting in its immediate removal. The defective position of the TIVAP is not a frequently reported complication. The complication may occur in 1.3% to 5.4% of cases within 5 months of TIVAP insertion 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. It may also occur after the time of use and be associated with patient growth 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. It has been observed that TIVAP made of silicone and those of smaller sizes show greater flexibility， which may be associated with higher risk of删除1换行migration 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\n\n【53】The use of TIVAP as a tool for quick and easy access to central veins of patients with aHUS for many years undoubtedly improves the comfort of their lives and facilitates chronic therapy. Pediatric patients and their caregivers should be given special care by the staff， ensuring that antiseptic agents and methods are used and the TIVAP is properly filled with anticoagulant. In addition， it is also very important to educate patients，their families and staff how to carry out procedures properlytoprevent complications： Infections，clotting and mechanical injuries among them. Methods that can be used to reduce the number of adverse events， especially during port implantation， are radiological assessment of the chest immediately after surgery and imaging before its completion， or cardiac echocardiography for intravascular catheter tip observation.\n\n【54】Conclusion\n\n【55】The usage of vascular ports in children with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome seems to be safe provided that close monitoring and early detection of complications are carried out， allows to maintain repeated long-term access to the venous system， makes available vascular preservation in patients with a significant risk for end-stage kidney disease and minimizes pain associated with repeated punctures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Clinical presentation of abdominal localization is variable especially when it occurs in children and may represent a rare cause of secondary arterial hypertension.\n\n【2】Case Report： We report a case of abdominal aortic coarctation diagnosed precociously in a 9 years old girl， who had showed non-specific symptoms. She complained dyspnea， retrosternal pain just before to fall asleep and palpitations and night fears， suggesting a diagnosis of anxiety attacks due to restarting of school time. We found accidentally increased blood pressure values in one evening ieasurement and confirmed by ambulatory blood pressure recording. So we started diagnostic process for differential diagnosis of hypertension causes and diagnosed abdominal coarctation， first suggested by an abnormal upper/lower extremities ratio and confirmed by CT and then by Angio-MRI.\n\n【3】Discussion： Aortic coarctation has a variable clinical presentation， depending on the severity and the site of obstruction. Abdominal aortic coarctations usually cause signs or symptoms during the second decade of life； the mean age of diagnosis is 22 years while our patient was just 9 years old. In our case， clinical presentation was not initially typical for aortic coarctation， because symptoms might suggest a generic diagnosis of anxiety attacks. Hypertension is not a frequent condition in children； when it is present， it’s often a secondary form， so it needs a deep differential diagnosis process.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Abdominal aortic coarctation is a rare pediatric clinical condition， very difficult to identify because of its rarity and its variable symptoms. Essential was the occasional discovery of high blood pressure levels confirmed with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. This element guided the diagnostic process to the research of causes ofhypertension and allowed us to obtain the correct diagnosis.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Abdominal aortic coarctation is a rare localization，the most common site of aortic coarctation occurs immediately distally to the origin of the left subclavian artery， while abdominal localization represents quite a an infrequent form that can be on a congenital basis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>， but may also be acquired.\n\n【7】Clinicalpresentation ofabdominallocalization is variable and may include arterialhypertension， heart failure， murmur， claudication， diminished femoral pulses and a leg blood pressure equal to or lower than arms 通用删除6(英):<u>[21</u>.\n\n【8】We report a rare case of abdominal aortic coarctation diagnosed in a child who had showed apparently non-specific symptoms： anxiety attacks.\n\n【9】When patient was admitted in our hospital，parents signed consent to the processing of personal data of the children.\n\n【10】A 9 years old girl was referred to our hospital for dyspnea and retrosternal pain just before to fall asleep. The patient had a more recent history of recurring similar episodes， characterized by palpitations and night fears， in addiction to mild chest pain and short breathing difficulty； these symptoms should have suggested to run cardiac clinical and instrumental examinations but remote pathological anamnesis was characterized by transient patent ductus arteriosus with six-monthly cardiologic follow-up until the age of 5years. For this reason only electrocardiogram was performed and a generic diagnosis of anxiety attacks due to restarting of school time had been the first diagnosis. Parents decided to ask a second opinion.\n\n【11】On admission， her general conditions were good. Heart auscultation noted a 1/6 systolic murmur at base of heart. Laboratory exams， spirometry， electrocardiogram and echocardiography were normal. During the first day of hospitalization we found an increased arterial blood pressure value in the evening and for this reason an ambulatory blood pressure recording was performed that finally revealed a before now undiagnosed hypertension. We completed diagnostic process for differential diagnosis of hypertension causes. The exams showed a normal renal function， aregular circadian rhythm of plasmatic cortisol levels and normal aldosterone blood levels； higher renin levels were found in clinostatism and in orthostatism(respectively 47，10 uUI/ml and 125，40 uUI/ml). In the while we assessed an abnormal difference in blood pressures between the upper and lower extremities： arterial blood pressure was 120/84 mmHg at right arm and 90/73 mmHg at right leg. A new Echocardiography excluded isthmic aortic coarctation； in effect there was a much rarer， especially in child， abdominal localization of aortic coarctation. Doppler vascular abdominal echography and contrasted-enhanced CT of chest and abdomen showed an isolate significant stenosis of abdominal aorta， with the stenotic tract originating vertebral arteries； this picture was confirmed by MRI and Angiography .\n\n【12】Once made the diagnosis， the patient has started a Ca-antagonist treatment to manage hypertension， while waiting for the choice of when and which kind of bypass correction.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Coarctation of aorta comprises 5% to 10% of congenital cardiac lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-4]</u> but if we consider only coarctation involving the abdominal aorta they are much rarer with a rate of 2% of all coarctations通用删除6(英):<u> 5]</u>.\n\n【15】Abdominal aortic coarctations clinical presentation is variable， depending on the severity and the site of obstruction. Usually cause删除1换行signs or symptoms during the second decade of life； the mean age of diagnosis is 22 years while our patient was just 9 years old. If untreated， this condition has been associated with stroke，progressive left ventricular hypertrophy with congestive heart failure and flash pulmonary edema， and less often with renal insufficiency. In one review， 55% ofuntreated patients died at a mean age of 34 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【16】Symptoms of aortic coarctations are related to the kind and site：in the neonatal isthmic severe localization there are early symptoms and signs of heart failure and respiratory distress such as tachypnea， grunting， retractions，pale skin ，heavy sweating，diminished or absent lower extremity pulses， increased upper extremity pulses， difficulty in feeding But in the adult post isthmic form patients may remain for long time almost asymptomatic or may present headache， systemic hypertension， nose bleeding， muscle weakness， cold feet， leg cramps and claudication； in effect our patient after diagnosis realized to have suffered of leg cramps. Physical examination can note strong upper body pulses and diminished or absent leg pulses， which are corroborated by a difference in blood pressures between the upper and lower extremities. After infancy， the systolic blood pressure in the lower extremities is usually higher (5 to 20 mm Hg) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-6]</u> than in the upper extremities as a result of the standing wave effect. If the leg systolic blood pressure is equal to or lower than the arm pressure， the diagnosis of aortic coarctation should be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-7]</u>， like in our patient， who presented a systolic pressure gradient of about 30mmHg in legs.\n\n【17】In our case， clinical presentation and the history of frequent“normal Echocardiograms\"contributed to mislead an early diagnosis also because specific symptoms began to be evident just before school restarting suggesting a generic diagnosis of anxiety attacks that， according to parents’ feelings， conformed with the irritable disposition of the preadolescent girl. Panic or anxiety disorders may be characterized by recurrent unexpected episodes of severe anxiety， which typicaly reach their peak within 10 minutes and last around30-45 minutes 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. These symptoms can look similar to those referred by our patient， who lamented an anxiety state associated to dyspnea and heart rate acceleration. Luckily in this case a new complete extended evaluation of the patient， including blood pressure ambulatory monitoring， thanks to the individuation of high blood pressure quickly redirected the diagnosis： in fact hypertension is not a frequent condition in children with a prevalence ranging from 4% to17%通用删除6(英):<u>[9-10]</u>. The probability of a secondary hypertension is inversely proportional to the age of the patient and directly proportional to blood pressure levels 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>； but a rare abdominal aortic coarctation caused just an apparently mild hypertension in this girl.\n\n【18】Regarding abdominal coarctation， we can suppose to have diagnosed a congenital form. Considering the acquired forms， they have been associated with pathologies such as Takayasu syndrome， William’s syndrome， neurofibromatosis， fibromuscular dysplasia， retroperitoneal fibrosis， and mucopolysaccharidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. In our case we could exclude neurofibromatosis， mucopolysaccharidosis and Williams’s syndrome because of absence of typical stigmata； so the differential considerations are limited to Takayasu arteritis and non-inflammatory aorto-arteriopathy， such as fibromuscular dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Takayasu arteritis usually is multi distrectual and it can be differentiated from fibromuscular dysplasia for the general inflammatory state and by histologic examination 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. The only therapeutic differences between the two conditions would be the use of anti-inflammatory therapy in Takayasu arteritis. D'Souza et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> with a study in 1998 conclude that differentiating between Takayasu arteritis and fibromuscular dysplasia may not be as important as the management itself of aortic coarctation 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【19】Management decisions for patients with coarctation of the aorta depend upon patient age， presentation， and the severity of the lesion. Medical therapy consists in hypertension management with antihypertensive drugs (beta-blockers， ACE inhibitors， angiotensin-receptor blockers or Ca Antagonist)， waiting to choose the best surgical option. There are different methods for the treatment of aortic coarctation， including surgical repair or percutaneous balloon angioplasty with or without stent placement 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Surgical repair of coarctation can be achieved by several techniques： resection with end-to-end anastomosis， subclavian flap aortoplasty in infants with long-segment coarctation， a bypass graft across the area of coarctation when the distance to be bridged is too long for an end-to-end repair or prosthetic patch aortoplasty. Balloon angioplasty has删除1换行been recommended as the preferred treatment for children andadults with native coarctation or recoarctation after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. It has been suggested that stenting after balloon angioplasty lowers the risk for complications and has a beneficial effect on long-term survival. However， primary stenting has an important limitation which is the failure to adapt to the growing vessel in a child. To overcome this problem， redilatation during follow-up has been described 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. In our case stent implantation can’t be realized because vertebral arteries originate from the stenotic tract， so we have to exclude this option. She will need to bypass the stenotic tract with the addition of all the implications connected with the growth of the girl. In this while the patient has begun antihypertensive therapy with Ca-antagonists， in order to manage arterial blood hypertension.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】Abdominalaortic coarctation is a rare pediatric clinical condition that can be quite difficult to identify because of its rarity and its variable symptomatology. Anamnesis and physical examination are the first steps to approach any patient. Our case presented initially non-specific clinical features. Essential was the occasional discovery of high blood pressure levels confirmed with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.

About 15% to 20% of the inguinal hernias in girls contain uterus with adnexa 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>， and are commonly associated with congenital anomalies of the genitourinary system such as the Mayer-Rokitansky-Kiister-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Upon impact on genitalia only the condition is defined as MRKH type-1 syndrome. Type 2 MRKH or MURC-associated syndrome includes renal anomalies (unilateral agenesis， ectopic kidney， horseshoe kidney)， skeletal anomalies (fused vertebrae， scoliosis)， and more seldom-hearing loss or cardiac defects. The type of inheritance is autosomal-dominant with incomplete penetrance and variable expression.

Physical examination revealed a rounded swelling with smooth surface， about 10 cm in diameter， fixed and relatively superficial. Ultrasound imaging findings included a cystic formation in the right abdominal half with an augmented internal echoes and size98 mm/87 mm， possibly originating from the right ovary； agenesis of the right kidney and slightly increased size of the left kidney with dilated parenchymal area. CT-scan confirmed the agenesis of the right kidney  with left-sided lateralization of the uterus without other pathological alterations. A herniated thin-walled (2 mm) cystic structure was described along the course of the inguinal canal with intra- (33 mm/27 mm) and extra-abdominal (103 mm/97 mm) component， in close proximity to an ileum intestinal loop， but there was no evidence of any connection between them . No nutrient vessels to the structure were spotted， and it remained relatively hypodense during the contrast phases. The structure described exerted pressure on the femoral vein in the inguinal canal to almost complete obturation of the vein in the contact segment. As an additional finding， a marked S-shaped scoliotic deformation due to congenital vertebral alterations was established-wedge-shaped L2， block vertebra of L1， Th12 and Th11； a wedge-shaped vertebrae at the level of Th10； and a sacrococcygeal deformation. Due to the proximity of the above-described formation to the great vessels we also performed a Doppler examination，establishing pervious deep veins of the lower extremities bilaterally.\n\n【8】Through a right-sided parainguinal approach we reached a large cystic formation with 10 cm\n\n【9】Discussion\n\nMale and female reproductive systems have common initial development.

Due to its immune-mediated pathogenesis， ARF can present with a variety of different tissue and organ manifestations like arthritis， carditis， chorea， subcutaneous nodules， and erythema marginatum. The large number of differential diagnosis associated with any one manifestation can make the diagnosis of ARF extremely difficult. It is essential to recognize and treat ARF in order to avoid the long-term morbidity. One of the rarest components of ARF is the manifestation of Sydenham’'s chorea. It is an autoimmune， neuropsychiatric movement disorder that makes up the major criteria alone to diagnose ARF.\n\n【2】An 8-year-old female presents with a two-week history of worsening involuntary movements， VOr difficulty with speech， and functional decline. On physical examination， the child displays non-rhythmic movements， an abnormal gait， and incomprehensible speech. Her oral pharynx is non-erythematous and no exudates are visualized. A new systolic murmur is appreciated and her Anti-Streptolysin O (ASO) was positive. ARF was diagnosed based on the chorea， new murmur， and also the positive ASO. The patient was administered with one dose of IM penicillin benzathine to treat her ARF and commenced on risperidone to help manage the chorea.\n\n【3】ARF is still present in developed nations and hospitalist should be familiar with the varying ways it can present. Sydenham chorea is a disabling feature of ARF that requires early recognition and treatment.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Sydenham chorea is a complication of Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF) and is one of the leading acquired causes of acute onset chorea in children 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. The Neurotransmitter (NT) dopamine has been shown to be the main NT attributing to the hyperkinetic movements seen in Sydenham’s chorea， which is very similar to the presentation in Huntingtons disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【6】In developing countries， the incidence of ARF is about 470，000 cases per year and around275，000 lead to mortality due to a cardiovascular pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. This can all be prevented if ARF is treated and diagnosed in time. The official criteria to diagnose ARF are defined by understanding the major and minor criteria that rule the disease. Officially known as the Jones criteria， it was originally described in 1944 by Dr. Jones. The Jones criteria have been constantly revised since 1944in order to properly diagnose ARF. In order to have ARF， there must be strict evidence of a previous Group A Beta-Hemolytic Streptococcal (GABS) infection with days 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. This is the first initial step in diagnosing ARF， and without a GABS infection； the probability of ARF is unlikely. A GABS infection can be diagnosed with elevated or rising anti-streptolysin O titers， or other antibodies such as anti-DNase B antibodies (there are multiple that are specific to GABS infections)， a positive GABS throat culture， or a positive group A streptococcal carbohydrate antigen test individuals with suspected streptococcus pharyngitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【7】According to the American Heart Association (AHA)， to make the diagnosis of ARF in a low risk area， one individual must satisfy the two out of five major manifestations or one major and two minor manifestations. While in a moderate/high risk area the criteria can also be met with the presence of three minor manifestations. Chorea is the only exception when ARF can be considered without having strict evidence of GAS infection. Chorea， by itself is sufficient criterion to diagnose ARF given that other neurological disorders are ruled out 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> .\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】An 8-year-old female with no past medical history presents with a two-week history of删除表格换行worsening involuntary movements， difficulty with speech， and functional decline. The patient recently returned from a three-week trip to the Dominican Republic (DR)， where she first started to develop symptoms after 7 days of arriving. Initially the patient began to have some small involuntary tics in her extremities and was noted to be more anxious. Over the course of one week， the tics began to become more of an involuntary jerking movement that affected the entire body including the face and torso. The movements were so severe that the child was no longer able to feed herself， dress herself， or even ambulate without assistance. She also began to have difficulty with speaking and was only able to communicate with one-word sentences， body gestures， and facial expressions.\n\n【10】Table 1： Jones criteria in low risk populations.\n\n| Jones criteria in low risk populations  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Major Criteria  | Minor Criteria  |\n| Subclinical carditis  | Polyarthralgia  |\n| Polyarthritis’  | Fever (>38.5℃)  |\n| Chorea  | ESR>60 mm in the first hour\"  |\n| Erythema marginatum  | CRP>3 mg/dL  |\n| Subcutaneous nodules  | Prolonged PR interval  |\n| Medium/High Risk Population：  |  |\n| monoarthritis or polyarthralgia  |  |\n| monoarthralgia  |  |\n| “ESR of>30 mm in the first hour  |  |\n\n【12】During the onset ofher symptoms， the patient developed two skin abscesses that were noted to drain minimal yellow pus， one located in the gluteal region and one on the scalp. The mother denies any sick contacts，fevers， cough， sore throat， abdominal pain， diarrhea，orhead Traiimia.\n\n【13】The child is noted to be afebrile， alert， and active. She displays non-rhythmic movements， an abnormal gait， and incomprehensible speech. Her oral pharynx is non-erythematous， and no exudates are visualized. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm， a 2/6systolic murmur is appreciated most prominently over the left lower sternal border. Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No lymphadenopathy appreciated. Two small abscesses with scabs are noted， one on right buttocks and second on the frontotemporal region of scalp. Cultures were collected from the patient's throat， urine， blood， and cerebral spinal fluids.\n\n【14】Laboratory results\n\n【15】ASO： Positive\n\n【16】Rapid Strep Antigen Test： Negative\n\n【17】White blood cell count： 9.9×10/uL(5.2-12.4)\n\n【18】Urine Toxicology： Negative\n\n【19】Findings on imaging\n\n【20】Head MRI showedleptomeningeal enhancements wwhich cannot rule out meningitis， but no masses were visualized. Her electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm and did not show an increase in the PR Interval or signs of atrioventricular blocks. While her echocardiogram showed a left ventricle ejection fraction of 65%， the septum was intact， mild mitral regurgitation， and some trace of tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n【21】Culture results\n\n【22】The patient's cultures of throat， urine， blood， and cerebral spinal fluids did not have any growth after 72 h. Testing for other sources of infection such as Measles， Respiratory Syncytial virus， West Nile virus， Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)， Lyme’s disease， and Influenza all came back negative. NMDA antibodies were also negative.\n\n【23】The patient's mother does recall the child have a self-resolving cold a couple weeks prior to the presentation of the acute chorea， but she does not recall the child complaining of any throat pain. On physical exam， the patient's gait was severely affected by the sporadic jerking movements. She was also noted to have a new murmur in the mitral region. Her laboratory results came back negative for rapid strep antigen， but her ASO levels came back elevated. Thus， ARF must be highly considered as the diagnoses.\n\n【24】The patient was administered with one dose of IM penicillin benzathine to treat her ARF and commenced on risperidone 1mg to help manage the chorea. Her symptoms began to improve during her hospital stay. Her chorea movements began to decrease in intensity. She was able to verbalize more phonetic sounds， and slowly began to form complete words. She continued to have elevated DNase B antibody and was started on oral penicillin V twice a day for prophylaxis.\n\n【25】Discussion\n\n【26】The average worldwide incidence of ARF is 19 cases per 100，000school aged children， while the incidence rate in the USA is only <2cases per 100，000 annually. Having Sydenham’s chorea as the sole manifestation is even rarer of a phenomenon， with only 5% of those2 per 100，000 reporting in this manner. In these cases， females were affected at a 2：1 ratio compared to males， and most often in the age group of 5 to 16 years old with a peak around the ages of 8 and 9 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【27】ARF is a condition that can be prevented with proper treatments and recognition， making it a rarity of a diagnosis in the United States通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Primary prevention of ARF requires adequate treatment of Group A Strep (GAS) pharyngitis with either Amoxicillin (50 mg per kg orally once for 10 day with a maximum of 1 gram daily)， Penicillin G benzathine (patients weighing 27 kg or less should receive 600，000units IM once or patients weighing more than 27 kg should receive1，200，000 units IM once)， Penicillin V Potassium (250 mg orally BID or TID for 10 days for <27 kg or 500 mg orally BID or TID for 10days >27 kg). For patients allergic to penicillin， narrow spectrum Cephalosporins (Cephalexin)， Azithromycin， or Clarithromycin are recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【28】Secondary prophylaxis of treatment for ARF is aiming at preventing recurrent ARF in those has been previously diagnosed with ARF. According to the American Heart Association (AHA)， patients who have ARF with carditis and residual heart disease should receive antibiotic prophylaxis for ten years or until the age of forty years (whichever is longer)； some patients need lifetime prophylaxis. Patients with ARF without any evidence of carditis should be treated withantibiotics for at least five years or until age twentyone (whichever is longer). Furthermore， AHA no longer recommends prophylaxis for infective endocarditis in most patients with rheumatic heart disease unless the patients have prosthetic valves， valves repaired with prosthetic materials， heart transplant patients， previous cases of endocarditis， and specific forms of congenital heart disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【29】Sydenham's chorea is manifestation that is very rare in the world， therefore there is little evidence to support that one drug is proffered over another to treat the patient’s symptoms. According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)， there is no clear evidence that one antipsychotic，benzodiazepines， or anti-epileptic is preferred over others for the treatment of Sydenham’s chorea. However， the FDA does verify the pediatric doses of antipsychotics specifically Haloperidol as well as another antipsychotic called pimozide. Furthermore，the FDA warns that the cardiotoxic side effects of these drugs should be kept in mind when addressing treatment and an electrocardiogram is a standard before treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.In conclusion， the world is in need for double-blinded， placebo- and comparative-controlled trials to establish evidence based worldwide treatment for Sydenham's chorea.\n\n【30】One study performed in sixty five children inthecountry ofTurkey has shown that haloperidol is superior to pimozide for controlling chorea in terms of recovery and time to remission. Haloperidol is a First-Generation Antipsychotic (FGAs) and has greater potential for toxicities and adverse effects compared to Second-Generation Antipsychotics (SGAs). While both sets of antipsychotics are used in motor disorders as they are all essentially dopamine antagonists， the SGA have proven to have less side effects and better in treating specific disorders rather than simply controlling motor symptoms of a disorder. In a study of haloperidol vs. risperidone， it shows that haloperidol is associated with greater severity of extrapyramidal symptoms， but there is no statistical difference in prolactin related measures or sedation 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n\n【32】No antipsychotics like all medications are free of adverse effects and the choice of antipsychotic in our case was risperidone due to its lower side effect profile as compared to FGAs as well as other SGAs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is thought to be polymicrobial with Klebsiella being one of the most common organisms usually seeding the liver/biliary tract secondary to transplacement from the gut to the portal vein 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【2】Klebsiella pneumoniae， a gram-negative and opportunistic pathogen， has emerged as a major threat in recent years due to its multidrug-resistant strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and/or carbapenemases causing disseminated community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections which are challenging to treat. HvKp-induced liver abscess is an emerging cause of PLA worldwide requiring immediate attention 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) affects immunocompetent hosts which were previously common in the Asian pacific rim is now claiming its global dominance 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Despite being a gram-negative organism， it has an increased propensity to spread metastatically. It can cause multi-organ infection and is associated with high morbidity and mortality even among immunocompetent hosts， though diabetes has been shown to be a significant risk factor.\n\n【3】We present a unique presentation of HvKp PLA initially presenting as Diabetic Ketoacidosis(DKA) unmasking itself with septic emboli to the lungs and the brain.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 41-year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history of non-insulin-dependent type 2diabetes mellitus presented with 3 days of malaise， generalized fatigue， lethargy， abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting， and rapid shallow breaths after running out of her medications4 days prior to presentation. Physical exam was significant for Kussmaul's breathing and mild abdominal tenderness otherwise was unremarkable. The patient remained hemodynamically stable， afebrile， and on room air. Labs revealed white count of 17.88 K/mm， hemoglobin 11.1 G/dL， platelets 434 K/mm， bicarbonate 5 mmol/L， anion gap 28， ketones 5.2 mmol/L， serum osmolality322， glucose 429 mg/dL， alkaline phosphatase 575 U/L， AST 20IU/L， ALT 32 U/L， hemoglobin Alc>14%， procalcitonin 2.45 NG/mL， lactic acid 4.97 mmol/L. Chest X-ray on admission revealed no focal airspace consolidation.\n\n【6】The patient was subsequently upgraded to ICU level of care for diabetic ketoacidosis and sepsis. Treatment was started with 200 mL/h of intravenous fluids and regular insulin infusion. Given the patient's septic picture and abdominal pain， CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast only was obtained which revealed a large pyogenic liver abscess with extension beyond the inferior liver capsule with an abscess in the right perinephric space involving the lower pole of the right kidney along with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules in the lung bases with a peripheral distribution in a few with early cavitary changes suggestive of septic emboli. Blood cultures showed growth of Gram negative bacilli prompting initiation of cefepime. On day 2 of hospitalization the patient's anion gap closed with the initiation of basal/bolus insulin and transfer from ICU to the intermediate medical care unit.\n\n【7】On day 3 of hospitalization， her blood cultures speciated to Klebsiella preumoniae with IR drainage and JP drain placement for pyogenic liver and perinephric abscess. Patient was evaluated by an infectious disease specialist. A quick string test was done in the microbiology lab which was positive hence her sepsis and metastatic infection was deemed secondary to hypermucoviscous Klebsiella bacteremia.\n\nAntibiotics were de-escalated to ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily. Echocardiogram was ordered for the|删除段之间换行|assessment of valvular disease along with a CT chest for pulmonary nodules. On day 4 of hospitalization echocardiogram revealed no valvular disease with a normal ejection fraction. CT chest with contrast was consistent with multiple pulmonary nodules with the largest 17 mm with minimal cavitations. Other much smaller nodules were also seen without cavitation which looked infectious etiology as per radiologist.\n\n【9】On day 5 of hospitalization， patient started complaining of right lower extremity weakness along with sudden dizziness， poor balance and right occipital headache. MRI brain with and without contrast was obtained given concern for septic emboli， which revealed multiple acute infarcts in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres，vermis， and right lateral medulla. Neurology evaluated the patient with the initiation of aspirin and Plavix. Q. 1 h neuro checks were initiated for the patient given high-risk herniation with cerebellar strokes with a subsequent upgrade to ICU level of care for neuro checks. On day6 of hospitalization a transesophageal echocardiogram was done for evaluation of cardioembolic source of stroke which revealed no evidence ofendocarditis.\n\nOn the 7h of hospitalization， a plan to place a PICC line for continuation of ceftriaxone 2 g IV for 6 weeks was made. On day8 of hospitalization， the patient remained stable with improvement of bilateral lower extremity weakness and clinical picture hence she was discharged with drains to the right subhepatic space and right hepatic lobes with close outpatient follow-up with infectious disease. The patient's course was complicated by clogging of the drain along|删除段之间换行|with incomplete resolution of liver abscess after prolonged antibiotic course as shown on CT abdomen and pelvis as residual fluid and gas in the right subhepatic space hence 6 weeks of oral cefpodoxime was added. On subsequent follow-up appointments the patient remained symptom-free with benign abdominal examination and normal inflammatory markers hence no further imaging was obtained.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Liver abscesses are subcategorized into pyogenic， amoebic， parasitic， and fungal which are all associated with high mortality in untreated patients emphasizing the importance ofearly diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Majority of the liver abscesses are noticed in the right lobe of the liver secondary to its increased blood supply however less commonly they can be seen in the left liver lobe or caudate lobe 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Before the advent of percutaneous drainage， surgical intervention was the mainstay of treatment with gastrointestinal sources like diverticulitis and peritonitis most common causes however in recent years biliary tract pathology has been known to be the most common trigger causing pyogenic liver abscesses affecting 55- to 65-year-old age group unlike our patient in this study case 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. PLA treatment nowadays includes antibiotics， percutaneous drainage when abscess size is larger than 5cm， or rarely surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【13】PLA is polymicrobial with the most common bacteria being E. Coli， Klebsiella， Streptococcus， Staphylococcus， and anaerobes 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. PLA secondary to Klebsiella has recently become a cause of concern given new emerging Hypervirulent strains (HvKP) and Carbapenem-\n\n【14】Resistant (CR-HvKP). Despite being a well-recognized organism， invasive syndromes affecting immunocompetent hosts causing life threatening infections were not reported previously with HvKp in the first world countries； first recognized in Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. Their capability of producing hypermucoviscous capsules helps them distinguish from the classic Klebsiella variant on the string test. String test， an initial screening test for these phenotypes assessing the ability of the bacterial colonies to form a hypermucoviscous string >5 mm after an overnight growth on agar plate has now become insufficient for diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【15】HvKP's virulenceilsS attributed to its hyperCcapsule， fimbriae， porins， excessivesiderophores， andmacromolecular exopolysaccharides， among others 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. These pathogens can cause invasive infections including endophthalmitis， meningitis， brain abscesses， osteomyelitis， muscle abscesses， and pyogenic liver abscess among others 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Literature suggests a possible relationship between high BMI， alcohol use， and poor glycemic control as in our patient with the development of PLA with risk reduction by modifications of these risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In such patients with risk factors and appropriate clinical presentation， multiple sites for metastatic infection should be evaluated for early source control which remains the mainstay of treatment along with long-term antibiotics depending on sensitivities通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【16】Treatment includes prolonged antibiotics along with source control. HvKP strains unlike the extended-spectrum-producing beta-lactamases-producing strains and carbapenem-resistant strains are susceptible to common antibiotics as evident in our patient since her HvKP strain was susceptible to ceftriaxone 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The rise of these strains is alarming， requiring an emphasis on preventative measures to curb the spread of these deadly infections. Exposure prevention， contact tracing， and hand hygiene have been paramount in limiting the spread of these pathogens.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】In conclusion， various strains of klebsiella with increased resistance affecting immunocompetent hosts causing invasive syndromes which are increasingly difficult to treat have not been extensively reported in the literature previously. Given its varied presentations， it is of paramount importance to raise awareness of删除1换行its different clinical presentations for early and prompt recognition preventing invasive infections by source control. Source control is the mainstay of treatment in these infections along with the requirement for prolonged antibiotics given extension hypermucoviscosity and biofilm production making them difficult to eliminate. Increased knowledge about preventative measures is warranted including hand hygiene to prevent and curb the spread of these worrisome strains.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Paraneoplastic disease with central nervous system involvement is a rare complication. Immunosuppression for the paraneoplastic features and chemotherapy for the underlying malignancy are described treatments but benefits are often short-lived because of co-morbid complications and disease resistance. This report describes a case of relapsed MCL with a rapidly progressing， motor-dominant，paraneoplastic polyneuropathy treated with immunosuppression and ibrutinib， an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Ibrutinib was well tolerated and led to a partial remission comparable in duration with that achieved by more toxic chemotherapeutic regimens， which are often difficult to deliver in this context. Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are rare but recognized complications of mantle cell lymphoma which are important to diagnose because treating the underlying disease is an essential component of therapy. This report demonstrates that ibrutinib is a safe and effective therapeutic option.\n\n【2】Keywords： Ibrutinib； Mantle cell lymphoma； Centralnervous system； Paraneoplastic syndrome； Anti-ganglioside antibodies\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)， genetically characterized by the t (11；14) chromosomal translocation resulting in over-expression of cyclin D通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> and deregulation of the cell cycle删除4-1:<u>1</u>. It accounts for 4-10% of NHL with a median age at diagnosis of 68 years and an approximate 2：1 propensity for older males 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. It often presents at a late stage and is generally regarded as incurable 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Median overall survival varies from 2 to 12 years and depends on several factors， including patient fitness for intensive therapy and disease features， such as the presence of blastoid histology 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. Extra-nodal involvement is common： patients often present with blood， bone marrow and gastrointestinal infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，7，8]</u>.\n\n【5】Sensory， motor and autonomic neuropathies are a recognized complication of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma through a variety of mechanisms： leptomeningeal and parenchymal infiltration of the nervous system； metabolic disturbance； infection； complications of therapy and paraneoplastic syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>[9-12]</u>.\n\n【6】Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are probably caused by immune mechanisms directed against self-antigens normally present in the central nervous system being ectopically expressed by the tumour (onconeural antigens). By definition， PNS occur in the absence of metastasis to or infiltration of the nervous system； known indirect toxic effect； ectopic secretion of hormones or induced coagulopathies. The frequency of PNS is low， occurring in <1% of patients with solid tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. They are rare in NHL but important to diagnose because treatment of the underlying tumour is an important initial step in their management 通用删除6(英):<u>[14-16]</u>.\n\n【7】There have been several reports ofparaneoplastic neuropathies associated with immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against the disialosyl gangliosides， including CANOMAD syndrome (Chronic Ataxic Neuropathy， Opthalmoplegia， Monoclonal IgM protein， cold Agglutinins and Disialosyl antibodies) 通用删除6(英):<u>[17-23]</u>. They are usually treated with a combination of plasma exchange (PEX) and immunosuppression in the form of corticosteroids， intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or rituximab.\n\n【8】This article describes a rapidly progressing， motor-dominant polyneuropathy with IgM anti-ganglioside antibodies associated with relapsing MCL and its successful treatment with the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor， ibrutinib.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 59 year old Caucasian male with a history of MCL treated four years previously with cytarabine-based chemotherapy followed by a reduced intensity， sibling-donor allogeneic stem-cell transplant， presented to a late-effects clinic with a four week history of dizzy spells. There was no previous history of neurological disorders. Clinical examination was unremarkable. A full blood count revealed a mild lymphocytosis (5.1x109/L) with a population of blastoid lymphocytes on the blood smear. Immuno phenotyping of these cells demonstrated a MCL phenotype (CD5+； CD19+； CD79a+； FMC7+； CD20/22+； CD23-). Renal and liver biochemistry， including serum B12， folate and ferritin assays were normal. A diagnosis of relapsed MCL was made.\n\n【11】Over three weeks，progressive neurological deterioration occurred with ataxia， diplopia， symmetrical paraesthesia and weakness in the upper and lower limbs together with worsening pharyngeal dysphagia. Cranial nerve examination revealed globally reduced eye movements and a left VII lower motor neuron weakness. Fundoscopy was unremarkable. There was bilateral nystagmus and finger-nose ataxia. Power was reduced in a pyramidal distribution in the upper and lower limbs， tone was globally reduced. Reflexes and plantar responses were absent and sensation to light-touch and vibration was reduced in the limbs in a glove and stocking distribution to the level of the hips and shoulders. Cardio-respiratory examination was unremarkable and there was no clinical evidence oflymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.\n\n【12】Contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) of the head， neck， thorax， abdomen and pelvis revealed low volume， mediastinal lymphadenopathy consistent with MCL. Magnetic-resonance imaging(MRI) with contrast of the brain and spinal cord demonstrated no focal parenchymal or leptomeningeallesion.\n\n【13】Examination ofccerebrospinalfluidd(CSF) revealedscant lymphoid cells with a mature T-cell immunophenotype (CD5positive； CD19， CD10， CD23 and FMC7 negative) but no malignant clonal population was detected. CSF protein was raised at 1.03g/L(0.15-0.45g/L) and glucose was normal at 3.7mM/L. Paired CSF and serum oligoclonal bands were identical. Nerve conduction and electromyographic (EMG) studies demonstrated severe， axonal， motor and sensory loss in the distal nerve segments of the limbs and active denervation and loss of motor units， consistent with a sensorimotor axonal neuropathy.\n\n【14】Other investigation revealed normal thyroid function， normal creatinine kinase and HbAlc levels. Anti-nuclear antibodies(ANA)， anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA and cANCA)，HIV and syphilis serology were all negative. Serum immunoglobulins were unremarkable with no evidence of a monoclonal band. An extensive search for an infectious etiology was unproductive and there were no constitutional signs to support infection. Serum complement C3and C4 were within normal range. A bone marrow biopsy was not performed.\n\n【15】Serum antiganglioside antibodies were positive for GD1a， GD1b and GQ1b IgM (levels >1/1000 (normal =<1/500))； GM1， GM2， GD1a， GD1b，GQ1b IgG，IgM GMl and IgM GM2 were negative.\n\n【16】On the basis of these results， a diagnosis of relapsed MCL with a paraneoplastic， motor-dominant polyneuropathy due to anti-ganglioside，onconeural antibodies was made.\n\n【17】Results\n\n【18】Initially， the patient required intensive supportive care in bed， including physiotherapy and nutritional support via a nasogastric feeding tube. Treatment for relapsed MCL was commenced with ibrutinib (560mg q.d. given via a nasogastric tube). In addition， one pulse of intravenous methylprednisolone (100mg q.d. for three days) and one course of intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4g per kilogram per day for five days) were given. After an initial improvement in neurological function，Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus， which were undetected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at presentation， reactivated and were treated successfully with rituximab (375mg/m2once weekly for four weeks by intravenous infusion) and intravenous ganciclovir.\n\n【19】Over several weeks， a global improvement in power was observed and the patient was discharged from hospital， walking with the aid of a stick. He achieved a partial remission with the use of single agent ibrutinib (560mg q.d.)， but after 4 months， developed a rapid neurological relapse with lymphocytosis and died shortly afterwards.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】In this case， the differential diagnoses included a paraneoplastic polyneuropathy secondary to MCL； leptomeningeal iinfiltration of MCL； a late infectious complication of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation and， given the presence of anti-ganglioside antibodies， CANOMAD syndrome. CANOMAD syndrome is a rare， immune-mediated， demyelinating poly neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[17-19]</u>. The clinical features include a chronic or sub acute neuropathy with marked sensory ataxia and are flexia， typically with relatively preserved motor function. Occulo motor and bulbar motor palsies may also be present either as fixed or relapsing-remitting features 通用删除6(英):<u>[24，25]</u>. Electrophysiological and nerve conduction studies demonstrate demyelinating and axonal neuropathies and immunological assays almost always detect the presence of a paraprotein together with anti-GQ1b and anti-disialosyl antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. Inflammatory peripheral neuropathies， paraneoplastic neuropathies and chronic Miller-Fisher syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis as they may also feature demyelination due to an autoimmune or paraneoplastic process. Treatment responses have been reported with the use of intravenous immunoglobulin， rituximab and plasma exchange in some cases although response duration is often brief删除4-1:<u>20，27</u>.\n\n【22】Although， in this case， the positive GD1a， GD1b and GQ1b IgM assay together with ataxia and opthalmoplegia were consistent with CANOMAD syndrome， the balance of opinion was against this for several reasons. Firstly， the onset and progression were more acute than the classical， slowly progressing disorder with relapsing and remitting symptoms and a mean duration of 13 years. Secondly， a loss of motor function， not dyskinaesthesia， was the prominent clinical feature， which is not typical for CANOMAD. Finally， the lack of detectable paraprotein was also against the diagnosis.\n\n【23】Relapsed MCL with leptomeningeal infiltration was also a possible explanation. Central nervous system infiltration has a crude incidence of approximately 1% at diagnosis and 4 to 20% overall in MCL 通用删除6(英):<u>[28-32]</u>.Weakness， confusion， ocular disturbance andheadache are the most common presenting features and CSF cytology or flow cytometry are often but not always positive， even when specific radiographic lesions are present 通用删除6(英):<u>[29，30]</u>. Leptomeningeal disease(positive cytology with normal neuro-radiological imaging) is more删除1换行frequent than parenchymal disease in MCL 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>.Although CNS MCL was suspected in this case， it was not possible to prove this from CSF analysis or neuro-radiological imaging.\n\n【24】A late complication ofallogeneic transplantation such as infection were considered unlikely in the absence of a detectable infectious agent； a lack of constitutional upset and the patient's subsequent improvement with immunosuppression.\n\n【25】The most likely diagnosis wastherefore a paraneoplastic， motor-dominantpolyneuropathy due tO anti-ganglioside， onconeural antibodies associated with relapsed MCL. Previously described treatments for PNS， including plasma-exchange and immunosuppression， have historically yielded only short-lived responses 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，33]</u>. Furthermore， chemo-immunotherapy to treat the underlying malignancy is often difficult or inappropriate to deliver in this context because of co-existing morbidity or typically poor performance status 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>.\n\n【26】In this case， although multiple immunomodulatory therapies， including rituximab， were initiated， an objective improvement was first observed on initiation of ibrutinib and before rituximab therapy.\n\n【27】Ibrutinib is an orally active， irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase， an intracellular protein downstream of the B cell receptor (BCR) responsible for regulation of cell-signalling， proliferation， migration and homing 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>. It has been shown to have potent activity against a number of B-cell malignancies， particularly chronic lymphocytic leukaemia， Waldenstroms macroglobulinemia and MCL 通用删除6(英):<u>[351</u>.Ibrutinib is veryeffective and well tolerated in relapsed/refractory MCL with an overall response rate of 68% as a single agent 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>. It has also been proven to penetrate the CNS at clinically effective levels using a standard therapeutic oral dose and recent studies have yielded encouraging results in the treatment of MCL with CNS relapse 通用删除6(英):<u>[37，38]</u>. The safety and efficacy of ibrutinib has not been previously evaluated in this context， although the suppression of onconeural antibody secretion by neoplastic B-lymphocytes is a plausible mechanism of action.\n\n【28】As this case demonstrates， ibrutinib is well tolerated， even in patients with significant co morbidities and can be administered via a feeding tube. It was therefore a rational choice of therapy in this case and led to remission duration comparable with more intensive therapies sometimes used in MCL with CNS involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】Paraneoplastic neurological disease is a rare complication of MCL and can be associated with anti-ganglioside antibodies as described in this case. Ibrutinib， in association with immunosuppressive therapy for paraneoplastic complications， is a safe and effective therapeutic option in the context of relapsed MCL with significant co-existing morbidities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However， it’s rare to see secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) during the AITL progression. We reported an AITL case proceeding to AML during the initial treatment and summarized the AML cases secondary to AITL from the literature.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 77-year-old woman presented with lymphadenopathies for one year； the lymph nodal biopsy and immunohistochemistry staining confirmed the AITL diagnosis without RHOAG17V and IDH2R172 mutations and excluded bone marrow infiltrated. After four courses of CHOP regimen treatment， the patient achieved a partial response. However， the bone marrow was observed the remarked increase of monoblasts， exceeding 70% of total monocytic linage， making the acute monocytic leukemia diagnosis.

As the AITL is derived from Follicular T Helper (TFH) cell in the germinal center， the dysregulated function of malignant TFH affects the Tumor Microenvironment (TME)， leading to the aberrance of differentiation and function of B cell in follicle 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In rare cases， we could see the malignant transformation of B cells in TME under the different disease stage of AITL， like diffuse large B celllymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. However， it's rare to see secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) during the AITL progression. Here， we reported an AITL case proceeding to AML during the initial treatment and summarized the AML cases secondary to AITL from the literature.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 77-year-old woman presented withbilateral cervical enlarged lymph nodes， without any other symptom for one year. As the growth of the lymph node， the patient appeared fatigued， anorexia and dyspnea， and peripheral blood test found the decrease of the platelet. To definite diagnosis， a left cervical lymph node excision biopsy revealed diffuse hyperplasia of medium-sized atypical lymphocytes and increased small blood vessels with branches and swelling endothelium. Atypical lymphocytes were positive for CD3，CD5，CD4，Bcl-6，CXCL-13，PD-1，CD30，and Ki-67 index 60%， negative for CD20， CD8，and CD10.

F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) indicated that lymph nodes from cervical， axilla and celiac were involved with the maximum SUV value 2.67. The invasion was excluded from the bone marrow detection via aspirate， biopsy， and Flow Cytometry(FCM). Several examinations were performed， including plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA (positive， less than 50 copies/mL)， serum anti-nuclear antibody (positive，1：320)，serum protein electrophoresis and immune fixation electrophoresis (without monoclonal protein). We initiated treatment with CHOP (cyclophosphamide，pirarubicin， vincristine， and prednisone) for chemotherapy and recombinant huiman GranulocyteColony-Stimulating Factor (rhG-CSF) preventionfor neutropenia； thepatient achieved Partial Response(PR) through enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) evaluation after 2courses. Before the fifth course oftreatment， the patient was admitted to the emergence department in our hospital with gingival bleeding， epistaxis， and ecchymoses； peripheral blood detection presented：white blood cell 49.74×10/L， neutrophils 32.33×10/L， platelet 29×10/L. Considering the growth of peripheral white blood cells (71.47x 10/L) and disease progression， we performed the bone marrow detection and found remarked increase of monoblast， exceeding 70%of total monocytes (AML-M5)， further FCM confirmed the diagnosis of acute monocytic leukemia . As the disease progressed rapidly， the patient died five days after diagnosis. The cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide and Adriamycin liposomes was 3300 mg and130 mg. From the initial diagnosis of AITL to the diagnosis of acute monocytic leukemia was seven months.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\nAITL has multifaced clinical manifestations， probably due to its complex T'ME. Our case presented another face in AITL development and progression. To better understand the relationship between|删除段之间换行|AITL and AML， we searched the literature， found 5 AML cases secondary to AITL. For the 5 cases and the one we presented here， the median year was 64.5-years-old， the ratio of male to female 1：1， AML occurred during， after the initial treatment， in disease relapse and after ASCT . Two patients detected the gene alternation in AITL samples， found TET2CL2B9Y，TET211B99S\"9， DNMT3AR77， RUNX1A329S'271，ARID1BS914N，DDX3XV526A，NFE2T31BA， ROBO1G904R with more than 20% Variant Allele Frequency (VAF). It found no gene rearrangement related to acute myeloid leukemia in 4 patients， of which 1 patient had the same mutated gene as in AITL. The overall survival time after AML was diagnosed was very short， not exceeding13 months.\n\n【15】Recently， Lewis et al. reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>thatTET2，DNMT3Amutations in Clonal Hematopoiesis (CH) is prevalent in AITL that may give rise to both AITL and AML. In their follow-up， 1 AITL patient developed with AML， suggesting that TET2，DNMT3A mutation in Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HST)， and further chemotherapy may associate with secondary AML in some AITL cases. In our case， we found no RHOAGl7V and IDH2R172 mutations in AITL tumor cells. and did not detect the TET2 and DNMT3A mutations in both AITL and AML cells.\n\nAML can arise from patients with hematological disorders(mainly NHL) or as a consequence of prior therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Xu et al. reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> that 10-year cumulative incidence of AML secondary to Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) was 0.7%， most of which were aggressive B-NHL. Those who aged ≥45-years-old (HR 3.77， 95%CI， 1.395-10.191， p=0.009) or received more than eight cycles of chemotherapy (HR 3.76， 95% CI， 1.472-9.557，p=0.006) had increased risk of leukemia. Additionally， it has been reported that alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors are the main drugs to therapy-related AML， the average latency period was 5-10 years (alkylating agents) or 1 to 5 years (topoisomerase II inhibitors) 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Our patient presented with AML during the initial chemotherapy course. The|删除段之间换行|Conclusion\n\n【17】We presented a rare case of AITL， indicating that secondary AML could occur not only after but also during the treatment of AITL. The alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors are the primary drugs for treatment-related AML， exploring the new treatment regimen to avoid the treatment-related AML in AITL are warranted.

Chest X ray revealed pleural effusion and subsequently a CT scan of abdomen and chest  confirmed right pleural effusion and showed a paramediastinic nodule (16x 18 mm) in absence of ascites or abdominal mass， and the uterus and the ovaries were described as normal. A PET/CT showed slight increased uptake in the paramediastinal lesion and in the right parietal pleura， without other area of pathological accumulation in the remaining part of the body. She underwent a video-assisted-thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies. The biopsy material consisted of fragments of parietal pleura with chronic fibrosing pleuritis and foci of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma both infiltrating the connective tissue  and superficially spreading between the reactive mesothelium . Neoplastic cells were focally aggregated in papillary structures containing occasional psammoma bodies . No benign tubal epithelium was described in the pleura. A similar histopathological picture imposes a differential diagnosis between a metastatic carcinoma， conceivably from ovary or lung and a mesothelioma.

Lauchlan 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> extensively described these lesions in 1972， hypothesizing the existence of the \"secondary miillerian system\". Extregenital millerian neoplasms have been reported not only in women， but also in men 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. In literature there is only another case of a miillerian tumor originating from the pleura， and not from ovaries or peritoneum. This could be explained in that also pleura share the same embryological origin of the peritoneum.\n\n【15】In our case， pleural biopsies revealed a neoplastic epithelial component forming papillary structures and containing psammoma bodies. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for WT-1， BerEp4， MOC-31， PAX-8， ER； negativity for： calretinin， TTF-1，HBME-1， D2-40， cytokeratin 5/6， caldesmon， cytokeratin 20， CD 141. Overall， the staining for epithelial glycoproteins (Ber-EP4 and MOC-31)and the lack of calretinin and CK5/6 staining was felt not to support a mesothelial differentiation. Immunohistochemistry contrasted also with a pulmonary origin (TTF1-). Positivity of ER， WT-1 and PAX-8 was highly suggestive for pleural malignant miillerian neoplasm. Fewspecific immunohistochemical markers are available for删除1换行carcinomas of miillerian origin. ER， PR and WT1 have been used in combination with other immunohistochemical markers to suggest possible millerian origin， however， their relatively low specificity is well known. ER and PR are present in breast carcinomas in addition to other gynecologic tumors. WT1， a nuclear transcription factor important for the development of the miillerian duct system， has been used as a surrogate marker for ovarian carcinoma. WT1 is also detected in benign and malignant mesothelial cells. PAX8 is a member of the PAX gene family encoding for nine well-characterized transcription factors. PAX8 is detected in the specialized precursor cells of the millerian ducts in the coelomic epithelium in the early embryonic stage 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. The millerian ducts subsequently separated from the coelomic epithelium， grow caudally and in female fetus eventually become fused at the midline to form the uterine corpus and cervix and the upper third of vagina. The non-fused portions form the fallopian tubes and fimbrial ends. Remnants of the most proximal miillerian ducts that do not participate in organogenesis constitute the secondary miillerian system which is hypothesized to be the source of ovarian and paraovarian disorders including the so called miillerianosis (endometriosis， endocervicosis and endosalpingiosis)， epithelial ovary carcinomas and peritoneal serous carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. All these tissues， both normal， ectopic and neoplastic， consistently express PAX通用删除6(英):<u>8 3，6]</u>.\n\n【16】Therefore PAX8 is a very useful marker for diagnosingcarcinomas of Mullerian origin in serous effusions， whichcan help us to distinguish betweenmiillerianffiromnon-miillerian origin1ofmetastatic carcinoma (including breast， lung， pancreas， gastrointestinal tract and malignant mesothelioma)通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>. Conceivably the case described herein and the other reported so far 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> might be derived from embryonic remnants of the cranial portion of the primitive coelomic epithelium. In our patient it was decided to administer chemotherapy with carboplatin-paclitaxel and bevacizumab， as miillerian tumors of ovarian or peritoneal origin typically are responsive to this regimen.

{"seq_id": "784be887-a9da-478d-a90b-b2bcb0895889", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】In this review we describe the incidence， presentation，available methods for early diagnosis and the different treatment options for management of interstitial ectopic pregnancy and how to distinguish this type of ectopic pregnancy from other pregnancies that implant laterally in the uterus. A case of viable interstitial ectopic pregnancy treated with intramuscular methotrexate is presented and used to critically discuss its management in the light of the presented evidence and we concluded by highlighting some practical points in reporting， diagnosing and managing interstitial ectopic pregnancy.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Many authors in the published literature use the terms “cornual”and “interstitial”pregnancy interchangeably for pregnancies implanted laterally in the uterus 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. Others reserved the term cornual pregnancy to describe pregnancy in one horn of a bicornuate uterus or a septate uterus or in a rudimentary horn of a unicornuate uterus 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. These terms are also frequently confused with the term angular pregnancy， in which the pregnancy is also implanted laterally in the uterus but the implantation is medial to utero-tubal junction and the round ligament of the uterus 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Some authors consider the term angular pregnancy is obsolete as it simply refers to a normal intrauterine pregnancy that happens to be located laterally within the uterine cavity and be carried to term 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. While other considers this type of pregnancy to either develop directly over the tubal opening or more probably， in the interstitial portion of the tube immediately external to that opening and then grows into the adjacent uterine cavity， thus considering angular pregnancy as a continuation of an interstitial pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. Angular pregnancy can progress to second trimester or even to term but is associated with high rates of spontaneous abortion， uterine rupture， and placenta accreta， with rupture occurring in as many as 23.5% of all angular pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【4】Definitions and Anatomy\n\n【5】Anatomically， the interstitial part of the fallopian tube (the intramural portion) is 0.7 mm wide and approximately 1 cm-2 cm long with a slightly tortuous course within the muscular wall of the uterus extending obliquely upward and outward from the uterine cavity. Therefore， an interstitial ectopic pregnancy is defined as pregnancy implanted in the interstitial portion of the fallopian tube that is within the muscular wall of the uterus， lateral to the round ligament of the uterus 1，2，10.\n\n【6】Incidence\n\n【7】The incidence of interstitial pregnancy varies between 2 to 4% of all ectopic implantations and one in every 2500-5000 live births 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，11-14]</u>. The interchangeable use of the terms cornual， angular and interstitial pregnancy in literatures may have created problems in the reported incidence of interstitial ectopic pregnancy. The frequency of interstitial ectopic pregnancy is increasing steadily with the increasing use of assisted reproductive technologies 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，15]</u>. The predisposing factors for interstitial ectopic pregnancies include： pelvic inflammatory disease， previous ipsilateral or bilateral salpingectomy， previous ectopic and pelvic surgery， tumours， uterine anomalies and in vitro fertilization 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【8】Delayed diagnosis of interstitial pregnancy is the main factor contributing to the high maternal mortality rate in comparison to that for tubal ectopic pregnancies； the mortality rate for tubal ectopic pregnancy was reported to be 0.14%， whilst that for interstitial pregnancy was reported to be nearly 15 times higher， at 2%-2.5%通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【9】Presentation\n\n【10】Interstitial ectopic pregnancy can present with the classic symptoms of ectopic pregnancy namely， amenorrhoea， vaginal bleeding， and abdominal pain， but the last two symptoms may not arise in some un-ruptured interstitial ectopic pregnancies which could remain asymptomatic for several weeks because the interstitial portion of the tube can expand more than other tubal segments before it ruptures 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【11】In a retrospective review of 109 cases of interstitial ectopic pregnancy 54.5% of patients presented with abdominal pain， 22.7%with vaginal spotting and 20.5% were asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\n\n【12】Because interstitial ectopic pregnancy is located in the upper lateral area of the uterus where there is extensive uterine-ovarian vessels anastomosis it results in catastrophic haemorrhage when ruptured 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. This explains the higher mortality rate of this type of ectopic pregnancy and highlights the need for early diagnosis.\n\n【13】Diagnosis\n\n【14】Interstitial ectopic pregnancy remains one of the most difficult gestations to diagnose. Eccentrically located intrauterine gestational sac can be misinterpreted as interstitial pregnancy on ultrasound evaluation. Even when interstitial pregnancy is suspected on ultrasound scan (US)， laparoscopic findings may be negative in early stages and present a diagnostic dilemma 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，20]</u>.\n\n【15】US identification of the interstitial portions of the two tubes is very helpful to exclude the diagnosis of unicornuate uterus and is essential for making the diagnosis of interstitial pregnancy. By examining the fundal aspect of the uterus in a transverse section， the interstitial tubes can be identified as thin hyper echoic lines extending from the lateral aspect of the uterine cavity through the myometrium towards the uterine serosa 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. They can be seen routinely in women with intrauterine pregnancies <7 weeks' gestation. In women with extra-uterine pregnancies， the uterine position and size are usually not affected by the growth of pregnancy and therefore it is possible to identify the interstitial segments of the tube as late as the second trimester of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\nUS findings consistent with interstitial gestation include an eccentrically located gestational sac at the superior fundal level of the uterus at least 1 cm from the lateral edge of the uterine cavity surrounded by asymmetrical thin (<5 mm) myometrial tissue with a distinct and separate empty uterine cavity， and the “interstitial line sign\"， an echogenic line that extends into the upper regions of the uterine horn and borders the margin of the intramural|删除段之间换行|An editorial suggested adaptation of two ultrasound findings for diagnosing interstitial ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>： 1) visualization of the删除1换行interstitial line adjoining the gestational sac and the lateral aspect of the uterine cavity； and 2) the continuation of myometrial mantle around the ectopic sac .\n\n【17】A recent review of 11 cases of interstitial pregnancies found that the presence of a cornual mass in the absence of any evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy is the most significant finding with a sensitivity of 80%. However， they acknowledged that sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between interstitial pregnancy and a tubal ectopic pregnancy on two dimensional ultrasound scan 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>.\n\n【18】Three-dimensional ultrasonography (3D scan) was shown to be an important diagnostic tool as it may depict precise location of the interstitial gestational sac differentiating it from eccentrically located intrauterine gestational sac as compared to other imaging modalities 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. The use of colour flow Doppler in combination with scan may reveal the presence of a vascular ring， which proved an intense peripheral vascularization around the interstitial gestation通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can also be used in non-urgent cases and for evaluation of cases in which ultrasound scans have been inconclusive. The main advantage of MRI as compared with ultrasound is the ability to visualize the whole uterus， and thus identify the exact site of implantation. The gestational sac is located eccentrically in the uterine fundus and is surrounded by asymmetric thin myometrium. Distinction between an angular pregnancy and an interstitial pregnancy can sometimes be difficult. However， in early interstitial pregnancy the presence of an intact junctional zone between the uterine cavity and the lesion (the gestation) is suggestive of an interstitial location  通用删除6(英):<u>[5，23]</u>. In second trimester the|删除段之间换行|Differential diagnosis\n\n【20】Diagnosis can be delayed due to the difficulty of distinguishing an interstitial pregnancy from other laterally implanted pregnancies including an eccentricaly located intrauterine gestational sac . In early pregnancy，3D scan can be utilized to help identifying the precise location of the gestational sac 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>.\n\n【21】Differential diagnosis with an angular pregnancy is acritical aspect. While an interstitial pregnancy is implanted in the uterine portion of the tube， angular pregnancy is an intrauterine pregnancy located near the utero-tubal junction. Anatomically， these two ectopic pregnancies cause a different uterine distortion： Usually the angular pregnancy leads to a bulge medial to the round ligament， and the interstitial one determines a lateral bulge 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Clinically， given the intrauterine location of angular pregnancies as described above and the enveloping myometrium， these patients are likely to present with symptoms later than patients with other types of ectopic pregnancies. On US examination the myometrium is thicker in angular pregnancies and has at least 5 mm or more of myometrium surrounds all sides of the sac while in interstitial pregnancies it is thinner <5 mm and present only in the supero-lateral portion of the sac 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，17]</u>.\n\n【22】At MRI， angular pregnancy appears as gestational sac implanted in the lateral angle of the uterus and can be confused with normal pregnancies. This gestational sac will be completely surrounded by uterine myometrium， although focal thinning is sometimes seen. High signal intensity in the uterine wall itself can represent intramural haemorrhage. It is also important to look for placental invasion of the myometrium because placenta accreta is frequently seen in these patients. Given the propensity for rupture， it is also importantto look for myometrial discontinuity and hemoperitoneum whenever angular pregnancy is suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【23】Treatment\n\n【24】Medical management with methotrexate has been used as删除表格换行first-line treatment in appropriate cases. A strict inclusion criteria(early gestation， diameter <4 cm， serum beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) of <10，000 IU/l， no evidence of rupture) was suggested and treatment was shown to be success in cases that satisfy these criteria and in women who are able to be monitored for a quite long time after treatment and treated further if required 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【25】Table 1： The

potential advantage ofavoidingsurgery and with an increased likelihood of preserving fertility. Systemic injection of methotrexate(MTX) is the most extensively studied medical regimen. This drug has been administered either a single dose or in a multiple-dose删除1换行fashion with reasonable success and also administered in a localized fashion， with both US and laparoscopic guidance 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. The systemic route of administration offers advantages over local injection of the ectopic gestation in that it is less invasive and not operator dependent. Follow-up may need to be prolonged after medical treatment of interstitial pregnancy as the initial hCG values tend to be higher than those encountered with tubal ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Other medical treatments showing some success include potassium chloride and prostaglandins， both injected directly into the gestational sac during ultrasonographic visualization.\n\n【28】Medical treatment of ectopic pregnancy has a failure rate of up to 35% and rupture of the ectopic pregnancy is also possible during删除1换行methotrexate treatment even in the face of decreasing hCG values通用删除6(英):<u>[25-27]</u>. Surgery is indicated when patient refuse， failed or unsuitable for medical treatment， in the presence of significant symptoms， in ruptured cases or in large interstitial ectopic with the presence of a heartbeat 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>.\n\n【29】In the past， laparotomy with either hysterectomy or cornual resection was advocated. Recently， options such as laparoscopic cornuostomy (incision of the cornual region)， or cornuectomy(resection of the cornual region of the uterus and the suturing of the incision site) have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[18，19]</u>. The current trend is to use conservative surgical alternatives to cornual resection in an attempt to increase future fertility and decrease the risk ofuterine rupture during a subsequent pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. These conservative surgical treatments successfully used combination of hysteroscopic， laparoscopic and ultrasound guided transcervical evacuation of interstitial ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[28，29]</u>.\n\n【30】Intraoperative bleeding remains a major problem for laparoscopic management of interstitial ectopic pregnancies， because of the rich supply of blood vessels at the location of the interstitial ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\n\n【31】Various haemostatic techniques have been attemptedfor the control of bleeding. These have included intracorporeal and extracorporeal suturing， endoloop or encircling suture before evacuation of conception， electrosurgey in addition to diluted vasopressin injection， fibrin glue， a harmonic scalpel and uterine artery embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>[18，30- 34]</u>. Successful laparoscopic management of interstitial ectopic pregnancies using the automatic stapler to simultaneously excise and stitch the uterine cornua has also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>.\n\n【32】One of the key challenges after laparoscopic surgery is the persistent trophoblastic activity even after cornual resection which may be due to increased myometrial invasion in some interstitial ectopic pregnancies.This hasbeen treatedsuccessfully with methotrexate 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，19]</u>.\n\n【33】Prognosis\n\n【34】The mortality rate for interstitial pregnancy was reported to be 15 times more than the mortality rate of tubal ectopic； this was attributed to delayed diagnosis of interstitial pregnancy but may also be due to confusion with angular and cornual pregnancies which tend to rupture at a later stage 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，17，23]</u>.\n\n【35】Persistently high serum Beta hCG afterlaparoscopic management has been treated with methotrexate 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. Recurrence of interstitial ectopic pregnancy after medical or laparoscopic treatment including conservative laparoscopic surgery or laparoscopic corneal resection has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[18，31]</u>.\n\n【36】Ruptureduterus during subsequent pregnancy has been reported after spontaneous resolution and after surgical treatment of interstitial pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[36，37]</u>. The drawback to cornual resection and suturing is the use of a full-thickness uterine wall incision (as in hysterotomy)and when electrosurgery is used；the depth of a thermal damage is difficult to be assessed. This has prompt many surgeons to recommend elective caesarean delivery in subsequent pregnancies to decrease the risk of uterine rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>[19，37]</u>. However， successful vaginal delivery have also been reported after both cornual resection Wwith suturing of the uterine defect and laparoscopic cornuostomy in which the uterine wall was left open for secondary healing 通用删除6(英):<u>[31，38，39]</u>.\n\n【37】Case Presentation\n\n【38】A 37 years old women， G8P6+1 presented after 6 weeks of amenorrhea to the ultrasound department. US showed 10 mm gestational sac containing viable fetal pole with a crown rump length(CRL) of 3.4 mm corresponding to 6 weeks gestation. The gestational sac was seen at the right cornual aspect of the uterus and a diagnosis of right sided viable cornual ectopic was reported . She was admitted for further assessment. She was asymptomatic with normal stable vital signs， her hemoglobin was 13.2 mg/dl and her hCG level was 8735 mIU/ml. In view of viable cornualpregnancy and high hCG levels the patient was counselled re surgical treatment as the first option but she declined that option. Medical treatment with intramuscular methotrexate was discussed and she opted for that. She agreed to stay in hospital during medical treatment and have surgery only if developed pain， her vital signs deteriorate and her hemoglobin dropped. She was kept at hospital. According to unit protocol she was given 90 mg Intramuscular (IM) methotrexate and remained stable with no pain in the hospital until day 4 after methotrexate injection. Her serum hCG increased to 13469 miU/ml. She remained asymptomatic with normal vital signs and no change to herhaemoglobin levels till day 7. Her hCG on day 7 dropped to 10137mIU/ml. A repeat US showed re-demonstration of right sided cornual pregnancy with CRL equivalent to 7 weeks gestation but no fetal heart beat was detected with the presence of Sub chorionic hematoma measuring 1.0 cm x 0.3 cm and reduced peripheral vascularity on colour flow Doppler . In view of the good response to IM methotrexate with a drop of >15% in hCG level and the US findings\n\n【39】Discussion\n\n【40】The case presented was successfully managed with systemic methotrexate. This case report and other have confirmed the successful use of methotrexate in treating early interstitial ectopic pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2，24，25]</u>. The presence of fetal heart beats in this case confirmed that medical treatment can be used successfully in early viable interstitial ectopic pregnancy even in the presence of detectable fetal heart beats with serum beta hCG of over 8000 mIU/ml. This is in contrast to other papers suggesting that the presence of fetal heart beat is a contraindication to medical management 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. In the case presented US did not report any of the sonographic diagnostic criteria described in the literatures above for diagnosing interstitial ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3，6，23]</u>. There was no use of the available 3D US to confirm diagnosis and the term Cornual instead of interstitial ectopic was used. However， the use of colour flow Doppler during follow up and demonstration of reduced flow and vascularity around the gestational sac was helpful to encourage continuation with medical management. The case reported declined surgical treatment and agreed to stay inpatient after the medical treatment until it was felt safe to discharge her for outpatient monitoring. She had 6 weekly visits over 47 days after the IM methotrexate until she was discharged from follow up. This prolonged follow up requires patient motivation and may not be suitable to all women.\n\n【41】Conclusion\n\n【42】The term cornual pregnancy should not be used to descript interstitial ectopic pregnancy inliteratures.Researchersand editors should adhere to this so the true incidence and the different management modality outcomes for interstitial ectopic pregnancy can be accurately reported.\n\n【43】Sonographers should be encouraged to look for the described the sonographic diagnostic criteria and document these in their report to increase clinician`s confidence with the diagnosis especially in asymptomatic patients with viable pregnancy and high serum beta hCG levels. If3 D scan is available this should also be used as it may increases the diagnostic accuracy.\n\n【44】Women suitable for medical management of interstitial ectopic pregnancy should be informed that medical management with systemic methotrexate for early viable interstitial ectopic pregnancy can be successful but post treatment follow up can be prolonged and they need to agree to that before offering the treatment.\n\n【45】The available literature do not provides agreed guidance regarding future pregnancy risks and optimum mode of delivery following treatment of interstitial ectopic pregnancy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The onset of SSPE usually occurs in children less than one year of age and is comparatively rare in adults. The disease is fatal accounting for a mortality rate of more than 95%. It has a variety of clinical presentations ranging from behavioral change to coma， which makes the diagnosis challenging. A combination of investigational procedures like MRI， EEG， demonstration of elevated measles antibody titers in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and serum plays the key role to segregate from its other differentials. It is more common in developing nations due to scarce vaccination， owing to the lack of awareness and low socioeconomic status. Herein，we report a case of newly diagnosed SSPE in a 32-year-old female who presented with fever， altered sensorium， and recurrent seizure episodes. Adult-onset SSPE is very rare and there are very few case reports on it. Though the neuroimaging findings were normal， the EEG gave us a clue towards the diagnosis. It was later confirmed by measles antibody titers in CSF and serum. The patient was conscious and oriented on discharge. She was advised with interferon-2b and regular follow-up visits were scheduled for close monitoring of the symptoms.\n\n【2】Keywords： Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis； EEG；Adult-onset； Seizures\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) is a slow， irreversible neurodegenerative sequela of a hypermutated wild measles virus infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Children under the age of 1 year have a higher risk of getting the disease when compared to adults. The risk of acquiring SSPE increases ifthe onset of measles is preferably at a younger age， in lower socio-economic class， poor immunity status， and with overcrowding 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The clinical characteristic ofthe disease is marked by behavioral change，focal or generalized seizure， ataxia which might progress to a persistent vegetative state. The incidence of SSPE in developed countries like the USA is less than 10 cases per 100，000 measles infections per year while it is as high as 210 cases per year in India 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The mortality rate of SSPE is 95% and most patients survive only 1 to 3 years after diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The global prevalence of SSPE has diminished to less than 70 cases per 100，000 due to robust immunization coverage. Cases are underreported in many areas due to a lack of resources and awareness 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. In the past few years， there has been a re-emergence of the measles virus in developed countries. This is significantly attributed to reduced vaccination due to vaccine hesitancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 32-year-old female with low socio-economic status presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever， chills， and altered sensorium. Her relatives gave a history of severe bilateral proximal myoclonic jerks followed by generalized tonic-clonic seizures on the day of admission. She has had a history ofrecurrent seizure episodes for the past three years with a progressive decline in cognition. She had no signs ofcranial nerve involvement and her visions， as well as eye movements， were normal. The patient had a history of measles in childhood with doubtful measles vaccination status and unremarkable family history.\n\n【7】Clinical examination revealed a disoriented patient with severe disability (MRS=5) and a GCS score of 6/15.

Blood culture was negative in both aerobic and anaerobic mediums. The MRI sequences had normal signal intensity with no evidence of abnormal enhancement in any region of the brain. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) study depicted normal levels of glucose， protein and white blood cells. The CSF measles IgG antibody (19656.4 IU/ml) &serum measles IgG titer (14929.4IU/ml) was elevated but negative for all possible autoantibodies including ANA， anti-NMDAR， lupus，etc. The CSF globulin was raised (25.8 mg/dl) and more than 20% of the total CSF protein (34 mg/dl). Electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed bilaterally synchronous sharp wave complexes of 150 uV to 200 uV with a short interval of 0.2 sec to 0.4 sec on a slow background-an atypical EEG finding . Therefore， a diagnosis of Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) was made. The patient was managed with weekly doses ofintrathecalInterferon 2b (6 million IU) and Isoprinosine 20 mg/kg in three divided doses daily. Antiepileptic drugs like Brivaracetam (4 mg/kg) and sodium valproate (20 mg/kg) in two divided doses were ordered to control ongoing seizures and prevent future episodes.删除2换行was established. She was intubated and resuscitation measures with IV fluids， continuous infusion noradrenaline (4u mg/min) as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics like piperacillin/tazobactam and clindamycin were started immediately. The patient was conscious， stable， and afebrile on discharge. She was advised to complete the course of weekly Interferon 2b by scheduling follow-up visits and her symptoms were monitored closely.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】SSPE is a long-term neurological complication of measles that points to the existence of incomplete measles vaccine coverage and illustrates potentialchallenges such as incomplete coverage in hard-to-reach populations and vaccine hesitancy among parents of children. Long-term neurological sequela of measles arranged in chronological order ofpresentation include Acute Measles encephalomyelitis which occurs approximately a week after onset of rash， Measles inclusion body encephalitis typically presents 3 weeks to 6 months after initial infection and SSPE occurs 1 to 15 years after primary infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\nFollowing discharge， a few weeks later， she presented with shortness of breath， high-grade fever， and confusion.

Atypical presentations have been described including isolated psychiatric manifestations， poorly controlled seizures， and isolated extrapyramidal symptoms， such as dystonia， chorea， and hemiparkinsonism.\n\nIn our patient， the presence of high titers of measles IgG in the|删除段之间换行|CSF (major) along with the presence of chronic progressive history with severe proximal myoclonic jerks and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (major) & CSF globulin greater than 20% of CSF protein(minor) points towards a diagnosis of SSPE by the Dyken criteria通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. However， there were some atypical findings in the EEG. In our patient，EEG revealed bilaterally synchronous sharp wave complexes of 150 uV to 200 uV with a short interval of 0.2 sec to 0.4 sec on a slow background. This EEG finding is atypical and has not been described before in the context of SSPE . Imaging studies， including MRI and CT scans， were also normal.\n\n【26】SSPE is typically a disease of childhood， presenting between 8 to11 years with subsequent clinical worsening leading to death usually within a few years of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Previous studies show mean survival in children to be around 1 year 9 months to 3 years after diagnosis. In adults， 20% survived beyond 4 years after diagnosis通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Our patient had a long latent period and was diagnosed late， at the age of 32 years. Fewer than 100 cases of adult-onset SSPE have been reported. It has often been attributed to diagnostic delay due to consideration of alternate diagnoses due to the atypical nature of the presentation and low index of suspicion. Previous studies have shown that adult-onset SSPE has a more atypical presentation with ophthalmological and behavioral disturbance being common. Although eventually fatal， adult-onset SSPE has better rates of remission and longer survival after diagnosis compared to classical juvenile-onset SSPE 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【27】SSPE is often diagnosed late， with a previous study stating that the mean duration to establish a diagnosis was 6.2±11.3 months. The study attributed the reasons for such a delay to low geographical prevalence， atypical features，low index of suspicion in adult patients， level of experience of healthcare personnel， acute onset as opposed to the usual indolent course， and fear of diagnosing a disease， which is routinely fatal 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.

Here we present a case of severe weight loss related by dapagliflozin， an antihyperglycemic medication through a mechanism of increasing urinary glucose excretion， in a patient with advanced lung cancer. An unusual feature in our case was that the patient continued to experience severe weight loss while the cancer was quite stable. Increased oral intake was unable to compensate the urinary glucose excretion， but the dose reduction worked， suggesting dapagliflozin as the main reason for weight loss. Our case highlights the usefulness of a full assessment of possible contributors to weight loss， even in patients with cachexia. Identification of reversible causes can have a major effect on the severity of weight loss and overall quality of life for cancer patients.\n\n【2】Keywords： Cancer cachexia； Dapagliflozin；Non-small cell lung cancer\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Patients with cancer cachexia frequently experience decreased quality of life， reduced chemotherapy tolerance， reduced physical functioning， and shortened survival 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Between 50%and 80% of patients with advanced cancer develop cachexia， with highest incidence reported in patients with lung and gastrointestinal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is commonly found in cancer patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The relationship between DM and cancer appears to be bidirectional： DM has been associated with an increased risk of developing several types of cancer while also cancer treatments， through the induction of metabolic derangements， can facilitate the onset of DM， or worsen glucose control 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. DM can negatively affect the clinical outcomes of these subjects， being associated with worse survival 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. However， there is the lack of specific guidelines for DM in cancer patients， a management of DM in cancer patients refer to the general guideline for DM. Dapagliflozin was the first drug in a class of therapies that took a new approach to glycemic control in adults with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). It can also be used for patients with cancer and T2D. Both patients with cancer and those with diabetes might experience weight loss， or cachexia. We present a case of severe weight loss， which was not caused by cancer or T2D， but caused by dapagliflozin， the antihyperglycemic medication.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】The patient is a 59-year-old male， 170 cm tall and weighing 53 kg with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. He was presented to Hubei Cancer Hospital， China， with an 8-kg， 13% weight loss over the past 6 months in October 2021.\n\nHe had been diagnosed with advanced adenocarcinoma 41 months before， and received first line chemotherapy of pemetrexed and cisplatin， followed by albumin-bound paclitaxel combined with pembrolizumab as second line therapy. He then continued pembrolizumab as maintenance therapy. Six months before he experienced weight loss and was diagnosed as diabetes with Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) at 22.6 mmol (406 mg/dL). He was diagnosed as T2D for he was negative for|删除段之间换行|FPG： Fasting Plasma Glucose； ONS： Oral Nutrition Supplement删除1换行glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody， islet cell antibody， and insulin autoantibody. He was first treated by metformin. Due to a severe side effect as diarrhea， he was then prescribed with dapagliflozin， an antihyperglycemic-Sodium Glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors， 10 mg orally. His serum glucose levels became stable at approximately 7.3 mmol/L (130 mg/dl)， but continued to experience severe weight loss.\n\n【8】On examination， his cancer was stable with the maintenance of pembrolizumab. His eating and exercise habits did not change throughout the treatment and he was not depressed. After a dietary survey， his daily dietary energy intake was appropriately 1，500 kcal， which was the same as usual. Oral Nutrition Supplement (ONS) with 500 kcal was added to his daily dietary. However， he lost 2 more kilograms within one month with additional ONS .\n\n【9】Sinceadditional ONS did noteliminate his weightloss， weassumed that his weight loss was caused by increased glucose excretion caused by dapagliflozin. His urine glucose was positive. Therefore， the dose of dapagliflozin was reduced to 5 mg and his weight stopped losing and became stable around 51 kg without any other contributors.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Weight loss in patients with cancer cachexia is due to a variable combination of decreased food intake and metabolic changes，leading to negative protein and energy balance 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Cancer cachexia can be seen in patients with normal food intake. Metabolic changes were the main mechanism in our patient rather than decreased food intake or increased energy expenditure. Weight loss without trying is one of the most common symptoms for T2D 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The diagnosis of diabetes was clear for this case due to hyperglycemia. However， this patient suffered weight loss related to dapagliflozin， rather than his diseases of diabetes or cancer. Special cautions of weight loss should be placed for those patients with cancer and diabetes， especially for those who undergo dapagliflozin.\n\n【12】Although the patient had a severe weight loss， he did not have any fatigue， anorexia， or sarcopenia. Taking together that his lab values such as serum C-reactive protein and albumin were at normal range during the treatment， he cannot be diagnosis with cachexia but only weight loss.\n\n【13】Dapagliflozin， an SGLT-2 inhibitors， is the latest glucose-lowering agents to become available. These drugs increase urinary删除1换行glucose excretion by inhibiting SGLT-2 in the renal proximal tubule通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Through a mechanism of glycosuria and urinary calorie loss of up to 320 kcal per day， substantial weight reduction was achieved when dapagliflozin was used 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. For this patient， we might assume that his urinary calorie loss is much more than 320 kcal especially when his weight loss continued with addiction of ONS with 500 kcal， but it was impossible to confirm it due to the limitation of our hospital， although his urine glucose was positive. His weight was rather stable when dapagliflozin was reduced to 5 mg without any concurrent medication.\n\n【14】Diabetes is one of the endocrine-related adverse events associated with immunotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Due to the potential mechanism that pancreatic beta cells destructed by immunotherapy， immunotherapy related diabetes is similar to classic type 1 diabetes generally 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. However， our case is negative for all the antibodies and is independent with insulin，which is more like T2D. Further researches，such as gene sequencing could be done in order to support the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. We focused on the weight loss and will not go further on this area.\n\n【15】Weight loss might be necessary for diabetes patients， but is not a good sign for advanced cancer patients. It could be confused with cancer cachexia， which is related to tumor mass and progressive disease. Normally cancer patients gain weight in association with tumor response to the anti-cancer treatment. An unusual feature was that in our case the patient continued to experience severe weight loss while the cancer was quite stable. Increased oral intake was not sufficient enough to compensate the urinary glucose excretion， but the dose reduction likely worked by reducing glucose excretion.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】Our case highlights the usefulness of a full assessment of possible contributors to weight loss， even in patients with cachexia. Special cautions should be paid for such a severe weight loss when advanced cancer patients with diabetes undergo dapagliflozin. A smaller dose， rather than the standard dose of dapagliflozin might be more suitable for them. Identification of reversible causes can have a major effect on the severity of weight loss and overall quality of life for cancer patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Despite the technical advances in thyroid surgery in recent years， Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve (RLN) injuries and associated permanent and transient nerve damage can impair the patient's quality of life， cause complications ranging from hoarseness to respiratory distress requiring tracheostomy， and impose medico-legal responsibilities on the surgeon. Temporary nerve damage is seen in 5% to 8% of cases， while permanent damage is seen in 0.3% to3% of cases. Intraoperative RLN injuries develop due to nerve cutting， nerve suturing， nerve traction， aspiration， compression， contusion， applied pressure， ischemia during tissue skeletonization， and electrothermal injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Receiving radiotherapy， recurrent surgeries， Graves disease， thyroiditis， large thyroid size， and retrosternal extension increase the risk of nerve injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Intraoperative Nerve Monitoring (IONM) has found widespread use all over the world to reduce nerve injuries， visualize the nerve， and determine intraoperative and postoperative treatments with information about its function 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> 通用删除7(英):<u>(2-13)</u>. It has found widespread use among endocrine surgeons in the last two decades， especially in terms of revealing the nerve， reducing transient nerve paralysis， and eliminating the risk of bilateral paralysis， and has changed surgical strategies 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【10】The most common early complication after thyroid surgery is hypocalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. It develops due to disruption of the parathyroid gland blood supply， iatrogenic removal of the parathyroid gland， interruption of venous drainage， dilutional hypocalcemia， or hungry bone syndrome. In studies， transient hypocalcemia is observed with a rate of 19% to 38%， while permanent hypocalcemia is observed with a rate of up to 3% 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. In the literature， female gender， recurrent operations， retrosternal location， advanced age， hyperthyroidism， malignant pathology， neck dissection， and删除1换行large thyroid gland are blamed for the factors that increase the risk of hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy. Apart from all these， prolonged operation time and failure to protect the parathyroid glands during surgery are also blamed for the development of hypocalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. At this point， it is likely that the use of the IONM device may predispose to postoperative hypocalcemia since parathyroid gland functions may be adversely affected due to the aforementioned reasons such as prolonged operation time and increased manipulations.\n\n【11】The aim of our retrospective study in terms of complications after thyroidectomy was to compare the effect of the use of IONM device on postoperative hypocalcemia that may develop postoperatively in the patient groups with and without the use of IONM device.\n\n【12】Materialand Method\n\n【13】In our study， the records of 612 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy by the same surgical team between January 2013 and January 2021 in the General Surgery Clinic of Memorial Kayseri Hospital were reviewed. The IONM device has been used in our center since June 2018. Retrospective information was obtained from the patients clinical files and hospital automation systems. Demographic data， radiologic imaging reports， serum biochemistry values， pathology reports， duration of surgery， IONM reports， and surgical records of the patients were analyzed. The approval of the study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Memorial Hospital. All patients who underwent IONM were informed about the operation and informed consent was obtained. Patients with previous thyroid surgery，patients who underwent radical neck dissection， patients who underwent unilateral total thyroidectomy and total complementary thyroidectomy， and 172 patients with comorbidities that may affect calcium values were excluded from the study. The surgical indication was not considered to be benign or malignant. Of the 440 eligible patients， 342 underwent thyroidectomy before the introduction of the IONM and 98 after the introduction of the IONM. Thus， We grouped the patients as those who underwent thyroidectomy without IONM device and those who underwent thyroidectomy with IONM. Homogeneous distribution was achieved between the groups in terms of patient characteristics， type of surgery and diagnoses. All patients underwent vocal cord examination preoperatively and 24h postoperatively.Postoperative 244-h calcium values were recorded. A calcium value below 8 mg/dl in the first 48 h postoperatively， tingling in the perioral region and fingers， muscle cramps， and prolonged QT interval on ECG were considered hypocalcemia. Asymptomatic hypocalcemic patients received only oral calcium after discharge， while symptomatic hypocalcemic patients received oral calcium and active vitamin D. Patients who needed calcium and vitamin D supplementation for more than two years were considered to have permanent hypocalcemia and those who needed less than two years of medical support were considered to have transient hypocalcemia通用删除6(英):<u>[8</u>.\n\nAll patients were operated by the same surgeon experienced in endocrine surgery (performing more than 100 thyroidectomies per year) and his team， and surgical decisions were made according to the 2015 American Thyroid Associations Guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. We did not estimate a learning period because the surgeon had been using the IONM device for two vears in another center. Patients were operated in the supine position with shoulders elevated， head back， and neck tense. All patients received a combination of inhalation and intravenous anesthesia. Intubation was performed with a Nerve Integrity Monitor (NIM) Standard Reinforced Electromyography|删除段之间换行|(EMG) Endotracheal Tube (Medtronic， Xomed， Jacksonville， FL， USA) with surface electrodes. Intubation was performed by the same anesthesia team to ensure the correct placement of the electrodes. Electrode impedance was routinely checked.\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】Of the 612 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy， 440patients who met the criteria were included in the study. Total thyroidectomy was performed in 342 (78%) patients without IONM device and 98 (22%) patients with IONM device. Of the patients，363 (82.5%) were female and 77 (17.5%) were male. The mean age was 49.2 years 通用删除7(英):<u>(20-87)</u> and the mean length of hospitalization was1.48 通用删除7(英):<u>(1-5)</u> days. While this period was 1.42 days before the use of IONM， this period increased to 1.7 days after the use ofIONM. The mean operative time was 118 minutes， which increased to 147 min in surgeries using IONM and 109.6 min in surgeries without IONM. Significant amplitude values were obtained at an average of 34.7min after incision. While 93 (21%) of our patients were operated for malignant pathology， the others were operated for benign reasons such as nodular colloidal goiter， follicular lesion， and thyroiditis. Among all our patients， only one patient (0.2%) in the non-IONM group developed permanent vocal cord paralysis. Thyroid tissue showed retrosternal extension in 32 (7%) of our patients， while 53(12%) patients underwent central lymph node dissection. During the follow-up period， 22 (5%) of our patients developed transient hypocalcemia， which resolved after medical treatment. Demographic data of the patients are summarized in Table 1. The mean postoperative24h-h biochemical calcium value was 8.93 mg/dL (6.15-10.9)， 9.05mg/dL (6.15-10.9) in patients without IONM and 8.5 mg/dL (6.6-10.6) in patients with IONM. A statistically significant difference was found between the groups in terms of calcium value， operation time， and age (p<0.05). Calcium values were also compared between groups according to whether the pathology was benign or malignant. In the group without IONM device， calcium values were 9.3 mg/dL(6.8-10.9) in patients operated for benign pathology and 8.7 mg/dL(6.1-10.6) in patients operated for malignant causes. Calcium values of 8.5 mg/dL (6.6-10.4) were observed in those operated for benign pathology and 8.4 mg/dL (7.0-10.6) in those operated for malignant删除表格换行pathology. Similarly， when calcium values were evaluated according to whether the thyroid gland was located retrosternally between the groups before and after IONM use， 9.2 mg/dL (6.1-10.2) was found in patients with retrosternal extension of thyroid tissue in the group without IONM and 9.2 mg/dL (6.3-10.9) in patients without retrosternal extension. In the group using IONM device， calcium values of 7.9 mg/dL (6.6-9.9) in patients with retrosternal extension and 8.6 mg/dL (6.6-10.6) in patients without retrosternal extension were reported. Statistically significant results were found when calcium values were compared with benign or malignant pathology in the group without IONM device (p<0.001). There was no significant difference between the retrosternal extension of thyroid tissue and calcium values between the groups with and without IONM device. Similarly， no significant difference was found between the calcium values of patients who underwent central lymph node dissection and the groups with and without IONM device. A significant difference was found between the groups in terms of length of hospitalization(p<0.05). Comparative results of the groups are shown in Table 2.\n\n【17】Table 1： Demographic and other characteristics of the patients.\n\n| Demographic and Other Characteristics  | n=440 (%)  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Age  | 49.2通用删除7(英):<u>(87-20)</u>  |\n| Gender  |  |\n| Female  | 363(82.5%)  |\n| Male  | 77(17.5%)  |\n| Thyroid Pathology  |  |\n| Benign  | 347 (79%)  |\n| Malignant  | 93(21%)  |\n| Retrosternal Extension  |  |\n| Yes  | 32(7%)  |\n| No  | 408 (93%)  |\n| ONM  |  |\n| Yes  | 98(22%)  |\n| No  | 342(78%)  |\n| Central Lymph Node Dissection  |  |\n| Yes  | 53(12%)  |\n| No  | 387 (88%)  |\n\n【19】Table 2： Patient characteristics between groups.\n\n|  | Total  | IONM  | IONM-free  | p-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Count  | 440  | 98  | 342  |  |\n| Mean age  | 49.2  | 43.05  | 51  | <0.001  |\n| Length of hospitalization (days)  | 1.48  | 1.7  | 1.42  | <0.05  |\n| Operation time (minutes)  | 118  | 147  | 109.6  | <0.001  |\n| Calcium values 24. h (mg/dL)  | 8.93  | 8.5  | 9.05  | <0.001  |\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】Total thyroidectomy is currently the standard surgical procedure for many thyroid diseases. Although it is accepted as a safe method， RLN injury that develops during thyroid surgery is considered as a major complication of thyroidectomy because it negatively affects the patient's postoperative quality of life and leads to medico-legal problems 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Intraoperative RLN injuries develop due to transection of the nerve， suturing of the nerve， nerve traction， aspiration， compression， contusion， applied pressure， ischemia during tissue skeletonization， and electrothermal injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. The largest multicenter study was conducted in Germany on 16，000 patients and it was reported that the use of IONM reduced the risk of nerve injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[10-12]</u>. Today， there is no doubt about the importance of knowing the anatomy of RLN in thyroid surgery and its protection during surgery. Despite all these advances， transient nerve injury is seen in 5% to 8% of patients， while permanent damage is seen in0.3% to 3% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. IONM has been widely used all over the world in recent decades to reduce nerve injuries， visualize the nerve， and determine intraoperative and postoperative strategies with information about its function 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Despite all these， the role and benefits of IONM use in thyroid surgery remain controversial. There is no consensus on the reduction in nerve injury rates in studies and meta-analyses conducted after the introduction of the IONM device 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14]</u>. However， a meta-analysis conducted in 2014 showed a decrease in nerve injury rates 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. In our study， permanent nerve injury developed in only one patient in the control group， and no permanent nerve injury was observed in the group using the IONM device.\n\n【23】Hypocalcemia is the most common complication after thyroid surgery and usually occurs in the first 24 h after surgery and may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. If hypocalcemia develops， patient删除1换行satisfaction decreases， the length of hospitalization increases，删除1换行hospital costs increase and health resources are consumed. The definition of postoperative hypocalcemia varies from study to study. In some studies， parathormone serum levels， tetany， and clinical symptoms are taken into consideration， while in others serum calcium levels are based on laboratory reference ranges. Mathur et al. have also shown that PTH levels are not safe in the evaluation of postoperative hypocalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[16，17]</u>. In the most recent studies， transient hypocalcemia is observed in 19% to 38%， while permanent hypocalcemia is observed in up to 3% 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. In the study by Mahenna et al.， the incidence of hypocalcemia in the same group was found between 0% to 46% due to inconsistencies in these definitions 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Hallgrimsen et al. also reported an increase in transient hypocalcemia due to prolonged operation time and enlargement of the dissection area， especially in patients undergoing thyroidectomy for Graves disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. In our study， transient hypocalcemia was observed in only 22 (5%) patients with lower rates than those reported in the literature. To date， there have been many studies investigating the causes of hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy， but they have not been fully clarified because of inconsistent definitions and heterogeneity of the studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. In our study， total thyroidectomy was performed in all patients with the same technique by the same experienced surgeon and anesthesia team to ensure homogeneity. At the same time， conditions that may affect calcium levels such as retrosternal extension， central lymph node dissection， and malignant pathology werehomogeneouslydistributedamongthe groups. In ourcomparison between the groups， a significant decrease in postoperative calcium values was observed in patients using the IONM device， possibly due to prolonged operation time. The mean calcium value of 8.93 mg/dL was 9.05 mg/dL in the group without IONM device and 8.5 mg/dL in the group with IONM device. Dissection around the parathyroid glands， dissections performed while identifying g RLN， venous stasis， and edema caused by ligation of thyroid veins may disrupt parathyroid functions and cause hypocalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. The hypothesis we formed based on this， especially the time until the RLN is detected with the IONM device (the time until significant amplitude occurs) prolongs the total duration of the operation and increases the risk of transient hypocalcemia because it will cause more tissue trauma， tissue edema， and increased inflammation while trying to detect the nerve. In our study， a significant difference was observed between prolonged operation time and calcium values (p<0.001). Female gender， recurrent operations， retrosternal localization， advanced age， hyperthyroidism， malignant pathology， neck dissection， prolonged operation time， failure to protect the parathyroid glands during surgery， and large thyroid gland have been accused among the factors that increase the risk of hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Many studies have searched for an answer to the predisposition to hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy in women， but although no clear conclusion could be obtained， it was thought that the effect of sex steroids on PTH secretion and genetic and anatomical differences in cellular signal transduction pathways may be the cause 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. The importance of the surgeon’s experience has also been emphasized. Although female gender and advanced age have been reported as risk factors in the development of hypocalcemia in meta-analyses， no significant difference was found between advanced age and female gender and the development of hypocalcemia in our study 通用删除6(英):<u>[23-25]</u>. Malignant thyroid pathology has also been found to be effective in the development of hypocalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. In our study， when the patients were divided into patients operated for benign pathology and删除1换行patients operated for malignant pathology， no statistically significant删除1换行result was found when calcium values were compared between patients with and without IONM device (p>0.05). When retrosternal extension， which was also evaluated among the risk factors， was compared with calcium values， no statistically significant result was found between the group using IONM device and the control group. However， statistically significant results were found when the length of hospitalization and calcium values were compared between the groups (p<0.05).\n\n【24】In light of this information， it is possible that the introduction of IONM for the protection of the RLN may have an effect on hypocalcemia due to the reasons mentioned above， such as prolongation in the total dduration of surgery and1increased manipulations in the period until the nerve fixation. Hallgrimsen et al. reported that the risk of symptomatic transient hypocalcemia increased in patients operated for Graves' disease and in patients with prolonged operation time 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. In other studies， on this subject， no connection between the duration of surgery and hypocalcemia has been shown 通用删除6(英):<u>[26-29]</u>. In our study， we found that the mean time to obtain amplitude after incision was 34.7 min. In terms of the time to obtain amplitude， we divided our patients into groups with a mean time to obtain the amplitude of less than 30 min (Group 1)， between 30 min to 60 min (Group 2)，and more than 60 min (Group3). While the calcium values of 24 patients in Group 1 and 36 patients in Group 2 were close to each other (8.55 and 8.58， respectively)，the mean calcium value of 38 patients in Group 3 was 8.3. In our study， a significant difference was observed between amplitude acquisition time and calcium values in the 3n Group (p<0.001). In light of our knowledge to date， since there is no study examining the effect of the use of IONM device on postoperative hypocalcemia in terms of complications after thyroidectomy， we retrospectively evaluated the factors that may cause a decrease in calcium values in patients with and without the use of IONM device in line with our hypothesis. We found that the use of IONM may have an increasing effect on hypocalcemia， as the prolongation in the total duration of surgery as well as the prolongation in the time until the nerve is detected will bring increased manipulations.\n\n【25】When evaluated in terms of postoperative complications， many publications have reported a decrease in complication rates with the use ofIONM. Barczynski et al. found a 2.9% decrease in early paralysis rates in the high-risk group and a 0.9% decrease in thelow-risk group with the use of IONM 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. Previous studies have also shown that the use of IONM increased the visibility and identification of RLN通用删除6(英):<u>[31，32]</u>. In our study， no permanent paralysis was observed in any of our patients after IONM use， but permanent paralysis was observed in one patient in the IONM-free group.\n\n【26】This study also has some limitations. Firstly， the number of patients in the study group was less than the control group and not all patient data could be accessed in a computerized environment due to the retrospective nature ofthe study. In addition，the approach to vocal cord examinations performed preoperatively and postoperatively may be subjective. Because Gianlorenzo et al. emphasized in their study that fiberoptic laryngoscopy is necessary for the detection of postoperative vocal cord paralysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>. On the other hand， our study is a single-center study， allpatients were operated bythe same surgeon， anesthesia technique was applied by the same anesthesia team and intubated by the same anesthesia team. Patients with previous thyroid surgery， radical neck dissection， unilateral total thyroidectomy，total complementary thyroidectomy， and 172 patients with comorbidities删除1换行that may affect calcium values were excluded from the study to ensure homogeneous distribution. Since calcium values may be affected by malignant pathology， retrosternal extension， and central lymph node dissection， homogeneous distribution of these patients in the groups was ensured. In addition， the fact that the endocrine surgeon had been performing operations with IONM in another center for more than two years prevented anyeffect on the results that may occur due to the learning curve. The fact that the blood values of the patients were checked only on the first morning after surgery may have caused early hypocalcemia that may develop in the first 48 h to be overlooked. Therefore， it would be useful to check the electrolyte values in the following days. Since magnesium values and thus chronic proton pump inhibitors use may also have an effect on calcium values， these should also be taken into consideration in further studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[34，35]</u>. There have also been reports suggesting that preoperative calcium values of patients may also affect postoperative hypocalcemia， but we did not look at preoperative calcium values in our study 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】The risk of hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy increases due to prolonged operation time， retrosternal extension of thyroid tissue， and thyroidectomy indication. In addition， the development of hypocalcemia leads to prolonged hospitalization. Identification of known risk factors before surgery may provide early diagnosis and treatment for the development of postoperative hypocalcemia， especially when there are conditions such as IONM use and surgical technique that may prolong the duration of surgery. Loss of signal or inability to receive the signal during IONM use is also a technical issue that needs to be addressed. In our study， it was shown that with the use of IONM in thyroid surgeries， calcium values may decrease and the risk of hypocalcemia may increase due to the prolongation of the time until amplitude acquisition from the nerve and the increase in manipulations in the surgical area until the nerve is detected.\n\n【29】Further studies should be performed to establish standards on the effects of IONM device use on hypocalcemia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Most of our current knowledge comes from single case reports and short case series. The purpose of this case report is to share our experience with a case of atypical presentation of this poorly known condition. We present a case of PMME in a 71-year-old patient displaying unique acute chest pain and a slight hindrance swallowing that had been evolving for six weeks. Endoscopy showed an achromic polypoid mass appended to the upper esophagus. The diagnosis of PMME was based on an immunohistochemical analysis of biopsies performed endoscopically after excluding the presence of esophageal metastasis from another primary melanoma. We assessed extension using endoscopic ultrasound and PET/CT and decided to surgically treat the patient without adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Primary Malignant Melanoma of the Esophagus (PMME) is an extremely rare but highly aggressive neoplasm. It accounts for 0.1% to 0.2% of all primary esophageal malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. The annual occurrence rate ofthis disease has been estimated at 0.03 per million people 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>. This tumor arises from melanocytes that are normally present in the basal layer of the esophageal epithelium in4% of the normal population 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【4】This condition was first described by Baur in 1906 and first histologically confirmed by Garfinkle and Cahan in 1952. By 2011， 337 cases had been published worldwide， mostly in single case reports通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【5】PMME mainly affects men with a male-to-female ratio of 2：1 with a peak incidence in the 64h and 7h decades 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Patients with PMME most commonly present dysphagia (73%)， retrosternal pain (24%) and weight loss (16%). A few patients may also display melena or hematemesis as first symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，6]</u>. Mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis is short with an average of three months 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，7]</u>.\n\n【6】Endoscopically， the tumor is often in polypoid and pigmented form and occurs mostly (>90%) in the mid and lower third of the esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. This is probably due to the greater concentration of melanocytes in these regions 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【7】Literature reviews report average survival ranging from 10 to 13 months. In a series of 139patients， Sabanathan et al. reported a 5-year survival rate of 4.2% 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>， while a more recent literature review published in 2002 by Volpin et al. reported a more encouraging figure of 37% 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. As mentioned above， the prognosis of PMME is dismal. Indeed， patients often present disease that is already at a metastatic stage 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The most common metastatic sites are the paraesophageal and supraclavicular lymph nodes， liver，lungs and brain 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，4，9-11]</u>.\n\n【8】Given the low number of cases published so far， PMME treatment has not yet been well established. The best outcomes have been observed with esophagectomy for patients with localized disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【9】We present a case of a 71-year-old patient diagnosed with an atypical presentation of PMME and treated by total esophagectomy with extensive lymphadenectomy.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】In December 2016， a 71-year-old female presented with slight hindrance in swallowing for 6 weeks without vomiting or weight loss. She also reported one episode of acute burning chest pain radiating to the jaw during this interval. In the relevant family history of the patient， we noted histories of lung cancer in the brother and father at age 60. The physical examination including dermatological evaluation was unremarkable.\n\n【12】All laboratory findings were normal. In this context， upper GI endoscopy was performed . A 1-centimeter polypoid mass was discovered in the upper esophagus located at 23 cm from the incisors. Accurate diagnosis was made histologically and immunohistochemically on the biopsy materials. Staining was positive for the S-100 protein， HMB-45 and Melan-A， indicating melanoma.\n\n【13】Further investigations were performed to distinguish between primary tumor and secondary metastatic sites. Careful cutaneous and ophthalmological examinations failed to identify any other suspected location.\n\n【14】Extension was assessed via Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) and PET/CT analysis. Endoscopic ultrasound showed a hypoechoic and regular polypoid lesion that did not infiltrate the muscularis . Nolymphadenopathy was detected. The tumor was endoscopically classified uT1N0.\n\n【15】The esophageal lesion had increased metabolic activity on PET/CT images . The latter also showed a focus in the right parietal lobe of the brain with no substrate on non-injected CT.A brain CT with contrast injection excluded cerebral metastasis. No metastasis was found and the final diagnosis was PMME.\n\n【16】Following multidisciplinary consultation， the decision was made to surgically treat the melanoma. No surgical contraindications were found and the patient underwent esophagectomy three-field with extensive lymphadenectomy. The patient did not receive adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. The postoperative course was uneventful except for a cervical abscess resolved by surgical drainage.\n\n【17】Macroscopic analysis of the mass showed a whitish polypoid mass (1.9 cm x1.3 cm ×1.3 cm) protruding in the esophageal lumen. Frozen sections showed healthy margins. Histological analysis revealed a widely amelanotic polypoid-shaped PMME infiltrating the muscularis mucosae with no evidence of deep invasion.\n\n【18】A total of 25 lymph nodes were analyzed and none was involved. The tumor was finally classified pT1a N0 M0 according to the TNM classification of malignant tumors 7h edition.\n\n【19】In July 2017， the patient was still disease-free on follow-up performed by a thorough physical examination and cervico-thoraco-abdominal CT-scan. The patient benefited from six endoscopic dilations following anastomotic stenosis. After four years of follow-up， the patient is doing well.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】We present a case of PMME in a 71-year-old female with symptoms of slight dysphagia and acute chest pain. The diagnosis of PMME was made by immunohistochemistry on biopsies performed endoscopically. Total esophagectomy with extensive lymph node dissection was performed. The patient is still in remission 11 months later.\n\n【22】This PMME differs from most presented cases for several reasons. After four years of follow-up， the patient is doing very well. First， despite the fact that the majority of cases presented are driven to seek medical care because of dysphagia， it should be noted that other symptoms are also encountered in this type of pathology such as acute chest pain in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【23】Moreover， the literature reports that the location of PMME is distributed as follows： Approximately 43% occur in the lower third，29% in the middle third， 18% at the junction of the middle and lower thirds， and finally only 10% in the upper third. A mass in the proximal third of the esophagus does not exclude PMME and must be investigated in the same way as a mass in the lower two-thirds 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.In addition， the majority of reported cases are pigmented forms whereas totally amelanotic forms represent only 10% to 25% of all PMME. The absence of visible pigmentation during endoscopy does not exclude PMME通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【24】PMME symptoms most often encourage practitioners to perform删除1换行esophagoscopy as part of the work-up. In most cases， it will show a single tumor of polypoid form as in the present case 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2，6]</u>. It should be noted that other atypical forms of PMME exist， such as multiple lesions， ulcerative lesions， fungating lesions， circumferential lesions， irregular flat areas or diffuse esophageal thickening 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>\n\n【25】The diagnosis of this type of tumor is well established in the literature. A pigmented polyploid tumor may suggest the diagnosis. However， the final diagnosis is established by means of immunohistochemistry. PMME typicaly reacts to antibodies against S-100， HMB-45 and Melan-A proteins 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，13]</u> while they are generally negative for epithelial markers， smooth muscle and lymphoid markers 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【26】As used in our case forr preoperative staging， endoscopic ultrasound is useful for assessing esophageal wall infiltration and possible periesophageal and mediastinal enlargement 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. We subsequently performed a PET/CT to complete the extension assessment. According to several publications， this technique represents the first-line modality for preoperative staging of the tumor通用删除6(英):<u>[5，8]</u>.\n\n【27】The literature suggests that the preferred treatment for PMME is total surgical resection and extensive lymph node dissection 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，5，9，13-15]</u>. However， according to the latest publications， esophagectomy would be beneficial only for localized forms without lymphatic metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>. Indeed，lymphatic involvement is associated with poor disease-free survival 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. On the other hand， cases of localized PMME treated by esophagectomy with long-term survival have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5，9，12]</u>. The place of chemotherapy， radiotherapy and immunotherapy is not well established 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，11，13，15]</u>. According to someauthors，these therapies could have a place in palliative situations通用删除6(英):<u>[2，8，10]</u>. Further investigation is needed to establish whether these therapies are useful in the treatment of PMME.\n\n【28】In conclusion， PMME is an extremely rare tumor with a dismal prognosis. Localized forms such as the present case can benefit from radical surgical treatment with the possibility of remission in the medium or long term.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Methotrexate-associated Lymphoproliferative Disorder (MTX-LPD) has been reported. Here we report two cases of MTX-LPD in patients with RA treated with MTX and Kampo medicines. Case 1 was a 70-year-old woman who developed MTX-LPD on MTX 8 mg， tacrolimus， and daibofuto. Case 2 was a 50-year-old woman who had had RA for 9 years and been treated with MTX 8 mg per week for 6 years； she developed MTX-LPD while also taking abatacept，bakumondoto， and unkeito. In case 1，MTX-LPD only resolved after discontinuation ofMTX；her RA was subsequently controlled by Minocycline and daibofuto. In case 2，MTX-LPD resolved after treatment with rituximab；her RA was then controlled with prednisolone 3 mg， iguratimod 50 mg， and Negative Nepi or Rio. Some Kampo medicines may have immunoregulatory activity and affect the serum MTX level. These medicines should be used cautiously in patients with RA if they are being treated with MTX.\n\n【2】Keywords： Rheumatoid arthritis； Kampo medicines； Methotrexate； Glycyrrhizae radix； Methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorder\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Kampo (traditional Japanese) medicines were first introduced from China via the Korean Peninsula 1500 years ago and since then have developed in a way unique to Japan. Kampo medicines are integrated into the Japanese national healthcare system. One hundred and forty-eight formulations containing Kampo extracts and 187 crude Kampo formulations are approved by the Ministry of Health， Labor， and Welfare and used under the national health insurance program 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>\n\n【5】Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes joint pain and damage throughout the body. RA was described as early as 1500 BC in the Ebers Papyrus and has been treated with Kampo medicines for hundreds of years. Kogure et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> reported that a Kampo decoction known preparations of carnitine (Gui Zhi Er Yue Bi Yit Tang Jia Zhu Fu Tang； KNEIJB) in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is safe and well tolerated and has clinical and economic benefits 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. A systematic review by Daily et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> highlighted the usefulness of guizhi-shaoyao-zhimu， which is used as Ignorant tenant for RA in Japan 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【6】The guidelines describe MTX as Avery effective treatment for RA. However， it has serious adverse effects， including liver disease， interstitial pneumonia， and myelosuppression. Lymphoma was first reported in a patient treated with MTX for RA in 1991 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Lymphoma in such patients is now known as MTX-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (MTX-LPD). Here we report two cases of MTX-LPD in patients with RA who were treated with Kampo medicines in combination with MTX.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Case 1\n\nShe was a 70-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with RA 16 years earlier. She had been taking MTX 8 mg/week for 6 years， a Kampo decoction known as daibofuto (Da Fang Feng Tang； DBFT) for 2 years， and tacrolimus 1 mg/day for 6 months. Although her RA activity was stable，|删除段之间换行|she developed a low-grade fever. A month later， she complained of a sore throat， which led to detection of a pharyngeal ulcer. MTX was discontinued and garenoxacin was started. One week later， her sore throat had improvedbut the ulcer had not healed completely. A biopsy of her pharyngeal mucosa revealed an infiltration of lymphoid cells， mainly of the large type， with necrosis beneath normal epithelium. The atypicallymphoid cells were positive for CD20， had a high Ki-67(MIB-1) labeling index， and were positive on EBER in situ hybridization  but were negative for CD3， CD5， and CD10. Her blood test results were as follows： white blood cell count，4，100/pL； hemoglobin， 11.4 mg/dL； platelet count 14.4 × 10/pL； serum lactate dehydrogenase， 234 IU/L (normal， 110-210)； aspartate transaminase 22 IU/L (normal， 12-31)； alanine transaminase 25IU/L (normal， 8-40)； serum creatinine 0.64 mg/dL (normal， 0.40-0.80)； C-reactive protein 4.03 mg/dL (normal <0.14)； ferritin 331ng/mL (normal， 12-60)； and solubleinterleukin-2 receptor 2305 U/mL (normal， 122-469). Test results for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens， hepatitis B virus antigen， and hepatitis C virus antibody as well as an interferon-gamma releasing assay for tuberculosis were all negative. Serum antigen tests and an enzyme immunoassay revealed previous Epstein-Barr virus infection (anti-viral-capsid antigen IgG antibody 160 times； anti-viral-capsid antigen IgM <10 times； anti-Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen IgG 40 times； anti-early antigen IgG <10 times). Computed tomography revealed multiple swollen删除1换行lymph nodes in the patient’s neck . She was diagnosed to have MTX-LPD. Within a few weeks of discontinuing MTX， DBFT， and tacrolimus， her fever resolved， her pharyngeal ulcer healed， her serum C-reactive protein level normalized， and her serum lactate dehydrogenase and soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels returned to their baseline values. In the 3 months following resolution of her pharyngeal ulcer， she was treated with minocycline 100 mg and DBFT. A complete remission of MTX-LPD was achieved. The patient has remained recurrence-free for 1 year， and her RA clinical disease activity has remained in remission.\n\n【10】Case 2\n\n【11】She was a 50-year-old woman who had had RA for 9 years. She was taking various Kampo medicines and had taken MTX 8 mg/week for 6 years. She had also taken abatacept (a fusion protein composed of the Fc region of IgG1 fused to the extracellular domain of CTLA-4) at a dose of 125 mg/week for 1.5 years after 2 years of treatment with etanercept (her treatment was switched because of loss of efficacy) in combination with two Kampo formulations， i.e. bakumondoto(Mai Men Dong Tang， BAK) extract 7.5 g and unkeito (Wen Jing Tang； UKT) extract 7.5 g (both from Tsumura Co.， Tokyo， Japan). Although her RA activity was stable， she developed left-sided cervical lymphadenopathy. Therefore， MTX， abatacept， BAK， and UKT were discontinued. After 2 weeks， there was improvement but not complete resolution of her lymphadenopathy. A lymph node biopsy revealed tumor cells with large， irregular， clear nuclei and multiple nucleoli . The atypical lymphoid cells were positive for CD20 and had a high Ki-67 (MIB-1) labeling index  but were negative for CD3， CD5， cyclin D1， MUM-1， and EBER in situ hybridization . Fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed uptake in the pharynx， right axillary lymph nodes， and the right elbow . We attributed the uptake in the right elbow to arthritis that predated the onset of lymphadenopathy. Her blood test results were as follows： white blood cell count， 4，990/uL； hemoglobin， 13.1 mg/dL； platelet count， 28.1×10/uL； serum lactate dehydrogenase 174 IU/L(normal， 115-245)； aspartate transaminase 19 IU/L (normal 12-31)； alanine transaminase 10 IU/L (normal，8-40)； serum creatinine 0.54mg/dL (normal 0.40-0.80)； C-reactive protein 0.33 mg/dL (normal\n\n【12】<0.14)； ferritin 97 ng/mL (normal 3.6-114)； and soluble interleukin-2receptor 241 U/mL (normal 145-519). Tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antigens， hepatitis B virus antigen， and hepatitis C virus antibody were negative， as was an interferon-gamma releasing assay for tuberculosis. Serum antigen tests with an enzyme immunoassay for Epstein-Barr virus showed previous infection (anti-viral-capsid antigen IgG antibody， 80 times； anti-viral-capsid antigen IgM <10times； anti-Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen IgG 40 times； and anti-early antigen IgG<10 times). She was diagnosed with MTX-LPD. Her right-sided axillary lymph node swelling did not improve in the 8 weeks following cessation of the MTX， abatacept， and Kampo medicines. Therefore， we started rituximab as monotherapy (an injection of 375mg/m²at weekly intervals for 8 weeks). After 8 cycles of treatment， the patient achieved a complete remission and has remained recurrence-free for 1year . Her RA clinical disease activity has remained low while on prednisolone 3 mg， iguratimod 50 mg and the KNEIJB decoction.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】To the best of our knowledge， these are the first reports of MTX-LPD in patients with RA who have been taking Kampo medicines. Kampo medicines have long been used in the treatment of arthritis and in Japan may be used in combination with other agents for various reasons in the treatment of RA. For example， KNEIJB can be used in combination with MTX to increase the therapeutic effect 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【15】In case 1，DBFT was administered to alleviate joint pain. DBFT is a herbal medicine that contains 15 compounds (i.e. Astragali Radix 6 g， Paeoniae Radix 3 g， Rehmanniae Radix 3 g， Angelicae Radix 3g， Atractylodis Rhizoma 3 g， Glehniae Radix cum Rhizoma 3.0 g Saposhnikoviae Radix 3g， Eucommiae Cortex 3 g， Cnidii Rhizoma 2g， Glycyrrhizae Radix 1.5 g， Notopterygii Rhizoma 1.5 g， Achyranthis Radix 1.5 g， Zizyphi Fructus 1.5 g， Ginseng Radix 1.5 g， Zingiberis Peocessum Rhizoma 1.0 g， and Processi AconitiRadix14g) and is used to treat RA. Inoue et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> investigated the effect of DBFT on collagen-induced arthritis in mice and suggested that its ability to attenuate the symptoms of arthritis might involve immunomodulatory and anti-osteoclastogenic mechanisms通用删除6(英):<u> 5]</u>.\n\n【16】In case 2，BAKand UKT were used to treat dryness of the mucosa and skin. These products have been reported to increase secretion of删除1换行saliva and improve immune status in patients with dry eye and mouth associated with Sjogren's syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> of note； both BAK and UKT contain Glycyrrhizae Radix.\n\n【17】Kampo medicines are considered to be relatively safe with the exception of some side effects， such as interstitial pneumonia anddhepatic impairmentCcaiised byy ScutellariaRadix and pseudoaldosteronism caused by Glycyrrhizae Radix 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. However， it is also known that some herbal medicines affect the blood levels of certain drugs， and it is possible that Glycyrrhizae Radix increased the serum MTX level in the two patients described in this report. Although we were not able to monitor the serum MTX level in either of our two patients， Lin et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> reported that Glycyrrhizin and licorice (the root of Glycyrrhizae uralensis) significantly increased the area under the blood concentration-time curve and mean residence time in rats. Therefore， it is possible that concomitant administration of MTX and Kampo herbal medicines containing Glycyrrhizae Radix resulted in an increase in the area under the blood concentration-time curve and mean residence time for MTX in our two patients.\n\n【18】Meta-analyses of epidemiologic studies in RA have identified clinically and statistically significant associations between RA and certain types of malignancy， particularly lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. MTX has been used in the treatment of RA since the 1990s； since then， there have been an increasing number of reports of MTX-LPD. In 1997， Georgescu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> reviewed 25 cases of lymphoma in patients with RA who were treated with MTX and described the following four important features： a predominance of large or polymorphous B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (90%)， a high rate of extranodal involvement (69%)， a high frequency of Epstein-Barr virus infection(41%)， and the possibility of remission only after withdrawal of MTX. Several case series and literature reviews have confirmed their findings. Our first case had all four of the above-mentioned features and the second had polymorphous B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Hashimoto et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> reported that older age and use of MTX and tacrolimus were associated with lymphoma in the NinJa cohort and we believe that Kampo medicines may have immunomodulatory activity that can increase the risk of MTX-LPD in the same way as tacrolimus. Furthermore， the Glycyrrhizae Radix contained in Kampo medicines may increase the serum MTX level， which is also thought to increase the risk of MTX-LPD. MTX-LPD did not recur in either of our patients even when Kampo medicines were restarted after remission. We think it unlikely that Kampo medicines alone cause LPD；however，MTX-LPD may develop when MTXand Kampo medicines are taken at the same time.\n\n【19】We are aware of only these two cases of MTX-LPD so far， and it is not certain if the risk of MTX-LPD is increased when MTX and Kampo medicines are used in combination. However， awareness of MTX-LPD is essential when Kampo medicines are used with MTX. Although research on MTX-LPD is ongoing， there is still no research on the risk of MTX-LTD when MTX is administered concomitantly withLTtraditional Chinese medicines， Kampo medicines， 1Glycyrrhizae Radix. We believe that concomitant use of agents such as Glycyrrhizae Radix may affect the serum MTX level and that this possibility should be investigated in the future.\n\n【20】In conclusion， we have encountered two cases of MTX-LPD in patients with RA treated with a combination of MTX and Kampo medicines. We consider that Kampo medicines should be used with caution in patients with RA who are being treated with MTX because they may have immunoregulatory activity and affect the MTX level.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The majority of patients have been transmitted from advanced stages of CKD to lower stages based on eGFR.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The use of herbal and alternative therapies in CKD lead to a decrease of serum creatinine levels and to transition patients from advanced stages to another lower； which means that treatments enhance kidney function and decrease deterioration.\n\n【5】Keywords： Kidney function； Corn silk； Shatavari root； Boswellia； Gum olibanum； Royal jelly\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) still described as one of the leading public health issues globally通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>， and it is characterized by progressive loss of kidney function 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The nature of CKD is complex and progression will lead to the End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) which is critical in management通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In addition， CKD is often asymptomatic until the disease reaches advanced stages； also patients in that stage already have one or more disease complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Therefore， it is critical to implement a measurable successful strategy that can be taken for prevention and management of the disease before the progression to ESRD.\n\nUntil now， there are no specific therapies to treat CKD. Treatments used are mainly dialysis or kidney transplantation， and are used for symptomatic and replacing kidney function 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Consequently， they must be done routinely， costly， and are not dissolve the problem. Therefore， alternative therapies are used to inhibit the progression of CKD； provide several effective therapeutic approaches to address the diverse pathologic conditions related to CKD， as it safe and not expensive|4.5.\n\n【9】Traditional and alternative medications comprise a variety of therapeutic approaches， including food habits and the use of herbs and minerals； additionally it may vary among countries 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. These approaches based on medicinal plants to forestall the need for hemodialysis， to reduce the adverse consequences of dialysis treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， and to beneficially relieve some of the associated symptoms of CKD comorbidities； such as muscle cramps， fatigue， depression and uremic bruising 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The diuretic properties of these herbal medicines are useful for patients on hemodialysis and for pre-dialysis patients by stimulating their kidney function and delaying the need for dialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【10】The most common mechanism for herbal treatment is antioxidant defense system， as they are rich sources of antioxidants 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Also， oxidative stress is the causative factor for a CKD删除2换行cited.\n\n【11】通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Furthermore， herbs have anti-inflammatory effects 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>， diuresis， immunomodulation， reductionin proteinuria and stimulation of renal repair mechanisms in CKD patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In the Middle East， many herbs were used to manage kidney diseases； specially kidney function， stones and inflammation such as corn silk(Zea mays L. Hair)， Paronychia arabica (paronychia)， Frankincense (Gum olibanum)， Asparagus racemosus roots and Royal Jelly.\n\n【12】Corn silk (Stigma maydisor Zea mays L. Hair) has been used for a long time as a treatment remedy for several illnesses and is vital as an alternative natural-based therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. It has been used as a traditional medicine in China， Turkey， United States and France通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Also， it has been used for the treatment of various Genito-urinary problems such as cystitis， edema， kidney stones， diuretic， prostate disorder and urinary infections 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，14]</u>. It soothes and relaxes the bladder and urinary tubules， hence increasing urine secretion and reducing irritation 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>.\n\n【13】The Boswellia species (Frankincense) are trees located in India， Ethiopia， Somalia， and the Arabian Peninsula， and they producea gum better resin called Olibanum， which possesses anti-inflammatory， anti-arthritic， and analgesic properties 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，16]</u>. Boswellic acids are the major constituents on the Olibanum gum resin and there have anti-cancer and anti-ulcerous activities 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Also， Rao et al. found that Boswel liaserrata has a protective effect against long-term diabetic complications specially kidney failure 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【14】In addition， Gum olibanum has been used in Arabic medicine for acute renal failure and normalizes systolic and diastolic BP and heart rate. Moreover， it protects against renal failure progression， involves in antioxidant and/or anti-inflammatory activity， and it is using in drinking water normalizes plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【15】Furthermore， Asparagaceae family that has been known as an antioxidant， reducer blood lipid， anti-diabetic， antifungal， anti-hypertension and anti-carcinogenic medication in traditional medicine 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Also， Asparagus may be effective to maintain renal normal function in diabetic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. The root of Asparagus oficinalis is more diuretic than its shoot and it helps flush out the kidneys and help in the prevention ofthe formation of kidney stones通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Asparagus racemosus root extract has a protective effect in renal injury in rats 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\n\n【16】Royal Jelly (RJ) is also considered to have anti-inflammatory effects due to its possible antiradical and ant oxidative effects. It can have positive effects on both the prevention of urolithiasis and possible inflammation during the existing urolithiasis and support the medical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. RJ may be used in combination with cisplatin in chemotherapy to decrease cisplatin-induced oxidative stress parameters and decrease the injury of kidneys and liver 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Also， pretreatment with RJ significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen， kidney malondi-aldehyde， creatinine， glomerular diameter and leukocyte infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>， and it may be effective to protect the kidney against I/R injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>.\n\n【17】This study was conducted to investigate the effect of the treatment of a herbal mixture (which is composed of corn silk (Stigma maydis)， Paronychia arabica (paronychia)，Frankincense (Gum olibanum) and Asparagus racemosus roots (shatavari)) accompanied with Royal Jelly capsules on renal function assessed by serum creatinine level.\n\n【18】Cases Interpretation\n\n【19】This retrospective case series study was conducted by reference删除1换行to computer patients files between 2015 and 2018 in Herbal Dynasty Medical Center，Amman，Jordan. A 20 cases of renal failure patients of both sexes (9 females'and 11 males) (age range 23 to 71 years) were selected. Serum creatinine before and after the treatment were reported. The consent of all patients attending the center is taken to use their medical results in scientific research. The study has been approved by Department of Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics Faculty of Science Philadelphia University， Amman， Jordan.\n\n【20】The selected treatment was traditional herbal mixture produced as tea bags (Approved by FDA Jordan). It was composed of corn silk (Stigma maydis)； Paronychia Arabica (paronychia)， Frankincense(Gum olibanum) and Asparagus racemosus roots (Shatavari) in equal amounts， each bag contains 3 g of herbal mixture. Herbal mixture was prescribed for patients by physicians with a specific dose of two tea bags daily soaking in a 150 ml cup of boiling water for 10min， half an hour before meals， with a RJ capsules (one capsule 1000mg daily before half an hour before meal) for 2 months. Patients were recommended to complete life-long treatment to be more comprehensive and creatinine to be normal.\n\n【21】Patients came to the clinic trying to avoid reaching the hemodialysis phase， and were followed up every two weeks； changes in creatinine levels were monitored. Under the supervision of doctors at the center. Moreover， an important recommendation was made during the treatment period regarding the diet； based on National Institute of Health (NIH)： NIDDK通用删除7(英):<u>(2014)</u>.\n\n【22】After the two-month deadline expires， patients whose kidneys function was not improved and there was no or bad response to the treatment， they were given the choice to continue the treatment or re rn to a nephrologist and start dialysis.\n\n【23】Data were analyzed using Microsoft office Excel (Windows 10). Means ± SD were calculated. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR) was calculated based on the following formula： eGFR=186×(Creatinine/88.4)1.154x(Age)0.203x(0.742 iffemale)×(1.210 if black). Then， patients were classifieds to different stages of renal failure(before and after) with reference to National Kidney Foundation， as followed： stage 1 CKD： eGFR 90 or Greater； stage 2 CKD： eGFR between 60 and 89；stage 3A CKD： eGFR between45 and 59； stage 3B CKD： eGFR between 30 and 44； stage 4 CKD： eGFR between 15 and29 and stage 5 CKD： eGFR Less than 15.\n\n【24】Results and Discussion\n\n【25】The mean age of the selected sample was 52.8 years as shown in Table 1. Serum creatinine levels after herbaltreatment for all selected cases were decreased by (2.8±1.4) as compared to creatinine levels before the treatment (3.9±1.8). The mean decrease of creatinine levels for all cases was 1.1±0.9 .\n\n【26】As shown in Table 2， 14 from 20 of participants were transitioned from advanced stage to another lower based on eGFR.\n\n【27】Due to the lack of treatment in conventional medical system for CKD， many patients turn to the complementary and alternative medicine， to help manage their disease and 1F prevent disease deterioration. Several herbals and alternative choices have been used worldwide. In Arab region they are using curcumin， black seed， Royal Jelly， corn silk (Stigma maydis)， Paronychia Arabica (paronychia)， Frankincense (Gum olibanum) and Asparagus racemosus roots (Shatavari).\n\n【28】Current study reported that selected herbal mixture accompanied\n\n【29】Table 1： The change in serum creatinine levels before/after herbal treatment\n\n| Cases  | Sex  | Age (years)  | Serum Creatinine before(mg/dL)  | Serum Creatinine after (mg/dL)  | The decrease of creatinine level  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | F  | 57  | 3.5  | 1.3  | 2.2  |\n| 2  | F  | 58  | 2.8  | 1.8  | 1.0  |\n| 3  | F  | 62  | 4.2  | 3.1.  |  |\n| 4  | F  | 49  | 4.8  |  | kidney1.Urol Nurs. 2005，25：381-7.  |\n| 5  | F  | 23  | 6.9  | 5.2  | 1.7  |\n| 6  | F  | 60  | 3.8  | 3.2  | 0.6  |\n| 7  | F  | 42  | 2.3  | 1.9  | 0.4  |\n| 8  | F  | 47  | 6.4  | 4.5  | 1.9  |\n| 9  | F  | 56  | 1.7  | 1.3  | 0.4  |\n| 10  | M  | 71  | 7.0  | 4.0  | 3.0  |\n| 11  | M  | 47  | 3.2  | 2.9  | 0.3  |\n| 12  | M  | 50  | 1.4  | 1.0  | 0.4  |\n| 13  | M  | 40  | 6.3  | 6.0  | 0.3  |\n| 14  | M  | 53  | 6.4  | 4.0  | 2.4  |\n| 15  | M  | 55  | 1.5  | 1.2  | 0.3  |\n| 16  | M  | 52  | 3.8  | 2.3  | 1.5  |\n| 17  | M  | 63  | 4.1  | 3.4  | 0.7  |\n| 18  | M  | 42  | 3.8  | 3.6  | 0.2  |\n| 19  | M  | 62  | 1.8  | 1.5  | 0.3  |\n| 20  | M  | 67  | 3.0  | 2.2  | 0.8  |\n| Mean±SD  |  | 52.8±11.0  | 3.9±1.8  | 2.8±1.4  | 1.1±0.9  |\n\n【31】M： Male；F： Female； SD： Standard Deviation删除1换行with Royal Jelly lead to an efficient decrease of serum creatinine levels in renal failure patients， and it may protect kidneys and enhance their function.

Acute suppurative parotitis is a rarely seen infection in childhood， which is characterized by parotid gland swelling and pus drainage from the Stenson’s duct 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The microbiology of acute suppurative parotitis is quite variable and is often polymicrobial. S. aureus is by far the most frequently isolated pathogen， but anaerobes are also common 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Treatment consists of parenteral antibiotics (usually Intravenous). Rarely，parotid abscess can develop in patients who are unresponsive to antibiotics alone and surgical drainage is required for complete recovery 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. We are reporting a case of acute infantile suppurative parotitis that was severe to the degree of swelling being a threat to the airway，intravenous antibiotics were not enough and surgery was warranted twice. Early expectation of airway compromise and early intervention are lifesaving in such a case.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】An 8-month-old well thriving child presented with 2 days history of high-grade fever， and evolving swollen right side of the neck. Left side was clear. He is a product of FT NVD with uneventful neonatal period and no previous hospital admission. This patient was a conceived by non-consanguineous parents and was born at term. Perinatal course was uneventful.\n\n【4】Patient was admitted initially to pediatric inpatient facility and started on IV Cefotaxime. Initial CXR： No obvious abnormality detected. US Neck： Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were noted at the right side of the neck with the largest measuring 2.8 cm×1.2 cm. Right-sided parotid gland was noted to be heterogeneous with increased vascularity. Blood Smear： Leukocytosis -Neutrophilia and Monocytosis and Microcytic Anemia.\n\n【5】Seen on the same day by the PICU team due to concerns on airway patency and was shifted to PICU immediately， we anticipated worsening of the condition and antibiotics were upgraded to IV Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Clindamycin.\n\n【6】On day 2 of admission， he was more sick looking and with increasing swelling. Fever spikes of up to 39°℃ were noted with rise in inflammatory. We proceeded to intubate him electively to secure his airway. This was done with Anesthesia assistance in OR where an Incision and Drainage were done at the same time. Patient returned to ICU intubated. After few hours in the PICU， patient self-extubated (due to inadequate sedation) and ET was re-cited. Larynx was noted to be inflamed and edematous. US neck showed enlarged right parotid gland and ill-defined localized collection measuring about 2.7 cm ×1.2 cm x 2.1 cm with perilesional increased vascularity . CT scan neck with contrast done post all above showed the abscess tracking posteriorly to the carotid sheath and medial to the pharyngeal wall .\n\n【7】ENT team was involved， who recommended IV Dexamethasone for 3 days. ID consultant has recommended adding Vancomycin if patient was persistently febrile and toxic. On Day 3 patient clinical condition improved， fever controlled. COVID PCR was negative. NBT test for CGD(Chronic Granulomatous Disease) was reported negative.\n\n【8】On day 4 Pus swab C&S showed： Heavy growth oxacillin sensitive Staph aureus， sensitive to Clindamycin. Tazocin sensitivity was not tested but expected to be well sensitive to Piperacillin too. Size of swelling started to reduce on day 4 and he was successfully extubated on Day 6. On day 9， right parotid swelling seemed to be increasing in size and uplifting the right ear pinna and he had spiking temperature up to 38.9°C. US scan revealed a smaller collection .\n\n【9】Patient was taken to the OR； I&D was done with very small volume of thick pus aspirated by interventional radiologist and a Penrose drain left in situ by the pediatric surgeon to aid drainage of pus for 2 days. Vancomycin was started along with Clindamycin and Tazocin was discontinued. He was extubated on the same day.\n\n【10】Patient was discharged home on day 16 with advice to continue PO Clindamycin for total of 4 weeks. He was seen in pediatric clinic on day 21， no neck swelling was noted， US showed postoperative changes in the right parotid gland， no collection seen.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Acute Suppurative Parotitis (ASP)， an inflammatory and infectious process of the parotid gland， was a well-recognized complication of abdominal surgery before the advent of antibiotics. With the use of perioperative antibiotics， ASP has become a rare occurrence通用删除6(英):<u> 5]</u>.\n\n【13】Prematurity， low birth weight， dehydration， oral trauma，\n\n【14】In the differential diagnosis， trauma，lymphadenitis，hemangioma， adenoma， lipoma， parotid gland duct anomalies， intraglandular abscess and neoplasia should be considered.\n\n【15】The polymicrobial nature of parotid space infections was illustrated in a study of 32 patients with acute suppurative parotitis. Aerobic bacteria were isolated in 34%， anaerobic bacteria in 41%， and mixed aerobic and anerobic bacteria in 25%. S. aureus Was the predominant aerobe (in 10 patients)， followed by viridans streptococci and H. influenza (in four patients each). Pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp， Fusobacterium spp， and Peptostreptococcus spp. were the predominant anaerobes.

Possible etiologies of retrograde flow from the oral cavity into the parotid include dehydration with resultant decrease in saliva production and stasis， dilatation of the ducts (sialectasis) through scarring or obstruction by stone or mass， and congenital variations in ductal structure.

Giant Cell Tumor (GCT) and Aneurismal Bone Cyst(ABC) may give the same clinical and radiological pictures. GCT is a rare benign bone lesion most often found in the extremities of women in the third and fourth decades of life. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment and usually consists of intralesional curettage. Local control rates range from 80% to 90% after this procedure. ABC is a reactive lesion of bone， locally destructive and not considered as a true neoplasm. Most common in proximal humerus， around the knee and spine. Treated by curettage and bone graft with a recurrence rate up to 20%. Aggressive inaccessible lesions may be treated by arterial embolization or low dose radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Aggressive ABC and GCT occur in the metacarpal bones， grow fast and tend to recur after curettage removal. They can be multicentral and destroy the whole bone and the Metatarsophalangeal Joints (MPJ) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>. These conditions can affect greatly the function ofthe hand.

The swelling was spontaneous with no history of previous trauma or infection in the hand. On physical examination， hard oval swelling on the dorsum ofthe hand in the second metacarpal area measuring 3 cm x2 cm. The mass was moderately tender on deep palpation. The range of movement of the second MPJ was moderately affected， and the neurovascular bundle was intact.

There are six reported cases of gastrointestinal tract granular cell tumors in pediatrics. There are rare reported cases of esophageal granular cell tumors in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis： three of which were in pediatric patients. We report two asymptomatic pediatric patients undergoing surveillance endoscopy for eosinophilic esophagitis with discovery of esophageal granular cell tumors. Both had successful removal via saline-assisted endoscopic mucosal resection. The association between eosinophilic esophagitis and esophageal granular cell tumors is unclear at this time.\n\n【2】Keywords： Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease； Esophageal tumor； Endoscopic mucosal resection\n\n【3】Abbre viations\n\n【4】EoE： Eosinophilic Esophagitis； GCT： Granular Cell Tumor；EGD： Esophagogastroduodenoscopy\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Granular Cell Tumors (GCT) are generally benign neoplasms derived from Schwann cells most commonly found in subcutaneous tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Eight percent of all GCT involve the gastrointestinal(GI) tract， two percent of which are esophageal 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. The rate of malignant transformation is 2%通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.

There are eight reported cases of GCT in individuals with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)， age ranging from 14 to 41 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6，9]</u>. Typically， esophageal GCTs are incidentally found on upper endoscopy.\n\n【7】Eosinophilic esophagitis is a clinicopathological disease with predominant esophageal symptoms， characteristic endoscopic findings， and histological criteria with esophagealeosinophilia. EoE presents with a variety of upper GI symptoms characterized by age of onset 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> with a mean age of 8 years. Seventy-five percent of cases are males 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Previously reported esophageal GCTs have presented with dysphagia， as can EoE. We present two pediatric patients with esophageal GCT discovered while undergoing surveillance endoscopy for eosinophilic esophagitis.\n\n【8】Methods\n\n【9】A retrospective chart review was performed using the electronic medical record system on pediatric patients with the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis and esophageal granular cell tumor. Case 1\n\nA 9-year-old boy with autism spectrum disorder， asthma， allergic rhinitis， and EoE underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for EoE surveillance. He was diagnosed with EoE at age Wa2 years and was treated with 6-food elimination diet and lansoprazole. At 9 years of age， he was asymptomatic and undergoing follow-up surveillance EGD on a stable diet. A 2 mm by 4 mm firm nodule was found in the middle third of the esophagus . Biopsy showed squamous mucosa containing submucosal granular cell tumor， which was positive for S100， CD68 and inhibin-alpha immunostaining . Previous EGD one year earlier was without lesion. He subsequently underwent removal of GCT via EGD with endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic mucosal resection. Endosonographic findings were a single oval intramural (subepithelial) hypoechoic lesion in the middle third of the esophagus within the submucosa (Layer 3) and measured up to|删除段之间换行|3 mm in thickness with well-defined borders. For removal， 2mL of saline were injected to raise the lesion. Band ligator was applied to capture the tumor. Hot snare mucosal resection with Roth Net retrieval was performed. A follow-up EGD 3 month later showed a grossly normal esophagus and biopsies without evidence ofGCT. All EoE surveillance esophageal biopsies obtained at discovery and at removal were negative for active eosinophilia or inflammation.\n\n【11】Case 2\n\nA 16-year-old boy with asthma， allergic rhinitis， and EoE underwent follow-up EGD. He was initially diagnosed with EoE at age 14 years after a work-up for dysphagia， GERD-like symptoms， and vomiting refractory to acid suppression. His EoE failed 6-food elimination， swallowed fluticasone， and now relies on an elemental diet with isolated single food reintroductions. At age 16 years， surveillance EGD revealed a 2 mm by 4 mm hard， firm nodule in the middle third of the esophagus . Biopsies of the nodule revealed S-100 positivity， consistent with granular cell tumor. Prior endoscopy 3 months earlier was without lesion. He underwent|删除段之间换行|removal of GCT via EGD with endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic mucosal resection . Endosonographic findings revealed a single small nodule hypoechoic lesion within the submucosa (Layer3). The mass measured up to 4 mm in thickness with well-defined borders. Resection was performed after 2 mL saline injection to raise the lesion， followed by band ligator to capture the tumor， and hot snare mucosal resection with Roth net retrieval. Follow-up EGD 3months later showed a grossly normal appearing esophagus and biopsies without evidence of GCT. All EoE surveillance esophageal biopsies obtained at discovery and at removal were negative for active eosinophilia or inflammation.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】The first GCT in the esophagus was reported in 1931 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> and since then there have been hundreds of GCTs found throughout the GI tract， with most cases found in adults. The rate of malignant transformation is 2% 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The first esophageal GCT in a pediatric patient was reported in 20034.\n\nThe typical endoscopic appearance of GCT is a polypoid， yellow， firm submucosal mass. The definitive diagnosis is made|删除段之间换行|histopathologically. Histologically， GCTs are typically able to be diagnosed with hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections， however positivity of the S-100 protein is useful to support the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Both of our cases were positive for the S-100 protein. Additionally， endoscopic ultrasound can provide important diagnostic data， suchas size andlayer of origin. In the previous literature， the majority of GCT arise from the inner layers of the esophagus and are hypoechoic with smooth margins 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Based on these findings， a determination can be made for method of tumor resection. Saline-assisted endoscopic mucosal resection has been reported to be a safe procedure with rare complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. The first reported case of saline-assisted endoscopic mucosal resection in a child was performed by Buratti and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Both of our cases had GCTs resected by saline-assisted endoscopic mucosal method without any complications， further supporting the safety of this procedure.\n\n【16】Recently in 2015， Yanoma and colleagues reported an adult with an esophageal GCT who had an elevated preoperative serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9， raising concern for malignant potential通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. The final pathologic diagnosisSwas a benign GCT. The patient’s serum CA 19-9 level normalized post-operatively. The immunohistochemical staining was interestingly negative for CA19-9. Alone from this report， there are no specific serum markers identified with esophageal GCT.\n\n【17】The children in our case series were undergoing surveillance EGD for eosinophilic esophagitis when esophageal GCT's were found. These cases are similar to other GCT cases in the literature characterized by incidental discovery. A recent retrospective report identified 18esophageal GCT， with two occurring in pediatric patients that were symptomatic from their EoE 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. This same report notes that perhaps esophageal GCTs are reactionary given their findings of active EoE inflammation. However， this is contrary to our cases， which were both asymptomatic and without active eosinophilia or inflammation删除1换行at time of discovery and removal. What is unique in this report is the strengthened recognition of additional esophageal GCT cases in the setting of EoE and only three prior in pediatric patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>\n\n【18】In summary，GCTs are rare in children. The relationship between GCT and EoE is unclear， with two possibilities being a coincidental finding verses long-term complications of chronic inflammation in EoE. The prevalence of EoE is certainly increasing， and with a potential increasing incidence 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>， it is important for clinicians to be attentive of this possible association， which may shed insight into alterations in disease pathophysiology.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

They have been hypothesized to originate from exposure of lymphocytes to events causing double stranded DNA breaks，such as ionizing radiation. Persistence of these breaks， along with the abnormal thymic development and defective cell cycle regulation seen in A-T， has the potential to lead to clonal dysregulation of B cells and to gammopathies.Of gammopathies present in the pediatricpopulation， etiologies vary from autoimmune disorders， hematologic malignancies， myelodysplasias， and renal and hepatic disorders. Herein we discuss the unusual case of a pediatric patient with A-T， IgA deficiency， and asthma， who was found to have a monoclonal gammopathy.

Clinically， the neurodegeneration manifests as oculomotor apraxia， dysarthria， and movement disorders such as choreo-athetosis， dystonia， Parkinsonism， among other neurological dysfunctions 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-3]</u>.\n\n【14】Due to the involvement of the ATM gene in cell cycle progression and DNA repair， homozygous mutated A-T patients are sensitive to ionizing radiation and may have an increased risk of hematologic Orgastric malignancy，dysgerminoma， medulloblastoma， and gonadoblastoma， among other cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-9]</u>. A-T patients are most likely to develop hematologic malignancies， with Caucasian A-T patients and African-American A-T patients carrying a 250-fold and750-fold increased risk of lymphoma，respectively， as compared with the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，10]</u>. There is an increased risk of developing both T and B cell tumors， with B cell non-Hodgkin'slymphoma being删除1换行the most common B cell tumor and T acute lymphocytic leukemia， T cell lymphoma， and T prolymphocytic leukemia， being the most common T cell neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Additionally， female carriers of an ATM gene mutation have a documented increased risk of breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，17]</u>.\n\n【15】Immune deficiency in A-T is variable in each individual patient but also in one patient across time. The most common immune defects in A-T involve cellular and humoral immunity： CD4+T cell lymphopenia， reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions， and deficiencies in IgA， IgE， and IgG2 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，10]</u>. Thymic hypoplasia is observed as an absence of Hassall's corpuscles and decreased corticomedullary differentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Lymphocytes of A-T patients exhibit telemeric erosion and fusions， as well as cell cycle dysfunction， which may also play a role in immunodeficiency in A-T 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Due to these factors， A-T patients have a predilection for recurrent bacterial sinopulmonary infection which， worsened by neurodegenerative dysphasia， leads to the most common cause of death in the disorder：aspiration pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>.\n\n【16】Additional sequelae of ATM gene mutations are monoclonal and polyclonal gammopathies 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，10-13]</u>. Gerritsen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> studied monoclonal gammopathies in the general pediatric population. They detected all immunoglobulin isotype monoclonal gammopathies except forIIgAImonoclonalgammopathies andidentifiedda predominance of lambda light chain gammopathies. Conversely Akha et al. specifically studied gammopathies in A-T patients. They found that 39% of A-T patients showed hypergammaglobulinemia， with 8% of patients having a monoclonal gammopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，12]</u>. They also found that all immunoglobulin isotypes were represented in A-T patients with monoclonal gammopathy and did detect A-T patients with lambda light chain gammopathies， although the lambda light chain did not predominate 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，12]</u>.\n\n【17】Our patient exhibited a monoclonal gammopathy involving the lambda light chain， but the immunoglobulin isotype was unable to be determined. It is unlikely that the gammopathy represented free light chain lambda， as the free k：A ratio was only mildly elevated in two measurements， with the mean ratio being within normal limits. Urine protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis would be helpful to further characterize the isotype， however the clinical team did not order these studies. Although our data cannot be directly compared to the Gerritsen et al. study， as they were not specifically evaluating A-T patients， our data is in agreement with Akha et al.'s finding that A-T patients can exhibit lambda light chain monoclonal gammopathies.\n\n【18】The differential for monoclonal gammopathies in the general pediatric population has been established by Gerritsen et al. and Karafin et al. and includes congenital， autoimmune， and infectious diseases， hematologic conditions， solid organ malignancies， and renal and hepatic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>. In this classification， A-T is included in the spectrum of congenital diseases. It is likely that the causes of gammopathies in A-T patients may predominantly include malignancy， autoimmunity， and infection， considering the unique susceptibility of these patients to cancer and immunodeficiency. Indeed， case reports published on gammopathies in A-T patients have described prior oral and genital herpetic infections and diffuse plasmocytosis of the kidney， liver， bone marrow， and lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，13]</u>.\n\n【19】It has been hypothesized that monoclonal and polyclonal gammopathies in A-T may result from exposure of lymphocytes to events that increased double stranded DNA breaks， such as ionizing删除1换行radiation， chemotherapy， or infections 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，11]</u>. The lack of repair of these breaks， coupled with abnormal thymic development and defective cell cycle regulation， could then lead to clonal dysregulation of B cells and gammopathies 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Data supporting this includes abnormalities in TCR rearrangements in A-T and an increased incidence of translocations involving TCR and immunoglobulin genes 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，8]</u>. In fact， these translocations can be detected in 10% of circulating T cells in A-T patients throughout their lifetime 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. In many cases， these monoclonal gammopathies appear to be short-lived通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>， as is the case in the general pediatric population 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. However， it is wise for clinicians to be aware of the unique susceptibility of A-T patients to malignancy and immunodeficiency and screen for the possibility of an underlying malignancy， autoimmune disorder， or infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

They occur frequently during the third trimester or near birth， increasing maternal morbidity and fetal complications. The increase in cardiac volumes and the effects of progesterone are the mechanisms proposed in this increase in the incidence of arrhythmias. In the Canadian study of CARPREG II of a total of 1，938 pregnant women with heart disease， arrhythmia the most frequent cardiac complication occurred in 9.3% followed by heart failure with 6.2% of all pregnancies.\n\n【2】Keywords： Cardioversion and pregnancy；ElectricalCcardioversion： Pharmacological cardioversion； Atrial fibrillation； Supraventricular tachycardia\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】In women with a history of paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)， symptoms worsen in the third trimester by up to 85%， even several studies suggest that pregnancy could increase the heart rate ofpatients with SVT episodes 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-5]</u>，Atrial Fibrillation (FA) is currently the most common arrhythmia observed in pregnancy according to Vaidya 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>，this attributed to increased maternal age，and cardiovascular risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>[71</u>.\n\n【5】Electrical cardioversion is a therapeutic option when primary measures such as carotid sinus massage，the Valsalva maneuver， or antiarrhythmic therapy have failed (oflimited use in pregnancy) and there is hemodynamic instability.\n\n【6】The literature review shows that cardioversion can be safe for both the mother and the fetus； however the published experience limits a case report. The objective of this work is to report the experience in a third-level center in cardioversion during pregnancy in women with hemodynamic compromise， to report the maternal clinical course and the perinatal results obtained. Finally， in refractory cases， ablation can be performed with current techniques in pregnant women with minimal radiation exposure.删除2换行cited.\n\n【7】A search was carried out in the clinical file of the National Institute of Perinatology \"Isidro Espinosa de los Reyes\" (INPerIER) of Mexico. Women of any gestational age with diagnoses of maternal arrhythmias that require electrical or pharmacological cardioversion due to hemodynamic instability， according to the ICD10 code and who were treated during pregnancy from January2010 to December 2020. In each case demographic variables were extracted； maternal age， obstetric history， weeks of gestation and cardiovascular medical history. The indications for electrical cardioversion were those recommended by the American Heart Association. Maternal risk was determined according to the modified WHO classification， the CARPREG II classification，and the NYHA. In all cases， the existence of structural heart disease was documented by echocardiography， the cardiological evolution of each patient was carried out by a doctor specializing in cardiology， recording the presence of clinical signs or symptoms of cardiac arrhythmias or changes in cardiac functional class， the evolution of the pregnancy， fetal growth， was performed by the maternal-fetal medicine service of the hospital itself and the fetal response to cardioversion was recorded through the cardiotocographic record， the weeks in which the pregnancy was resolved， the means of resolution， the maternal status and the newborn.\n\n【8】Measures of mean central tendency and standard deviation were used for the numerical measurements and proportions for the nominal and categorical variables.\n\n【9】Results\n\n【10】Thirteen cases were studied during the 10-year period， of which in 11 cases the complete data from the clinical record was obtained for inclusion in the analysis. The clinical characteristics and demographic data are shown in Table 1. All women were admitted to the Institute through the emergency department with hemodynamic and/or neurological compromise. 57.1%(6 cases) required electrical cardioversion and three cases (42.8%) required pharmacological cardioversion.\n\n【11】In all cases， basic life support measures were implemented， ensuring the airway， and oxygenation in addition to non-invasive monitoring of blood pressure， electrocardiography andpulse oximetry， a cardiotocographic record was installed to detect alterations in fetal well-being and frequencies. Fetal heart rates are seen in the Table. The mean maternal age was 24.3 years， in 57.1%the event occurred in their first gestation， the mean gestational age at the time of admission to the emergency room was 22.6 weeks， and the minimum gestational age was 7 weeks and the maximum at 38.5weeks. Two cases with Ebstein s anomaly (28.6%) and two with atrial septal defect were observed； in three cases no structural heart disease was identified.\n\n【12】In women who required pharmacological cardioversion， there is structural heart disease in 50% of cases (Ebstein's anomaly， CIA and PCA).\n\n【13】In women who required electrical cardioversion， only in one case was structural cardiac pathology identified due to Ebstein's anomaly.\n\n【14】Maternal hemodynamic status before cardioversion\n\n【15】The symptoms were dyspnea (100%)， hypotension (100%)， syncope and lipothymias (42.9 %). The mean systolic pressure on admission was 77.8 mmHg； the mean diastolic pressure was 53.8mmHg. In all cases there was an elevation of blood lactate (>2mMol/L).\n\n【16】In allcases，carotid massage，Valsalvamaneiiver and antiarrhythmic drug therapy were indicated and anticoagulation was performed with conventional sodium heparin and/or subcutaneous enoxaparin.\n\n【17】Maternal results\n\n【18】Maternal survival was 100%， there were 5 cases that required more than one shock due to recurrence of cardiac arrhythmia during pregnancy or the puerperium， and however， in 100% of the cases， complete remission was achieved. In four patients there was recurrence of the arrhythmia during pregnancyand in two women in the immediate puerperium. Case 1 with a diagnosis ofarrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia required electrical cardioversions on 10occasions throughout the pregnancy . The patient with ASD and Ebsteins anomaly (case 3) developed acute pulmonary edema and did not initially respond to pharmacological cardioversion and subsequently required electrical cardioversion in addition to requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. There was an average of8.6 weeks of pregnancy gain between the time the cardioversion was performed and the resolution of the pregnancy.\n\n【19】Perinatal outcomes\n\n【20】There was a 100% fetal survival， the average gestational age at the time of pregnancy resolution was 37.1 SD ±1.3 in 85.7% and the route of birth was abdominal. In two cases the indication was due to prematurity secondary to loss of fetal well-being； in all cases there was an Apgar score of 9. After 5 min， the average stay in the intensive care unit before and after cardioversion was 3.3 ± 0.7 days. Case 8developed Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) and Preeclampsia(PE) with severity data， case 9 developed IUGR. In both cases， the loss of fetal well-being triggered the resolution of the pregnancy. The loss of fetal well-being was not related to electrical cardioversion.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】Electrical and/or pharmacological cardioversion during pregnancy is currently recommended by the AHA (Editorial and Article Editorial 2020； Correction to： 2015 ACC/AHA/HRS Guide.)， ESC 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> (Editorial and Article Editorial 2020)， ANMCO， SIGO通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Before 2011，44 cases of electrical cardioversion had been reported in the English-language literature (Tromp et al. 2011). The types of arrhythmias in the published cases is very varied and of different etiology， the shock ranges used range from 50 J to 400J通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> and currently more than 25 cases have been published in recent years. The literature dealing with pharmacological cardioversion in pregnancy is also limited to case reports； a report from a tertiary center in Texas reported a total of 23 SVTT cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> and only two with atrial fibrillation.

Case number 5 in our series， the patient with the lowest gestational age observed， was reversed with drugs with an acceptable perinatal result. The need for repeated shocks during pregnancy is likely to present few fetal effects， as demonstrated in our case number 1 with arrhythmogenic dysplasia in which 10 shocks were performed from week 10 of pregnancy until its resolution at term with a newborn healthy， case number 8 received three shocks upon admission to the emergency room， however， the poor perinatal outcome seems more associated with preeclampsia and IUGR.

Approximately 150 to 200 cases are newly diagnosed with IMT annually in the America 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. IMT can occur at any age with a predilection for children， adolescents and young adults 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The tumor primarily affects visceral organs and soft tissue. The most common sites of involvement are the lung， mesentery and omentum 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. To the best of our knowledge， IMT originating from the abdominal wall was an exceedingly rare entity and only4 cases were reported in the English literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-7]</u>. Herein， we describe a case of a 49-year-old Chinese man with IMT presented in abdominal wall and we also reviewed the relevant literature to learn more about this rare disease from clinical features to therapeutic approaches.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】Chief complaints\n\n【11】A 49-year-old Chinese male was admitted to Tongji Hospital(Wuhan， China) with a palpable mass in the rightlumber region that had been growing slowly for 2 years.\n\n【12】History of present illness\n\n【13】The patient discovered a touchable mass in the right abdomen2 years ago without any other discomfort， and the mass gradually enlarged without any other symptoms. He visited Wuhan Xiehe Hospital. CT of the abdomen showed that there was a 49 mm x22 mm soft tissue density mass on the right side of the abdomen. The enhancement was progressive and obvious and uneven. The boundary was clear， It can be seen that the tortuous and thickened intermuscular blood vessels extend in， which is usually considered as a neoplastic lesion. The patient was referred to our hospital for further investigation and treatment.\n\n【14】History of past illness\n\n【15】There was no history of anemia， fever， malaise， weight loss， or any other systemic symptoms.

Had no allergies to food or medicines yet.\n\n【18】Physical examination\n\n【19】Admission to the hospital for physical examination： the patient was well-nourished (the Body Mass Index is 25.4 kg/m)， afebrile(Temperature 36.7C) with stable vital signs (Blood Pressure 125/70mmHg， Pulse 87 bpm). The abdomen is flat and soft， there is no intestinal shape or gastrointestinal peristaltic waves. No tenderness in the whole abdomen and rebound pain. There were no palpable liver and spleen below the costal margin or enlarged superficial lymph nodes. After palpation of the abdomen， we found at approximately 40mm x 20 mm sized palpabal solid mass on the right upper abdomen without any signs of discomfort.\n\n【20】Laboratory examinations\n\n【21】Basic laboratory examination revealed normal IgG4， IgG4/IgG ratio， white blood cell count and hemoglobin.

In 1954， Umiker 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> named IMT as an inflammatory pseudotumor because its clinical features and imaging findings mimicked those of malignant tumors. IMT has many synonyms， such as plasma cell pseudotumor， inflammatory pseudotumor， inflammatory myofibroblastic proliferation， inflammatory myofibrohistiocytic proliferation and plasma cell granuloma， due to its histopathological features. IMT shows a predilection for children， adolescents and young adults 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. There is a slight predominance in females (female：male， 4：3) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. IMT could occur in visceral organs and soft tissue throughout the body and the most frequent sites are the lung， mesentery and omentum 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor (IMT) of the abdominal wall is exceedingly rare. We reviewed the relevant literature on PubMed using the key words \"inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor\"and“abdominal wall”. The search through PubMed listed 47 citations involving 4 patients with primary IMT of the abdominal wall 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-7]</u>. Of the 5 reports of IMT arising from the abdominal wall， including the present case， the age at diagnosis ranged from 6 years to 58 years (median age， 49 years old). IMT of the abdominal wall occurred primarily in middle-aged adults other than children or young adults. The predominance of male gender was evident (4 males and 1 female). Abdominal mass and abdominal pains were the most common symptoms. The average tumor size was 10.2 cm. Information about follow-up was available in 4 cases and the average duration of follow-up time was 14 months ranging from 4 to 27 months. One case had a recurrence after 13 months but the other 3 cases did not show recurrence after resection.\n\n【42】Trauma， inflammation， autoimmune disorders， surgery， and infections by the human herpes virus or Epstein-Barr virus could lead to the development of IMT， but the etiology is still unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>[11-13]</u>.

The clinical presentations and radiologic characteristics of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor are nonspecific， so the diagnosis is predominately based on the histopathological features|删除段之间换行|Histologically， IMT is characterized by myofibroblastic spindle cells with infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes.TThree histological patterns have been described， as follows： A compact spindle cell pattern； a myxoid/vascular pattern； and a hypocellular fibrous pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. The myxoid/vascular pattern resembles nodular fasciitis， granulation tissue or other reactive processes， with loosely arranged plump spindle cells in an edematous myxoid stroma， abundant blood vessels and an infiltrate of lymphocytes， plasma cells and eosinophils. The compact spindle cell pattern resembles a variety of spindle cell neoplasms， with a compact fascicular spindle cell proliferation in a collagenous stroma. The hypocellular fibrous pattern resembles a desmoid fibromatosis or scar， with relatively fewer spindle cells in a densely collagenous stroma and scattered inflammatory cells.

However， recent evidence using next-generation sequencing suggests ALK-negative IMTs demonstrate the gene fusions involving ROS-1(ROS删除2换行proto-oncogene 1)， RET (RET proto-oncogene)， PDGFRB (Platelet- Derived Growth Factor Receptor B)， and NTRK (Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase) 通用删除6(英):<u>[28-31]</u>.\n\n【45】Although the spontaneous regression of IMTs has been reported in various organs 通用删除6(英):<u>[32-37]</u>， complete surgical resection is recommended as the primary therapeutic approach for most patients with IMTs 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>. Complete surgical resection is the curative treatment and the best method for diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u>. Incomplete surgical resection is a risk factor for recurrence. If the tumor cannot be completely resected，radiation therapy， chemotherapy，anti-inflammatoryagents， such as corticosteroids and Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs(NSAIDS) can be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>[33，40]</u>.\n\n【46】However， there is no standard systemic treatment and different approaches have been used with varying success rate.

The increased risk of CVD and T2D in an individual with MetS is proposed to be at least partially related to chronic low-grade inflammation that is reflected by increased serum High-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (Hs-CRP)level. We aimed to investigate the relationship between serum hs-CRP and MetS.\n\n【2】Methods： Nine hundred eighty-eight school girls (mean age 14.56±1.53 years) were recruited using random cluster sampling. Demographic information was collected by questionnaire. Biochemical and anthropometric measures were estimated by standard routine procedures. The IDF， NCEP-ATPIII， and two modified NCEP (Cook and DeFerranti) were used for metabolic syndrome diagnosis.\n\n【3】Results and Conclusion： Our findings show that hs-CRP was associated with WC， elevated serum triglyceride and low HDL in adolescent school girls； but the association with serum HDL was weak. We found no correlation between hs-CRP and blood pressure and FBG. For all definitions of MetS， the prevalence of MetS in a high-risk group of hs-CRP (>3 mg/L) was higher than other groups except when using the DeFerrant definition. Logistic regression revealed that the highest and lowest ORs (CI 95%) were in the Cook (1.410(1.22-1.63)) and DeFerranti (1.228(1.14-1.43)) definitions of MetS， respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were： 68.29% to 82.61% and 64.68% to 65.90% for serum hs-CRP using the different definitions， respectively. In ROC analysis， the AUC for different definitions varied between 0.649 to 0.788 and serumhs-CRP cutoff value for all definitions was >1.33mg/L. In conclusion， serum hs-CRP， an inflammatory marker， may be of useful in the diagnosis of MetS in girls； but not reliable.\n\n【4】Keywords： Metabolic syndrome； Pediatrics； Hs-CRP； Low-grade chronic Inflammation； Biomarker； Pro-inflammatory factors\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality globally. The increasing prevalence of obesity and obesity-related condition such as Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is associated with a high risk of CVD mortality and morbidity. Hypertension， life style， smoking， obesity and obesity-related disorder including hyperlipidemia， Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and MetS are identified as a risk factor for CVD 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-4]</u>. MetS comprises a cluster of several metabolic risk factors including central obesity， dyslipidemia， elevated blood pressure， high fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance that are associated with increased susceptibility to CVD and all-cause mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-9]</u>. The high删除1换行risk of CVD and T2D in individuals with MetS， may be associated with a chronic low-grade state of inflammation that is reflected in an increased serum high sensitivity C Reactive Protein (Hs-CRP). Serum hs-CRP is a biomarker of low-grade inflammation. Increased serum hs-CRP is observed in individuals with MetS patients， and is also associated with CVD and T2D risk 通用删除6(英):<u>[10-171</u>.\n\n【7】Examinations of several features that comprise MetS in screening and monitoring procedures， or measuring the prognosis are very problematic especially in adolescent because of pubertal and developmental changes in this period 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Therefore， it may be useful， in screening and monitoring in large scale studies， a single reproducible and reliable marker is identified that can replace the assessment of each of the separate MetS criteria.\n\n【8】Based on the association of hs-CRP with MetS and insulin resistance， some investigators have suggested that serum hs-CRP could be used as a marker for the prediction of CVD and T2D and should be included as one of the diagnostic criteria for MetS通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3，19，20]</u>.\n\n【9】According to findings of the large-scale population cohort of the Women Health Survey (WHS)， there is a relationship between serum hs-CRP， MetS and CVD 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. For the prediction of future risk of coronary heart disease and stroke， serum hs-CRP values have been classified into three categories： <1 (low risk)， 1-3 (moderate risk) and >3 mg/L (high risk) respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. We aimed to investigate the association between serum hs-CRP and definitions for the MetS adjusted for children and adolescents， and its constituent components.\n\n【10】Subjects and Methods\n\n【11】Schoolgirls [mean age of 14.56 ±1.53 years (ranging from 12 to 18years)，resident in the cities of Mashhad and Sabzevar，in northeastern Iran， were recruited using a random cluster sampling method， as part of a vitamin D supplementation study. The study was approved by the local institutional Ethics Committee， as well all participants gave written informed consent. Demographic information collected by using research made questionnaires.\n\n【12】After an overnight fast， blood samples were taken from all participants， for estimation of fasting blood glucose， lipid profile and high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. The high sensitivity C-reactivee protein Was measuredusingparticleenhanced turbidimetric assay (Bioscience， Germany)，and the enzymatic assay was applied to measuring the fasting blood glucose， lipid profile as manufacturer manual (Pars AzmoonTeb， Iran).\n\n【13】Waist circumference was measured at a point midway between124h rib and top of the iliac crest， at the end of normal expiration.\n\n【14】The IDF， NCEP-ATPIII， Cook's and De Ferranti's definitions were used for the diagnosis of MetS as indicated in Table 1.\n\n【15】Prevalence was reported as a percentage. Normality of data was examined by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results represent median and first and third interquartile because of the abnormal distribution of data. Statistical significance was determined by the paired t-test， as well， one-way ANOVA test was used for comparison of means in groups. ROC curves were drawn for estimation ofarea under curves， and the optimal cutoff value was computed by Yandex index and Delong method applied for determining sensitivity and specificity of serum hs-CRP for MetS definitions. Pearson's test was used for computing of association between variables， also the point-biserial删除1换行correlation test was performed for estimation of the correlation between quantitative and dichotomous variables. Binary logistic regression was used for computing of odd ratios (CI 95%). All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 11.0(Chicago. IL.)/MedCalc software version 15.8 was applied for ROC analysis. P-value <0.05 was considered as significant.\n\n【16】Results删除表格换行r=0.085 (P=0.019)， and in DeFerranti's definition r=0.102 (P=0.005). Also， no significant association was observed with fasting blood glucose and blood pressure. The strongest association was observed between WC and hs-CRP values， in WC cutoff for DeFerranti's r=0.246 (P=0.0001) and for other studied definitions r=0.244(P=0.0001).\n\n【17】Table 1 showed the serum Hs-CRP values in subiects with and without MetS and each MetS components separately， and the associations of serum Hs-CRP with each component of MetS based on four different definitions of MetS adapted for children and adolescents represented in this table. In regard to subjects with WC measure that met the criterion of MetS in Cook's， NCEP-ATPIII and IDF， serum hs-CRP was significantly higher in girls with MetS(1.92(1.16-3.86)) as compared to those without MetS (0.9 (0.46-1.68)). Also， similar differences were observed in the WC based on DeFerranti's criterion (754 percentile) with 1.60 (1.00-3.17) VS.0.86(0.43-1.61) of hs-CRP in MetS and non-MetS， respectively. In participants with FBG that met the cutoff values for IDF definition， serum hs-CRP was higher than in healthy girls (1.02 (0.51-2.00) VS.0.95(0.5-1.8))but these differences were not significant(P=0.462)，in the other definitions of MetS a cutoff for FBG (≥ 110 mg/dL)， similar results were observed (hs-CRP in MetS： 1.01(0.48-1.47 vs.non-MetS：0.96 (0.50-1.83)； P=0.994). There were no significant differences between subiects that met the SBP criterion with healthy individuals， while the hs-CRP values were higher in who met the IDF(1.38(0.71-3.54) vs. 0.96 (0.50-1.83) P=0.122)， ATP III and Cook's (0.98 (0.51-2.95) vs. 0.97 (0.50-1.84) P=0.644) and DeFerranti's (1.24(0.63-3.37) vs. 0.98 (0.52-1.91)P=0.376) criteria. In DBP， two different cutoffs were investigated in the studied definitions， in spite of higher values of hs-CRP in individuals with DBP criterion for IDF 1.12 (0.49-3.02) vs. 0.96 (0.50-1.83) and other definitions 1.10 (0.58-1.78) Vs.0.95 (0.50-1.85) contributed to healthy subjects； but again， these differences were not significant (P>0.05). There are three different cutoffs for hypertriglyceridemia among the studied definitions， Hs-CRP concentration in subjects who met the criterion， was significantly higher in each of the three different cutoffs， according to IDF (≥150mg/dL)， ATPIII and Cooks (e 110 mg/dL) and DeFerrant's (e100mg/dL) criteria cutoffs， positive individuals with these cutoff， have serum hs-CRP of 2.09 (1.24-3.34)，1.47(0.75-2.67) and，1.34(0.75-2.37) mg/L， while the negative subjects showed a median serum hs-CRP of 0.92 (0.48-1.75)，0.88(0.45-1.61) and， 0.86 (0.42-1.60) mg/L， respectively. Decreased HDL criterion was also defined by three different cutoffs in used definitions， and IDF and Cook's definitions have the same cutoff (<40 mg/dL).

Often subjects with MetS are classified into a high-risk group of hs-CRP with values more than 3 mg/L. Data on the odd ratios indicate that serum hs-CRP is a risk factor for MetS in female adolescents. The highest andlowest odd ratios were found when using the Cook's or DeFerranti's definitions of MetS， respectively .\n\n【30】ROC analysis showed that serum hs-CRP had the greatest AUC using the NCEP-ATPIII definition， and the smallest for Cook et al. The highest specificity of hs-CRP as a biomarker was observed for the DeFerranti's definition (65.90%)， followed by the NCEP-ATPIII definition (65.53%). However， hs-CRP showed82.61% sensitivity as a marker for NCEP-ATPIII， while DeFerranti's definition has the lowest sensitivity of hs-CRP(68.29%).\n\n【31】In general， hs-CRP showed the highest sensitivity (82.61%) and second highest specificity (65.53%) for NCEP-ATPIII definition.

Results presented in Table 6 show that with an increasing number of components of MetS， the median serum hs-CRPincreased for all the studied criteria except in IDF definition. In the latter definition， in contrast with median values for hs-CRP，most frequent value in 3 or more and two components group was 5.47 mg/L and0.20 mg/L， respectively； but due to different subject numbers in each group， median value in group with two component showed higher amount than 3 or more group.\n\n【33】Discussion\n\n【34】In this study， we aimed to investigate the potential use of serum hs-CRP as a biomarker for pediatric MetS in schoolgirls. MetS was defined using four different criteria： The IDF， NCEP， Cook’s and DeFerrantis definitions. In general， the prevalence of MetS based on studied definitions was verylow and ranged from 1.2% to 4.3% for IDF and DeFerrani's definition， respectively. According to our findings， the highest prevalence was observed in 12 years old and then in 18-year age group. Based on often used definitions of MetS， the 14 years age group showed the lowest prevalence of MetS in this population. Kelishadi et al. reviewed the prevalence of MetS among Iranian children and adolescents；they are reported the prevalence ofpediatric MetS ranged between 1% to 22% based on different definitions， such as NCEP-ATPIII： 3% to 16%， IDF： 0% to 8% and， DeFerranti's： 0%to 22%通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.

In the east of Iran， some reports showed the low prevalence of MetS in children and adolescents 通用删除6(英):<u>[24，251</u>.\n\n【38】Obesity as a maior component of MetS is associated with insulin resistance possibly due to the increased production of inflammatory cytokines， and some researchers believed to inflammation as an important mechanism in the etiology of MetS 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. Serum hs-CRP could be useful for the prediction of CVD risk and diabetes development in the future； as well as prognostic information from the Framingham risk score is available 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. Therefore， in the present study， we measured the association of each definition and their components with hs-CRP values.

Similar to the present study， many studies showed an association between highhs-CRPandMetS通用删除6(英):<u> 3，11，13，16，28-30]</u>. Among the MetS components， obesity has the highest correlation with hs-CRP， this finding has been confirmed by other research which that found association between high hs-CRP and BMI or WC as a measure of obesity 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，13，14，17，20，28，31-33]</u>.\n\n【39】In adults， serum hs-CRP levels are significantly associated with body fat and also with some components of MetS 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. This suggests that a high serum hs-CRP in MetS might be relatedto chronic systemic inflammation. In some studies， there is relationship between lipid profile abnormalities and hs-CRP values 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，11，13，17，28，29，31，34]</u>， relation between hs-CRP and lipid profile disorders might be proposed that this condition affected normal function of liver and high hs-CRP levels lead to liver dysfunction， there are evidence for that adolescent with NAFLD have high-level hs-CRP in comparison of no NAFLD ones 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>， also Oda et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> showed a correlation between hs-CRP levels and ALT.\n\n【40】We did observe no statistically significant association between hs-CRP and FBG and BPs in any of the studied definitions， the relationship between hs-CRP and BP was not significant. Somestudies have reported a significant association between a high serum hs-CRP and systolic BP 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，11，29]</u>， diastolic BP 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，34]</u>； also， some studies like our study did not observe any correlation between hs-CRP and BP通用删除6(英):<u>[20，27，31]</u>. However， Abdullah et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> did find serum hs-CRP was associated with BPs only in obese individuals with MetS. They found no significant correlation between hs-CRP and BP in overweight and normal individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>. This complicated relationship may be attributed to sampling size，gender， and ethnicity and may need more investigation.\n\n【41】We found no significant association between FBG and serum hs-CRP in our study. Similar findings reported by Oliveira et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> which that may be related to increasing of hs-CRP influenced by obesity before the disturbance of glucose metabolism.\n\n【42】Many studies have shown that serum hs-CRP is related to the number of MetS components 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，17，27，29，30]</u>. This suggests MetS components clustering may be accompanied by an increasing pro-inflammatorystatus that is closely related to adiposetissue dysfunction. Also， these findings point to a higher the risk of cardiovascular being a consequence of a higher number of components of MetS.\n\n【43】ROC analysis was performed for computing sensitivity and specificity of serum hs-CRP for pediatric MetS definition. We found sensitivity and specificity， 68.29% to 82.61% and 64.68% to 65.90%for serum hs-CRP for the different definitions of MetS， respectively. AUC for different definitions varied 0.649 to 0.788 and cutoff value for all studied definitions have been determined more than 1.33 mg/L hs-CRP. As similar to these findings， Oda and Kawai reported that AUC of hs-CRP was 0.74 and sensitivity 67% and specificity 72% in Japanese women 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>. In another report， the cutoff value for serum hs-CRP was 1.04 mg/L with sensitivity and specificity， 58% and92%，respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Also， Han et al. resulted that AUC of hs-CRP for prediction of MetS development was 0.684 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. This similarity in different ethnic groups with MetS might be suggested hs-CRP as a potential inflammatory marker for MetS which that reproducible， easy access results； but low values for specificity make it unreliable.\n\n【44】Conclusion\n\n【45】MetS is recognized as a cluster of risk factors including obesity， lipid profile abnormalities， glucose metabolism disorders， and hypertension. MetS is also characterized by a chronic low-grade inflammation condition. Current definitions of MetS lack a component that measures inflammatory status. Serum hs-CRP has been suggested as a sensitive marker that is predictive of MetS as well as the development of cardiovascular problems. The present study investigated the relationship of hs-CRP and MetS in pediatrics. In conclusion， we found an association between hs-CRP and pediatric MetS and some of its components， by certain definitions. We also show that hs-CRP values can predict MetS in pediatrics and suggest measurements of hs-CRP as a risk factor for MetS in large scale screening due to easy access and cost-effective measures， but more studies are required to clarify the clinical application of hs-CRP， particularly in boys， and in girls who are defined by menarche status.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The purpose of this case report is to describe how multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation using the home-based patterns reverse left ventricular remodeling in dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 29-year-old male， repeated hospitalization for heart failure with poorly controlled， received home-based tailored cardiac rehabilitation， repeated chest pain and breathing difficulties， heart fell sharply. The results of auxiliary examinations showed enlargement of heart， with left ventricular ejection fraction of 34.3%， left ventricular end diastolic diameter from 7.5 cm， left ventricular end systolic diameter from 6.2 cm. However， when we consider family economic conditions， we find that the CRT-implant therapy is not suitable for him. Meanwhile they were far removed from hospital. Afterwards， we decide to adopt multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation to help him to alleviate symptoms， reverse left ventricular remodeling and improve the quality of life. Then， we provide home-based CR included comprehensive assessment， scientifically tailored and individualized cardiac rehabilitation prescription and remote wireless ECG monitoring. After 7month home-based CR， his left ventricular Ejection Fraction (EF) improved from 34.3% to 62.2%， left ventricular end diastolic diameter from 7.5 cm to 5.7 cm， left ventricular end systolic diameter from 6.2 cm to 3.8 cm， VO2peak improved from 13.67 to 26.25， VO2AT (ml/kg/min) improved from 7.74 to 14.48， VE/VCO2 decreased from 41.8 to 27.6， there were no adverse events. During the follow-up period his cardiac function maintained stability and live a happy life.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Home-based CR help patient with EF reduced heart failure reverse the left ventricular remodeling， improve the quality of life， proved to be safety.\n\n【4】Keywords： Reverse left ventricular remodeling； Dilated cardiomyopathy； Multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Dilated cardiomyopathy is a common disease， with the left ventricular dysfunction as the main characteristics.\n\n【7】Usually when we face the dilated cardiomyopathy， cardiac resynchronization therapy and medication should be the first choice， but this patient had no CLBBB， the more helpful and valuable treatment to the patient would be the multidisciplinary Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR).\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A-29-year-old male patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy three years ago， he had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 34.3%， and the UCG shows the left ventricular enlargement， experienced edema of both lower limbs and progressive dyspnea， no obvious incentive. However he did not take medicine irregularly. Now he experienced edema of both lower limbs and progressive dyspnea with exercise intolerance again， and his condition was classified as New York Heart Association class III. Thereby， he seeks for the advanced strategies. After carefully examination， we decided to prescribe cardiac rehabilitation for him. Since the patient live in another city far from my hospital.

The causes or pathophysiology of heart failure in DCM may be variable， but Left Ventricular (LV) remodeling is considered the major pathway to deterioration in Left Ventricular (LV) systolic function 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. It’s reported that LV reverse remodeling was associated with ~50% lower mortality rates at 10-year follow-up in DCM patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Over the decades， the Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) has been shown significant benefits on reversing LV remodeling and substantial functional recovery in patients with DCM. It’s widely recognized that timely therapy with Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme(ACEI) inhibitors and beta-blockers confers a LV reverse remodeling and substantial improvement of LVEF in anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. This case firstly demonstrates the successful utilization of home-based cardiac rehabilitation to improve cardiac function and outcomes in a young male with dilated cardiomyopathy. He showed a significant improvement in peak Oxygen Consumption(VO2peak)， left ventricular ejection (%)， and left ventricular end diastolic diameter from baseline after 2 years multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation based on tailored exercise training， combining with tailored psychological intervention， dietary counseling， risk factors control， advice on refraining from smoking and leisure physical activity 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Numerous studies have reported favourable effect of exercise-based CR on LA volume， left ventricular geometry and function， and cardiac prognosis in patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. Isao Nishi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> reported that in CHF patients with advanced LV dysfunction on b-blocker therapy， exercise training successfully improves exercise capacity without adversely affecting LV remodeling or causing serious cardiac complications. However to date， there are no studies focused on CR in heart failure specifically due to dilated cardiomyopathy， future studies should work on this specific population. Significantly， in this case， the young male actually received a home-based CR model under remotely guides from our CR team. Not surprisingly， Home-Based Medical Care (HBMC) is a powerful modality which provides high-quality， patient-centered care beyond the limitation of time and space， especially， during this time of COVID-19 crisis 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>. In this report， we indicated the safety and effectiveness of such a home-based CR program consistent with other HBMC.\n\n【18】Conclusion删除表格换行dilation were would have happened significantly along with the evolution. A case is reported of the using the CR in a 29-year -old man with dilated cardiomyopathy. The report demonstrated that the adoption of CR would help patients achieve better clinical treatment effect and maximize the reversal ofleft ventricular remodeling. At the same time the advantage of the home-based model was also proved to be safe and effective.\n\n【19】Table 3： Exercise prescription.\n\n|  | Frequency  | Intensity (Bases on AT}  | type  | Time(min/d)  | progression  | Notes  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Aerobic exercise  | 5days a week  | 95-105 beat/min  | walking  | initial from 5  | Gradually added to40min  |  |\n| Resistance exercise  | 3 days aweek  | Moderate  | Heellift dumbbell preacher curls  | 10  |  | Execution will begin in half a month  |\n| Breath exercise  | 5 days a week  | Moderate  | Deep breathing training  | Initial from 5  | Gradually added to 30min  |  |\n| Flexibility exercises  | 5 days a week  | Moderate  | Joint stretch (shoulder and hips)  | 10  |  |  |\n\n|  | 2018.2.5  | 2018.5.15  | 2018.8.20  | 2019.2.27  | 2019.4.24  | 2019.8.24  | 2020.5.26  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| VO2peak (ml/kg/min)  | 13.67  | 24.07  | 26.25  | 20.47  | 28.71  | 26.25  | 23.31  |\n| VO2AT (ml/kg/min)  | 7.74  | 13.58  | 14.48  | 14.61  | 14.71  | 15.27  | 13.28  |\n| VE/VCO2  | 41.8  | 29.5  | 27.6  | 30.2  | 29.4  | 27.3  | 29.7  |\n| RERpeak  | 1.03  | 1.25  | 1.12  | 1.06  | 1.13  | 1.12  | 1.10  |\n| HRrest (beats/min)  | 84  | 82  | 74  | 94  | 85  | 98  | 115  |\n| HRpeak (beats/min)  | 126  | 162  | 160  | 148  | 169  | 169  | 173  |\n| SBPrest (mm Hg)  | Not testec  | 104  | 106  | 113  | 111  | 149  | 166  |\n| SBPpeak (mm Hg)  | 128  | 149  | 155  | 130  | 165  | 161  | 196  |\n\n【22】Abbreviations： VO2peak： Peak Oxygen Consumption； VO2AT： Oxygen Consumption At Anaerobic Threshold； VE/VCO2slope： The Slope of Increase in Ventilation Over Carbon Dioxide Output； RERpeak： Respiratory Exchange Ratio at Peak Exercise； Wattmax： Maximal Workload； HRrest： Heart Rate at Rest； HRpeak： Heart Rate at Peak Exercise SBPrest： Systolic Blood Pressure at Rest； SBPpeak： Systolic Blood Pressure at Peak Exercise\n\n【23】Table 5： The changes in UCG.\n\n|  | 2018.01.23  | 2018.5.15  | 2018.8.20  | 2019.8.21  | 2020.5.26  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Left ventricular ejection (%)  | 43.3  | 45.2  | 62.2  | 55.5  | 60.3  |\n| Left ventricular end diastolic diameter  | 7.5  | 6.9  | 5.7  | 6.0  | 6.2  |\n| Left ventricular end systolic diameter  | 6.2  | 5.3  | 3.8  | 4.2  | 4.2  |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The defect in CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) results in various degrees of disrupted ion and fluid transport across epithelial cells， affecting respiratory， digestive， and reproductive systems. Manifestations includes recurrent lung/sinus infections， pancreatic insufficiency， constipation， and biliary dysfunction通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>， with lung complications being the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Previously CF was not considered a cancer syndrome， as these patients used to haveshort life span in past and long-term complications were not studied通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. However survival has improved， to be specific， one cohort study reported increase in the median age of survival from 31.9 years in 1990， to about 49.7 years in 2012 in cases of CF 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Contributing factors include early detection， better nutrition， and newer treatment options 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，6]</u>. With increased survival now， a predisposition to digestive tract malignancies has been identified in these patients通用删除6(英):<u>4]</u>.\n\n【18】Genetic studies have suggested that CFTR is in fact a tumor suppressor gene. In one study， colonic and small intestinal tumors developed in the mice after intestinal CFTR gene was knocked off in them 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. It is hypothesizedthat the alterationin the luminal environment caused by CFTR dysfunction leads to various changes that may ultimately lead to chronic inflammation with its related risk of cancer， since CFTR normally plays important physiologic role in various digestive tract organs通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. In addition， various effects of the disease process (like deficiencies of protective vitamins) could play a role in increasing the risk for cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，8]</u>. At the same time， interestingly and for unknown reasons， the risk of melanoma is shown to be decreased in these cases， although the risk of digestive cancers is increased 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Abdul Karim et al. reported the first case of digestive tract cancer (biliary adenocarcinoma) in CF patient in 1982 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Neglia et al. performed retrospective cohort study on over 38，000 patients with CF from national databases in the US， Canada， and Europeover a 7-year period 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>， and despite no increased risk of other cancers， the risk of digestive tract cancers was significantly increased， with an observed to expected risk ratio of 6.5. In this study， most patients who developed digestive tract cancers were in their thirties and 23% of thosewere colon cancers， making colon cancer the most prevalent. Mayer et al. studied the risk in post-transplant CF patients and found a high risk of fatal colon cancer even in 3 and 4h decades of life通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. A study by Sheldon et al. involving 412 CF patients showed an increase in pancreatic and small intestinal cancers in these cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【19】Therapy related immunosuppressive effect (post lung and/or liver transplant) may potentially accelerate the cancer development process in CF. A 20-year US study followed 41，188 CF patients and confirmed the risk of digestive tract cancers， particularly in post-transplant patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The observed to expected risk ratio for digestive tract cancers was 3.5 (17.3 in post-transplant patients). For the colon and small intestinal cancers analyzed separately， the observed risk was 6.2 and 11.5(30.1 and 52.2 in post-transplant patients)， respectively. Patients who had homozygous deletion mutations for F508， had the highest risk for bowel cancers compared to those with other genetic alterations in CF. This was especially high among those who held the diagnosis of distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (impaction of inspissated stool in distal intestines) which preceded cancer diagnosis by 9 years in many， but no similar increased risk was observed in association with other CF complications. Their data also showed higher frequency of cancers in right colon.\n\n【20】In general， colon cancer is one ofthe more preventable cancersin the general population through efficient screening andearly detection of premalignant adenomas and non-invasive cancers， often detected by colonoscopy， CT colonography (CTC)， or other screening strategies 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>. Screening is advocated by the US Preventative Services Task Force to startat the age of 50 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>， but earlier删除1换行screening is recommended in the presence of genetic risk factors通用删除6(英):<u>[4，12，14]</u>. After colonoscopy irrespective of the type of indication， the risk for colon cancer has shown to be significantly reduced for up to 10 years 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，15]</u>. Until recently， there were no recommendations for colon cancer screening in patients with CF 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Many studies on screening colonoscopy had exclusion criteria for CF patients with predicted FEV1<25， 40 or 50%通用删除6(英):<u>[1，4，8]</u>. However， these patients could be at higher risk for developing cancer because of the severity of their disease requiring organ transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【21】The Minnesota Cystic Fibrosis centerhad recently recommended screening colonoscopy for their in-center CF patients starting at age 40， and they analyzed the data in 2 continuous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，8]</u>. Adenomas were found in half of their cases， with half of those being advanced adenomas. Three out of their 88 patients developed colon cancer.Surveillance of their study population revealed new adenomas in 47%， with more advanced adenomas in those previously detected. Findings suggested a high yield， even when screening was performed at 1 to 2 year intervals in these patients. This study also suggested that the adenoma progression to cancer is faster in CF. Furthermore， in additional 27 patients aged 30-39 who underwent diagnostic colonoscopy for various indications； 4 (15%)had adenomas， with one of them advanced. In this study， CF related diabetes and homozygous AF508 mutation were risk factors for polyp formation. Male gender， lung transplantation， and homozygous mutation were associated with advanced or multiple adenomas.」 This study supported early screening colonoscopybeginning at age 40 in clinically stable patients， and recommended annual surveillance colonoscopy if >3 polyps or advanced polyp were detected.\n\n【22】The first consensus recommendations for colorectal cancer screening in CF patients were developed in 2017 by a task-force convened by the CF foundation 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. They recommend screening colonoscopy beginning at age 40 (30 in organ transplant recipients)， with 5-year screening intervals and 3-year surveillance intervals， unless findings dictate shorter intervals. These guidelines are considered to be beneficial tomost CF patients above age 40. However， some studieshave reported colonic cancers in younger CF patients， for example， in the 3 decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，18]</u> and even cases of advanced cancer in 18- and 13-year olds reported by McKenna et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>and Ibele et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>， respectively. We recently encountered a 36-year old CF patient who was found to have advanced sigmoid colonic cancer . Neglia et al. found many CF cases with cancer in their 3 decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【23】Newer colorectal cancer screening tests， iincluding stool DNA testing and CT colonography (CTC)， offer promise as less-invasive screening exams for CF patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，21]</u>. These can be particularlymore useful for CF patientswith impaired respiratory reserve and/or with sedation or anesthesia risks preventing them from undergoing screening colonoscopy通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Plumb et al. studied CTCas part of national screening program in patients in whom colonoscopy was unfeasible or incomplete 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>， and found it well tolerated and extremely safe. They concluded that CTC can be delivered across a national screening program. Devir et al. compared CTC to conventional colonoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>， and they indicated that CTC is valuable alternative to colonoscopy with very high sensitivity and specificity for various pathologic colon findings. Some studies have reported 90-100% sensitivity of CTC in detecting colon cancer cases删除4-1:<u>23-25</u>.\n\n【24】In contrast to alimited number of colonoscopy studies in patients删除1换行with CF， there have been no studies evaluating use of CTC in CF patients. Thus， in our opinion， studies are needed to evaluate the utility of CTC in the younger CF population. Until then， a high index of suspicion for colorectal adenoma and cancer should be maintained in young symptomatic patients of CF. In summary， although new guidelines have recommended early screening colonoscopy for detection of colonic cancers or precancerous lesions in CF patients above age 40 years， many CF patients are unable to undergo such invasive procedures. This is particularly true for those that are considered to be at high risk forcolonoscopy and related procedure complications， and these cases are at the same time more prone to developing colonic cancers. Furthermore， many colon malignancies develop in CF patients who are younger than age 40. Therefore， more studies are needed to explore the utility of alternative screening methods like CTCand DNA stooltesting with the potential ofrefining future screening recommendations for young CF population.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We recommend pre-operation color Doppler ultrasound and urgent treatment for the giant hydronephrosis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Giant； Hydronephrosis； Pulmonary thromboembolism； Risk factor\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Pulmonary Thromboembolism (PTE) is defined as the blockage of the pulmonary artery by a thrombus， usually caused by Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in lower limbs. It could be a serious complication after surgery， especially orthopedic surgeries， which require prolonged bed rest 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Generally speaking， Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) carries only a low risk of PTE 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Zeng et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> reported an experience with more than 10，000 PCNL without a case of PTE. Recently， we treated a patient with right giant hydronephrosis who developed PTE the day after left PCNL.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 50-vear-old Chinese woman was referred to our hospital because of left-sided flank pain. Her medical history was unremarkable， and no significant sign was revealed during physical examination except for abdominal distension. Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed a huge cystic right kidney occupying almost three-fourth of the abdominal cavity， displacing the small intestine， colon and left kidney. The inferior vena cava was compressed  because of the right upper ureteric calculi， which extended to the left side . The left kidney also showed moderate hydronephrosis with left upper ureteric calculi . The Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) was 5.4 ml/min for right kidney and 85.2 ml/min for left kidney. The serum creatinine was within normal range as were other systemic examinations and laboratory results. Since the patient mainly suffered from left-sided flank pain and in order to maximally protect renal function， she underwent right double-J catheterization in lithotomy position and left PCNL in prone position. Prophylactic anticoagulant was not given and the operation was successfully completed in ≤ 40 minutes， without obvious bleeding.\n\n【7】However， the next day after the operation， the patient suddenly experienced syncope after off bed activity， and she regained consciousness a few minutes later. Urgent CT scan showed thrombosis in the right main pulmonary artery  and the serum D-dimer level was ≥ 5 mg/L， so a diagnosis of PTE was established. The patient received oxygen and heparin anticoagulants， but did not require respirator. Ten days later， her general condition improved and another CT scan showed that the thrombosis had disappeared . Four months after PCNL， her serum creatinine remained normal and the GFR was 5.0 ml/min for right kidney and 85.2 ml/min for left kidney， so laparoscopic right nephrectomy was performed.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines in the United Kingdom， the following patients may have risk factors for venous thromboembolism：patients with active cancer or cancer treatment， age more than 60years， dehydration， critical care admission， known thrombophilias， significant medical comorbidities (ex.： heart disease； metabolic； endocrine or respiratory pathologies； acute infectious disease； inflammatoryconditions)，hormoneereplacement therapyOI oestrogen-containing contraceptive therapy，personal history or first-degree relative with a history of venous thromboembolism， varicose veins with phlebitis， women who are pregnant or have given birth within the previous 6 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Although surgery itself may be a risk factor， PTE can also occur several days after operation due to删除1换行prolonged bed rest. Our patient did not have any above high risk factors， and the only suspicious factor was the giant hydronephrosis|删除段之间换行|Giant hydronephrosis is defined as the presence of over 1 liters of urinewithin the adult renal collecting system. Congenitalureteropelvic junction obstruction is the most common cause followed by stone disease，trauma and tumor. Flank pain or asymptomatic progressive abdominal distension is the usual complaint. Nephrectomy is the commonest treatment because of the irreversible renal insufficiency Giant hydronephrosis may cause infection， malignant degeneration and rupture ofthe kidney. Compression ofthe surrounding structures is another main concern， including vein， intestine and contralateral ureter. Aliotta et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> once reported a case of left iliofemoral vein thrombosis with extension to the inferior vena cava associated with giant hydronephrosis. Vascular endothelial injury， slow blood flow and hypercoagulable state are three factors causing DVT. Our patient had ≥4liters of fluid in the collecting system， which may have compressed the vessels， reduced the blood flow and finally caused thrombosis. We did not perform color Doppler ultrasound before the operation in this case. Although without direct evidence， it was reasonable to deduce giant hydronephrosis as a potential high risk factor for PTE.\n\n【10】This case will strengthen the awareness of giant hydronephrosis as a potential high risk factor for thromboembolism.

A very uncommon tumor in adults， the most common site is the IV ventricle， less often in the third ventricle or the cerebellopontine angle 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Based on histology， choroid plexus tumors have been sub-classified into Choroid Plexus Papilloma (CPP， World Health Organization [WHO] grade I)， atypical Choroid Plexus Papilloma(aCPP， WHO grade II)，and Choroid Plexus Carcinoma (CPC，WHO grade III)， with aCPP showing increased mitotic activity and CPC displaying common histological hallmarks of malignancy通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. CPPs are typically treated by surgical resection alone， with excellent outcomes. In contrast， treatment outcomes for CPC remain poor， especially when gross total resection is not feasible 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. While adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy appear to improve survival in CPC， and use of radiotherapy is limited， especially in infants and very young children because of treatment-related toxicities. Whether CPPs behave， (and therefore should be treated) in similar fashion to CPPs or CPCs remains controversial， with some data suggesting response may be age-dependent 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Subarachnoid spread of atypical CPPs is uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【8】We report a case of atypical choroid plexus papilloma of the fourth ventricle in an adult patient， in whom， ten years after surgical resection； spinal tumor metastasis to a Tarlov cyst of the sacrum was diagnosed.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】Fifty-three year-old female， who consulted at our institution in 2005 because of recent onset headache associated with vertigo. Physical examination revealed right gaze torsional nystagmus， left appendicular ataxia， tandem gait with instability and positive Romberg test. MR showed the presence of a tumor lesion in the IV ventricle ofintermediate signal strength on T2-weighted images，\n\n【11】In December of2005，the patient wassubjected to surgicalresection in the Concorde position through a medullary (telovelotonsilar) approach. Complete resection was possible and no post-operative sequelae were observed. Pathology report indicated presence of choroid plexus papilloma， with 2% Ki 67 expression .\n\n【12】Post-op control MRI of the brain and spine showed no residual macroscopic tumor.\n\n【13】In the year 2009 however， routine follow up MR imaging showed tumor recurrence in the left lateral recess of the IV ventricle， of similar morphology to the original tumor . This was resected at another institution and the pathology report confirmed atypical choroid plexus papilloma recurrence with 8% Ki-67 proliferation fraction.\n\n【14】In 2010， a new local recurrence was diagnosed and treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery； the procedure was repeated in 2013， due to a new local recurrence.\n\n【15】In March 2015，MRI showed increased size of the IV ventricle nodular lesion， as well as presence of otherlesions of similar behavior along the walls of the IV ventricle， suggesting meningeal spread. MRI of the spine showed multiple perineural Tarlov cysts， in the lumbar and sacral regions， with the largest on the left side at S1 level.

In November 2015， the patient received craniospinal irradiation (3000 cGy) with a boost of 600 cGyin the upper spine and 1500 cGy in the lower spine.\n\n【21】At most recent follow up visit in November 2016， patient remains asymptomatic with no signs of radiological progression.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Choroid Plexus Papillomas (CPP) is rare neoplasms originating in the choroid plexus epithelium， and constitute approximately to0.2% of all CNS tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. WHO classification of these tumors will depend on the number of mitoses， degree of nuclear pleomorphism， cell density and presence or absence of necrosis.\n\n【24】Typical CPPs are considered Grade I tumor according to the WHO classification. Atypical or anaplastic choroid plexus tumors showing more pleomorphism， cellularity and mitoses， correspond to grade II， and represent the transition from a low grade to a high grade tumor. Choroid plexus carcinomas are classified as Grade III according to the WHO， and present evident signs of malignancy. The atypical subtype was incorporated in the 2007 version of WHO classification 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【25】The patient we present showed metastatic leptomeningeal dissemination in a Tarlov cyst.

Distal metastases of CPPs are more common in tumors located in the posterior fossa， 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> and have been associated most often with choroid plexus carcinoma. However， the multicenter CPT-SIOP-2000 study reports 21% of carcinomas and 19% of atypical CPPs present distal spread 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>\n\n【27】After searching the English and Spanish language medical literature， we were unable to find any reports on atypical CPP spread to a Tarlov cyst.\n\n【28】Tarlov or perineural cysts develop as a result of dilated sheaths between endo and perineural spaces of nerve roots 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Incidence in the general population is between 4.6% and 9%， with equal gender distribution and higher prevalence among young adults 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.

PainDraineris a drug-free， self-management tool， powered by artificial intelligence that adapts to the self-reported activities of each individual patient， resulting in a truly patient-centric support. The tool was tested in an open label， one-arm pilot study performed in two phases， encompassing in total 15 patients. The change in quality of life， pre-and post-treatment by using PainDrainer\"， was measured using a PROMIS Pain Interference 6a validated questionnaire. The outcome showed a statistically significant improvement in pain interference， surpassed the minimal important difference between T-scores， and showed a reduction in pain intensity after six weeks'treatment. In conclusions the study showed both patient acceptance and improvement in quality of life for chronic pain patients.\n\n【2】Commentary\n\nPain is one of the most common reasons patients see a physician 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>， a leading reason for suffering and disability 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>， and more than 100 million individuals only in the United States suffer from chronic pain 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. This condition is considered as a major worldwide health problem and is associated with high personal and economic costs. Despite the high prevalence of chronic pain， most patients find even the most up to date treatments falling short due lack of efficacy or significant side effects. The current Opioid Crisis in the United States is a clear example of this problem 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Also， many patients have very limited access to highly specialized pain clinics due to both availability and/or cost 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. An alternative option to increase accessibility， not only to chronic pain patients，but to a variety of health conditions are digital tools for self- management. Those tools have emerged over the past few years， one example being the recently developed PainDrainer\"通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> for chronic pain. PainDrainer\" was developed in collaboration with health care providers， pain specialists and experts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is utilizing the concept of the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy(ACT)通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>， believed to constitute a core component in evidence-based treatment of chronic pain. ACT is considered a form of clinicalbehavior analysis and is based on functional contextualism leading to effective action and clinical interventions. Furthermore，ACT has a behavioral perspective of inner experience， for example pain， caused by environmental events which may influence the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. According to the American Psychological Association， ACT also recently achieved the status of “well established” for the treatment for chronic pain. If the relationship between daily activities and the experienced pain level of the patient could be understood and the balance be improved， it would allow the patients to do more， suffer less and improve their Quality of Life(QoL). In order for a patient to learn how their daily activities affect their pain， the different activities and pain levels need to be recorded， analyzed and presented back to the patient. Since the human brain can only process around four parameters at a given time 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>， the relation between daily activities and pain is difficult to comprehend and interpret. Inaccurate conclusions can lead to problems， such as fear avoidance and catastrophizing. However， a digital device powered by artificial intelligence could better quantitative， clarify and decipher the relationship of daily activities and pain， which in turn could help patients maximize their desired activities. PainDrainer was|删除段之间换行|T-scores were calculated and compared at the start of the study and post-treatment after around 6 weeks of using PainDrainer. The T-score shows how many standard deviations the result is from the mean and a post-treatment reduction indicated a positive response. The positive response rate in the first phase was 56% (5/9)， while 44%(4/9) of the patients showed no improvement. In the second phase， the positive response rate was 83% (5/6)， while 17% (1/6) of the patients showed no improvement . The power in the response was then analyzed， using a one-tail， paired T-tests to calculate the statistical difference between T-scores， pre- and post-treatment. In phase one， the p-value between the T-scores obtained pre-and post-treatment was 0.0086 and in phase two the p-value was0.0014. The Minimally Important Difference (MID) 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> was then analyzed for both study phases ， where MID refers to the smallest meaningful difference in T-score that carries implications for the patient. For pain interference， MID estimates range from 2 to 3T-score points 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In our first study phase the mean difference between T-scores was 3.0， while in the second study phase a mean of4.8 was recorded. Consequently， after using PainDrainer\"for around six weeks the result surpassed a clinically relevant MID. This effect was also sustained in the majority of patients that continued to use PainDrainer\" for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was improvement in pain interference， indicated by a decrease in T-score， which the results supported. The secondary outcome was experienced pain intensity measured by the NRS scale. A reduction was recorded in10/15 patients ， with a mean reduction in pain intensity of1.6 units (range 1-4 units). Three patients showed no change， while two patients showed an increased pain level with one unit. PainDrainer is powered by an AI engine and uses machine learning to teach an individual model associating activities with average pain. The model is based on artificial neural networks， specifically a multi-layer perceptron with a single hidden layer . During training(back-propagation) the weight factors are tuned such that a given activity record corresponds to the average pain as recorded by the patient. The training is carried out to ensure that model can generalize as good as possible to unseen activity settings. A trained model can be queried in a reverse fashion to find appropriate activities for a desired average pain level. To test the engine， we analyzed the convergence rate for each responding patient， using version 14. The AI engine showed convergence in all responding patients after their individual logging of activities. A converging AI engine demonstrates that the software adapts to the input data of each individual patients， illustrating the concept of patient-centricity. The effect of ACT has been investigated in a number of traditional clinical studies， where the outcome has varied from none to modest improvements in pain interference通用删除6(英):<u>[11，12]</u>，while resulting in more significant improvements in depression， and anxiety 通用删除6(英):<u>[11，13]</u>. Several trials with digitally delivered ACT have also been conducted 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，14，15]</u>， including smart phone applications， although these have not provided anytheoretical rationale or have undergone clinical efficacytesting 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. PainDrainer is， to the best of our knowledge， the first digital tool， powered by artificial intelligence to address an unlimited accessibility for chronic pain patients to a drug free， self-management tool with initial clinical evidence. In summary， we have designed a truly patient-centric digital tool to circumvent questions， such as what works for whom， how and under which circumstances? Consequently， we tested a digital， self-management tool powered by an AI engine， in a pilot study for chronic pain patients. The outcome of the study indicates删除1换行that by utilizing PainDrainer the patients achieved an increased QoL， due to the fact that the AI engine allowed them to better manage the relation between their daily activities and their pain. The positive indications from the present pilot study will form the basis for further clinical investigations with larger sample size and an extended follow-up period.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The echocardiogram revealed moderate-large volume pericardial effusion. The PET/CT revealed pathognomonic coated aorta and highest uptake in both long bones， we performed a bone marrow biopsy. ECD was confirmed by foamy non-Langerhans histiocytes with CD68+CD1a-S100-.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 66-year-old woman presented with dyspnea and legs edema over 2 months， worsening of paroxysmalnocturnal dyspnea for 1 week. Her Department of Cardiology，Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University， Dalian， Liaoning Province 116023， China only medical history was hypertension， which she had been taking medicine regularly. The patient was diagnosed with heart failure in local hospital 1 week ago. The chest radiograph and transthoracic echocardiography at the local hospital both reported massive pericardial effusion， and abdominal ultrasound showed bilateral hydronephrosis. So， she came to the Second hospital of Dalian Medical University， China for further treatment. On admission， her vital signs were： Blood pressure 193/98 mmHg， pulse rate of 88 beats/min， respiratory rate 20 breaths/min， and body temperature of 36.3°C. We didn’t find arrhythmia and hypo-phonetic sounds. Her chest examination revealed minimal moist crackles at both bases. The abdomen examination showed no abnormalities and without hepatosplenomegaly. No cervical， inguinal or axillary lymphadenopathy was identified. There were no cutaneous nor neurological abnormal findings.\n\n【4】Methods andProcedures\n\n【5】Blood gas analysis showed type II respiratory failure (Under oxygen inhalation： O2 partial pressure of 69.2 mmHg， CO2 partial pressure of 69.1 mmHg). Laboratory studies revealed BNP， NT-pro BNP and myocardial necrosis markers were normal. The inflammatory markers， including Complete Blood Count (CBC)， C-Reactive Protein (CRP)， Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) were also normal. We didn’t find any abnormal results in regular tests， including renal function， liver function， thyroid function， coagulation screen， total cholesterol， glucose and tumor specific antigen. As well as we detected indicators related to rheumatic immune system diseases， the autoantibody screen was negative (rheumatoid factor， and antinuclear antibody， anti-dsDNA， anti-Sm， anti-SSA (Ro)， anti-RNP and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies). Although we had suspected tuberculosis， but ultimately ruled it out.\n\nThe echocardiogram revealed normal systolic function and moderate-large volume pericardial effusion (left ventricular ejection fraction： 60%)， then we took pericardiocentesis with total 300 ml effusion. The routine of pericardial effusion preferred some atypical cells and without tumor cells. Urinary tract CT angiography (CTU) suggested bilateral renal changes that tended to be inflammatory， but did not rule out tumor . Kidney biopsy were performed， and|删除段之间换行|the pathology results showed inflammatory change . The whole-body Positron Emission Tomography (PET-CT) was performed furtherly， and it revealed fluorodeoxyglucose highest uptake in multiple organs， including all levels of blood vessels， optic nerve， bones， kidney and other organs . The whole-body bone scan revealed increased uptake in multifocal bone lesions， special in both distal femurs. Cardiac and aortic lesions involvement were identified. The results indicated a systemic disease.\n\nAfter a multi-disciplinary treatment， Erdheim-Chester disease was highly suspected. The characteristic pathologic feature of ECD删除2换行is histiocytosis. Due to the limitations of the myocardial biopsy， we performed a bone marrow biopsy furtherly.

The incidence of ECD is extremely low， since it was first reported in 1930. Until 2019， there are only 1，500 known cases worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The median age at diagnosis of ECD was 60 years， the male/female patient ratio was 3：1for pure ECD 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. ECD often involves in multiple systems， such as lung， kidney， bone and nervous system. With the development of imaging，thepositive rate ofthe cardiovascular system in ECDhas been improved. The specific cardiovascular changes include the fibrosis in periaortic，pericardial， myocardial， or less often peri-coronary fibrosis通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>，and cardiovascular involvement occurs in up to 75% of patients通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The incidence of diffuse thickening and/or pericardial effusion is 13% to 24%， but cardiac tamponade hardly occurs 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. When cardiac was involved predicting worse prognosis， the mortality rate is as high as 40% 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. At present， characterized histological changes are still the gold standard for ECD diagnosis， at assistance of radiologic examinations such as 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. In this case， we found foamy and CD68+CD1a-histiocytes in bone marrow， even though the kidney biopsy was negative. In this case we observed pericardial effusion， and we also observed pathognomonic coated aorta through PET/CT. We did not find the other characterized feature， such as right atrium pseudotumor， whose incidence rate is 30%通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【9】The pathogenesis of ECD is still unclear， and treatment is mainly related to gene mutations. The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is a cellular signaling pathway， which plays a major role in tumors. BRAFV600E mutation results in an activation of RAS-ERK pathway， independently of RAS activation. BRAFV600E mutations have been detected in patients with LCH. The study showed that ECD and LCH share similar oncogenic pathways. A BRAFV600E mutation was detected by pyrosequencing in 13 of 24 (54%) patients with ECD. In addition， immunohistochemical analysis of ECD tissue samples using BRAFV600E-selective antibody showed that the mutation was only expressed in typical foam histiocytes and Touton giant cells， but not in lymphocytes， fibroblasts， and endothelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. The BRAFV600E mutation was also positive in this patient， and the treatment is based on the special gene mutation (the result was not supplied). This reported patient has been participating in the clinical trial of BRAFV600E inhibitor for half a year. During follow-up， pericardial effusion and other clinical symptoms have not appeared again， such as weakness， dyspnea and legs edema.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】ECD is a rare histiocytic neoplasm， cardiovascular involvement is frequent and indicates a poor prognosis.

It is characterized by a rapid onset of interdental gingival necrosis， gingival bleeding and gingival pain. Other systemic factors such as malaise， fever and lymphadenopathy can also be found. The establishment of a rapid diagnosis is very important in order to avoid complications. The treatment of NUG is organized in successive steps and predisposing factors should be taken into account in order to obtain stable outcomes. The present case report describes the diagnosis approach and the treatment of NUG in a 21-year-old female patient.\n\n【2】Keywords： Necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis； Necrotizing periodontal diseases； Diagnosis； Treatment\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (NUG) is a severe form of acute inflammatory periodontal diseases. It is characterized by the necrosis of the interdental gingiva， gingival bleeding and gingival pain 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Since this disease is found especially in military personnel， the true prevalence ofthe NUG is unknown because most of the studies are based on military recruits and are not representative of the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. NUG is defined by some clinical symptoms such as edematous， hemorrhagic and inflamed dental papilla. This papilla is usually covered by a white layer with an ulcerated gingival margin surrounded by an erythematous halo. The lesion is limited to the gingival tissue and does not generate any periodontal attachment loss 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Halitosis can be detected in the majority of patients， and some systemic symptoms like fever，lymphadenopathy and malaise can also be found通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In 1999， the international workshop for the classification ofperiodontal diseases and conditions proposed a new category of periodontal diseases： Necrotizing periodontal diseases that included both necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. According to the new classification of the last world workshop AAP/EFP 2017， necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis has been replaced by the term of necrotizing gingivitis. Also based on the location， necrotizing periodontal diseases have been subdivided into necrotizing gingivitis， necrotizing periodontitis and necrotizing stomatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The aim of this paper is to report the management of a case of a 21-year-old female patient diagnosed with NUG associated to stress.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 21-year-old female patient was referred to the periodontics department at the University of Hassan II of Casablanca， Morocco. Her main chief of complaint was gingival pain in the lower incisor’s region and also gingival bleeding during tooth brushing.\n\n【7】Clinical examination revealed evident halitosis， necrosis and ulceration of the interdental papilla’s covered by a pseudomembrane. The papilla was absent in some sites and generalized accumulation of oral biofilm was observed on dental surfaces. Large calculus deposits were detected on the right upper posterior teeth. It was due to her unilateral chewing habits . During the physical examination， we reported the presence of lymphadenopathy even if no systemic condition that could predispose the patient to NUG was found. However， we reported a psychological stress probably due to her studies. X-rays examination showed no interproximal bone loss . Laboratory HIV test was done with the patient's consent and the result was negative. Based on the clinical data obtained at the examination， NUG was diagnosed. The treatment was taken urgently：Application of chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% using sterile swabs， associated with ultrasonic supra-gingival debridement. An oral administration of antibiotic (500 mg of metronidazole 3 times a day during 7 days)， chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12%+ Chlorhydrate Cetylpyridinium Chloride mouth rinse (twice a day for 15 days) were performed. A motivational approach to changing the patient’s oral hygiene habits was emphasized by the clinical team. Three days after， an ultrasonic sub-gingival debridement was performed to disorganize sub-gingival biofilm and to remove sub-\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (NUG) involves only gingival tissue without periodontal attachment loss. This infectious disease is conditioned by several predisposing factors that compromise the host immune response 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Many factors can contribute to NUG， such as psychological stress， poor diet， insufficiency sleep， alcohol， tobacco， poor oral hygiene， pre-existing gingivitis， and HIV infection. These factors seem to affect the host immune response and enhance the bacterial pathogenesis. Psychological stress can be responsible of the reduction of gingival microcirculation and also the salivary flow. It increases also adrenocortical secretions and modifies the function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes. Hence， it can alter the immune response 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>， and increase the susceptibility to infections and bacterial proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. In the present case， the patient was suffering from stress caused by her studies. This factor is an important parameter that predispose to NUG.\n\nThe diagnosis of NUG is made clinically according to the presence ortheabsence of 3 important clinical symptoms that are interproximal necrosis often described by 《punched out》 ulcerated papillae，gingival bleeding and gingival pain 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. These clinical signs were all detected in the present case. Systemic signs as lymphadenopathy， fever and malaise have also been reported to occur in NUG 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In the present case， fetid breath andlymphadenopathy were also detected at clinical|删除段之间换行|examination.\n\n【11】Concerning the histological aspect， the observation ofthe gingival tissue with light microscopy shows the presence of an ulcer within the stratified squamous epithelium and the superficiallayer of the gingival connective tissue， surrounded by a nonspecific acute inflammatory reaction. In a classic electron microscopic investigation， four zones associated with the gingival lesion of NUG were identified 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>： A superficial bacterial area； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> a neutrophil-rich zone； 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> a necrotic zone and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> spirochetal infiltration zone. Additional findings included plasma cells in the deeper parts and IgG and complement factor C3 between epithelial cells. These observations have been confirmed by electron microscopy， adding areas of transition to a chronic stage of inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【12】The microbiota composition associated with NUG includes Treponema sp.， P melaninogenicus sp. Intermedius， Fusobacterium sp.， Selemonas sp. and A. odontolyticus. The findings of Loesche in1982 confirm that these microorganisms are contributors to the pathogenesis of this disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. According to the last EFP/AAP workshop 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>， other bacterial types were also described in the NUG microbiota. The authors reported a microbiota containing 4 bacterial species that are P. intermedia， Treponema， Selenomonas and Fusobacteriur.\n\n【13】The diagnosis of NUG may be confused with primary herpetic gingivostomatitis， desquamative gingivitis， agranulocytosis， leukemia and ascorbic acid deficiency associated gingivitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【14】The treatment of NUG should be approached in successive stages. This treatment includes the management of the acute phase， treatment of any pre-existing condition， treatment of abnormalities following the disease， and transition to supportive periodontal therapy phase. The first phase aims to control patient’s discomfort and to stop tissue destruction. This involves ultrasonic debridement of superficial gingival plaques and calculus along with oxygen therapy通用删除6(英):<u>[71</u>. The use of 0.12% Chlorhexidine Gluconate mouth rinse can be recommended twice a day for 15 to 30 days 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Patients with severe or moderate NUG and local lymphadenopathy or other systemic symptoms are placed on antibiotic regimen of Penicillin (500 mg every 6 h) 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> and 250 mg of Metronidazole every 8 h for 7 days). Metronidazole is the appropriate choice of drugs because it is active against anaerobic bacteria's 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Antibiotics should be continued until systemic complication subside 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【15】Predisposing factors should be evaluated and also treated. Patient education is very important in order to maintain a good oral health. Oral hygiene instructions should be reinforced and patients should be placed into a maintenance program 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】NUG is a specific acute periodontal disease. The diagnosis is based on the presence of typical clinical features that are papilla necrosis， gingival bleeding and gingival pain. A successful treatment should be organized on successive steps. Risk factors should also be taken into consideration in order to avoid the occurrence of this disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Affected patients must undergo device removal； however， the optimal timing of new pacemaker reimplantation after infected pacemaker removal is still under debate. Some patients require reimplantation as soon as possible； however， the safety of same-day reimplantation is controversial.\n\n【2】Objective： We sought to evaluate the safety and outcomes of same-day reimplantation in patients diagnosed with pacemaker device infection after lead extraction.\n\n【3】Methods： We recruited patients who underwent same-day pacemaker reimplantation at our center after complete lead extraction due to infection between May 2014 and December 2018.\n\n【4】Results： A total of 24 patients (median age， 72 years； range， 3 to 92 years) underwent same-day reimplantation after successful pacemaker extraction. All patients demonstrated isolated pocket infection and were pacemaker-dependent. The average follow-up period was 59.7 ±16.5 months. Two patients died 3 years after the procedure due to sudden non-cardiac death. None of the patients developed reinfection.\n\n【5】Conclusion： In this study， same-day reimplantation of a new pacemaker was safe and feasible in patients with isolated pocket infection after extraction of the infected pacemaker.\n\n【6】Keywords： Pacemaker； Isolated pocket infection； Reimplantation；Device-related complications\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】With progressive population aging and the expanding indications for Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic Devices (CIEDs)， the use of pacemakers has increased exponentially over recent decades 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. With this increase， there has also been substantial growth in the number of CIED complications， especially infectious complications. Antibiotic treatment and complete extraction of the infected CIED are the two dominant methods to control infectious complications通用删除6(英):<u>[2-4]</u>. However， these interventions are not easy to perform， and the optimal timing for CIED reimplantation after infected CIED removal is still uncertain 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Current management strategies have mainly been examined in the context of a population age group distributed between 18 to 75years old. As such， there is limited evidence on the optimal management strategies in octogenarians and children， due to the high incidence of cardiovascular diseases and medical comorbidities in these groups 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. In this study， we aimed to describe our experience in the treatment of isolated pocket infection by pacemaker removal with same-day reimplantation of a new pacemaker.\n\n【9】Materials and Methods\n\n【10】Peking University People’s Hospital (PUPH) is thelargest tertiary center for CIED management in China. All patients who underwent lead extraction and reimplantation of a new pacemaker on the same day as leads removal for infection between May 2014 and December 2018 at PUPH were included. Patients who did not un dergo devicereimplantation or did not survive tohospital discharge were excluded from the study. Among all included patients， we compared those who underwent device reimplantation within 48 h of lead extraction with those who received device reimplantation删除1换行more than 72 h after lead extraction. Demographic data were collected， including age， sex， and medical history， indications for CIED implantation， clinical status， and cardiac rhythm. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Peking University， and all patients provided written informed consent.\n\n【11】The definition and classification of CIED infection were based on the 2010 scientific statement from the American Heart Association on CIED infections and their management 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Isolated pocket infection was diagnosed if signs of inflammation were confined to the generator pocket， including local erythema， warmth， fluctuance， tenderness， or hardware protrusion through the skin， with negative blood cultures. Systemic infection was classified as an increase in the white blood cell count and/or a positive blood culture and/or visible vegetation during cardiovascular ultrasound examination. In fact， this study only included patients with isolated pocket infection.\n\n【12】Before the procedure， all patients were treated with intravenous antibiotics from admission to discharge once blood cultures were obtained. Intravenous antibiotics were administered throughout the extraction and reimplantation procedure. After discharge， patients received a 10-day course of oral antibiotics.\n\n【13】Transvenous lead extraction was conducted in the hybrid operating room. All patients underwent lead extraction and new device implantation by an experienced electrophysiologist， with a cardiac surgeon as a back-up. Radial artery sheaths were placed for hemodynamic monitoring， and a temporary pacing catheter was advanced from the femoral vein into the right ventricular apex for pacing support during the procedure. Removal by simple traction was first attempted， and if unsuccessful， more advanced tools were deployed. These tools included locking stylets， mechanical dilator sheaths (Evolution； Cook Medical)， and laser sheaths (Spectranetics). A combination of all of the above or surgical device removal was implemented based on the lead dwell time， the number of leads， and the surgeon's preference. Complete extraction was defined as removal of the entire lead， while partial extraction was defined as removal of most of the lead components， except for the electrode tip and <4 cm of the wire or insulation.\n\n【14】The indication for reimplantation was thoroughly reevaluated before the procedure. The contralateral pectoral was the first choice of placement for the replacement device. Alternatively， the iliac vein or epicardium was considered. After complete lead extraction， the reimplantation region was prepared in a sterile fashion. With the temporary pacing catheter still in place in the femoral vein， the new pacemaker device was implanted.\n\n【15】Post-implantation device interrogation was performed before hospital discharge to identify stable and satisfactory lead parameters. All patients were subsequently followed up by regular care visits at our center. Routine follow-up with device interrogation was arranged at 2 weeks， 3 months， 6 months， and 12 months， and every 6 months thereafter. For patients living in remote areas， survival and functional status information were obtained by telephone.\n\n【16】Results\n\n【17】Patients' baseline characteristics\n\n【18】Between May 2014 and December 2018， a total of 693 patients were referred to the PUPH for infected pacemaker lead extraction. Twenty-four of these patients (17 males； age range， 3 to 92 years) underwent contralateral implantation on the same day as lead删除表格换行extraction， and as such， these patients met the inclusion criteria for the present study. The clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. The population age distribution varied greatly. For example， the population included a 3-year-old child， three elderly patients (>85 years of age)， and two patients who were unable to function independently due to central nervous system diseases.\n\n【19】Table 1： Baseline characteristics.\n\n| Patients  | N=24  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Age (yrs)， median (range)  | 72通用删除7(英):<u>(3-92)</u>  |\n| Gender，Male  | 17(71%)  |\n| Comorbid conditions  |  |\n| Coronary artery disease  | 6(25%)  |\n| Heart failure  | 3(12.5%)  |\n| Diabetes mellitus  | 8(33.3%)  |\n| Chronic kidney dysfunction  | 6(25%)  |\n| Congenital heart disease  | 2(8.3%)  |\n| Anticoagulation  | 4(16.7%)  |\n| Stroke  | 3(12.5%)  |\n| Parkinson's disease  | 1(4%)  |\n| LV ejection fraction (%， mean±SD)  | 59.5±12.3  |\n| Antibiotic prior to extraction  |  |\n| Cefmetazole  | 22  |\n| Levofloxacin  | 2  |\n\n【21】Table 2： Original pacemakers implant and lead extraction data.\n\n| Indication  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Heart block  | 17  |\n| Sinus node dysfunction  | 6  |\n| Atrial fibrillation with long RR interval  | 1  |\n| Last procedure before lead extraction  |  |\n| Contralateral implantation  | 9  |\n| Due to malfunction  | 3  |\n| Due to intection  | 6  |\n| Ipsilateral Lead revision/insertion  | 4  |\n| Generator replacement  | 8  |\n| Mean time fram first implantation (yrs， mean ±SD)  | 6.2±5.5(0.5-18)  |\n| Combine RV lead perforation  | 1  |\n| Number of treated leads  | 58  |\n| Extraction taals (leads number)  |  |\n| Locking style  | 12  |\n| Laser combined snare  | 9  |\n| Snare  | 20  |\n| Evolution  | 4  |\n| Simple traction  | 11  |\n| Open chest  | 2  |\n\n【23】Original pacemaker implantation data are shown in Table 2. The reason for extraction was isolated pocket infection in all patients. However， before being transferred to PUPH， most patients (21/24通用删除6(英):<u>[87</u>.5%]) underwent at least two device-related procedures， including eight patients who underwent at least one generator replacement删除表格换行for battery depletion， four patients who required ipsilateral lead revision or new lead insertion， and nine patients who had a bilateral implantation history and in the original side with the resident leads. Considering the complexity ofthe patients with bilateral implantation， detailed clinical data are shown in Table 3. One patient combined right ventricular lead asymptomatic perforation， which was founded by accident before lead extraction.\n\n【24】Table 3： Procedural characteristics and outcomes.\n\n| Reimplantation site  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Contralateral site  | 22  |\n| Abdomen  | 1  |\n| Epicardium  | 1  |\n| Long-term outcomes  |  |\n| Fallow-up duratian(manths， mean ± SD)  | 59.7±16.5  |\n| Intection recurrence  | 0  |\n| Death  | 2  |\n| Sudden non-cardiac deaths  | 2  |\n\n【26】Lead extraction\n\n【27】Fifty-eight leads were extracted from 24 patients (mean， 2.3 leads/patient， range， 1-5 leads/patient). The mean implantation time for the oldest dwelled leads was 6.2 ± 5.5 years (range， 6 months to 18years). Eleven leads were removed with simple traction， twenty leads required the use of a snare， and nine leads required a snare combined with a laser sheath. The patient with combined right ventricular lead perforation underwent open chest lead extraction. All leads were completely and successfully removed， with no severe procedure-related complications.\n\n【28】Pacemaker reimplantation\n\n【29】The reasons for same-day pacemaker reimplantation were complex and unusual. All patients were pacemaker-dependent. Six patients were scheduled for same-day reimplantation due to their vulnerable physical fitness， including one three-year-old child， three elderly patients (>85 years of age)，and two patients who were unable删除1换行to function independently due to diseases of the central nervous system. Two patients could not undergo temporary ventricular lead implantation due to subclavian vein occlusion at the infected site. Thus， we decided to implant a new pacemaker system on the same day. Two patients had obvious pacemaker syndrome， which manifested as an acute decrease in cardiac output and blood pressure during single right ventricular pacing.\n\n【30】Nine patients had a bilateral implantation history. Three of them were scheduled to undergo removal of the original infected leads， but the contralateral leads were accidentally dislocated during transvenous leadextraction. Interim decisions were madeto reimplant the leads on the uninfected dislocated side. The patient with bilateral pocket infection was scheduled for abdominal implantation ofa VVI pacemaker .\n\n【31】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【32】At short-term follow-up， no intraoperative deaths occurred in the study population. Three VVI pacemakers and 21 DDD pacemakers were reimplanted. The pacing threshold， sensing， and impedance parameters were acceptable in all implanted leads during the procedure， postoperatively， and before discharge. There were no acute complications related to device reimplantation.\n\n【33】At long-term follow-up， all patients were followed up at the electrophysiology outpatient clinic at PUPH. The mean follow-up time was 59.7 ±16.5 months (median， 58.5 months； range， 34to 88 months). Two patients who were >85 years old with several comorbidities died 3 years after the initial surgery due to sudden non-cardiac death. There were no instances of new pacemaker infection， including no lead-related infections and no local infections of the new contralateral pocket.\n\n【34】Discussion\n\n【35】The main finding of this study was that same-day reimplantation of a new CIED is safe and feasible in patients with isolated pocket infection after extraction of an infected pacemaker. During a mean follow-up of 59.7 ± 16.5 months， which to our knowledge is the longest follow-up period to date， none of the 24 patients who were删除表格换行diagnosed with isolated pocket infection experienced recurrence.\n\n【36】Table 4： The detail information of patients had bilateral implantation history.\n\n| Palieni  | Sex  | Age  | PMH  | Indicalionfor PM  | Original implantalion SI1e  | Original im plan1alion lime  | Abandoned leadsnumber  | Heasan torbilaileral implantaiion  | Coniralaleralimplantalion1ime  | IIrnfeclionsile  | Infeclion lime  | Exlracledleadsnumber  | TLE 10：0lS  | Complicalionsduring TLE  | Reimplantalionsile  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | F  | 77  | HBP.CHD， DMRA renalarterystenosis  | SSS  | left  | 13yeas  | 2  | RVleaddislocation  | 8 years  | right  | i years attercontralateralimplantation  | 4  | lasersheatheombinee  | Transienthypotension  | et  |\n| 2  | M  | 86  | DM HF  | AVB  | left  | 11yeas  | D  | intection attergeneratorreplacement  | 2 years  | both sites  | 1.8 years attercontralateralimplantation  | 2  | locking style  | none  | abdomen  |\n| 3  | M  | 68  | HBP  | SSS  | right  | 14yeas  | 3  | intection attergeneratorreplaoement  | 5 yBars  | right  | 4.8 years atter contralateralimplantation  | 5  | laser sheathcombinedSnR  | contralateral diskcated  | lett  |\n| 4  | M  | 71  | NONE  | SSS  | left  | 12yeas  | 1  | maltunction  | 3 years  | right  | 2.8 years attercontralateralimplantation  | 3  |  | none  | left  |\n| 5  | M  | 74  | HBP.OSASH  | AVB  | right  | 1years  | Move the pulsegenerator to thelelt chest andoonnect the originalelectrode to thesubcutaneoLIStuinnel  | intection  | rmonths  | left  | 1 month attergontralateralimplantation  | 2  | simple trct  | none  | right  |\n| 6  | M  | 76  | kidneystone  | SSS  | left  | 16yeas  | 2  | intection  | syears  | nght  | 1.6 years attercontralateralreplacement  | 4  | S9删除8:<u>尼 </u> | none  | lett  |\n| 7  | M  | 73  | DM  | AVB  | right  | 18yeas  | 2  | maltunction  | 11 years  | both sites  | 1Dyeas attercontralateralimpla.nta.tion  | 4  | open chest  | none  | epicardium  |\n| 8  | M  | 46  |  | AVB  | lett  | i years  | 2  | intection  | 2years  | lett  |  | 4  | evolution  | contralateraldislcated  | right  |\n| 9  | F  | 65  |  | AVB  | left  | 1Dyeas  | 2  | maltunction  | 4 years  | left  |  | 4  |  | gontralateral dislcated  | right  |\n\n【38】The rate of CIED infection is increasing in parallel with population aging， as is the number of CIED implantation procedures. Pacemaker replacement and aging are strong factors predisposing to pacemaker infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In the present study， the overall rate of a second procedure was up to 28%， and a quarter of patients were aged>80 years.\n\n【39】Antibiotic therapy and complete extraction of the infected CIED system constitute the current treatments for CIED infection management 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Despite standardized protocols for CIED infection being established since 2010 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>， improper treatments are still used in parts of China. This may be due to a lack of recognition of infection and inadequate preparation for complete extraction. Six patients underwent removal ofonly the infected pulse generator， not the entire system， before a new device was implanted on the contralateral side. During CIED removal on the infected side in patients with bilateral CIEDs， the contralateralleads were dislocated in three patients. Thus， such inappropriate treatments could not solve the infection on the original side and very likely contaminated the healthy contralateral side， increasing the complexity of surgery and economic loss 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【40】In principle， patients with infected CIEDs are treated using two separate procedures， one for lead extraction and one for reimplantation. Current guidelinesrecommena that CTED reimplantation in patients with positive blood cultures should be delaved for 72 h to allow blood cultures to return to negative. In patients with isolated pocket infection， however， guidelines do not address the optimal reimplantation time owing to the paucity of literature exploring the timing of CIED replacement and reinfection risk 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In addition， even though the use of an active fixation lead connected to an external pulse generator has proven safe in pacemaker-dependent patients after transvenous lead extraction， these temporary leads require maintenance and are associated with infection recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，91</u>.\n\n【41】Recent studies have shown that there is no significant correlation between the timing of reimplantation and survival in patients with isolated pocket infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，10]</u>. In a prospective study of 434 patients who underwent complete system removal due to CIED infection， 23patients underwent same-day reimplantation， and the reinfection rate was as low as in the delayed reimplantation group 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Another study by Mountantonakis et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> included 15 patients who underwent reimplantation of a new device on the contralateral side on the same day as lead extraction for isolated pocket infection. There was no infection of the new system at a mean follow-up of 39.6months. In a study by Spanish scholars， a new system was implanted on the contralateral side in the same procedure in 152 patients and in a second procedure in 57 patients， with no difference in relapse after1 year of follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\nAt our center， the strategies for pacemaker reimplantation and lead extraction are carefully discussed on a case-by-case basis by an experienced CIED management team， including， as a minimum， an electrophysiologist and a cardiothoracic surgeon. Certain factors are considered， including the extent of infection， degree of pacing dependency，presence of bilateral subclavian vein occlusion， physical fitness to sustain a second procedure (octogenarians， children， patients who cannot take care of themselves for other reasons)， and VVI syndrome. The factors that determine the final decision are not always isolated. In fact， for cases of simple local pocket infection， the proportion of patients who underwent same-day reimplantation was|删除段之间换行|3.5%(24 of 693) at our center.\n\n【43】Leadless pacemakers have become an excellent alternative to traditional CIEDs in these challenging cases， such as in patients with recurrent device infection， occlusion of the subclavian venous access， or bilateral implants 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>. Some centers attempt simultaneous reimplantation of a new leadless pacemaker and lead extraction. For example， in a study by El-Chami et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>， 40 patients (37.1%) underwent leadless pacemaker implantation during the same procedure as device removal， with no recurrent device-related infections after a mean follow-up period of 8.5 months. Zhang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> also performed leadless pacemaker reimplantation immediately after removal of an infected pacing system in eight patients with pocket infection. Kypta et al. demonstrated the feasibility of Micra y n implantation just before conventional pacemaker lead extraction during the same procedure in two patients. Both of these studies indicate that it is safe and feasible to implant leadless pacemakers without delay in patients with isolated pocket infection after transvenous lead extraction. However， more research is required to support this conclusion. Our approach to same-day traditional pacemaker implantation might provide an empirical basis to support this strategy.\n\n【44】Study Limitations\n\n【45】This study has some limitations that should be noted. First， it was a small single-center retrospective study with a degree of selection bias. Second， the small sample size of our study meant that a multivariate analysis was unsuitable.\n\n【46】Conclusion\n\n【47】In this study， same-day reimplantation of a new pacemaker during lead extraction for isolated pocket infection was feasible and was not associated with long-term adverse outcomes. To ensure the safety of same-day reimplantation， it is necessary to ensure that there is no bacteremia during transvenous lead extraction， which should be confirmed in future prospective studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

After several recurrences and different unsuccessful treatments， the patient refused a further surgery and a multidisciplinary board decided o start treatment with sonidegib， a hedgehog inhibitor approved as first-line treatment in laBCC. We started with sonidegib 200 mg every day and then， due to mild adverse events most probably related to the concomitant antipsychotics， we switched to the in-label dose modification of 200mg every other day. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak， we decided to follow the patient via telemedicine. Response was impressive and clinically evident after one month of therapy. Currently， after 3months from the start of sonidegib treatment， the patient presents an almost complete response with residual crust and is still on treatment with sonidegib.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Even thoughlaBCCpatients are more susceptible to severe complications ofCOVID-19than the general population， there is so far no evidence in favor of preventively stopping treatment. Approved dose modifications and telemedicine are interesting strategies not only to control adverse events but also to manage treatment more flexibly during COVID-19pandemic.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】The COVID-19 pandemic is having a serious and disruptive effect on the management of cancer patients. Available data indicate that individuals with active cancer are more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Additional risk factors are older age (≥ 80 years old) and presence of underlying chronic comorbidities 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Moreover， due to resource rationing， it is difficult to foresee which effect delays in surgeries and drug therapy administration will have on the long-term health of cancer patients. Ensuring the safety of patients and health care professionals during the current pandemic is of utmost priority. Government agencies， professional societies and hospitals have provided initial guidance on the implementation of measures such as telemedicine and reducing or postponing oncologic visits when feasible to achieve the best possible risk/benefit balance 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>. Data on COVID-19 and malignancy remain limited at present and there are no guidelines or evidences recommending preventively discontinuing treatment.\n\n【6】The patient suffering from locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (laBCC) frequently fits well into the criteria that define an individual at high risk for severe COVID-19， mainly in terms of age and presence of comorbidities. Recently， a case series of laBCC patients under hedgehog pathway inhibitors has been published， focusing on their follow-up in time of pandemic 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】In this report， we describe our own experience regarding the management of an elderly patient with a difficult-to-treatlaBCC in treatment with the hedgehog pathway inhibitor sonidegib and the preventive measures we adopted during COVID-19period. The patient is an 89-year-old female with a laBCC on the forehead who presented at our center after at least 4 years of lesion evolution. In June2016， the tumor was histologically diagnosed as a BCC and surgically removed. In March 2018， the patient suffered a recurrence and underwent treatment with topical therapy (electrocoagulation)，an immunomodulator (imiquimod) and chemotherapies (5-fluorouracil) with unsuccessful results. In October 2019， the lesion was treated with topical antibiotics and riepithelializing creams. At the time删除1换行treatment.删除2换行of our first assessment in January 2020， the tumor measured 4 cm in diameter and appeared ulcerated with clear borders characterized by pearly papules . A biopsy confirmed the relapsed BCC. Patient referred concomitant use of antipsychotic medications(olanzapine and quetiapine). A multidisciplinary board defined the lesion operable but patient refused surgery. No other local treatment was considered suitable； therefore， the board advised a systemic targeted therapy. Therapy with sonidegib was started in February2020 at the dose of 200 mg daily. After ten days of treatment， patient reported drowsiness and tachycardia. After reviewing the drugs metabolism， we hypothesized that these AEs were most probably related to the antipsychotics use. However， to increase chances of AEs resolution， we prescribed an in-label sonidegib dose reduction from200 mg daily to 200 mg every other day.\n\n【9】Thereafter， due to the worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic， we started following the patient’s treatment remotely. Patient’s caregiver took photos of the lesion at agreed time points and under our instructions and shared the photos with us. We could then assess them virtually and provide advice over the phone. Blood tests could be performed in a laboratory closer to patients home and results sent TO 11S.\n\n【10】Despite reducing sonidegib dose from 200 mg every day to 200mg every other day and the necessity to follow the patient remotely， clinical response after 1 month from the start of sonidegib treatment was impressive . At two months， lesion improved further， no adverse events were reported and routine blood tests were in the norm.\n\n【11】Currently， patient is still on alternate day treatment， presenting an almost complete response with residual crust  and only a mild decreased appetite (grade 1) at the time of writing of this report(May 2020； after 3 months from start oftherapy).\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】Despite the unprecedented time for health care systems globally， it is still possible to manage laBCC patients in an efficacious and safe manner. Even though they are more susceptible to severe complications of COVID-19 than the general population， there is so far no evidence in favor of preventively stopping treatment.\n\n【14】Several factors， including the possibility of alternative in-label dosage and patient’s refusal ofsurgery， led the multidisciplinary board to suggest treatment with sonidegib. Approved dose modification is an interesting strategy not only to control adverse events but also to manage treatment more flexibly during COVID-19 pandemic. Finally， telemedicine allows laBCC patients to have access to high-quality care without traveling to the clinic and thus minimizing infection chances for this high-risk population.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

To our knowledge， no research has been performed on the use of FES to address foot drop for a patient with a foot dystonia. The purpose of this single case study was to assess the use of FES for an individual with a foot dystonia on gait speed and quality of life (QOL). After 20 months of daily use of the FES system， clinically significant improvements were noted in 10m Walk Self Selected pace (10SS) and 10m Walk Fast Pace (10FP) both with and without the FES device. 10SS with FES increased +0.17 m/s (+15%)； 10FP with FES increased +0.27 m/s(+19%)； 10SS without FES increased +0.22 m/s (+19%)；and 10FP without FES increased +0.27 m/s(+22%). In addition， improvements were seen in patient subjective report of QOL， which increased by 20%. The results of this case study demonstrate improvement in the gait speed and subjective QOL measures for an individual with an equinovarus deformity secondary to a focal dystonia.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Individuals with an equinovarus deformity and foot drop often present with walking difficulty， which has a direct connection with， decreased quality oflife (QOL)， decreased gait speed， increased fall risk， and increased mortalitly 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) to address a walking difficulty associated with equinovarus deformity and foot drop has been shown to improve gait pattern and QOL in populations with central nervous system (CNS) disorders associated with spasticity (i.e. Stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> and Multiple Sclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>). FES to address foot drop is a neuromuscular electrical stimulation system that provides electrical stimulation to the anterior tibialis and peroneal muscles through surface electrodes. Activation ofthese muscles is coordinated through input from a pressure sensor in the heel of the shoe that activates the stimulation when the pressure is sufficiently decreased from the sensor (pre-swing through mid-swing). During initial fitting the intensity (mA) was adjusted until an appropriate muscle contraction was obtain resulting in adequate dorsiflexion and eversion ofthe foot. Research on FES and foot drop has been generallylimited to Central Nervous System (CNS) related lesions， such as stroke or spinal cord injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. However，limited research has addressed the use of a FES on a foot or hand. Barrett et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>； showed improvements in balance and gait endurance with the use of surface FES in an individual with an isolated focal dystonia not combined with an additional movement disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder presenting with muscles that contract involuntarily， often presenting as a twisting movement of the affected body part making it difficult for voluntary muscle contraction to occur 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Since central nervous system pathologies have successfully used FES to address equinovarus deformity and foot drop， we surmised that in an individual with a focal foot dystonia associated with a primary central movement disorder would also increase gait speed and QOL. The purpose of this single case study was to assess the use of FES on an individual with an equinovarus deformity and foot drop from a dystonia manifesting after CNS compromise on gait speed， QOL， and fear of falling.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\nThe subject is a 32-year-old female diagnosed with West Nile virus meningoencephalitis confirmed by an elevated level of IgM and pleocytosis via cerebral spinal fluid after a mosquito bite.

Following the acute hospitalization she presented to Inpatient Rehabilitation (IR) for Physical Therapy (PT) for limb muscle weakness and Speech Language Pathology to address bulbar muscle weakness. After two weeks of IR she was discharged home with almost full resolution of bulbar and muscle weakness. Six monthslater，shereturned to neurology due toleft foot weakness，pain， dysesthesias， hyperesthesia， swelling， skin changes and a dystonia. The subject was diagnosed at that time with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). Eight months later， without treatment for the CRPS， the pain resolved but the patient still presented with a dystonia of the left foot. To address the dystonia， she tried gabapentin and a series of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) injections with limited effect. Forty-six months later she presented to outpatient PT with difficulty walking longer distances， decreased QOL， and increased fear of falling because of the foot dystonia. The patient was assessed on gait speed via 10 meter walk self-selected and fast pace (10SS， 10FP respectively； with and without an FES system)， QOL (subjective percentage)， and fear of falling (subjective percentage). She was provided an FES system to address the equinovarus deformity and foot drop and a trial of a FES system was used (Bioness， Inc) in the clinic. A successful muscle contraction was achieved to warrant further training with the device. Settings for the program included a symmetrical sinusoidal waveform were used at phase duration of 200 uS and a pulse rate of30 Hz.

But before then， the concept of sex-cord differentiation of endometrial stromal tumors has been reported several times in retrospective analysis. So far， there are a few articles about the image description of UTROSCT in the domestic and overseas. This is a very rare， benign or malignant tumor. Mainly occur in premenopausal and perimenopausal women， with onset around the age of 45. The main symptoms are vaginal irregular bleeding，abnormal menstruation， or lower abdominal pain， and some cases have no symptoms.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】The clinical manifestations and imaging features of UTROSCT are non-specific， so they are very easy to be misdiagnosed. Currently， pathological biopsy plays a key role in the final diagnosis. Our hospital encountered a case of UTROSCT， which was diagnosed as uterine leiomyoma 3 years ago and was repeatedly considered as uterine leiomyoma in preoperative hysteroscopy， transvaginal ultrasound and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 44-year-old female patient， who had been diagnosed with uterine leiomyoma for more than3 years. Due to irregular menstruation， she was admitted to the department of gynecology of our hospital on June 23m删除4-1:<u>，2022</u>. She presented vaginal bleeding with a small amount of yellowish vaginal fluid， no abdominal pain or other discomfort， negative tumor markers， and no abnormal hormone levels.\n\n【6】Transvaginal ultrasound showed that the uterus size was 9.46 cm× 6.96 cm x 6.90 cm， the shape was irregular and the echo was not uniform， thickness of the endometrium was about1.07 cm. Sonographer detected several slightly hypoechoic masses in uterus and cervix. In pelvic magnetic resonance imaging ， the uterus and cervix increased in volume which had irregular appearance and local bulges. There were multiple circular nodules and masses in the uterine posterior wall and cervix. Compared with myometrium， T1WI presented isointense， T2WI presented uneven slightly hyperintense/hyperintense， DWI presented slightly hyperintense， ADC presented slightly hypointense. And the lesions were significantly heterogeneously dense enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images， similar to the degree of myometrium enhancement.\n\n【7】The patient underwent hysteroscopic submucosal myomectomy. During the operation， a uterine myomatoid tissue with a size of about 6 cm x5cmx 4 cm was observed in the cervix and protruded to the vagina. There was thickening of the endometrium. The cut surfaces of the lesion were gray or gray-red and it grossly seemed to be tough tissue， about 8 cm x7 cmx 2.5 cm in size.

In 2020， WHO 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> changed the classification of female reproductive system tumors， defining that UTROSCT is a uterine tumor similar to ovarian sex-cord tumors in shape and there are no endometrial matrix components in this tumor.\n\n【10】The source of UTROSCT is unclear. At present， most scholars believe that UTROSCT contains true sex-cord components， which originates from multipotential1rmesenchymal cells and删除1换行those differentiate into sex-cord cells， smooth muscle cells and endometrial stromal cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Since UTROSCT is characterized by multidirectional differentiation， a variety of uterine tumors with sex-cord differentiation characteristics should be considered in the differential diagnosis of this tumor， such as uterine leiomyoma， endometrial stromall tumor， adenosarcoma， and endometrioid carcinoma and so on. As with endometrial thickening in this case， we need to think of neoplasticlesions associated with hormonal changes， and then take ovarian sex-cord tumors into account. Given that they occur in the uterus， perhaps we should consider UTROSCT. Would the rate of misdiagnosis decrease?\n\n【11】There are few reports on the imaging findings of UTROSCTs.In previous cases， the imaging findings of the tumor were not specific， and most radiologists or physicians did not consider UTROSCT into the differential diagnosis. All UTROSCTs were confirmed by final postoperative biopsy and pathology. In the cases encountered in our hospital， the tumor shows multiple circular nodules and masses located， iso-signal on T1WI and uneven slightly high/high signal on T2WI. Those imaging findings were very similar to uterine leiomyomas. The slightly uneven high/high signal on T2WI is highly consistent with the sign ofuterine leiomyoma degeneration. And combined with the multiple characteristics of this case， it is more likely to be misdiagnosed as uterine leiomyoma. In addition， the tumor in this case is characterized by cystic and solid imaging features， which is similar to typical imaging features of granulosa cell tumor. If we associate this subtype of ovarian sex-cord stromal tumor， the diagnostic accuracy may be improved.\n\n【12】Therefore， it is necessary to further study the pathological and imaging characteristics of UTROSCT. At the same time， incorporate UTROSCT into the differential diagnosis of sex-cord differentiated uterine tumors， so as to provide a better basis for clinical diagnosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The purpose ofthis study was to evaluate the effect of adipose tissue hip injections at reducing pain and improving function in severe hip OA， and to assess for adverse effects.\n\n【2】Case Report： Five patients (5 male， mean age 59.9 ±5.9 years) with hip pain attributed to severe OA， and who had failed conservative management， underwent adipose cell harvesting followed by an ultrasound-guided adipose tissue injection into the affected hip joint. Pain and quality of life were assessed at baseline， and at 1-，3-， 6-， 12-， and 24-months post-injection， using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the International Hip Outcome Tool-12 (iHOT-12). VAS scores improved at all follow-up visits， with the greatest improvement noted at 3 months post-injection. iHOT-12scores progressively increased throughout follow-up， corresponding to a poorer quality oflife. Two participants had consultations with an orthopedic surgeon during follow-up， and one underwent a Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). There were no significant adverse effects noted as a result of the injection.\n\n【3】Discussion： Hip injections with adipose tissue appear to be safe and to improve pain in severe hip OA， with maximum improvement noted at 3 months post-injection. However， quality of life scores progressively worsened post-injection and one participant ultimately underwent a THA. Future studies comparing intraarticular hip injections of adipose tissue to other substances will help further elucidate their long-term efficacy at treating symptoms associated with hip OA.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Hip Osteoarthritis (OA) is a condition resulting from intraarticular cartilage loss and affects approximately 1 in 4 individuals throughout their lifetime 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-4]</u>. Hip OA is typically characterized by pain localized to the hip or groin， and can be severely debilitating 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The condition is often classified using the Kellgren and Lawrence (K&L) grading system， which assigns a score of 0-4 based on the amount of cartilage loss seen on X-ray 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Management typically starts with non-operative measures consisting of activity modification， oral pain medications and physical therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. However， significant proportions of individuals are refractory to these treatments and necessitate more invasive interventions， which typically begin with a Corticosteroid Injection (CSI). CSIs have been found to reduce pain due to hip OA for up to 3 months 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>；however， they are associated with adverse effects， including elevations in blood sugar， and worsening of arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，6-8]</u>. Furthermore， CSIs do not treat the underlying cause of hip OA， and research has found that approximately 1 in10 individuals will ultimately undergo a Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Given the drawbacks of CSIs and the high risk of requiring an operative intervention for end-stage OA， intraarticular injections of substances other than corticosteroid have been evaluated as a potential alternative non-operative means of managing hip OA， though they have not shown significant success Viscosupplementation of the hip joint with Hyaluronic Acid (HA) has not been found to be more successful at relieving pain compared to intraarticular saline 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>. Intraarticular hip injections of Platelet-Rich-Plasma (PRP) have not been found to be more effective than HA 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，11-13]</u>. Lastly， injections of NSAIDs directly to the hip joint have not been found to be more successful than injections of corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. A substance that has not been extensively studied for injection into the hip joint is adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is often harvested from the abdomen and contains Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)， which have been shown in vitro to have the ability to mature into删除1换行different types of cells based on the stimuli to which they are exposed通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. As such， unlike other substances used for intraarticular injections， adipose tissue has the theoretical potential to slow the progression of OA instead of solely treating pain. Furthermore， injections of bone marrow concentrate， which contains MSCs， into the knee joint have shown promise at treating pain associated with knee OA 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>， and have not been associated with any significant adverse effects 通用删除6(英):<u>[151</u>. When evaluating the use MSCs for the hip， research performed in dogs has shown that intraarticular injections of adipose-derived MSCs improved quality of life at 6 months post-injection and were not associated with any adverse effects 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Limited research in humans with mild-moderate OA found that adipose-derived MSC injections into the hip were associated with improvement in pain and function at the 6-month mark with no adverse effects 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. However， this data is based on a small study population (n=6) with only mild-moderate OA， and there is a lack of data regarding outcomes beyond 6months post-injection. The purpose of this case series was to evaluate the effects of intra-articular hip injections with adipose tissue in reducing pain and improving function in patients with severe hip OA at various intervals up to 2 years post-injection， as well as to evaluate for adverse effects.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】Patient's ≥ 18 years of age who presented to our outpatient sports medicine clinic with hip pain secon dary to severe OA were considered for inclusion into the study. Patients had to have completed a minimum of 6 weeks of conservative management， including physical therapy， weight loss， activity modification， or oral anti-inflammatory medication. Furthermore， patients were required to have had at least one intraarticular hip injection of corticosteroid with little to no sustained effect. Exclusion criteria included having taken an anti-inflammatory medication within 14 days of study entry， having taken an anti-rheumatic disease medication within 3 months of study entry， or having received an injection of any substance to the treated hip within 2 months of study entry. Patients were not considered for inclusion into the study if they were pregnant， breast-feeding， or carried any of the following diagnoses： A systemic rheumatic or inflammatory disease of the joint， an ongoing infectious disease， diabetes mellitus， cancer， or a clinically significant cardiovascular， renal，hepatic， or endocrine disease. Lastly， participants were required to have not participated in a study of an experimental drug or medical device within 30 days of study entry. Consent and IRB approval were obtained through Stanford University. Patients who enrolled in the study completed the following baseline assessments： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> a visual Analog Scale (VAS) measuring average pain and peak pain during the past week on a scale from 0 to 10 (with higher scores correlating with increased pain levels)， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> International Hip Outcome Tool-12(iHOT-12) questionnaire designed to measure health-related quality of life， consisting of 12 questions scored from 0 to 10 (with higher\n\n【8】Table 1： Demographics.\n\n| Participant  | Age  | Gender  | K&L grade  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | 58.2  | M  | 4  |\n| 2  | 67.3  | M  | 4  |\n| 3  | 62.2  | M  | 4  |\n| 4  | 54.3  | M  | 4  |\n| 5  | 52.6  | M  | 4  |\n| Mean  | 58.9  |  |  |\n\n【10】Abbreviation： K&L： Kellgren and Lawrence删除1换行scores correlating with poorer health-related quality of life) with the final score calculated as the sum of each question 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Patients then underwent autologous adipose cell harvesting from the abdomen at our outpatient clinic. A qualitative analysis of the adipose cells was performed before undergoing MSC isolation using a centrifugation system. A qualitative analysis of the MSC isolate was then performed. The patient then received an injection of the adipose-derived MSC isolate into the affected hip joint， along with 5 mL of 1% lidocaine，40 mL of 0.9% sterile saline， 0.4 mL of 4.2% bicarbonate， and1：100，000 epinephrine， using a standardized ultrasound-guided technique by the same physician. Following the injection， the patients were instructed to undergo a period of relative rest for 1week in conjunction with range of motion exercises， followed by a gradual increase in activity level that progressed to normal daily activity at week 3. Patients were then followed up at 1-， 3-， 6-， 12-， and 24 months post-injection， at which time they repeated the VAS and iHOT-12. Patients were advised that they could drop out of the study at any point， including if they did not receive optimal pain relief and wanted to seek other treatments. A total of 5 participants met inclusion criteria for the study and agreed to participate. All participants were male， mean age was 59.9 years (range 52-67)， and all participants had grade 4 0A (K&L classification) at the time of their injection， indicative of severe OA . All participants completed baseline assessments. One participant was lost to follow-up at 1 month， one participant was lost to follow-up at 6 months，and one participant was lost to follow-up at 12 months. Two participants completed the full 24 months of follow-up. When evaluating baseline VAS pain assessments， mean VAS scores were 6.0 (average pain) and 7.0 (peak pain) . These values improved at all follow up visits， with the most significant improvement noted at 3 months post-injection (mean average pain of 2.5， peak pain of 3.5). Similarly， participants noted the greatest percentage improvement in their pain at 3 months post-injection (mean of 61.25% improvement). When evaluating iHOT-12 assessments， the baseline mean score was 37.6. Scores at follow up were higher at all visits， with the highest mean iHOT-12 score being 85.9 at 24-months post-injection . One participant underwent a THA during the follow up period， which was performed at 19 months post-injection. Of the remaining four participants， one had a consultation with an orthopedic surgeon due to ongoing pain from hip OA， but ultimately did not undergo a surgical intervention. One participant reported an adverse reaction post-injection， as he endorsed severe pain radiating from his affected hip to his anterior thigh several hours after returning home from his injection. However， the symptoms resolved with over-the-counter analgesics.Otherwise， no adverse events were reported by any patient during the 2-year follow up period.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】We found that intra-articular hip injections with adipose tissue for severe hip OA improved pain up to 2 years post-injection， with the greatest improvement noted at 3 months post-injection. The participants who completed the full 2 years of follow-up noted approximately 50% improvement of their pain at 12- and 24-months post-injection.

It was first described by Pierre Mason in1923 in an ulcerated haemorrhoidal vein， but has also been reported to occur at various sites such as the cranium， thyroid， breast， neck， external jugular vein， tongue， oral cavity and rarely urethra 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Due to its histological features of papillary formation， anastomosing vascular channels and plump endothelial cells， it was earlier thought to be a variant of angiosarcoma； however nowadays， it is considered a reactive vascular proliferation to traumatic vascular stasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Due to its common presentation as a subcutaneous soft tissue lump， the diagnosis is usually not possible without histopathological examination.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 56-year-old， male patient came to our Outpatient Department (OPD) with the complaint of a left supraclavicular swelling for one year. On examination， the swelling measured 2 cm×2cm， and was mobile， non-tender， firm， and with no associated skin changes. A clinical diagnosis of lymphadenopathy was made and Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) asked for. FNAC reported the lesion as a benign lipomatous lesion  and the patient underwent excision of the lesion under local anaesthesia on OPD basis. During excision， the lump was found to be highly vascular， and multiple small vessels were seen traversing through it. The lesion was excised and sent for histopathological examination.\n\n【7】Histopathological examination revealed proliferation of endothelial cells within fibrous tissue， dilated blood vessels that contained thrombi， as well as fibrin deposition. There was no cellular atypia or mitotic figures， and a diagnosis of Masson's haemangioma was made . On receiving the histopathology report， the patient was questioned about any past history of trauma， and he revealed that he had been involved in a road side accident two years ago in which he had sustained trauma to the neck， left upper limb and a fracture of the shaft of left humerus that were managed conservatively.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Masson's haemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that is always almost intravascular， and clearly distinct from an organizing thrombus. It is known by various eponyms such as Masson's intravascular hemangioendothelioma， Intravascular Papillary Endothelial Hyperplasia (IPEH) or reactive endothelialhyperplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. It was first described in 1923 by Pierre Masson within the lumen of inflamed hemorrhoidal veins in a 68-vear-old male and he believed the lesion caused obliteration of the vessel lumen leading to subsequent degeneration and necrosis. Masson's observations were modified by Henschen， who believed that the lesion was a reactive process rather than a neoplasm. This was confirmed by the findings reported by Kauffman and Stout 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> that the endothelial layer of the lesion was composed of normal endothelial cells and that the endothelial proliferation was of benign papillae pattern and the cells showed no atypia. Nowadays it is considered to be a reactive vascular proliferation following traumatic vascular stasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【10】It is difficult to make a pre-operative diagnosis of Masson’s haemangioma， and it is often misdiagnosed as fibrolipoma， ganglion， cyst， soft tissue tumor or sarcoma. The lesion has no age or gender predilection and has been frequently reported from the head， neck， fingers， trunk and cutaneous veins. It usually presents as a small， firm， superficial mass with bluish-red discoloration of the overlying skin. Color Doppler or a plain ultrasound can be helpful in diagnosing a vascular lesion， but there are no pathognomic features to make the diagnosis with certainty.\n\n【11】Histopathological examination of the excised swelling is the gold standard for making a diagnosis-the following features are important in making the diagnosis and ruling out other vascular lesions：\n\n【12】Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia， either well-circumscribed or encapsulated；\n\n【13】The papillae are composed of fibro-hyalinized tissue oftwo or more endothelial cell layers；\n\n【14】The proliferative process is completely limited to the intravascular spaces；\n\n【15】The endothelial cells are hyperchromatic， but extreme nuclear atypia and mitotic figures and necrosis are not seen；\n\n【16】There may be pseudo channels， but there are no irregular or anastomosing blood vessels in the stroma 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【17】Based on histopathology， Masson’s haemangioma can be classified into three distinct categories：\n\n【18】However， these different pathological varieties do not have any clinical significance， since the treatment is total excision. When resected completely， recurrence is extremely rare.\n\n【19】A “pure form” that occurs within a dilated vascular space， and is most frequently located in the fingers， in the region between the elbows and hands or head and neck，\n\nA“mixed form” that represents a focal change in a pre-existing haemangioma， vascular malformation， or pyogenic granuloma， and|删除段之间换行|A rare “indeterminate\" form that does not belong to either ofthe first two categories， and has an extravascular origin 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【21】However， these different pathological varieties do not have any clinical significance， since the treatment is total excision.

We add another case of PAD after a fall from great height.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 46-year-old woman was found in a backyard of an apartment block under unclear circumstances. A fall out of a window (estimated height 8 meters)， presumably with suicidal intent， was suspected. The emergency physician intubated the patient and inserted chest drainage on the right side due to suspected pneumothorax. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of our hospital (Klinikum Nuernberg South) for further diagnostics and treatment.\n\n【9】On arrival， the patient was circulatory stable but hypothermic (34.7°). Clinical examination showed evidence of multiple traumatic injuries， but no penetrating injury could be found. An emergency whole-body-CT， including a thoracoabdominal scan in portal venous phase， was performed. Multiple fractures could be detected (including complex midface and pelvic fractures， multiple rib fractures). In addition， the CT-scan revealed several thoracoabdominal injuries including a right side tension pneumothorax and lung contusion as well as focal intimal defects of the thoracic aorta in keeping with multiple intimal flaps. In addition， an irregular hypodense line in the right pulmonary artery was seen； this was suspected as being a dissection .\n\n【10】The patient was promptly re-examined for further assessment due to motion artifacts in the initial scan. For this purpose， a gated pulmonary CT was performed and clearly revealed a dissection membrane with adjacent thrombus formation in the right pulmonary artery . In addition， a small pulmonary embolus in the right lower-lobe-artery was detected (not shown). There were no signs of a mediastinal hematoma or pericardial effusion. The pulmonary trunk was norm-wide and there was no indication of right heart loading.\n\n【11】Due to the stable circulatory condition and the complex injuries， the aortic and pulmonary dissections were treated conservatively and the patient was continuously monitored.Tracheostomy was performed； anticoagulation was not initiated due to the estimated high risk of bleeding.

We present the case ofa 23-year-old transgender (male to female) Abdominal Gunshot Wound (GSW) victim who developed significant bradycardia and sinus pause during PSV trial.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： The patient presented to the Emergency Department with multiple GSWs to the abdomen. She was intubated for airway protection. Exploratory laparotomy was performed and patient underwent partial liver resection for liver lacerations and right hemidiaphragm injury. She remained intubated in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) post-operatively and had multiple planned returns to the Operating Room (OR). On hospital day 9 the patient was on minimal MV settings， 0.8 mcg/kg/h of Dexmedetomidine， and 6 mg/h of Morphine. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and PSV trial was initiated， pressure Support (PSupp)7 cm H，O and Positive End Expiratory Pressure(PEEP)5 cm H，O. Immediately， the patient became bradycardic and had a sinus pause for approximately 15 sec， at which point the ventilator mode was switched back to Pressure Regulated Volume Control (PRVC)， and the patient instantly converted back to Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR) 70 to 90 beats per minute. The following day， another CPAP trial was performed after stopping all sedation， which again resulted in episode of bradycardia and pause， reverting to NSR after being placed back on PRVC. The patient self-extubated ahead of the third CPAP trial， on20 mcg/kg/h of Propofol and 1.2 mcg/kg/h of Dexmedetomidine. She became bradycardic to 30 to40 beats per minute for approximately 10 sec， and spontaneously returned to NSR 70 to 80 beats per minute.\n\n【3】Conclusion： MV setting alterations during weaning procedures have direct effects on patient hemodynamics， due to effect on intrathoracic pressure and the autonomic nervous system. The decreased airway pressure during CPAP and PSV trials or immediately after extubating produces an increase in cardiac output due to decreased intra-thoracic pressure and thus， increased venous return to the right atrium.

It is the most common support intervention in critical care units 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation is associated with various adverse outcomes， including Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-associated lung injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Thus， there is a clear benefit to weaning patients from mechanical ventilators as early as possible. Decreased duration of mechanical ventilation decreases morbidity and mortality. Ventilator setting alterations during weaning procedures have a direct effect on hemodynamics of the patient， due to its effect on the autonomic nervous system and variations in heart rate 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Despite this， there is a scarce supply of删除1换行research and data on the topic of hemodynamic changes that take place during weaning from mechanical ventilation.\n\n【9】It has been proposed that the decrease in Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) during weaning produces an increased cardiac output due to decreased intra-thoracic pressure and thus， increased venous return to the right atrium. This， in turn， causes an increase in parasympathetic output， which may cause profound bradycardia or sinus pause 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. This is the case of a 23-year-old Gunshot-Wound(GSW) victim who underwent multiple abdominal surgeries who developed sinus pause during Continuous Positive Airway Pressure(CPAP) trial after 8 days of mechanical ventilation.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】A 23-year-old transgender (male to female) patient presented to the emergency room after sustaining a GSW to the abdomen. She has a past medical history significant for HIV on intermittent HAART. She presented to the Emergency Department (ED) ambulatory and hemodynamically stable. She was found to have a bullet hole on the right flank as well as a bullet hole at the anterior aspect of the left costal margin. She was sedated and intubated for airway protection upon arrival to the trauma bay. She was taken to the Operating Room (OR) where a right chest tube was placed and exploratory laparotomy was performed. A liver exploration was performed and patient was found to have a liver laceration separating segments VI and VII as well as right hemidiaphragm injury. Segments VI and VII of the liver were resected along with the gallbladder. An Abthera wound VAC was placed. She was admitted to the Surgical ICU (SICU) postoperatively. She remained intubated and had three planned returns to the OR. Additionally， patient required chemical and physical restraints due to agitation and attempts to self-extubate. On hospital day 3， she underwent exploratory laparotomy， partial liver resection of necrotic segments V and VIII， omental flap to liver， and drain placement. On hospital day 5， she underwent exploratory laparotomy， open G-tube placement， and wound VAC exchange. Finally， on hospital day 8， she underwent exploratory laparotomy， abdominal washout， and primary closure of fascia with wound VAC placement. The following day， patient's ventilator settings were V400， RR16，FiO，30%， PEEP 5. Patient was on 5 mcg/kg/h of Propofol，0.8 mcg/kg/h of Dexmedetomidine， and 6 mg/h of Morphine. CPAP trial was performed， at which point patient was placed on PSupp 7 cm HO and PEEP 5 cm HO. Patient immediately became bradycardic and had a sinus pause， which lasted approximately 15 sec， at which point she was immediately converted back to Controlled Mechanical Ventilation (CMV) on her previous settings. She then converted back to her average heart rate， ranging from 70 to 90 beats per minute.\n\n【12】The following day， another CPAP trial was planned with patient off sedation. However， patient self-extubated ahead of the trial while on CMV 400/16/30/5. At that time， patient was on 20 mcg/kg/h of Propofol and 1.2 mcg/kg/h of Dexmedetomidine. Patient was immediately placed on non-rebreather at 50% FiO，and 15 liters/min flow rate. She again became bradycardic； her heart rate decreased to low 30s to 40s for approximately 10 sec， after which she spontaneously returned to her normal heart rate of 70 to 80 beats per minute. Within15 min， patient was switched to nasal cannula at 5 liters/min with non-labored breathing at respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute. She was continuously weaned to room air over the next 24 h， which she tolerated well. She remained hemodynamically stable； however， she was tachypnic with respiratory rate reaching 41 breaths per minute. She did not appear to be in respiratory distress， maintaining\n\n【13】SaO. 100% and stated she was comfortable.\n\n【14】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【15】Bradycardia during ventilator weaning is a rare occurrence， with only one such case report found in the literature. It is not uncommon for patients to experience hemodynamic changes while on mechanical ventilation. With regards to heart rate， tachycardia is more common than bradycardia 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Because preload has a direct impact on stroke volume，changes in intrathoracic pressure caused by changes in PEEP have a direct effect on cardiac output. Intrathoracic pressure during mechanical ventilation is positive 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. As intrathoracic pressure and right atrium pressure increase during positive pressure inspiration， venous return decreases 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Therefore， increasing PEEP (which increases intrathoracic pressure) decreases venous return to the right atrium； thus， preload is decreased which leads to decreased cardiac output. Conversely，decreasing PEEP decreases intrathoracic pressure and increased blood return to the right atrium and thus， increases preload； this then increases cardiac output.\n\n【16】In response to the above-mentioned changes， the autonomic nervous system is activated and subsequently causes physiologic alterations aimed at maintaining cardiac output 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. A patient who experiences decreased venous return to the right heart will experience increase in heart rate to accommodate this and maintain cardiac output. Therefore， a patient with decreased preload due to higher PEEP may have increased heart rate. Contrary to this is a patient with decreased PEEP， who will have increased preload and a resulting increase in parasympathetic activity and maylead to a vagal response； this would ultimately cause a decrease in heart rate， as occurred in this case report.\n\n【17】An associationhbetween intrathoracic pressurTeeand left ventricular after load was explained by Buda et al.， stating negative intrathoracic pressure affects left ventricular function by increasing left ventricular transmural pressures and thus， after load. Stated another way， decreasing PEEP also increases left ventricular after load 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. This would cause a decrease in cardiac output in a patient with impaired myocardial function； however， in a patient without such impairment， the increased cardiac output gained by decreased intrathoracic pressure will outweigh the decrease in cardiac output as a result of increased left ventricular after load 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. An understanding of the mechanics that occur in a patient on a ventilator is exceedingly important to manage these patients safely as well as to recognize the hemodynamic changes taking place 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【18】Availability of Data and Materials\n\n【19】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article， including details obtained directly from the patient's medical chart.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Invasive mole， also known as chorioadenoma detrusens， is one such entity which involves trophoblastic tissues， penetrating deep into the myometrium， and at times， involving peritoneum， adjacent parametrium or vaginal vault. They are locally invasive but generally lack tendency to develop wide spread metastasis. Classic presentation of invasive mole is history of amenorrhea， bleeding per vaginum and pain abdomen. However， it may present as massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage， following uterine perforation. We report a rare case of chorioadenoma detrusens， presenting as massive hemoperitoneum in a nulliparous woman， in which， a challenging decision of conserving the uterus was taken in low resource settings.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 25-years-old nulliparous female was referred from a small public hospital to the casualty department of a tertiary care hospital， as a case of ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The patient had history of dilatation and curettage done four months back in view of missed abortion at eight weeks gestation， in a private hospital. No histopathology had been sent. Patient remained asymptomatic for one month and developed bleeding per vaginum thereafter. She assumed it as menstruation， though pattern of bleeding was different from normal. After five days of bleeding， she developed acute pain in abdomen for which she consulted the public hospital. There， her ultrasound showed normal size uterus with endometrial thickness of 12 mm. Bilateral ovaries were normal，however， increased vascularity in bilateral adnexa and mild amount of heterogenous collection in pouch of Douglas was noted. The BhCG levels came out to be 2，97，198 IU. With these reports， patient was referred to our hospital.\n\nOn admission， patient was conscious but had signs of hypovolumic shock (blood pressure of80/60 mmHg， pulse rate of 130 bpm to 140 bpm). She had severe pallor. Abdominal examination revealed a distended and tense abdomen with tenderness in lower abdomen. Vaginal examination showed minimal bleeding， closed external OS and fullness in fornices. Uterine size and bilateral adnexa could not be assessed due to tense abdomen. Paracentesis showed non-clotting blood. Patient was taken for laparotomy immediately.Operative findings showed hemoperitoneum of 1000cc， uterus enlarged to 10-12 weeks size with a rent of 2 cm ×1 cm on fundus with torrential bleeding through it and grape-like vesicles popping from it. Two more thin uterine blebs (2 cm x1 and 4 cm|删除段之间换行|x4 cm)， bluish in color， representing thinned out myometrium， were seen on the anterior and right lateral surface of uterus on the verge of rupture . Bilateral fallopian tubes were normal but bilateral ovaries enlarged with theca-lutein cysts. A clinical diagnosis of invasive mole or choriocarcinoma was made. Keeping in mind， the nulliparous status of patient， uterine conservation seemed to be important. However， risk of rupture of the blebs was a prime concern. Moreover， there was a possibility of inability to achieve hemostasis. The patient's husband was explained about the gravity of situation and requirement of relaparotomy if she bleeds again. Hemostatic sutures were applied on the rent and bleeding was controlled. The protruding grapelike tissues was sent for histopathologic examination. Intraperitoneal drain was inserted due to risk of subsequent rupture of the blebs leading to hemoperitoneum. As ultrasound revealed no mass in uterine cavity， no evacuation was attempted.\n\n【8】Patient remained stable in postoperative period with her stitches and drain removed on 84 postoperative day. Her histopathology showed hyperplastic trophoblasts， generalized cystic degeneration of chorionic villi and presence of molar villi within myometrium. Her BhCG had fallen to 56，781 IU/ml by 8th post operative day. No metastasis found in her chest X-ray and USG whole abdomen. Oncology consultation was done. After reviewing all reports and prognostic scoring (=7) patient was put on multiple agent chemotherapy (EMACO) on outpatient basis by oncology department； patient discharged with proper contraceptive and follow up advice. She received eight cycles of EMACO. Weekly BhCG follow up was done and it was found to be 1.5 IU/ml after 20 weeks follow LP.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Invasive moles comprise of 15% cases of gestational trophoblastic\n\n【11】Management of invasive mole basically depends on two factors-prognostic scoring of GTN and parity of patient. Low risk GTN includes both non-metastatic and metastatic GTN with prognostic score <7. In patients with stage one disease， the selection oftreatment primarily depends on whether patient desires to retain fertility. If patient does not want to preserve fertility hysterectomy with adjuvant single agent chemotherapy is performed as primary treatment. But in patients wanting to preserve fertility， management solely rests on chemotherapy.\n\n【12】Mitani et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> proposed partial resection of uterus for young women if invasive mole presents with hemoperitoneum. Five women have been reportedly treated this way and four of them delivered healthy babies with cesarean section. Local uterine resection together with bilateral internal iliac artery ligation to combine hemostasis with preservation of fertility has been reported by Goldstein et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Atala et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> reported a case of chorioadenoma detrusens with uterine rupture where trophoblastic tissue invaded broad ligament and right ureter 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Hysterectomy followed by chemotherapy was done although it could not save the patient. In our case， the nulliparous status of patient along with point source of bleeding which could be easily controlled by hemostatic sutures deferred us from hysterectomy. Nonetheless there was further risk of uterine perforation through those thinned out blebs but we undertook that risk and left an intraperitoneal drain to watch for any further episode of hemoperitoneum. Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE) is an alternative and has been reported by Shen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> to successfully control internal hemorrhage caused by invasive trophoblastic disease. But UAE was not an option for us， as the facility is not available in our setting. If available， preoperative or immediate postoperative UAE could have been an option in our patient， as it would have alleviated the risk of further hemorrhage to an extent. In patients with stage one disease who desire to retain fertility chemotherapy is preferred option with excellent remission rates. Though a case has been reported by Sunesh et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> where local uterine wedge resection following uterine evacuation without any chemotherapy cured the patient.\n\n【13】Conclusion删除1换行nulliparous patient and hysterectomy should only be opted as last resort.

We believe that the preoperative evaluation of the patient by a multidisciplinary team composed of oncologist， otolaryngologist， pathologist and radiologist will reduce this possibility.\n\n【2】Keywords： Carotid body tumor； Adenocarsinoma； Biopsy\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Neck swelling is quite frequent seen in various medical disciplines such as oncology， pathology， ear-nose-throat， general surgery， internal medicine， pediatrics， thoracic surgery，radiotherapy and creates a common interest. The neck is the busiest parts of the body's lymphatic network and very different and a lot of neoplasm can be seen in the neck. For this reason， the differential diagnosis is important in neck masses. In differential diagnosis； history， ultrasonography (USG)， computed tomography (CT)， magnetic resonance (MR)， fine needle aspiration (FNA) is utilized. FNA has become the standard in the diagnosis and treatment of neck masses. Different opinions regarding the success of FNA in the diagnosis has been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. The experience is important for receipt， preparation and evaluation of aspiration. The most important reason for misdiagnosis was shown as aspiration from inappropriate places and improper preparation 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. FNA is a good method in the diagnosis ofhead and neck malignancies， especially a highly sensitive method for the detection of metastatic carcinoma of the lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The carotid body tumors are rare tumors developing from paraganglionic cells of the carotid body and they are often found in common carotid artery bifurcation. The carotid body tumors are rare， asymptomatic，slow-growing and usually benign tumors. Malignant transformation of tumor is between 3-10 % and metastasis has been published as 2% 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. Metastatic spread often happens to regional lymph nodes.\n\n【5】In this article， we present a patient with carotid body tumor misdiagnosed as adenocarcinoma metastases in the light of the literature.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\nForty-three-year-old female patient with a mass in the neck was forwarded to us by oncologist with the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown. In history， he said growing left neck mass in 5 months. Neck ultrasound (USG)， neck CT and chest CT were done before coming to our clinics. In the neck CT， there was a ovoid， smooth contours of approximately 30x20x45 mm in size and isodense mass pushing the left internal carotid artery (ICA) posteriorly， and locating in the posterior of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle . Fine needle aspiration (FNA) results from mass were reported as metastatic adenocarcinoma. Patients PET was performed and hypermetabolic areas were found in the left cervical region and rectum. Two tumor biopsies were|删除段之间换行|taken from rectum at different times for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes and reported as negative， therefore， neck dissection was planned. Round encapsulated mass with 3x删除4-1:<u>2</u>. 7x删除4-1:<u>2</u>. 5 cm was detected in left carotid bifurcation， intraoperatively. The mass was excised by working in subadventisyel . As pathology results， the mass was reported as paraganglioma， on the other hand， the neck dissection material was reported as reactive hyperplasia.\n\n【8】Postoperative complications were not observed in the patient. Although flushing episodes were observed in the patient’s in first postoperative days， these complaints were disappeared in follow-up.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Neck mass is a common pathological condition involving many medical disciplines. All tumors should be approached with a suspected neck malignancy until proved otherwise， and primary studies should be performed in order to determine the pathology taking into account the possibility of a metastasis.Therefore， detailed ENT examination in the approach of the neck masses is vital especially in metastatic neoplasms. It is not possible to identify the primary focus without a complete ear， nose， and throat examination. Multidisciplinary approach should be followed in the diagnosis of mass such as radiology， pathology， oncology branches. In our case， oncology directed the patient to our clinics in the diagnosis stage； FNA diagnosed incorrectly， preliminary results of PET / CT results have led us to have the wrong directions.\n\n【11】The staging of head and neck tumors is an important part of diagnosis and treatment. Especially， in locally advanced head and neck cancer are about 10% in the distant metastatic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.PET/CT provide bothlocal staging and showing distant metastases and it is a good opportunity in this regard affecting the patient management. In a study， especially， high-risk patients were selected and evaluated for synchronous and metachronous metastases of patients as the first staging of head and neck cancer and it was conducted in F-18\n\n【12】FDG PET / CT. The sensitivity and specificity for distant metastasis were 96.8% and 95.4%， respectively， 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. In our case PET/ CT results， hyper metabolic areas of the rectum were followed and rectal adenocarcinoma is thought to be inducing metastasis in the neck. Tumor biopsies were taken from the rectum twice and have resulted as negatives in both of them. Although PET / CT have high reliability， fallibility should be kept in mind.\n\n【13】Head and neck masses develop due to inflammatory， infectious， benign or malignant neoplasms， and cystic lesions. The story of the patient and clinical findings are necessary for diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. However， morphological examination is necessary in order to make a definitive diagnosis in most cases. In addition， during preoperative evaluation， accurate diagnosis is of paramount importance in determining the surgical and technical technique 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Therefore， importance of FNA in the diagnosis and treatment planning increases. FNA is cheap， reliable and easy diagnostic methods to apply. However， different opinions in the literature regarding the diagnosis success of FNA has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. In a study reported by Ozbay et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>regarding to non thyroidal FNA results containing all head and neck masses， they reported 68 patients with 95.1% accuracy， 97.5% sensitivity，92.8% specificity， 1.5% false positive and 2.9% false negative results. In our case， treatment plans has changed completely due to wrong result as adenocarcinoma metastasis.\n\n【14】In the histopathological basis of carotid body tumor， the majority of main cells and supporting cells that surround them create \"zellball island\". Main cells contain cell nuclei with fine chromatin network structure and amfofilik or eosinophilic cytoplasm. These cells are sometimes as short cords in carcinoid tumors， sometimes gland-like structures as in adenocarcinoma， and sometimes rosette-like structures as seen in neuroblastic tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Therefore， histological differential diagnosis is required in cytological differential diagnosis of these tumors. Our patient was misdiagnosed as metastasis of adenocarcinoma. This kind of differential diagnosis to avoid misdiagnosis is necessary to rule out the possibilities.\n\n【15】The carotid body tumor is caused by chemoreceptor tissue in the carotid bifurcation. It is frequently benign and non functional. Growing mass in theanterior necktriangle should raise this pathology. Due to the slow development， it is often asymptomatic until it reaches a certain size 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. They remain silent until they press cranial nerve or vascular structures. In patients with functional， it can occur with symptoms related tothe release ofcatecholamines. It is more common in women and at high altitudes. They are tend to be seen together with other cervical paraganglioma of carotid body tumors， head and neck and other malignant paraganglioma (lung， larynx， breast carcinoma)删除2换行and are tend to be bilateral or multiple. Therefore， each patient with unilateral mass should be examined carefully including all neck and thorax 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14]</u>. In our case， it wasasymptomatic left neck mass growing in five months， and it has no symptoms， no family history. There was no other focus showed by the body scan.\n\n【16】The choice of therapy for carotid body tumor should be planned considering patient’s symptoms， age， tumor size， growth rate and complications of the surgery. Radiotherapy and / or embolization can be selected because it has slow growth pattern， low malignancy and surgical treatment risk 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. In our case， the mass was excised by working in subadventisyel and postoperative complications were not observed in the patient.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】Unknown primary tumors of the neck should be evaluated multidisciplinary. A detailed ENT examination and all attempts must be carried out carefully in order to find primary tumor. FNA is one of the diagnostic phase， therefore it should be done professionally and should be reported by a good cytologist. Otherwise， patients with suspected cancer may be uneasy for months like our patient. The patient waited 3-4 months until reaching surgical pathology report as benign. If the patient was admitted to our clinic directly and FNA results was diagnosed correctly， the patient would not be uneasiness tor 3-4 months.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The disease most often affects the hips， but can also affect the knees， ankles and feet 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. The disease is most commonly one-sided， but a bilateral phenomenon is also described. This type of syndrome is most commonly associated with middle-aged men and women in the third trimester of pregnancy删除4-1:<u>3</u>.\n\n【5】This paper presents thirty-nine year old patient with transitory osteoporosis of the knee that appeared in the third trimester ofpregnancy.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 39-year old patient presented with the pain in both knees， but more severe of the right knee. Joint pain began spontaneously in the 7h month ofpregnancy， followed by a difficult loaded the right leg and limping， symptoms were of a progressive character. This was patient's first pregnancy. The patient was otherwise healthy but has been treated for infertility. Eleven days before the expected delivery the patient was hospitalized. At that time pain estimated by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was 10 in motion and in rest the patient was without pain. The birth was executed by C-Section because of the eclampsia. Three weeks after delivery the patient was examined by rheumatologist. At that time the patient was in wheelchairs and she complained of pain in both knees， denying general symptoms. Patient's clinical appearance was dominated by the difficulty of mobility， the patient was able to verticalize from the sitting position， make a few steps with the help of 2 crutches. The right knee was hyperthermic， with the positive signs of intra articular effusion， and in a flexion contracture of 20 degrees. The clinical diagnosis of undifferentiated oligoarthritis was set up. Laboratory tests made the same day were all within the reference values. The X- ray of the knees demonstrated reduced mineralization of metaphysis of tibia and femur， both with slightly reduced joint space of both median intercondylar hinges without reactive changes， also it showed symmetrically thickened para-articular soft tissue. The MRI of the knees was planned. In the treatment of the patient's condition we recommended physical therapy (individual kinesitherapy，electrostimulation of quadriceps muscles and knee electromagnetotherapy)， which the patient started five weeks after childbirth. The physical therapy resulted with reduced pain， a better knee movement， improved mobility and the patient was walking with the aid of one crutch. Five months from the onset of the disease， imaging of the right knee with an MRI was obtained and it demonstrated a massive stain bone-marrow edema of the distal metaphysis of the femur and proximal metaphysis of the tibia and fibula with consequent trabecular fractures of condyes with periosteal response. These changes are typical for diagnosis of transitory osteoporosis. Six months from the onset of the disease， the patient删除1换行cited.删除2换行was no longer complaining of knee pain. The knees were euthermic， with no signs of intra articular effusion and with a preserved movement of joints. Repeated knee MRI， 1 year from the onset of the symptoms， revealed almost complete regression of the earlier present massive bone-marrow edema of the distal metaepiphysis of the femur and proximal metaepiphysis of the tibia and fibula with only some residual zones of mild edema. In the same period， the patient was without any subjective problems and she presented without any sign of knee pathology.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】The rare occurrence of this syndrome， non-specific clinical and radiological images contribute to the difficulty of recognizing this disease. The syndrome was first described by Kurtis and Kincaid in删除4-1:<u>1959</u>. On the hip joint in three pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. There are different hypotheses about the etiology of this condition. Proposed etiologies include nerve compression， vascular insufficiency， and changes in the fibrinolytic system during pregnancy. Also some authors believe that TO is a type of chronic regional pain syndrome without previous trauma， but the exact etiology remains vague 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-6]</u>. The most commonly affected is hip joint， but transitory osteoporosis can also affect other leg joints such as knee， ankle and foot 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. This syndrome should be suspected based on anamnesis and examination，but an MR通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> should be used to confirm the diagnosis. Transient osteoporosis is characterized by sudden localized pain， which is present in the loading of the joint and is absent in rest. It is also characterized by reduced movement of the affected joint， non-specific laboratory findings， and uncertain radiological findings 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. Differential diagnostic considerations include avascular necrosis， stress fractures， neoplasms， inflammatory arthritis and bone injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. On the standard x-ray structure of the bone is osteopenic， while the MR confirms diagnosis with high-signal bone in edema of T2 sequences. The gold standard for diagnosing TO is MR that shows bone edema48 hrs after the onset of symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Bone marrow edema on the MR is a non-specific finding that occurs in various pathological conditions of the knee. In the finding of bone marrow edema on the knee MR and without the presence of Avascular Osteonecrosis(AVN)， meniscus or osteoarthritis injuries must be suspected of transitory osteoporosis. Due to different prognoses and approaches to treatment， it is important to distinguish between AVN and TO， the latter being self-limiting and treating conservatively while AVN is progressive and may require surgicaltreatment. The above mentioned MR is of exceptional help 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. TO can be objectified by scintigraphy of a skeleton with Tc-99m showing increased accumulation of radioisotope， while in AVN it is reduced and shows \"cold point\"通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【10】Since TO is a self-limiting disease， in therapy is recommended to take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs， physical therapy， relieve删除1换行the affected joint， and sufficient vitamin D and calcium intake to accelerate the healing process. Some of the drugs used postpartum are bisphosphonates (alendronate， pamidronate， ibandronate and zolendronic acid)， glucocorticoids， prostaglandins and calcitonin. Studies suggesting the use of these drugs were conducted on a small number of subjects 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In most patients， with adequate diagnosis and adequate treatment， a regression of symptoms is expected in 3 to 6months with simultaneous withdrawal of the radiological finding 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】Diagnosis of TO is usually delayed， and treatment is often inadequate. It is important to suspect on transient osteoporosis in pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy， which is presented with the sudden onset of pain in one joint， and the clinical finding is not correlated with the severity of the pain. With an early diagnosis unnecessary invasive treatment approach can be avoided.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) disease is characterized through uncontrolled proliferation and accumulation of Langerhans cells in varioustissues. The etiology and pathogenesis have not been fully identified yet； however， it is generally thought that it is associated with immune system damage or a malignant process. While its incidence is very rare among the adults， it is most commonly seen in pediatric age especially between 1 and 3 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The incidence is reported to be 0.5 to 4per million. Although lung， bone， and skin are the most commonly involved organs in this disease， Gastrointestinal System (GIS) involvement is generally very rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Crohns disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of GIS with granulomas. The aim of this study was to present the clinical， radiological and histopathological findings of LCH with terminal ileum andlung involvement along with discussing in the light of most recent findings in the literature.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\nA 42-year-old male patient presented to our hospital with the complaints of intermittent diarrhea and abdominal pain which continued almost along a year frequently. He had also associated nausea， vomiting and weight loss. The white blood cell count in the laboratory examination of the patient was found to be 13 ×10/mL， hemoglobin was 11 g/dL， hematocrit was 30， platelet was490×10/mL， sedimentation was 48 mm/h， CRP was 69 mg/L. Other biochemical values were found to be within the normal range. Colonoscopic examination revealed geographically shaped large ulcers with a deep-bottomed at the first 10 cm of the terminal ileum which initially suggests the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease . The pathological examination of the ulcer biopsies was reported as chronic active colitis that may be compatible with Crohn’s disease. The patients were then administrated immediately with azathioprine and budesonide. While patient's diarrhea regressed with the treatment， the abdominal pain still persisted. In the third month oftreatment， the|删除段之间换行|Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【9】LCH is among the very rare diseases， and is characterized by the proliferation of langerhans type of cells expressing CD1a， and S100protein. In the active phase of the disease， granulomatous nodular lesions consisting of langerhans cells are existed. This disease is definitively diagnosed through the existence of positively stained Langerhans cells with CDla antigen and S-100 protein in the biopsy taken from the lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. The disease can be clinically encountered as a single-focus or multi systemic disease. The systemic involvement has been associated with poor prognosis. GIS involvement with LCH in adults is very rare， and the cases often present as a solitary， polypoid lesion without a systemic involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【10】In our literature research (based on PubMed and Google Scholar)， we identified 35 published studies reporting the cases with LCH and GIS involvement in which the first case was reported in1968 and the last was in 2019 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-37]</u>. Among these 35 reported cases， its distribution based on the involved organs as follows： 1 esophagus，8 stomachs，4 small intestines，20 colons (14polyps)，and 2 anal canals. These patients also included the small case series of 12patients reported by Singhi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In this series， GIS involvement was identified in 10 adults LCH patients in which nine often patients had colon involvement while one patient had stomach involvement and two had skin involvement. In this series， the mostly reported cases were single， non-ulcerated LCH polyps incidentally detected by colonoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【11】There are limited numbers of cases on LCH involving the small intestine with only 4 reported cases in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，8，10，31]</u> in which two of these mimicked Crohn's disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，10]</u>.\n\n【12】The first case with ileum and lung involvement was firstly described in 1968. In that case report， a 64-year-old male patient who previously diagnosed with LCH presented with bleeding and was diagnosed with LCH in the small intestine. The difference of this case from the case herein was that there was no diagnosis of Crohn's disease and diffuse involvement of the ileum and multiple ulcers were observed通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【13】Sakanoueet al.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> reported that a patient，who hadbeen diagnosed with Crohn’s disease involving the small intestine for five years and improved dramatically with steroid treatment during this period， experienced an attack leading to segmental ileal resection during the follow-up period. In the pathology findings of the resected specimen， diffuse histiocyte aggregates and langerhans cells were observed and then the case was confirmed as LCH at the end of five years 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【14】In the recent case of LCH mimicking Crohn's disease， the disease had colon involvement， unlike our case. Therein they presented a case of ulcers， perianal lesion and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis(PSC) involvement in the colon. Biopsy of deep ulcers in the colon suggested Crohn's disease. During the follow-up of the patient who did not respond to infliximab treatment， skin lesions developed and the examination of skin lesion biopsy revealed as LCH. Subsequently， biopsy specimens of ulcers in the colon were re-examined and LCH was confirmed in the colon 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>.\n\n【15】In another case report consisting the LCH mimicking Crohn's disease， Roeb et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> described a 69-year-old male patient who删除表格换行had been diagnosed with Crohn's disease with perianal fistula and deep colon ulcers for 4 years. This patient was diagnosed with LCH by the second examination of colon Bx samples at the end of 4 years通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Similar to our case reported herein， another case mimicking Crohn's disease along with lung involvement was also reported. In this case， a 46-year-old female patient had diffuse ulcers extending from the anal canal to the terminal ileum in her colonoscopy because of her complaint of chronic diarrhea. The pathological examination and clinical findings of the patient were consistent with Crohn's disease. The patient was then initially administered with prednisone，6-mercaptopurine， and infliximab and had been using this treatment for the 23 months. The patient was limitedly benefited from this treatment and re-presented to another hospital due to severe diarrhea， dehydration， and renal failure.

Her colonoscopy examination revealed deep ulcers in the entire colon， indicating Crohns disease while the terminal ileum was normal. She had recently diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and pulmonary fibrosis in the lung. Cirrhosis was thought to be associated with PSK secondary to the underlying inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore， intravenous prednisolone treatment was initiated and diarrhea was treated. Before the treatment， patchy rashes developed on the back of the patient. The colon bx samples were then re-examined since the findings in biopsy was consistent with LCH. Colonic ulcers were also compatible with LCH. Bx samples were collected from both lung and liver. While histiocyte infiltration suggests the diagnosis of LCH in lung samples， liver Bx samples were not compatible with LCH 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. More recently， another case report of a 55-year-old woman who underwent laparotomy for acute onset abdominal pain and subacute intestinal obstruction have reported. In this case report， granulation tissue was observed in the periumbilical region and pathological diagnosis was reported as LCH in the small intestine 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. The largest series in the literature has been reported by Goyal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>. In the study， 186 adult LCH patients were investigated retrospectively and no GIS involvement was reported. Lung involvement was the most common in the series.\n\n【19】To the best of our knowledge， the case presented herein is the first case of LCH involving the isolated terminal ileum and lung. Since GIS involvement with LCH is very rare and it is a disease with granulomas， the possibility of misdiagnosing the disease is very high. As in the four aforementioned cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[17，22，27，33]</u>， our case was diagnosed as LCH even following the second examination of colon biopsy samples along with the use of special marker staining. Since immune histochemical staining for S100 and CD 1a is not a routine practice in the clinic， the diagnosis of LCH can easily be overlooked. Therefore， pathologist awareness is critical in such a case. Ifpathologists report an increase in eosinophilia or histiocytic cells in microscopic examination of biopsy specimens， the clinician should frequently think of the possibility of LCH.\n\n【20】There is no standard treatment of LCH available for adults because the pathogenesis of LCH has not been clear yet. However， the current recommended first-line therapy in multisystem LCH patients is the combination of prednisone and vinblastine drug therapy. In addition， local excision is considered as the preferred treatment modality especially for unifocal involvement， but a long-term follow-up is required in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u>.\n\n【21】Mansour et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> recently reported the case of multiple polyps from the rectum to the cecum and LCH with lung involvement. In the case report， the recurrence of colon lesions was observed after vinblastine treatment. Following the recurrence， the patient was administered a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin， a chemotherapy regimen that was previously not tried and not reported for adult LCH treatment. They obtained a positive response with this combined treatment. The authors highlighted that this combination may be an alternative treatment regimen in LHD cases with symptomatic diffuse GIS involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>. In our patient， 1 mg/删除2换行kg prednisolone treatment was initiated and then combined with vinblastine. Thetreatment and follow-up of the patient have been still continuing.\n\n【22】Taking all into consideration， the possibility of LCH should be always kept in mind in the case of non-response to the treatment for the patients with a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease， when atypical skin rashes develop or when lung nodules are detected. The definitive diagnosis of Crohn's disease should be questioned in such cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

After surgery， the excised scrotum was reported as soft fibroma pathologically， which was quite rare in children. To our knowledge， it was the first time to disclose accessory scrotum with soft fibroma in neonates.\n\n【2】Keywords： Neonate； Accessory scrotum； Soft fibroma\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The incidence of congenital scrotal anomaly is rare. Traditionally， it can be classified into four types： bifid scrotum， penoscrotal transposition， ectopic scrotum and accessory scrotum通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Accessory scrotum is the occurrence of scrotal skin outside its normal location， either in the perineum or elsewhere， without the presence of testis in it 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. In most cases， perineal lipoma is observed associated with accessory scrotum pathologically. But herein， we would report two cases of soft fibroma in the accessory of neonates.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Case 1\n\n【7】A 28-day-old boy born in a normal family presented with a soft tissue mass in the perineal region. Physical examination of the genitalia showed a normal scrotum and penis. The testes were descended to the scrotum. There was another 10 cm x 5 cm x4 cm mass covered with skin with rugosity suggestive of accessory scrotum. This was situated between the normally sited scrotum and the anal orifice . Magnetic resonance imaging of the mass revealed a soft tissue with high signal intensity in the T1- and T2-weighted sequences. MRI of the lumbosacral spine and spinal cord were normal. No other congenital abnormalities or problems related to the patient were found.\n\n【8】Case 2\n\n【9】A 2-day-old boy was transferred from a local hospital. It seemed nothing abnormal to him but a 3 cm x2 cm × 1.5 cm mass located in the right groin. The mass was soft， non-tender and covered with wrinkled skin. The penis and scrotum were situated in the normal position. Although there was hypoplasia of the right part of the scrotum， bilateral testes stayed within it . Ultrasonography demonstrated the mass contained fat and fibrous tissue with poor blood flow.\n\n【10】After consultation and routine pre-operative tests， the above two patients accepted operations individually. The mass was resected completely and normal anatomy was restored. Histological appearance of the mass comprised of fat cells， fibrous septa and collagen . The dermal adnexa appeared normal. Sweat glands were absent. These findings were consistent with scrotal skin. So the pathological report of the mass was soft fibroma. And the clinical diagnosis was accessory scrotum.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Accessory scrotum is the rarest among the congenital anomalies of the scrotum 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. It occurs in the perineum， inguinal canal， or medial aspect of the thigh and is sometimes associated with genitourinary or anorectal abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>[5-7]</u>. Fortunately， the two boys in our report were generally healthy except the accessory.\n\nReview of the literature does not provide enough information on the confirmed causative mechanism for the occurrence of accessory scrotum.

Lamn and Kaplan 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> have suggested that the failure of movement of|删除段之间换行|Sule et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> suggested that a developing lipoma in the perineal region could divide the labioscrotal swelling of one side into two or more parts， so that the accessory scrotum is coincident with a lipoma通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.

There are difficulties in the approach of symptomatic patients， mainly abdominal pain when we are in the presence of associated pathologies such as neoplasms. Multiple studies have evaluated the relationship between PM and cancer trying to identify a possible prediction of neoplasms， progression or a paraneoplastic injury with contradictory results. We present the case of a patient with an advanced neuroendocrine tumor undergoing oncological management with MP， its clinical picture， diagnosis and management， and finally， a review of the literature is carried out with an emphasis on the available evidence on the association between PM and cancer.\n\n【2】Keywords： Mesenteric上panniculitis； Pamniculitis； Peritoneal：上Neoplasm；Carcinoma； Neuroendocrine； Abdominal pain\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Mesenteric Panniculitis (MP) is a rare， complex， localized fibroinflammatory pathology of unknown etiology that mainly affects the mesentery of the small intestine and occasionally the mesocolon，peripancreatic region，retroperitoneum， or pelvis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. Generally， PM is an unexpected finding found by abdominal Computed Tomography (CT)， which can identify the characteristical radiologicalfeatures of PM，such as thepresence ofawell-definedheterogeneous fat mass that emerges from the root of the mesentery of the small intestine (with increased attenuation of retroperitoneal fat)， displacement of surrounding loops of intestine， sparing of adjacent fat surrounding superior mesenteric vessels and mesenteric lymph nodes (\"Fat halo sign) and may coexist with presence of a peripheral band of soft tissue surrounding the inflammatory mass (tumor pseudocapsule)通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>.\n\n【5】Currently， several evolutionary stages are identified according to the histologic findings， beginning with inflammation of the mesentery (Mesenteric Panniculitis)， then with fat necrosis(Mesenteric Lipodystrophy) and， finally， scarring mesenteric fibrosis (Sclerosing Mesenteritis) is generated 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Also， is known in the literature as retractile mesenteritis， xanthogranulomatous mesenteritis，liposclerotic mesenteritis， isolated lipodystrophy， or peritoneal xanthogranulomatosis删除4-1:<u>7</u>.\n\n【6】Epidemiologically， MP has a prevalence between 0.16 and 2.5%通用删除6(英):<u>[3，5，8]</u>. It has a higher incidence in men between 50 and 60 years old， with a 2：1 ratio 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，9]</u>. Multiple triggering mechanisms have been described，such as infectious processes， ischemic disorders， trauma， drugs， previous abdominal surgeries， autoimmune diseases， and malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【7】The evidence on the association between MP and cancer is limited， the relationship with lymphomas， colorectal and urogenital malignancy being more common， with rates between 17.6and 69.3%. Some authors have proposed MP as a predictor of malignancy based on low-quality evidence 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，5，11，12]</u>. Therefore， there are still doubts about the approach to these patients with PM and cancer.\n\n【8】We present the case of a patient with a neuroendocrine tumor undergoing cancer management who presented with persistent abdominal pain that was difficult to control and in whom were radiological signs of mesenteric panniculitis， which raised doubts about a manifestation of tumor删除1换行progression. Finally， a discussion ofthe clinical case is made based on the review of the literature.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】Male patient， 50 years old， engineer， married， previously diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumor of unknown primary of6 years of evolution. Hepatic， lymph node， and bone metastases. Oncological management with Lanreotide. He consulted recurrently due to intense abdominal pain that was difficult to locate， predominantly on both flanks， without the presence of associated gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptoms， and without respiratory symptoms. On physical examination， there were no signs of systemic toxicity， no fever， tenderness on palpation in the flanks， no masses or visceromegaly， and peristalsis present， without other significant findings during the assessment. Laboratory tests did not show increased acute phase reactants， leukocytosis， no impaired renal function， and electrolytes but did show elevated phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase. A CT scan of the abdomen reported necrotic adenopathy's in the hepatic hilum， portocaval region， retroperitoneal， retrocrural， and the left iliac chain， unchanged from a previous study. Hepatomegaly and the progression of focal hepatic lesions remained stable in the follow-up. Also， known polyostotic involvement. Halo sign compatible with mesenteric panniculitis. Also， A contrast MRI of the spine showed a diffuse heterogeneous aspect of the bone marrow without collapse or focal infiltrative lesions. It realized a contrast MRI of the spine to rule out metastases and showed a diffuse heterogeneous aspect of the bone marrow without collapse or focal infiltrative lesions. Also， is performed a gallium Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan as a follow-up by his oncologist， which showed cervical， mediastinal， mesenteric，retroperitoneal，and retrocrurallymph node involvement. Hepatic metastasis. Bone involvement in calotte， spine， costal arches， scapulae， and clavicles. And did not report peritoneal involvement. He received multimodal analgesic management with potent opioids， morphine in escalated doses up to 4 mg intravenously QID and删除1换行hyoscine 20 mg intravenously QID with partial improvement， anti-inflammatory cycle with ketorolac and steroid cycle. Intervention is carried out with a quadratus lumborum block achieving better pain control. Outpatient management continued with fentanyl50 microgram patches every 72 h with subsequent removal of 25micrograms and oral hyoscine 10 mg tid due to clinical improvement.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Jura made in 1924， during abdominal surgery， the description of the first case of the disease and named sclerosing mesenteritis. Later， Kuhrmeier made the initial description of the macroscopic and histopathological typical findings. MP is a subtype of sclerosing mesenteritis， a non-specific， inflammatory， non-neoplastic condition of mesenteric adipose tissue. Histopathologically， a mixture of necrosis， chronic inflammation and fibrosis of adipose tissue is found 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，3，13]</u>. The prevalence is variable and based on radiology databases， from 0.16% to 7.8%. Since CT is the choice study and generally incidental， it shows characteristic Coulier radiological criteria， requiring at least 3 of the 5  通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. This large variability depends on the difference in terms used and radiologist operator dependency. Clinically they can be asymptomatic， but some patients present with common symptoms such as fever， malaise， weight loss， hyporexia， abdominal pain， and diarrhea. Different comorbidities were associated with MP， but a causal association has not been found通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Our patient is a man in his fifth decade， corresponding to the population with the highest prevalence reported in the literature. He had a neuroendocrine cancer and consulted due to severe abdominal pain. The CT scan showed the characteristical radiological findings ofMP.\n\n【13】Different studies， mostly case reports and case series from radiological databases，have reported an association between MP and cancer rates of 17.6% to 38%， mainly lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，14]</u>.\n\nMahafza et al. retrospectively studied the tomographic findings of4，758 patients finding MP in 90 of them (1.9%) with a prevalence of|删除段之间换行|Table 1： Signs of Coulier's PM.\n\n| 1.

Gregory et al. also retrospectively evaluated tomographic signs of MP associated with malignancy in 444 patients observing that the presence of nodules >10 mm and lymphadenopathy in other abdominal areas is associated with lymphoid malignancy with high sensitivity and specificity 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>.\n\n【18】Ehrenpreis et al. found retrospectively in 147，794 tomographic studies， 359 with findings compatible with MP， 22.6% with known cancer， and 5.3% with de novo cancer. Lymphomas were the most common neoplasms related to MP (follicular 47%，followed by diffuse large cell B 25%). The most frequent solid tumors were prostate 7%， lung and kidney 6%. Was performed follow-up CT in 56 patients， of which 80% had no new findings， 11% worsened， and 9% improved， and PET-CT in 44 patients showed uptake in only 5%， so it is not a recommended study 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【19】In contrast， other studies have shown a poor relationship between MP and cancer. Gogebakan et al. reported a retrospective case-control study based on CT findings on the prevalence of malignancy and other diseases in patients with and without MP. 77 cases out of13，485 were diagnosed with MP by tomographic studies (0.58%). Malignancy was present in 50.6% of the patients vs. 60% of the control group. They also found no correlation with chronic diseases such as hypertension， diabetes mellitus， or previous surgeries 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Kaminsky et al. also reported no association between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and MP in a case-control study with retrospective CT and PET-CT findings in 166 patients with lymphoma and 332 controls with a prevalence of 1.8% vs. 2.1% respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>.\n\n【20】The MP also have been associatediasaa]paraneoplastic phenomenon with contradictory results. Badet et al. a retrospective analysis of 158 patients diagnosed with MP by CT， found 56% of patients with underlying neoplastic disease， suggesting that it may be a paraneoplastic condition 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. On the contrary， Buchwald et al. a retrospective cohort study of CT findings in 173 patients with MP over 12 years， found no difference in the remission rates of MP in patients with cancer vs. non-cancer， whether or not there was cancer remission， considering that it is not the behavior of a paraneoplastic phenomenon but an epiphenomenon 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Our patient evolved satisfactorily with multimodal and interventional analgesic management. The signs of progression documented in the CT did not influence the clinical evolution towards improvement， which supports the presence of an incidental independent condition.\n\n【21】Few studies have evaluated the presence of MP in patients with neuroendocrine tumors， as in this case. Patirannehalage et al. reported the late diagnosis of an ileal neuroendocrine tumor histologically diagnosed as MP 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. There are doubts about the approach and management of these patients.\n\n【22】MRI and PET-CT also have been used in the diagnosis of MP. Orcajo Rincon et al. evaluated prospectively 2，666 PET-CT to determine its role in MP， 30 had signs suggestive ofMP， with a positive predictive value low (49.79%). The PET-CT findings indicate intense inflammatory activity but do not allow for excluding a concurrent tumor process 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. The patient underwent PET with gallium， which is more accurate for his type of neoplasia and did not correlate with tumor progression， leaving the diagnosis of MP based on CT findings， which， according to the literature， is still considered the method of choice删除4-1:<u>1</u>.\n\n【23】Halligan et al. conducted a systematic review of imaging studies删除1换行of MP to evaluate its relationship with malignancy， concluding that the studies are heterogeneous and present biases that do not allow determining this relationship 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> and recently， Hussain et al. in a meta-analysis with controlled studies with 415 patients， did not find a significant association between MP and neoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【24】There are no recommendations regarding the treatment of MP. Asymptomatic cases do not require management. Multiple drugs such as steroids， tamoxifen， azathioprine， and cyclophosphamide have shown partial response in case series. In rare cases， surgery is helpful for symptomatic relief 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，14]</u>. In our case， management was focused on symptomatic pain management and steroid cycle with clinical improvement and sustained remission.\n\n【25】The clinical significance of MP in patients with malignancy remains controversial， but the studies that show an association have low quality and biases. Better quality evidence available favors the presence of an epiphenomenon.

We evaluated the value of Platelet-to-Portal vein Width Ratio (PPR) and Platelet-to-Spleen Thickness Ratio (PSR) to predict advanced liver fibrosis among patients with HBV infection with HBV e Antigen (HBeAg)-negativity and a normal ALT level.\n\n【2】Design and Methods： HBV surface Antigen (HBsAg) -positive and HBeAg-negative individuals with a normal ALT level was enrolled. The inflammation Grade (G) and fibrosis Stage (S) were analyzed according to pathological features. Two groups (<S2 vs. ≥S2) were divided based on the pathological diagnosis， and the clinical characteristics were summarized.\n\n【3】Results： 73 individuals among 142 patients had a normal ALT. 83.56% (61/73) individual's showed advanced liver fibrosis (e S2). The level of ALT between the two groups differed (21.01±7.40vs.25.37±7.90 U/L， p=0.08). Platelet count， PPR， and PSR were significantly different between the two groups ((145.92±14.55)×10/L vs.(126.38±23.85)×10/L，p=0.008；10.80±1.30 vs. 9.01±1.97， p=0.004； 4.21±0.65 vs. 3.33±0.89， p=0.02， respectively). The PPR and PSR decreased gradualy upon fibrosis aggravation (p<0.05).\n\n【4】Conclusion： The PPR and PSR can be employed to assess fibrosis progression among patients with HBV infection with HBeAg-negativity and a normal ALT.\n\n【5】Keywords： Fibrosis stage； Hepatitis B virus； Normal ALT； Platelet-to-portal vein width ratio； Platelet-to-spleen thickness ratio\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】The natural history of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection can be divided into four stages：Immune tolerance， immune clearance， inactive carrier status， and reactivity 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.“Immune tolerance”refers to the non-responsive state after the immune system of the body meets a specific antigen 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Previously， it was believed that most patients with chronic HBV infection were in the “Immune Tolerance Period\"(ITP) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Patients in the ITP have slight inflammatory necrosis and/or liver fibrosis， and a poor response to antiviral therapy. Simultaneously， spontaneous HBV e Antigen (HBeAg) serological conversion and sustained remission are possible during the ITP. Otherwise，long-term antiviral therapy in the ITP can lead to drug resistance and other adverse events， and even increase the economic burden of patients. Therefore， most patients with immune tolerance of chronic HBV infection do not need antiviral therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. There is a lack of sensitive and specific markers to measure the immune tolerance of patients after HBV infection. However， in the definition of the ITP of HBV infection by various hepatology societies， a continuously normal level of Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) is regarded as a basic characteristic 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-8]</u>. However， there is also evidence that significant fibrosis occurs in a large proportion of HBV-infected patients with a normal ALT level who are considered immune-tolerant 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Hepatocellular carcinoma has been删除1换行found in some patients in the ITP 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>. Liver histopathology of HBV-infected people with a normal ALT level indicates that about one-third to one-half of cases are not in the ITP 通用删除6(英):<u>[12-14]</u>. Therefore， clinicians must judge if patients with chronic HBV infection and a normal ALT level are in the ITP. Liver biopsy is the “gold standard”for determining if the liver has inflammations and fibrosis. However， ascertaining if a patient has liver inflammation by liver biopsy impractical is important because it is invasive. Accurate assessment of the degree of liver fibrosis in patients with a normal ALT level in a non-invasive manner is crucial to ascertain if patients are immune-tolerant. We investigated the basic clinical and laboratory characteristics of advanced liver fibrosis among patients with HBV infection who were HBeAg-negative and had a normal ALT level.\n\n【8】Patients and Methods\n\n【9】Ethical approval of the study protocol\n\n【10】The study protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Fuling Center Hospital of Chongqing City (Chongqing， China). Written informed consent was obtained from patients (or their legal surrogates) before data collection.\n\n【11】Inclusion criteria\n\n【12】The inclusion criteria were： (i) Serum Hepatitis B surface Antigen(HBsAg)-positivity for ≥ 6 months； (ii) serum HBeAg-negativity； (iii) never treated with antiviral agents.\n\n【13】Exclusion criteria\n\n【14】The exclusion criteria were： (i) Infection with hepatitis A， C， D， E or other viruses； (ii) history of alcohol and/or drug intake that caused liver damage； (iii) nonalcoholic fatty liver disease； (iv) space-occupying lesion in the liver； (v) history of hereditary metabolic liver disease or autoimmune liver disease； (vi) history of hypertension， diabetes mellitus， coronary heart disease， or metabolic syndrome；(vii) history of traumatic fractures.\n\n【15】Study design\n\n【16】A total of 165 patients who underwent liver biopsy for assessment of disease progression from July 2019 to June 2021 at Fuling Center Hospital of Chongqing City were evaluated . Twenty-three patients were excluded. Hence， 142 patients with HBV infection with HBsAg-positivity and HBeAg-negativity were enrolled. Of these， 73patientshad a normal ALT level (defined as ALT<40 U/L). All patients underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous liver biopsy followed by calculation of the METAVIR score to assess the inflammation grade and fibrosis stage. Then， patients were divided into two groups：advanced fibrosis (stage ≥2) and non-progressive fibrosis (stage <2).\n\n【17】删除10:<u>Data</u>\n\n【18】The clinical andlaboratory data of all patients were collected upon hospital admission. These data comprised： Age； platelet count； serum levels of ALT， Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)， albumin， globulin， and Albumin/Globulin (A/G) ratio； Portal Vein Width (PVW)；spleen thickness. Serum levels of HBeAg or HBsAg were quantified using a standardized electro-chemiluminescent immunoassay (Architect~HBeAg； Abbott， Chicago， IL， USA) with a limit of detection of 1 S/CO. HBV DNA was measured using COBAS TaqMan v2.0 (limit of detection =20 IU/mL； Roche， Basel， Switzerland). Laboratory tests were done upon admission to Fuling Center Hospital of Chongqing City.\n\n【19】Liver histology\n\n【20】Ultrasound-guided percutaneous liver puncture wascarried删除1换行out. Then， hematoxylin and eosin-stained liver biopsies were tested by two specialist pathologists in a blinded manner. Inflammation grade ≥2 was considered“moderate/severe necroinflammation\"，and fibrosis stage ≥2 was regarded as “advanced fibrosis\"according to the METAVIR scoring 通用删除6(英):<u>[15-17]</u>.\n\n【21】Statistical analyses\n\n【22】SPSS 22.0 (IBM， Armonk， NY， USA) was used for statistical analyses. Continuous variables (presented as frequencies and percentages or the mean ± SD) were compared using the Student's t-test or non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test. Categorical data were analyzed with the chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test. Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated and compared. Logistic regression was employed to consider the cutoff value. Optimal cutoff values were selected to maximize specificity and sensitivity. P<0.05was considered significant.\n\n【23】Results\n\n【24】Patient characteristics\n\n【25】Twenty-three patients ofthe 165 patients were excluded (infection with the hepatitis C virus (seven patients)； space-occupying lesion in the liver (five)； autoimmune liver disease (five)； genetic metabolic liver disease (two)； alcoholic liver disease (two)； nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (two). Thus， 142 patients were enrolled in this study， and73 individuals had a normal ALT level .\n\n【26】Inflammation grade and fibrosis stage\n\n【27】Of 142 patients， the number with an inflammation grade of 0， 1，2，3， and 4 was 0， 16，100， 23， and 3， respectively . For patients with inflammation grade 0，1，2，3 and 4， the percentage with a fibrosis stage ≥2 was 0%，18.75%，93%，100%， and 100%， respectively. Overall，83.80%(119/142) of individuals had advanced fibrosis (fibrosis stage22). For the 73 patients with a normal ALT level， the number with an inflammation grade of 0， 1， 2， 3， and 4 was 0， 10， 56， 7， and 0， respectively.For patients with inflammation grade 0， 1，2， 3 and 4， the percentage with a fibrosis stage ≥ 2 was 0%， 10.00%，94.64%，100%， and 0%， respectively. Overall， 83.56%(61/73) patients had advanced fibrosis (fibrosis stage 22) .\n\n【28】Table 2： Inflammation grade and fibrosis stage among 73 HBV-infected patients with HBeAg-negativity and a normal ALT level.\n\n【29】PPR： Platelet-to-Portal vein Width Ratio； PSR： Platelet-to-Spleen Thickness\n\n【30】Ratio删除表格换行(21.01±7.40 vs. 25.37 ±7.90 U/L， p=0.08； 29.49±13.56 vs. 30.16±21.88 U/L， p=0.92， respectively).

Recent studies have shown that ~19% of people infected with the HBV require antiviral treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. For chronic HBV infection， antiviral therapy can prevent the progression of fibrosis， cirrhosis， and cancer of the liver， and reduce the mortality associated withliver disease. Hence，antiviraltherapy is crucial 通用删除6(英):<u>[20-22]</u>. The serum level of ALT reflects the host immunity to viral challenge， and is one of the most sensitive biomarkers for liver inflammation. Therefore， an increase in the serum level of ALT is a good indication of hepatic necroinflammation， and one of the parameters for determining initiation of antiviral therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，23，24]</u>. However， in real-world clinical practice， the ALT level is not completely consistent with the degree of liver inflammation. Inflammation and fibrosis as judged by histology has been documented in people with a HBV删除2换行infection and a normal level of ALT 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，25，26]</u>. We found that 83.80%(119/142) of individuals with an HBV infection had advanced fibrosis. Simultaneously，83.56%(61/73) of patients with a normal ALT level had advanced fibrosis (fibrosis stage ≥2). ALT is a marker of liver dysfunction. In China， about 62.4% of HBV-infected patients have a normal ALT level， and these patients are often mistaken for having immune tolerance. Changes in the ALT level are not always consistent with the degree of inflammation of liver tissue. Hence， errors may arise in judging if patients need antiviral therapy based on the ALT level. Therefore， a normal ALT level cannot be used to ascertain if patients need treatment. Liver biopsy is the gold standard to assess fibrosis/cirrhosis in HBV patients objectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Antiviral therapy should be applied to HBV patients with a Knodell Histology Activity Index 2 4 or moderate/severe necroinflammation and/or fibrosis with a normal ALT level 通用删除6(英):<u>[20，21]</u>. We observed that， in HBV-infected patients with a normal ALT level， the progression of inflammation and fibrosis could not be determined by hepatic biochemical indices(ALT， AST， albumin， globulin， A/G ratio)， imaging (PVW， spleen thickness) and other characteristics (e.g.， age) alone. These data suggest that we should reconsider the guiding role of the ALT level删除1换行for starting antiviral therapy in HBV patients. We also under took evaluation by non-invasive methods， such as the APRI and FIB-4Score. These are recommended by the World Health Organization as non-invasive evaluations of inflammation and fibrosis of the liver. However， these two indices are not applicable to HBV-infected patients with a normal ALTlevel. We noted a significant difference in the platelet count between patients with fibrosis stage <2 and patients with fibrosis stage 2 2. Hence， fibrosis progression in HBV-infected patients with a normal ALT level was inversely proportional to the number of platelets. Hence， although the ALT was normal in HBV-infected patients， inflammation and advanced fibrosis may be present in the liver. Patients with advanced liver fibrosis require antiviral therapy regardless of ALT status 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，20，27]</u>. Early antiviral therapy in these patients could also achieve a greater immune response 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>. Our results suggest that HBV-infected patients with a normal ALT level may also have significant hepatic pathological changes and a high risk of liver cancer or death.\n\n【50】Thrombocytopenia has been observed in 76% to 85% of patients with advanced liver disease. Thrombocytopenia is secondary to hypersplenism， possible immune-mediated mechanisms， direct viral suppression of platelet production， and reduced production of thrombopoietin 通用删除6(英):<u>[29，30]</u>. Thrombocytopenia in individuals with chronic liver disease is associated with portal venous pressure and hypersplenism. The platelet number is influenced by many factors， whereas the portal-vein width and spleen thickness are mainly associated with portal hypertension during liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. We combined the platelet count with the portal-vein width and spleen thickness into the PPR and PSR. The PPR and PSR could be used to predict advanced fibrosis among HBV-infected patients with HBeAg-negativity and a normal ALT level. We calculated the sensitivity of the PPR and PSR to be 0.917 and 0.833， respectively， where as the specificity of the PPR and PSR was only 0.525 and 0.541， respectively. Such low specificity may be related to the many factors influencing thrombocytopenia， as well as having a small study cohort.\n\n【51】We demonstrated that patients with advanced fibrosis had a lower PPR and PSR. Further subgroup analysis showed that the PPR and PSR tended to decline gradually (but significantly) with fibrosis progression. Therefore， the PPR and PSR could reflect the stages of advanced fibrosis among HBV-infected patients with HBeAg-negativity and a normal ALT level. Using the PPR and PSR might provide better predictive accuracy than using the ALT level alone(especially for determining who needs a liver biopsy). Liver biopsy is invasive， so timely and accurate assessment of the need for early liver biopsy is extremely important to detect advanced liver fibrosis. Greater efforts should be made to explore more non-invasive methods to enable accurate judgment of disease progression for patients with a normal ALTlevel.\n\n【52】Conclusion\n\n【53】Our study revealed the value of using the PPR and PSR for predicting advanced fibrosis among patients with HBV infection with HBeAg-negativity and a normal ALT level. The PPR and PSR could help to screen patients who need a liver biopsy in a timely manner.\n\n【54】Limitations\n\n【55】Our study had three main limitations. First， the study cohort was small， which hampered the robustness of statistical analyses. The small sample size was because liver biopsy is invasive and many patients refuse it. Second， our cohort may be not representative of all\n\n【56】HBV-infected patients. Third， we excluded HBeAg-positive patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The coracoid process is the hub of the shoulder joint， which gradually attracts attention in the diagnosis and treatment of acromioclavicular joint dislocation. A 65-year-old woman suffered a car accident injury with painful left shoulder and restricted restriction for 2 days. Preoperative X-ray and computed tomography revealed dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint with coracoid fracture. According to the anatomical characteristics of the acromioclavicular joint， we used an suitable surgical approach to the anterior shoulder. The postoperative X-ray showed good reduction of the acromioclavicular joint， stable fixation and good fixation of the coracoid. At the 3-month follow-up， the patient reported relief of his symptoms. The incidence of acromioclavicular joint dislocation combined with coracoid fracture is low and the management is complicated. Understanding the anatomical and biomechanical properties (especially the mechanical characteristics of the coracoclavicular joint and the shoulder during injury) is crucial to successful surgery and avoiding intraoperative complications.\n\n【2】Keywords： Acromioclavicular joint； Coracoid fracture； Case report\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The acromioclavicular joint is the fulcrum of the scapular suspension complex； the acromioclavicular joint can increase the range of shoulder abduction and upper lifting movement within a certain range； at the same time， the subacromial articular surface and the intact acromioclavicular ligament structure are the anatomical basis for maintaining stability above the glenohumeral join； the stabilization of the acromioclavicular joint in the vertical direction relies more by the cubic ligament and cone ligaments from the base of the coracoid； based on the anatomical and biomechanical basis of the acromioclavicular joint， shoulder trauma is easy to involve the acromioclavicular joint 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. According to statistics， acromioclavicular joint dislocation accounts for 12% of the whole shoulder dislocation and 8% of the joint dislocation of the body 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Simple coracoid fracture， accounting for 3%~13% of the whole scapular fracture， is easy to miss diagnosis clinically. The coracoid is not only a hub for the scapular complex suspension， but also an attachment point for the combined tendon， so most coracoid fractures are mostly combined with peri-acromioclavicular joint injuries. Despite the low incidence of acromioclavicular dislocation with coracoid fracture， the impact on patients is greater and the management is complex 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>.We report a case with dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint with coracoid fracture.

The X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) revealed a dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint combined with a coracoid fracture . Physical examination showed swelling of the left shoulder with no significant local skin damage； surface tenderness of the acromioclavicular joint， key (+)， Dugas of the left shoulder 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>， Left shoulder arm stamp sign 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>. According to the patient s condition， we make the surgical plan：1. Use open reduction and intramural screw fixation management of coracoid fracture and dislocation of particular joint；2. Clavicular hook plate internal fixation； 3. Calcified ligament anchor repair.\n\n【7】After the patient received anesthesia， the supine position with right deviation of the head.\n\n【8】acromioclavicular joint with coracoid fracture.\n\nAfter accurate positioning ， we oblique cut the skin and subcutaneous tissue at the outer margin of the coracoid along the deltoid/pectoralis major muscle space； separate the thoracic fascia along the muscle space and expose the coracoid， trapezius ligament， and conical ligaments. A fracture touching the coracoid base along the coracoid \"knee\" (The bodyturns the body to the base). Continued exploration revealed good integrity of the orthorhombic ligament and conical ligaments； above-mentioned ligament laxity was seen in the lower pressure acromioclavicular joint. The coracoid was reset with a fingertip， and along the finger direction， a 2.0 mm Kirschner wire was inserted from the tip of the coracoid \"knee\" to the base (keep the Kirschner wire direction perpendicular to the fracture surface)； push test tested good coracoid reduction stability. Confirm Kirschner wire position and reset with X-ray； use a 3.5 mm x36 mm hollow screw was drilled along the Kirschner wire to fix the coracoid process. At the distal part of the clavicle， the skin and subcutaneous tissue were cut layer by layer， and we found a tear of the acromioclavicular ligament； the \"joint disc\" is damaged in the joint space， and the joint is dislocated . Clean the soft tissue around the joint and try to down press the acromioclavicular joint to confirm that the joint can be reduced. Select the distal clavicle hook plate (5 wells with15 mm cut) and insert the clavicle hook into the acromioclavicular joint space； adjust the plate proximal orientation and secure with a Kirch clamp. Passive movement of the shoulder joint to ensure good reduction of the acromioclavicular joint and stable fixation； coracoid is well fixed. Suitable length screws selected near and far. The wound was rinsed after surgery. The belt line anchor repaired the acromioclavicular ligament and joint capsule， stitched layer by layer， and properly bandaged and fixed. Later the patient was left to shoulder abduction 45 and fixed for 3 weeks. And guide the deltoid muscle isometric contraction， elbow， wrist joint flexion and extension activities. After 3 weeks， the active outreach，adduction and pendulum movement gradually began under the protection. The postoperative X-ray showed good fracture reduction， the patient recovered well and|删除段之间换行|complete resolution of preoperative symptoms .\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】The acromioclavicular joint is the fulcrum of the scapular suspension complex suspended on the trunk. In theprocess of shoulder abduction， upper lifting and forward flexion， the acromioclavicular joint can adjust the dynamic position of the scapula through muscle movement， so as to maintain the stability of the whole shoulder joint. The stability of acromioclavicular joint can be divided into dynamic stability and static stability. The coracoclavicular ligament composed of the conical and trapezius ligaments forms the core of the static stable structure of the acromioclavicular joint 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. Their coordination with an intact coracoid structure can limit the acromioclavicular movement. If the coracoid structure is damaged， the acromioclavicular joint will lose its stability. Patients will experience shoulder ringing， pain， and limited movement 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>.\n\nThe main mechanism of acromioclavicular joint injury is the extreme adduction of the shoulder when touching the ground， while the clavicle maintains a normal anatomical position due to the interlocking of the sternoclavicularligament； at this point，the scapula adducts， the acromion and coracoid displaced below， resulting in Coracoclavicular ligament， acromioclavicular ligament and other tears. At this time， the acromioclavicular joint may have different degrees of damage from relaxation to tear. The coracoid fracture is mostly caused by strong elbow flexion of patients and short head pull ofbiceps muscles after injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[11-13]</u>. We believe that this patient had further internal rotation and adduction during the collapse， impacted the coracoid process，and a strong elbow pulling caused simultaneous injury of the ligament and coracoid process in the final patient|删除段之间换行|For the simple acromioclavicular joint dislocation， we applied the distal clavicle hook plate fixation. This mode of fixation has yielded beneficial results in the vast majority of patients with acromioclavicular dislocation. However， due to its mechanical stimulation， the hook plate may lead to subacromial impact， acromial dissolution， and even acromial fracture and osteoarthritis complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Here， we attempt to utilize an elastic-fixation scheme. Elastic fixation of the parenchyma is mimicking the action of the coracoclavicular ligament. Stability of the acromioclavicular joint using nonabsorbable sutures. Elastic fixation is more in line with shoulder biomechanics than rigid fixation and hardly causes secondary acromioclavicular joint impingement. However， elastic fixation requires a complete \"anchor point\"of the coracoid， which is why elastic fixation was not considered in this patient.\n\n【13】For coracoid fractures， the purpose of surgery is to restore its stability and provide the basis for reattachment of the coracoid ligament. Due to its special anatomical structure and rare incidence of disease， this fracture is prone to miss diagnosis. For patients with periarticular injuries， clear preoperative shoulder CT thin scans can have an importantimpact on our clinical decision making. For coracis base fractures (Eyres-IV)，according to the principle of AO fixation， it can basically solve this problem. During the operation， more attention is paid to the direction of the screws and the protection of the surrounding important structures.\n\n【14】Intraoperative ligament reconstruction， especially double-bundle anatomical reconstruction， is more conducive to restore physiological structures. But look from the following two aspects， still have its drawbacks： 1. Increased operative time and surgical trauma. Precise positioning， the selection and preparation of autologous tendons have increased the surgical steps. 2. In addition， for doctors with little experience， during the tunnel preparation process and early after surgery， the artificial destruction of local bone structure resulted in the risk of clavicle and coracoid fracture during surgery or rehabilitation.\n\n【15】Whether it is dislocation or coracis fracture， the purpose of surgery is to restore the shoulder function as early as possible and prevent traumatic arthritis and joint stiffness. We believe that 3weeks after surgery is mainly detumescence to improve the local inflammatory response and pain. External booth fixation can avoid prolonged adduction of joint capsule contracture. This stage needs to emphasize the recovery of the elbow and wrist joint flexibility. After 3 weeks， the cartilage scab at the fracture end has formed an initial coverage， and the passive joint stretching and active muscle contraction under protection can gradually stimulate the recovery of the function of various tissues around the shoulder joint.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】Dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint with coracoid fracture is rare. Our study highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis and preoperative assessment of anatomical structures. In normal circumstances， choosing a suitable surgical method can avoid most postoperative complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We devised New Short-term Intensive Insulin Therapy (N-SIIT) to avoid hypoglycemia and mitigate glucotoxicity and Insulin Resistance (IR). Here， we show a newly diagnosed diabetic subject with COVID-19 who was efficiently treated using N-SIIT. A 43-year-old male was hospitalized due to high fever， wet cough and loss of taste and smell. SARS-CoV-2was positive in PCR test. Chest CT image showed pneumonia. Immediately， we started N-SIIT， but pneumonia drastically aggravated on day 3. However， by continuing N-SIIT， clinical data were improved， and various symptoms disappeared on day 8. The required insulin dose was decreased and finaly replaced by oral diabetes agents. He was discharged on day 13 under stable conditions. Pulmonary infiltration in the chest CT completely disappeared. We did not use anyantiviral medicine or steroids， but COVIT-19 was cured by N-SIIT. Indeed， N-SIIT mitigated hyperglycemic adverse effects， leading to reduction of inflammatory cytokines and decrease of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressions which is known to act as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. We also assume that the mitigation of glucotoxicity and IR might have revived his own healthy metabolism and immune response. It is necessary to perform further clinical trials with a large number of subjects to establish practical therapeutic strategies.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection represents a worldwide health crisis causing severe illness and death 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-2]</u>. Although COVID-19 has a broad spectrum of severity ranging from asymptomatic conditions to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)， a great risk of severe COVID-19 has been reported in patients with old age， obesity， diabetes and hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-6]</u>. Many reports have shown that patients with such risk factors and COVID-19suffer from synergistic aggravation of both diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-10]</u>. In particular， the mortality of COVID-19was higher in newly diagnosed diabetes subjects than in non-diabetic or preexisting diabetes subjects通用删除6(英):<u>[11-14]</u>. It is possible that the virus enters pancreatic beta-cells via the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor， injures beta-cells and induces Insulin Resistance (IR)，leading to the onset of diabetes mellitus or the aggravation of pre-existing diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>[15-18]</u>. Early glycemic control may be an important therapeutic strategy to reduce poor outcomes in hyperglycemic COVID-19patients. Insulin is a safe choice under poor glycemic situations and is considered the first-line treatment in hyperglycemic and critically weakened patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[19-20]</u>. Although insulin therapy sometimes brings about hypoglycemia， insulin can substantially mitigate beta-cell glucotoxicity and IR in a relatively short period of time， which likely leads to the improvement of abnormal metabolism and lowered immune activity in each patient. Here， we show a newly diagnosed diabetic subject with COVID-19 who we efficiently treated using New Short-Term Intensive Insulin Therapy(N-SIIT) 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>， which is a basal-bolus insulin injection therapy based on the concept of “treat to target\"to avoid hypoglycemia and eliminate glucotoxicity and IR.\n\n【4】Methods\n\n【5】We used New Short-Term Intensive Insulin Therapy(N-SIIT) based on the concept of “treat to删除1换行target\"通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. This is different from conventional basal-bolus injection通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. In brief， 40% of the initial total daily dose of insulin (0.4 units/kg to 0.6 units/kg) was delivered with glargine U300 before dinner as basal insulin， and 20% was applied with Lyumjev before each meal as a bolus injection. On the following day， insulin dose was titrated according to the latest blood glucose level based on the concept of“treat to target”. The relationship between insulin and glucose levels is as follows： Lyumjev before breakfast reduces elevated blood glucose levels after breakfast and determines blood glucoselevels before lunch. Similarly， Lyumjev before lunch and dinner determines blood glucose levels before dinner and bed time， respectively. Basal insulin glargine U300 before dinner determines fasting blood glucose level on the next morning. Through the above relation， titration of four insulin injections reduces blood glucose levels down to the“target\"glucose range (90 mg/dl to 140 mg/dl). When the pre-meal blood glucose level was less than 90 mg/dl， the insulin dose was reduced by 2 units the next day to avoid hypoglycemia. To perform it more efficiently， we optionally injected 2 to 3 units of Lyumjev as additional pre-meal insulin at that time， only when the blood glucose level 2 h after a meal was over 200 mg/dl. Capillary blood glucose measurement and insulin injection were performed using capillary blood measurement devices and pen-type insulin injectors. Doctor or nurse gave instruction about insulin amount to each patient. Statistical analyses were performed using a nonparametric method(n=7). Wilcoxon’s signed rank tests were applied for comparison of the data. In the comparison of three groups，p values were adjusted by Bonferroni-Holm's calculation formula.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】Here， we present the case of a 43-year-old Japanese male patient admitted to our hospital due to three days of a high body temperature of 39.0°℃ and wet cough with blood-tinged sputum， shortness of breath， headache， sore throat， and loss of taste and smell. He had no symptoms or history of diabetes before this episode， but his mother and maternal aunt had diabetes mellitus. He was a non-smoker and删除1换行social drinker. On admission， his height， body weight and BMI were175 cm， 95 kg and 31.0 kg/m’respectively. Although the patient had several symptoms as described above， his consciousness was clear， and he actively communicated with other people. There were no abnormalities or abnormal sounds in the heart， and respiration was smooth with a small crackle on auscultation. He had occasional nausea but had enough appetite to eat meals regularly. Initial vital signs were as follows： Body temperature， 39.0°℃； blood pressure，148/98 mmHg； heart rate， 82 beats/min； respiratory rate， 20/min； oxygen saturation on room air， 95%. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was increased up to 9.33 mg/dL， and chest CT images showed pneumonia with ground glass infiltration. SARS-CoV-2 was positive in PCR test. High CRP， ferritin， LDH and liver enzymes and low absolute lymphocyte counts were compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent cytokine storm. HbAlc and blood glucose levels were as high as 11.8% and 337 mg/dL， respectively. C-peptide was high (5.59 ng/mL)， and anti-GAD antibody was negative. Such high HbAlc， blood glucose and C-peptide indicated that this subject had hyperglycemic crisis with IR. To obtain good glycemic control， we started N-SIIT immediately after admission. As shown in Table 1and Figure 1， the injected insulin dose was increased step by step， but blood glucose levels were not decreased for several days (from day 2 to day 4). After day 5， however， blood glucose levels started to decrease significantly with the same dose of insulin (136 units/day). In addition， after day 9， the insulin dose was considerably reduced， but blood glucose levels were not increased. These findings clearly indicate the mitigation of glucotoxicity and IR， as reported previously通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Lab data were improved， and several symptoms subsided by day 8 without bringing about hypoglycemia . Various symptoms， such as loss of smell and taste and cough， subsided， and finally， fever and bloody sputum disappeared on day 8. C-peptide on day 9 was lowered presumably by a feedback mechanism due to adequate insulin injection for beta-cell rest . Then， insulin was replaced by empagliflozin 10 mg/day on day 8， voglibose 0.6mg/day and mitiglinide 30 mg/day on day 9 and linagliptin 5 mg/\n\n| Hospital days  | 1  |  | 2  |  | 3  |  | 4  |  | 5  |  | 6  |  | 7  |  | 8  |  | 9  |  |  | 10  |  | 11  |  | 12  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Before breakfast  |  |  | 258  |  | 219  |  | 209  |  | 212  |  | 198  |  | 158  |  | 147  |  | 148  |  |  | 135  |  | 111  |  | 118  |  |\n| 2 hafter breakfast  |  |  | 282  |  | 352  |  | 216  |  | 266  |  | 250  |  | 154  |  | 173  |  | 114  |  |  | 190  |  | 156  |  | 188  |  |\n| Before lunch  |  |  | 199  |  | 275  |  | 252  |  | 308  |  | 292  |  | 207  |  | 187  |  | 96  |  |  | 138  |  | 125  |  | 155  |  |\n| 2 h after lunch  |  |  | 339  |  | 247  |  | 315  |  | 310  |  | 166  |  | 157  |  | 176  |  | 157  |  |  | 151  |  | 161  |  | 118  |  |\n| Before dinner  | 359  |  | 207  |  | 216  |  | 213  |  | 162  |  | 122  |  | 136  |  | 131  |  | 161  |  |  | 109  |  | 117  |  | 120  |  |\n| 2 h after dinner  | 410  |  | 276  |  | 288  |  | 264  |  | 284  |  | 232  |  | 217  |  | 168  |  | 194  |  |  | 192  |  | 170  |  | 176  |  |\n| Before bed time  | 307  |  | 251  |  | 281  |  | 287  |  | 234  |  | 235  |  | 212  |  | 179  |  | 129  |  |  | 108  |  | 145  |  | 147  |  |\n| Plan， Additional  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  |  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  |\n| Lyumjev breakfast  |  |  | 10  | 2  | 16  | 3  | 20  | 2  | 24  | 3  | 29  | 3  | 30  | 0  | 30  | 0  |  | 30  | 0  | 15  | 2  | 8  | 0  | 3  | 0  |\n| Lyumjev lunch  |  |  | 10  | 3  | 16  | 2  | 20  | 3  | 25  | 3  | 30  | 0  | 30  | 删除8:<u>门 </u> | 30  |  |  | 30  | 0  | 15  | 删除8:<u>门 </u> | 8  | 0  | 3  | 删除8:<u>门 </u> |\n| Lyumjev dinner  | 10  | 2  | 14  | 2  | 16  | 2  | 20  | 4  | 26  | 3  | 30  | 2  | 30  |  | 30  |  |  | 30  | 0  | 15  | 0  | 8  | 0  | 3  | 0  |\n| glargine-U300  | 20  |  | 24  |  | 28  |  | 32  |  | 38  |  | 42  |  | 46  |  | 46  |  | 46  |  |  | 20  |  | 10  |  | 10  |  |\n| Total  | 32  |  | 61  |  | 75  |  | 101  |  | 122  |  | 136  |  | 136  |  | 136  |  | 136  |  |  | 67  |  | 34  |  | 19  |  |\n\n【9】Lyumjev： New ultra-rapid-acting insulin (insulin lispro-aabc) (units)； Pla： Planned insulin dosage， Add： Additional insulin injection.

We started insulin therapy with 10 units of lyumjev before each meal and 20units of glargine U300 before dinner and adjusted as follows. For example， since blood glucose level 2 h after dinner was 410 mg/dl which was higher than 200 mg/dl，2 units of lyumjev was optionally injected at that time. Also， blood glucose level before bed time was 307 mg/dl which was higher than 140 mg/dl， we added 2 units of lyumjev and planned 14 (10+2+2)units for day 2.\n\n【10】Table 2： Time course of various clinical parameters in this subject.\n\n|  | normal range  | day 1  | day 3  | day 9  | day 21  | day 91  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| V-GTP  | 13-64U/L  | 157  |  | 143  | 69  | 78  |\n| AST  | 1.3-30U/L  | 57  | 61  | 42  | 31  | 30  |\n| ALT  | 1.0-42U/L  | 79  | 69  | 76  | 53  | 47  |\n| LDH  | 124-222 U/L  |  | 342  | 255  | 165  |  |\n| Feritin  | 25.0-280.0 ng/ml  | 938  | 955  |  | 651  |  |\n| C-peptide  | 0.61-2.06 ng/ml  | 5.59  |  | 1.21  | 6.2  |  |\n| CRP  | 0.00-0.14 mg/dl  | 9.33  | 7.76  | 1.11  | 0.24  | 0.68  |\n| HbA1c  | 4.9-6.0%  | 11.8  |  |  | 10.1  | 7.2  |\n| Glucose  | 70-126 mg/dl  | 337  | 126  | 88  | 148  | 146  |\n| Absolute lympho  | 1，500-4，000/pl  | 930  | 770  | 1，822  | 1.586  | 1.500  |\n| Fibrinogen  | 200-400 mg/dl  |  | 482  |  |  |  |\n| D-dimer  | <1.0 pg/ml  | 0.3  | 0.2  |  |  |  |\n\n【12】V-GTP：y -Glutamyl Transpeptidase， AST： Aspartate Aminotransferase， ALT： Alanine Aminotransferase， LDH： Lactate Dehydrogenase， CRP： C-Reactive Protein； Absolute lympho： Absolute Lymphocyte\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】We accepted this patient as an emergency case impending the severe stage of COVID-19 or diabetic ketoacidosis because of typical symptoms， laboratory results and aggravating pneumonia . On admission， the patient was classified in phase 2A 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. In this phase， it is possible that worsening of the cytokine storm leads to irreversible phase 2B and phase 3. It is well known that intensive insulin therapy is very important in critically weakened patients with diabetes and COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，9，22，23]</u>. On the other hand， to reduce cytokine storms， steroid therapy is often performed in COVID-19 patients. However， it is also known that systemic corticosteroid therapy induces hyperglycemia， primarily by increasing postprandial blood glucose levels， IR and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and that steroid therapy weakens immunity to infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Therefore， we have to be very careful when we start steroid therapy in patients with poorly controlled diabetes and COVID-19. In this subject， to interrupt the vicious cycle of diabetes and COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>， we performed N-SIIT 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> to relieve glucotoxicity and IR rather than steroid therapy to subside the cytokine storm. Hyperglycemia promotes the production of inflammatory cytokines 通用删除6(英):<u>[25，26]</u> and increases the expression of ACE-2 通用删除6(英):<u>[27，28]</u>. Increased ACE-2 acts as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2and the dominant path of virus entry into various cells. We believe that N-SIIT reduces hyperglycemia stepwise into the glucose target range， attenuating cytokine storms and viral entry into cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely associated with a rapid increase in the required insulin dose， namely due to increased levels of inflammatory cytokines 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. In this patient， the insulin dose was increased up to 136units per day. Then， blood glucose levels were decreased to less than180 ng/dl and glucotoxicity was eliminated. As shown in Figure 1， blood glucose levels were decreased with the same dosage of insulin for 4 days (days 6 to 9)， indicating the mitigation of IR as reported previously 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Then， insulin therapy was replaced by oral agents，but blood glucose levels were not increased， indicating that this patient was substantially relieved from glucotoxicity and IR 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. During the period of N-SIIT， various symptoms subsided， and laboratory data improved . We did not treat him with antiviral medicine or steroid hormone， but COVID-19 was cured after N-SIIT. Since\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Newly diagnosed diabetes and poorly controlled diabetes are risk factors of COVID-19 infection. Previously we devised a New Short-term Intensive Insulin Therapy (N-SIIT) on the concept of“Treat to Target\"to avoid hypoglycemia and to converge adequate insulin dosage for the patient’s individual pathophysiology. We successfully treated a case of newly diagnosed diabetes impending to severe stage using N-SIIT. Without steroid therapy N-SIIT exerted favorable effects in the patient with COVID-19 infection. Although hyperglycemia induced cytokine storm， N-SIIT efficiently treated hyperglycemia and led to subside cytokine storm. Therefore， we think that it is very important to treat risk factors of COVID-19 such as hyperglycemia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It was first described by Armstrong-Jones in 1920通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The term exploding head syndrome was coined by Pearce in 1989 in a paper in which he described 40 patients with EHS 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. It is thought to be a migrainous phenomenon 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，6]</u>. There have been different descriptions of the noise which include the sound of an explosion， gunshot， door slamming， roar， waves crashingagainst rocks， loud voices， a ringing noise， a terrific bang on a tin tray， or the sound of an electrical buzzing. In some cases， an instant flash of what is perceived as video ‘static is reported both audibly and visually for a fraction of a second 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，7]</u>. It arises from the transition between different sleep stages and disappears completely when awake， although it may recur on further sleep attempts 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. There is no actual dW headache or persistent pain， but some patients may experience a brief， mild jab-like sensation.\n\n【10】Although EHS has been reported in patients as young as 10 years， the age of onset is usually after age 50 and the condition has a slight female preponderance. The attacks occur with variable frequency for a few weeks or months. Attacks can be one-time events or can recur with attacks删除1换行increasing or decreasing over time， sometimes with no incidents over long periods of time 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，7，8]</u>. The cause of EHS is unknown；however some possibilities include a sudden movement of a middle ear component or the Eustachian tube， or a brief temporal lobe complex partial seizure 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. It may be related to emotional tenseness， as some patients report a stressful life situation in periods when attacks were intense and frequent 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.

They are located between the muscular layers of the abdominal wall and can be easily overlooked because of abdominal obesity. Generally， they are difficult to diagnose because of their location and vague symptoms. The diagnosis has been considerably aided by the introduction ofultrasonography and Computed Tomography. Once the diagnosis is made operative management is indicated due to risk of incarceration. We report a 32 years old female patient from who presented with right upper abdominal pain associated with a swelling below the right subcostal margin. A diagnosis of Spigelian hernia and gallbladder stones was made. The patient underwentlaparoscopic mesh repair and cholecystectomy. Her recovery was uneventful.\n\n【2】Keywords： Spigelian hernia； Lateral ventral hernias； Laparoscopic mesh repair\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Spigelian hernia is named after Adrian Van der Spighel who described semilunar like(lineaspigeli) in 1645. The hernia was first described Klinkosch in 1764 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Spigelian hernia is a rare abdominal hernia， occurring through the spigelianaponeurosis， it carries a significant risk of incarceration and strangulation. Most spigelian hernias occur below the level of the umbilicus close to the level of the arcuate line (inferior margin of posterior leaflet of rectus sheath within the abdomen)，though they have being reported to occur above the level of the umbilicus 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【5】Diagnosis of Spigelian hernia requires a high degree of suspicion， with the most common finding on clinical examination being a lump at the semilunar line. Radiological tests are useful in confirming the diagnosis. Once diagnosed， Spigelian hernias require operative repair. Elective repair of uncomplicated Spigelian hernias can be performed both laparoscopically and by an open technique， with the former reported to be associated with a lower morbidity and shorter hospital stay 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. We present a case of spigelian hernia in a female patient and its management and discuss about the various investigations and the treatment modalities available for its repair， with literature review.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 32 years old female patient presented to the outpatient department with history of intermittent right upper quadrant pain for 8 years. She underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy 2 years ago. On examination， she had a weight of 89 kg with a BMI of 33 kg/m. Physical examination revealed a firm lump of about 6 x 5 cm was found on the right upper abdomen at the margin of the right semilunar line. The lump would increase on coughing and decrease in lying position.\n\n【8】On investigation， haemogram， liver function tests， blood urea and creatinine were normal. Ultrasonography showed multiple gall stones and right hypochondrium anterior abdominal wall defect . CT scan showed the defect of a Spigelian hernia about 3 cm in diameter， containing omentum .\n\n【9】After adequate preparation she was planned for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Intraoperatively， right sided SH was detected. There was also hemangioma on the lower part of the right lobe. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was done and the hernia was managed laparoscopically. Omentum adherent to the defect was reduced. The defect was seen as a large opening in the peritoneum， along the lateral margin of rectus abdomens muscle on the right side . After dissection of the adhesions with the help of Harmonic scalpel，a prosthetic composite mesh (10x10cm) was introduced into the peritoneal cavity and was fixed with the help of tacks to cover the defect. A full laparoscopic exploration of the abdomen was completed without finding other defects. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 2.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Spigelian hernia constitute about 0.12 to 0.2% of all abdominal hernias usually found between 50-60 years， affecting both sides and both sexes equally 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In 2002， Morenao Egea et al， did a medline search and found that there were only 497 cases of spigelian hernia reported in the literature till that date 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Most of the Spigelian hernia occurs in the lower abdomen where posterior sheath is deficient. SH most commonly presents at the level of the semicircular line(arcuate line of Douglas). Below this line， the Spigelianaponeurosis is a single layer and resistant to hernination. However， at the level of the semicircular line， the fascias of the oblique and transverse muscles begin to split， to allow the formation of two separatelayers. It is at this juncture， that the layers of aponeuroses are at their weakest.\n\n【12】The overlying external oblique muscle and fascia remains intact， contributing to the difficulty in diagnosis of this partial abdominal wall hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. In our case， the defect was located in the upper part of the semicircular line and this is a rare entity.\n\n【13】The hernia sac usually contains the greater omentum. However， involvement of other organs has been reported， including the small intestine， colon， stomach， gallbladder， Meckels diverticulum， appendix， ovaries and testes 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Clinical symptoms of SH are not characteristic and the preoperative diagnosis is often difficult. Given the rarity of Spigelian defects and lack ofpersonal clinical experience， the diagnosis often remains elusive for years with only half of cases are diagnosed preoperatively. The most common diseases that mimic Spigelian hernia include rectus sheath hematoma， abdominal wall abscess and seroma. Incisional hernias through the spigelian fascia or line conventionally are not considered as spigelian hernia， though some authors have described them as spigelian hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Our case underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy， and the site of the defect was close to one of the ports， therefore diagnosis of port site hernia was considered initially. Intraoperatively， the port site of previous surgery was clearly seen away from the defect.\n\n【14】Repair of this hernia has typically been accomplished with a transverse incision and primary repair. With the advent of mesh and laparoscopic techniques， other options now exist. In 1992， Carter published the first laparoscopic correction 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Nowadays， laparoscopic hernia repair， with either trans-peritonealor total extra-peritoneal approach is recommended for patients with SH. The advantage of intra-peritoneal laparoscopic approach is that， it can be done at the same time with other surgical procedures， as clearly seen in our report. A mesh is fixed with either tacks or manual suturing. To prevent adhesions， presently there is composite mesh， which has both absorbable as well as non-absorbable components and costlier mesh can be used 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Laparoscopic repair offers advantage over open mesh repair， including reduced morbidity， shorter hospital stay， cosmetic and perhaps the lower recurrence rate.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】A high index of suspicion is required for accurate diagnosis. Radiographic studies may facilitate the diagnosis of such hernias， which ultimately require operative repair. This case illustrates the role of laparoscopy in the treatment of spigelian hernia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "38d4d5b8-3bbb-4327-82cd-fc82d88a84d3", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】We present the case of a 44-year-old woman who suffered an out of hospital cardiorespiratory arrest. After six direct current shocks and 10 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation she had return of spontaneous circulation and regained consciousness. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal left ventricular eiection fraction and a mildly dilated left atrium. The mitral valve was thickened with myxomatous degeneration (Barlow’s disease) and moderate regurgitation secondarytobileaflet prolapse. Cardiac catheterization showed no coronary artery disease while left ventriculography revealed a mildly dilated left ventricle with preserved systolic function and high-end diastolic pressures. Cardiac MRI revealed an enlarged left ventricle with Mitral Valve (MV) prolapse and moderate to severe Mitral Regurgitation (MR). There were no features suggestive of a specific cardiomyopathy other than her valvular heart disease. The patient had an uneventful hospitalization， received an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD)， and eventually had MV repair surgery. In this article we also review the literature regarding similar cases and record important data for the epidemiology of the disease and the important research that has been carried out in the identification of prognostic imaging factors and the genetic background of these patients. We emphasize once again that it is especially important to be able to timely identify patients with mitral regurgitation who are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death so that immediate and effective treatment can be offered.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】Patient presentation\n\n【4】A 44-year-old patient was transferred to the Accident and Emergency Department of Nicosia General Hospital after suffering an out of hospital cardiorespiratory arrest during anaerobic exercise at the gym. The patient reported weakness and dizziness before she lost consciousness. A bystander nurse initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Ventricular fibrillation was recorded as the initial rhythm upon connecting to an external defibrillator by the paramedics. After six direct current shocks， 10 min of CPR， the administration of 2 mg adrenaline IV and 300 mg amiodarone IV， the patient had Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) and regained consciousness， upon arrival at the emergency department. She reported a past medical history of mitral valve prolapse and migraines with occasional use of analgesics. She is an active tobacco smoker. She denied any history of chest discomfort，palpitations， and shortness of breath， nausea or vomiting， either at stress or at rest. There was no recent febrile illness， gastroenteritis， or rashes. She is a mother of 5 children and has 1 previous miscarriage. There is no family history of heart disease or sudden cardiac death. On clinical examination she was a febrile； heart rate was 88 beats per minute， blood pressure 122/77mmHg and had an oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Her cardiac examination revealed normal Sl and S2 with a mid-systolic click and a late systolic murmur best heard at the apex of the heart. There were normal breathing sounds， no peripheral edema， and normal peripheral pulses. Her neurologic examination was normal with GCS 15/15 and normal cranial nerve exam.\n\n【5】Initial work up删除1换行cited.\n\n【6】The Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm， normal axis with normal QRS and QTc intervals with infrequent ventricular ectopic beats. Shallow negative T waves were noted in lead III，\n\n【7】LV： Left Ventricle： LA： Left Atrium； Ao： Aortic Root删除1换行and biphasic T waves in lead aVF . Blood tests were normal with normal arterial blood gasses while her chest X-ray showed an increased cardiothoracic index. Inpatient Holter monitoring revealed a 2% burden of ventricular ectopy (singlets and couplets) of primarily a single morphology. A transthoracic cardiac ultrasound revealed an Ejection Fraction (EF) of 55% to 60%， a mildly dilated Left Atrium(LA)， normal Right Atrium (RA) and a normal trileaflet Aortic Valve(AV). The mitral valve was thickened with myxomatous degeneration(Barlow’s disease) and a moderate Mitral Valve Regurgitation (MR) with a predominately anteriorly directed jet. Moderate bileaflet prolapse was also present. There were only traces of Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR) with normal Right Ventricular Systolic Pressure(RVSP). No pericardial effusion was noted . Due to her presentation with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest， she had an emergency coronary angiogram which showed normal coronary tree anatomy and no coronary lesions of concern. Left ventriculography showed a mildly dilated ventricle with preserved systolic function and high-end diastolic pressures. There was an angiographically severe mitral valve regurgitation and a large left atrium .\n\n【8】Diagnosis and managemeni\n\n【9】Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography confirmed that moderate MR was present. The Regurgitant volume (Rvol) was30 ml with a vena contract a of 0.3 cm and Effective Regurgitant Orifice (ERO) of 20 mm. The mitral valve was myxomatous with bileaflet prolapse . For further evaluation of the MR， exercise treadmill testing was utilized using the standard Bruce protocol. The patient was exercised for 6 min achieving a maximum heart rate of 95 bpm， whist on b blocker therapy. There was normal\n\n【10】LV： Left Ventricle； LA： Left Atrium； Ao： Aortic Root； RA： Right Atrium； RV：Right Ventricle\n\n【11】Follow up\n\n【12】The patient had an uneventful hospitalization， and following a multidisciplinary heart team discussion， an ICD was implanted. The decision for this was based on the circumstances of her presentation\n\n【13】Genetic studies\n\n【14】The patient was genetically investigated with Next Generation Sequencing of a panel of 72 genes， which are known to be implicated in inherited cardiac conditions (not shown). Two variants were of particular nterest， which were further validated by Sanger sequencing. In the MYPN gene， exon 19， variant c.3793G>A， p.Ala1265Thr was detected. In Silico analysis shows it is extremely rare and classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) in the ClinVar database and likely pathogenic in the VarSome database. Importantly， a known pathogenic variant reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) affected the same amino acid residue， but substituting alanine with proline， in an Asian female patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. She was first diagnosed at age 28-yrs and was compound heterozygote for another variant in the second allele of the same gene， MYPN， thus suggesting recessive inheritance. A second variant in our patient was in the TMPO gene， exon 4， substituting aspartate with glycine，c.1970A>G， p.Asp657Gly. VarSome classifies it as of VUS， and mutation taster classifies it as a polymorphism. The mother of the patient carries only删除1换行mutation in the TMPO gene， and she is healthy at age 68-yrs. Three children of the patient， a son and daughter from a first marriage and a son from a second marriage， aged 22， 21 and 29-yrs respectively， have inherited both variants and are mainly healthy， with the 22-yo son manifesting mild mitral valve regurgitation. Two other sons， one from each marriage aged 23 and 27-yo，are healthy and have inherited neither of the variants. It is not easy to attribute causality to either of the two DNA variants， thus reiterating previous similar experience by many authors in this field. Reduced penetrance is certainly a likely explanation of the lack of obvious past family history. If only digenic inheritance is sufficient and necessary to produce a perceptible phenotype， might also explain this lack of past history， while the three children who by chance co-inherited both linked variants， may be at increased risk and require close clinical monitoring. Overall， the genetics findings， although not conclusive， might suggest that digenic inheritance is responsible for the phenotype， implicating genes previously linked to dilated cardiomyopathy， thus expanding the phenotypic spectrum of variants and mutations in these genes. An alternative to digenic inheritance might be that the variant in the MYPN gene is pathogenic and the variant in the TMPO gene acts more like a genetic modifier. A genetic modifier is a DNA variant with no effect on its own， but which could exacerbate or even precipitate the phenotype when co-inherited on the background of another condition 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【15】Alimitation of this work is the absence of unequivocal segregation of the phenotype with the genetic findings， which may be resolved in the future if one or more of the younger members develop pathognomonic clinical features，hopefully not a fatal cardiac arrest. The literature is not particularly helpful in further resolving the genetic uncertainty， as many genes have been shown to be mutated in patients with MVP while incomplete penetrance， or age-dependent penetrance， is the norm. More genes that may play a role either following Mendelian inheritance or following digenic inheritance are to be discovered through contemporary parallel sequencing of panels of genes or through whole exome and whole genome sequencing.\n\n【16】Revie w of the Literature\n\n【17】Definition of m itral valve prolapse\n\n【18】Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) is a valvular heart disease in which one (asymmetrical) or both (symmetrical) leaflets of the mitral valve are displaced more than 2 mm above the mitral annulus into the left atrium during systole. Because of the bulging into the left atrium the valve does not close tightly， causing variable degree of valve regurgitation. According to the thickness of the leaflets， MVP is classified as classic (>5 mm) and non-classic (<5 mm) MVP. Mitral valve prolapse is also known as click-murmur syndrome， Barlows syndrome， or floppy valve syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. During heart auscultation， a mid-systolic click， followed by a late systolic murmur is heard at the apex. The duration of the murmur is prolonged by standing and Valsalva maneuver and the systolic click is heard earlier.\n\n【19】Epidemiology of mitral valve prolapse and sudden cardiac death (SCD)\n\n【20】Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) affects 2% to 3% of the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Patients maypresent with a variety of clinical scenarios ranging from mild， nonspecific symptoms to decompensated heart failure， endocarditis， malignant arrhythmias， and sudden cardiac death. The incidence of SCD in patients with MVP in the general population has been calculated up to 0.3% to 0.4% yearly 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-8]</u>. MVP has been recognized in a recent study as the third most\n\n【21】Table 1： Variants detected.\n\n| Gene-Exon  | Mutation  | dbSNP  | MAF  | Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD)  |  | ClinVar  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MYPN (Exon 19)  | c.3793G>A， p.Ala1265Thr  | rs199476416  | 0.00000  | Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy， reported in female patient with c.3793G> C，p.Ala1265Pro  |  | Uncertain significance  |\n| TMPO (Exon 4)  | c.1970A>G. p.Asp657Gly  | No data  | No data  | Not founc  |  | No data  |\n\n【23】Table 2： Prediction.\n\n| Gene-Exon  | Mutation  | Varsome  |  | Mutation Taster  | SIFT  | Polyphen  | Grantham Score  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MYPN (Exon 19)  | c.3793G>A， p.Ala1265Thr  | Likely pathogenic  |  | Disease causing  | Tolerated (0.51)  | Probably damaging(1.0)  | 58.0  |\n| TMPO (Exon 4)  | c.1970A>G， p.Asp657GlyUncertain significance  |  |  | Polymorphism  | Tolerated (0.07)  | Benign (0.089)  | 94.0  |\n\n【25】common cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults <35 years(12%) following arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy(24%)，and coronary heart disease (20%) as leading causes 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. MVP is more frequent in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome， Marfan syndrome， Graves’ disease， and polycystic kidney disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>. Rheumatic heart disease， endocarditis and myocardial ischemia could also be causes of mitral valve prolapse. Barlow’s disease is the most prominent form of MVP characterized by myxomatous degeneration of the valve leaflets and increased calcification of the mitral annulus删除4-1:<u>4</u>.\n\n【26】Identifying patients with MVP at risk for SCD\n\n【27】Electrocardiographic findings： Patients with MVP often have a normal baseline ECG. However， in patients who had a cardiac arrest， the incidence of inverted or biphasic T waves in the inferolateralleads通用删除6(英):<u>[6，12]</u> was found to be increased.QT dispersion and QT prolongation have also been described. The presence of Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) originating from the Papillary Muscle (PM) or fascicular region has been well documented 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Arrhythmias arising from PMs in the left ventricle have right bundle branch morphology gY in lead V1. More specifically ventricular ectopic originating from the posteromedial PM has a superior axis， which is similar to left删除1换行posterior fascicular and or perimitral arrhythmias while ventricular ectopic arising from the anterolateral PM has an inferior axis similar to arrhythmias from the left anterior fascicle 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Notably a recent study showed how important it is to grade and categorize the burden of ventricular arrhythmia in these patients and presented that severe ventricular arrhythmia is associated with more adverse events. Patients with no VT and PVC frequency below median (<5%) were categorized in the“No/Trivial”group while patients with， PVCs above the median (5%) and/or with documented VT runs no faster than 120beats/min， with VT runs of 120 to 179 beats/min and with VT >180beats/min and/or proven history of VT/Ventricular Fibrillation (VF)， indicating a need for an ICD were categorized in \"Mild\"，“Moderate”and “Severe”groups respectively. In addition， in the same study the authors were able to gather the main prognostic factors that were directly correlated with the prognosis of these patients. The most important of these are Mitral Annular Disjunction (MAD)， leaflet redundancy and ST-T changes 通用删除1(英):<u>(T wave inversion and ST-depression)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. On the same line a recent study that describe the phenotype of forty-two patients with cardiac arrest has found that most patients had PVCs originated mainly from the posterior papillary muscles通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. MVP may cause alterations in the mechanical function of the删除1换行papillary muscles and the left ventricle in extent. This abnormal mechanical function has been associated as a trigger of malignant arrhythmias even in the absence of histological changes 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，17，18]</u>.\n\n【28】Echocardiography： The iise ofbothhtransthoracic and transesophageal examination is crucial to determine the disease severity. A detailed description of the mitral valve structure should include leaflet thickness or redundancy， annular dilatation， and chordal length. The presence of bileaflet prolapse has been associated with an increased rate of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，19]</u>. The severity of MR has not been associated with bad prognosis； however its quantification as well as any consequent structure anomalies such as LA dilatation，LV dysfunction，pulmonary flow reversal or pulmonary hypertension should be described. It is important to report that the presence of Mitral Annular Disjunction(MAD) found on echo examination in patients with MPV has been associated with increased prevalence of arrhythmic events. MAD is characterized by the abnormal positioning of the hinge point of the mitral valve away from the ventricular myocardium and has been appointed as an independent factor for the presence of ventricular arrhythmias 通用删除6(英):<u>[20-22]</u>. Accordingly， a study， summarizing findings from subjects of sudden cardiac death and mitral valve prolapse， showed increased prevalence of bileaflet prolapse， sub endocardial fibrosis and mitral annulus dilatation 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>.Importantly， a recent study has shown that mechanical dispersion identified by speckle tracking echocardiography was a strong predictor ofthe presence of malignant arrhythmias. Notably， this was independent of LV function， bileaflet valve prolapse and degree of MR 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>.\n\n【29】Cardiac MRI\n\n【30】The most prominent finding in patients with cardiac arrest and MVP is the presence of fibrosis ofthe papillary muscles and inferobasal segments of the left ventricle that was consistent with histological findings 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Consistent with the above researchers have recently reported that by using T1 mapping and late gadolinium enhancement half of the patients with MVP had a degree of papillary muscle fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. It is important to clarify that the absence of fibrosis is not a positive predictive variable since patients without fibrosis still suffer a sudden cardiac death. Probably this is since the fibrosis is a late finding in the disease process and other triggers of malignant arrhythmias are to be blamed. Interestingly a new study has come to support the above theory by demonstrating an undetected until now level of myocardial inflammation in patients with degenerative mitral valve prolapse by using a hybrid method of PET/MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>.\n\n【31】Genetics\n\n【32】The genes contribution in the development of MVP has been associated with both the syndromic as well as the non-syndromic aspect of the genetic spectrum. Trisomies of chromosome 18 (Edwards syndrome)， chromosome 13 (Patau syndrome) and chromosome 15are associated with MVP 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. In addition， patients with connective tissue diseases such as Marfan Syndrome (MFS)， Loeys-Dietz Syndrome (LDS)， Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS)， Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) Pseudoxanthoma elasticum， Osteogenesis imperfecta， Borrone dermato-cardio-skeletal syndrome， have been presented with variable degrees of MVP 通用删除6(英):<u>[27-31]</u>. Moreover， isolated non-syndromic familial forms of MVP have also been characterized. These forms are age and sex dependent as well as with different levels of age dependent and age-independent penetrance and phenotypic expression. Also， these forms are present with X-linked recessive inheritance 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> as well as autosomal dominant inheritance 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>.\n\n【33】MVP1，MMVP2 and MMVP3 loci in chromosomes 16， 11 and 13respectively are also associated with the presence of MVP 通用删除6(英):<u>[34-36]</u>.\n\n【34】A recent study in patients with Left Ventricular Non-Compaction(LVNC) and sinus node dysfunction who present with MVPhas found mutations in the FLNC gene that encodes for gamma flimin， a crucial protein interacting with act in filaments in the myocyte structure通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>. Genome-wide association studies have also been contacted. TNS1 gene (encodes tens in 1 which is an act in-binding protein) as well as LCMD1 gene (encodes a transcription factor repressor of GATA 6 which is an important regulator to atrioventricular valves development) are under study to identify their role in the expression ofMVP 通用删除6(英):<u>[38，39]</u>. Further studies are needed to identifythrough genetic analysis those in dividuals that are in increased risk of malignant MVP and SCD.\n\n【35】Treatment options\n\n【36】Optimal medical treatment including beta or calcium channel blocker therapy or more complex anti arrhythmic drugs， should be first line treatment in patients with MVP and documented malignant arrhythmias. More importantly the use of ICD therapy as secondary prevention has been related with better prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>. Furthermore， catheter ablations of PVCs found in patients with MVP have been shown to reduce ICD shocks 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. The ability of surgical correction to reduce ventricular arrhythmias has been controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>. One study reported a significant reduction in arrhythmic burden after mitral valve surgery， even in the absence of substantial mitral regurgitation 通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>. On the other hand， another study failed to show any reduction on the ventricular ectopic burden 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>. At the same time， both emphasize the importance of early surgical intervention for the timely and immediate treatment of possible mechanical and electrophysiological remodeling that the heart may undergo.\n\n【37】Conclusion\n\n【38】While various prognostic factors have been described， no one is sensitive enough to predict these arrhythmias. Overall， there is an increasing need for more studies that will address not only the causative factors leading to sudden cardiac death but also to establish an efficient risk stratification strategy to provide immediate solutions to our patients' problems. Perhaps the early identification of DNA variants that increase the genetic susceptibility to adverse outcomes might be an option， accompanied by closer clinical follow-up. The detection of such variants that demonstrate co-segregation in affected families is a strategy facilitated with contemporary Next Generation Sequencing Technologies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Therefore， this disease should be investigated and it is essential to perform Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) and High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) early in the course of the disease to make a definitive diagnosis. Nowadays，2-deoxy-2-[F]Fluoro-D-Glucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (2-[F]FDGPET/CT) canbe a useful tool for patients diagnosed with DM since， in addition to observing the state of inflammatory myopathy and detecting possible associated malignant tumors， it allows early identification of ILD， before structural changes occur. We present the case of a 45-year-old patient with a diagnosis of DM，who requested 2-[IF]FDG PET/CT to rule out possible occult neoplasia， showing pathological uptake of moderate intensity and peripheralpredominance in the posterior segments of both lower lobes that coincides with a very discrete increase in pulmonary interstitial density， which translates as an active inflammatory pathology， to rule out ILD. Given the findings on 2-[\"F]FDG PET/CT，it was decided to perform a HRCT showing pulmonary interstitial involvement with reticular pattern and ground glass， predominantly peripheral and basal， suggest ILD. PFTs showed a progressive drop in KCO (71%)， so， in view of these findings， ILD was diagnosed and immunosuppressive treatment was prescribed. A control CT was performed showing improvement of the interstitial involvement. Currently the patient is clinically asymptomatic， without PFR alteration (KCO 75%) and ILD radiology stability. In conclusion 2-[IF]FDG PET/CT can help in the early diagnosis， clinical course and treatment of ILD in patients with DM.\n\n【2】通用间距删除-1:<u>OPEN ACCESS</u>\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Dermatomyositis (DM) is included within the idiopathic in flammatory myopathies or idiopathic myositis which are characterized as a heterogeneous group of muscle diseases of unknown etiology that cause progressive onset of muscle weakness， inflammation and may cause systemic involvement.\n\n【5】Pulmonary involvement appears to be a common manifestation， the most frequent histological pattern being Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD). About 35% to 40% of patients will develop ILD throughout the course of their disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. ILD is known to be an important contributor to morbidity and mortality in these patients， with a 5-year survival rate of 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Therefore， due to the important effect that ILD has on mortality in patients with DM， this disease should be investigated， and it is essential to perform Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) at the beginning of the course of the disease， since they usually show reduced lung volumes， impaired gas transfer and hipoxemia， however， these tests may vary significantly as muscle strength improves with treatment，and High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【6】Nowadays， 2-deoxy-2-['F]Fluoro-D-Glucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (2-[IF]FDG PET/CT) can be a useful tool for patients diagnosed with DM， since， in addition to observing the state of inflammatory myopathy and detecting possible associated malignant tumors， it allows ILD to be identified early， before structural changes occur. In ILD，an increase in macrophages，lymphocytes and the release of cytokines such as TNF-aandIL-2has been described， which causes an increase in glycemic metabolism that， using F-FDG as a radiotracer， can be detected by PET/CT， obtaining early information on this pathology which is relatively frequent and which negatively influences the prognosis of these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】We present the case of a 45-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of DM， who attended a consultation for disease control. She did not refer respiratory symptoms. On physical examination basal saturation of 98%， without alteration when exploring the cardiopulmonary system. Laboratory tests within the normal range. Positive Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA). Chest X-ray without alterations. 2-[F]FDG PET/CT (July/2019) was requested to rule out possible occult neoplasm， showing pathological uptake of moderate intensity and peripheral predominance in the posterior segments of both lower lobes， coinciding with a very discrete increase in pulmonary interstitial density， which translates as an active inflammatory pathology， to rule out ILD .\n\n【9】Given the findings present on 2-[F]FDG PET/CT， it was decided to perform a HRCT (August/2019) of the chest and PFTs. HRCT showed pulmonary interstitial involvement with reticular pattern and groundglass， predominantlyperipheral and basal， suggest ILD . PFTs showed a progressive drop in KCO (71%)，so， in view of these findings， ILD was diagnosed and immunosuppressive treatment was prescribed. A control CT was performed (October/2020) showing improvement of the interstitial involvement. Currently the patient is clinically asymptomatic， with no alteration of PFTs (KCO 75%) and stable ILD radiology .\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】ILD occurs frequently in DM and is an important cause of mortality， being its early diagnosis paramount. However， early changes of asymptomatic ILD are difficult to detect.\n\n【12】Interestingly， PET/CT showed a moderate increase in 2-[ISF] FDG uptake in the periphery of thelung bases， before the detection of altered PFTs， suggesting active inflammatory disease. In addition， it was evidenced that once the HRCT was performed，thelocation of the increased uptake in [F]FDG PET/CT coincided with the location of the interstitial lung involvement seen in HRCT.\n\n【13】There is evidence in the literature that 2-[F]FDG PET/CT can aid in the early diagnosis of ILD prior to detection by HRCT 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> coinciding with the location of interstitial lung involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.

The patient was identified to have influenza-related acute hypoxic respiratory failure， and a workup was initiated in the intensive care unit with a differential diagnosis formulated. This case presentation breaks down the clinical decision-making process step by step and provides a detailed evidence-based description of the differential diagnosis. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) was identified and managed according to the current guidelines.\n\n【2】Conclusion： It’s important to recognize and manage acute respiratory distress symptoms as a complication of influenza using evidence-based medicine early as well as consider transferring to a tertiary care facility in a timely manner.\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】A 67 to 75-year-old female presented to the emergency department for three days with progressive cough，shortness of breath， weakness， nausea， and vomiting. The patient has had recent exposure to several sick contacts with influenza and verifies that she did not receive the vaccine this year. She denies fever， chills， and night sweats. Her medical history included diabetes and former cocaine use： Now on methadone maintenance. Her current medications include Lisinopril，Lantus， and Humalog. She has no significant family history of disease.\n\n【5】Initial Evaluation and Management\n\n【6】On admission， the temperature is 96.3°F (C)， heart rate 109 beats per minute， blood pressure152/80 mmHg， respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute， oxygen saturation 97% on room air， weight68 kg， and body mass index 26.4 kg/m.\n\n【7】Physical exam\n\n【8】The patient is in no acute distress on examination and is alert and oriented x 2 (name and place). She has no nasal discharge， sinus tenderness， pharyngeal erythema， or exudates but noted poor dentition and dry mucosa. No lymphadenopathy or jugular vein distention is observed. There is no accessory muscle use with wheezing/coarse lung sounds， bilaterally. The cardiac exam shows tachycardia， regular rate and rhythm， and normal S1/S2 with no murmur， rubs， or gallops. The abdomen is positive for bowel sounds， soft， non-tender， and non-distended.

ARDS accounts for ~10% to 15% of ICU admissions， is potentiallylife-threatening， occurs within seven days of a critical illness， and is characterized by bilateralpulmonary infiltrates and poor oxygenation. ARDS results from an immunologic response caused by an injured pulmonary lining， leading to increased alveolar-capillary permeability and subsequent hypoxia from the reduced gas exchange. CXR in this patient， after intubation， revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates not seen in the prior study. Distinguishing CXR findings for ARDS from cardiogenic pulmonary edema can pose a challenge. Still， helpful clues include pleural effusions， common in Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema (CPE) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>， and Kerley-B lines more frequently associated with CPE， although rarely seen in ARDS. ARDS radiography stabilizes in 36 h， whereas CPE will see improvement/删除2换行resolution with treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[31</u>.\n\n【21】CPE results from increased capillary pressure and endothelial permeability due to left or right ventricular heart failure， which can have an acute or gradual onset of respiratory distress 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Differentiating CPE from ARDS is very important for treatment， and it requires physical examination， laboratory data， echocardiogram and hemodynamic assessment. Physical examination often reveals inspiratory crackles/rales， neck vein distention， and peripheral edema 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， of which are not present in ARDS. Obtaining Plasma Brain-type Natriuretic (BNP) or N-Terminal BNP (NT-proBNP) greater than 100 pg/mL points to CPE but underlying medical issues such as COPD or renal dysfunction need to be considered well. Sick patients are more apt to have elevated BNP levels for reasons other than CPE 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. One can estimate left atrial pressure with point-of-care ultrasound， subsequently obtaining an indirect pulmonary capillary wedge pressure measurement which， if elevated， is indicative of CPE 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Sarcoidosis is an insidious disease and commonly seen CXR findings include bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy， also called Lofgren’s syndrome. Abnormal laboratory findings in Sarcoidosis include hypercalcemia， an elevated 1，25-dihydroxyvitamin D， alkaline phosphatase， serum Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme(ACE)， soluble Interleukin-2 Receptor (sIL-2R)， and glycoprotein KL-6 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. This patient’s CXR was absent of lymphadenopathy and laboratory results for hypercalcemia， 1，25-dihydroxyvitamin D， alkaline phosphatase， serum Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) are negative therefore， Sarcoidosis is less likely the diagnosis.\n\n【22】Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is fungal pneumonia more commonly seen in immunocompromised patients，particularly those with HIV/AIDS with a CD4 count <200 cell/mm³通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Typically， patients have respiratory symptoms for a few weeks before being evaluated and usually present with pleuritic chest pain， hypoxic/hypoxemia andpotentially mixed findings on lung examination，which could be normal， but if abnormal may mimic bronchial pneumonia on pulmonary exam and reveal rhonchi， crackles， or egophony 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. CXR shows fine reticular， perihilar interstitial changes， subpleural blebs， and small pneumatocele， mimicking findings in ARDS 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. This patient has no known underlying HIV/AIDS， autoimmune or cancer history， and HIV testing was negative.\n\n【23】Case Continued\n\n【24】The patient develops shock： IV fluid resuscitation， IV antibiotics， Tamiflu， and hemodynamic support with vasopressors are quickly started. A repeat CXR reveals new bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacities .\n\n【25】ARDS Classification\n\nWe define ARDSas pre-existing respiratoryillness for approximately one week with PaO，/Fio， ≤300mmHg in a|删除段之间换行|Table 2： Having previously diagnosed this patient with ARDS， how would you\n\n| Sodium  | 132 mmol/L  | 137-145 mmol/L  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Arterial blood pH  | 7.324  | 7.35-7.45  |\n| Partial pressure of carbon dioxide  | 23.6mmHa  | 32.0-45.0 mmHa  |\n| Partial pressure of Qxygen  | 51.0 mmHg (on room air)  | 83-108 mmHg  |\n| FIO，  | 100%  |  |\n| PEEP  | 15  |  |\n\n【28】ARDS is further classified based on PaO，/FiO， ratio and defines as\n\n【29】Mild ARDS (200<PaO，/FiO，≤300mmHg)\n\n【30】Moderate ARDS (100<PaO，/FiO，≤200mmHg)\n\n【31】Severe ARDS (PaO，/FiO，≤100 mmHg)\n\n【32】This patient has severe ARDS with a PaO/FiO. ratio of 51. The current Berlin definition expands on the validity of the mild， moderate， and severe stages of ARDS by their associated increase in mortality(27%；95% CI， 24% to 30%；32%；95% CI， 29% to 34%； and 45%；95% CI， 42% to 48%， respectively； P<0.001) and increased median duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors (5 days； Interquartile[IQR]， 2-11； 7 days； IQR， 4-14； and 9 days； IQR， 5-17， respectively； P<0.001)通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Moderate to severe ARDS calls for a combination of treatment strategies ， to reduce the associated higher risk of mortality.\n\n【33】Treatment Considerations for ARDS\n\n【34】Which of the following management options would be most appropriate for this patient?\n\n【35】High Tidal Volume (TV)， high Positive-End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)\n\n【36】Low tidal volume (≤6ml/kg)， low PEEP\n\n【37】Low tidal volume， high PEEP\n\n【38】Tidal volume and PEEP management should be individualized to the patient after considering multiple factors-Predicted Body Weight (PBW)， underlying cardiac and respiratory conditions， hemodynamic assessment， and the current illness to optimize oxygenation and minimize Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI). Ventilator management requires balancing the TV and PEEP to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation.\n\n【39】Normal TV is based on PBW for height， initially set at 6 ml/kg to8 ml/kg and adjusted as needed to ensure proper ventilation based on ABG， maintaining a plateau pressure (Pplat) ≤ 30 cmH，O. High TV(210 ml/kg) is used to improve hypoxemia/oxygenation， minimize atelectasis and increase the functional residual capacity. Still，research has shown that this causes more complications with volutrauma and mimicking non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14]</u>. Low TV(≤6 ml/kg) is also known as lung-protective ventilation and is the recommended/standard treatment for ARDS due to the poor lung compliance and allows for permissive hypercapnia， which has been shown to reduce mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，16]</u>.\n\n【40】In the American Thoracic Society's (ATS) clinical practice guidelines for mechanical ventilation in adults， the use of low tidal volumes (LTVs； 4 mL/kg to 8 mL/kg PBW) was compared with traditional strategies (TVs； 10 mL/kg to 15 mL/kg PBW) in seven RCTs (1，481 patients). Although they found no significant difference in mortality rates， the largest possible effect (derived from the boundaries of the CIs) inferred a relative risk reduction in mortality of up to 30% in patients receiving LTV 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【41】The former analyses did not include studies that used higher PEEPs in conjunction with LTVs. Sensitivityanalyses， which included删除1换行studies using LTV/higher PEEP combination strategies (a total of nine RCTs， 1，629 patients)， confirmed the clinical importance of LTV， finding significantly reduced mortality (RR， 0.80； 95% CI， 0.66-0.98) compared to traditional strategies. Meta-regression analyses discovered that LTV had a dose-dependent effect on mortality in each RCT 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Hence， the ATS’s strong recommendation is that mechanical ventilation is started at 6 mL/kg PBW， increasing to 8mL/kg if inspiratory pressures fall below PEEP (plateau pressure <30cmH，O)通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\n\n【42】PEEP is essential for alveolar recruitment to improve oxygenation due to poor lung compliance/stifflungs and is adjusted in conjunction with TV to avoid lung injury. A shallow TV (<5 ml/kg PBW) would not benefit an ARDS patient as it would be close to physiologic PEEP 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Whereas high PEEP (>5 cmHO) has been associated with barotrauma from rupture of alveoli leading to pneumothorax通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>， it is strongly recommended in patients with moderate to severe ARDS by the ATS 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. This recommendation is partially based on data from an individual patient data meta-analysis of higher versus lower PEEP from three large， randomized RTCs which confirmed a significantly lower risk of mortality with high PEEP in patients with moderate-severe ARDS (adjusted RR： 0.90； 95% CI， 0.80-1.00) but found no significant effect in patients with mild ARDS 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. However， the potential benefits must be outweighed against possible complications of reduced venous return and increased afterload， resulting in hemodynamic instability 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>.A post hoc analysis of prior randomized control trials and subseq uent meta-analysis demonstrate driving pressure (DT = plateaul - PEEP) is a strong predictor of outcome in ARDS than either tidal volume or plateau pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Lastly， novel options may soon be on the horizon， such as trans-pulmonary plateau pressure-guided PEEP titration， which produced favorable results in a pilot trial and is currently being investigated in a large-scale multicenter RCT 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【43】What additional treatment management would this patien1benefit from?\n\n【44】Supine positioning\n\n【45】Elevate head-of-bed >30 degrees\n\n【46】Prone positioning\n\n【47】Prone positioning is the best way to improve oxygenation and minimize ventilation-perfusion mismatch in moderate-to-severe ARDS patients. It facilitates the maintenance of open alveoli while preventing VILI when used in conjunction with the above strategies already discussed 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. Although there is some debate as to the number of hours per day needed in a prone position， it is strongly recommended for a minimum of 12 consecutive hours per day， ideally 16 h， in patients with PaO，/FIO， ratio<150 mmHg通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\n【48】Supine positioning has the effect of gravity producing an increased weight on the lungs and heart， especially in obese patients， increasing pleural pressure and decreasing lung ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Elevate Head-of-Bed (HOB) also causes lung impairment with reduced compliance and poor gas exchange， as previously discussed. Both HOB elevated and supine positioning have been associated with an increase in lower lobes atelectasis in patients with ARDS and are therefore not beneficial in conjunction with ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>.\n\n【49】In addition to the treatment strategies discussed above (LTV， High PEEP， prone positioning)， a couple of commonly employed important management options must be addressed： Neuromuscular删除表格换行blocking agents and ECMO.\n\n【50】Table 3： Key points in the diagnosis and management of ARDS.\n\n【51】Diagnosis\n\n【52】>PaO/FiO，≤300\n\n| >PEEP≥5 cmH，0  |\n| --- |\n| ) Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema：  |\n| ·Bilateral lung opacities  |\n| ·Pulmonary wedge pressure ≤ 18 mmHg.  |\n| )One week of a known clinical insult  |\n| > Fever， Cough， and chest pain if ARDS is caused by pneumonia.  |\n\n| > Infection (white blood cell count >12，000 per mm)； pulse >90 beats/min； temperature >100.9F (38.3℃) or <96.8F (36℃) and altered mental state if ARDS is  |\n| --- |\n| due to sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>.  |\n\n| Management  |\n| --- |\n\n【56】》 Mechanical ventilation using Lower Tidal Volumes (LTD) starting at 6 mLkg PBD and lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure <30 cmH，O).\n\n【57】> Higher PEEP in patients with moderate-severe ARDS (>12 cmH，O)， NOT in mild ARDS， which benefits fram keeping PEEP~6 cmH，O.\n\n【58】) Prone position， during ventilation， for 12-16 hours per day.\n\n| > Recruitment Maneuvers (RMs) in patients with moderate-severe ARDS.  |\n| --- |\n\n| 》 Stress ulcer prophylaxis and Nutritional support  |\n| --- |\n| ) Paralytics and other pharmacological agents： their use was not addressed in the current ATS guidelines due to resource constraints but will be addressed in future  |\n\n【61】) Paralytics and other pharmacological agents： their use was not addressed in the current ATS guidelines due to resource constraints but will be addressed in future删除1换行guidelines.\n\n【62】 Use caution about using RMs in patients exhibiting pre-existing hypovolemia or shock\n\n【63】ATS guicelines do not support the routine use of the following：\n\n【64】》 Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)： Should be used with caution in severe ARDS (currently， there is not enough evidence for ATS to make a definitive recommendation for or against ECMO)\n\n【65】ATS guidelines strongly recommend against the following：\n\n【66】》 High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation (HFOV) in moderate-severe ARDS.\n\n【67】Neuromuscular blockade iIsSuised inpatients undergoing mechanical ventilation to improve oxygenation anddecrease ventilator-induced lung injury but it may also cause muscle weakness通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. There is a strong expert recommendation for their use in ARDS patients with a PaO，/FiO， ratio<150 mmHg to reduce mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. A multicenter， double-blind trial of 339 patients receiving either the neuromuscular blocking agent Cisatracurium besylate or placebo， found that the hazard ratio for 90-day mortality in the cisatracurium group was 0.68 (95% CI 0.48-0.98；p=0.04)， with improved survival in patients with PaO，/FiO， ratio<120 mmHg， more days alive and free of mechanical ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. Importantly， in this trial， tidal volume was maintained between 6 mL/kg to 8 mL/kg PBW， and the neuromuscular blocking agent was administered early (within48 h from the start of ARDS) and for no longer than 48 h. Patients receiving neuromuscular agents in conjunction with mechanical ventilation must be evaluated daily 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\n\n【68】Venovenous ExtracorporealMembrane Oxygenation (VV ECMO) employs a gaseous-exchange device that oxygenates and removes carbon dioxide in blood drained from a central vein before being reinfused back into the patient. Although its use has increased due to advanced state-of-the-art extracorporeal support techniques， there is limited evidence to support its benefit. RTCs have shown no significant difference in mortality between patients who underwent ECMO and those who did not. Thus， ATS guidelines state that further research is needed and caution against using ECMO in patients with severe ARDS 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.

Here we present a case of Mondor’s disease in an orthopedic surgeon after wearing a tight-fitting lead vest during surgery. Physicians and staff should be aware of the possibility of venous compression and thrombophlebitis from wearing tight clothing in the OR.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Thrombophlebitis of the superficial veins， or Mondor’s disease， is a benign and self-limiting condition which typically occurs in the anterior chest well， although it can also occur in the groin/penis， breast， antecubital fossa， or posterior cervical region 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Mondor’s disease is rare with only roughly 400 reports in the literature. It typically affects middle aged women (three times more frequently than men) and occurs most often after breast surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>.\n\n【4】The typical presentation of Mondor’s disease involves the sudden onset of a tender and erythematous cord which subsequently becomes asymptomatic， although visible. This subcutaneous cord like induration typically occurs on the thoracoabdominal wall and most often involves the superior epigastric system or the lateral thoracic vein 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Here we present a case of a 34-year-old male who presented for evaluation of firm palpable cord on the left side of the chest and abdomen. He first noted linear erythema and tenderness within 24 h of wearing a tight-fitting lead vest during surgery. The tenderness lasted for two weeks， and he was afebrile. He presented to the dermatology clinic three weeks after onset with a 15 cm to 20 cm firm palpable cord on the left lateral chest extending onto the abdomen toward the umbilicus. The patient denied history of malignancy or hypercoagulability. He declined duplex ultrasound of the affected area to rule out deep venous thrombosis. He was diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis of the thoracoepigastric vein (Mondor’s disease). He was treated with NSAID's and warm compresses as needed.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】The etiology of Mondor’s disease is unknown； however， vessel wall damage， hypercoagulability， and venous compression can lead to development of this condition. Pressure on the vein with stagnation of blood， or trauma to the vein itself can lead to inflammation and development of a thrombus.

{"seq_id": "a4d2879b-d6b8-4d4f-bac5-101e6ef83bc0", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD) is a rare， non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by foamy infiltrates of soft tissue and bone， with a histopathology that reveals CD68+， CD1a-，and S100- histiocytes densely infiltrating organ systems such as bone， large vessels， heart， and lungs，and other tissues to name a few. Few chemotherapeutic options exist in the second line， of which one is cladribine. Cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) is an anti-metabolite that predominantly affects blood cells by mimicking adenosine nucleosides， inhibiting adenosine deaminase， and thus disrupts the ability of the cell to repair DNA. Here we report three patients with varying sites of disease who achieved a response following treatment with cladribine. Although the efficacy of cladribine has been demonstrated in patients with ECD who primarily exhibited neurological symptoms， we present three patients in whom significant responses were achieved in disease distributed in long bones， pericardium， and retroperitoneum.\n\n【2】Keywords： Cladribine； Erdheim-Chester disease；Non-Langerhans； Histiocytosis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis that was ffiirst described as a “lipoid granulomatous” by JakobErdheim and William Chester in 1930. The disease is characterized by infiltration of foamy macrophages into various tissues with associated xanthogranulomas inflammation.ECD is a relatively rare condition with between 550-600 reported cases in the literature. Diagnosis of the disease primarily hinges on imaging， clinical symptoms，and the aforementioned histology 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The disease shows preference to males and adults， although it can present in children 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【5】The pathophysiology of ECD is yet to be fully understood. There is some debate as to the reactive or malignant nature of the disorder， with favorable data existing for both mechanisms. Stoppacciaro WI et al. have shown undetectable Ki-67 on ECD histiocytes and the absence of mitosis， which led them to conclude the limited contribution of proliferation to the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Furthermore， they found an increase in chemokine receptors for monocyte migration that allows for the possibility that proliferation has a minimal contribution to the pathogenesis of the disease and an autocrine loop of recruitment and accumulation may be the major contributing factor 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. The group was also able to show T-helperlymphocyte infiltration with IFN-y staining with IL-10 on the histiocytes， pointing to a TH1 or TH2-oriented inflammatory response. The alternative hypothesis， which posits malignancy， cites the incidence of the mutation in the proto-oncogene BRAF， a member in the MAPK pathway 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Depending on the study and the method used to evaluate the mutation status， more than 50% of all tested ECD biopsies carry the V600E mutation in BRAF 通用删除6(英):<u>[7-10]</u>.\n\n【6】Histologic lesions are characterized by cells staining for CD68 and are CD1a-negative， indicating that the progenitors arise from the macrophage/monocyte cell line rather than the dendritic line characteristic of the more common Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In addition， the clones of ECD are S100 negative in 80% of the cases and are further differentiated from LCH by the presence of cytoplasmic Birbeck granules in fewer than 20% of invading histiocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【7】The most commonly associated clinical feature of ECD is osteosclerosis of the long bones， centered primarily in the metaphyses and diaphysis. In a large series of 59 cases， 45 had evidence of radiologic disease such as osteosclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Extraskeletal manifestations of the disease are varied， with common presentations included central diabetes insipidus， retroperitoneal fibrosis， exophthalmos，aortic sheathing，pericardial involvement，cutaneous xanthalesmas， and neurological involvement including parasthesias， paraplesias， and ataxia 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，11]</u>.\n\n【8】First-line treatment for ECD consists of either interferon-a or pegylated interferon-a； interferon is thought to cause immune-mediated histiocyte killing and differentiation of immature histiocytes通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The efficacy of interferon was debated until a study conducted by Arnaud et al showed an increase in survival with interferon in a53-patient cohort 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Furthermore， a positive correlation between treating with escalated-dose regimen contingent on location of disease (i.e. CNSinvolvement) has been established as well 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. More recent studies have shown that the response to IFN-a is variable and again， dependent on the site of disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>， leading most to cite its lack of efficacy or poor tolerance justifying a search for an alternative通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【9】One alternative therapy is cladribine， a purine nucleoside analogue that is selectively toxic to monocytes andlymphocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. It acts by interfering with single-stranded DNA repair and synthesis of both resting and dividing monocytes and lymphocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. The proposed treatment dosage for cladribine is 0.1-0.14 mg/kg per day for five days on a twenty-eight day cycle for histiocytic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>， although the dosage is often modulated according to the severity of the disease. Cladribine has several side effects including neutropenia， anemia， thrombocytopenia， headaches， andincreased risk of infection， fatigue， pyrexia， optical nerve toxicity， and lymphopenia通用删除6(英):<u>[15，16]</u>.\n\n【10】Cladribine use in the management of ECD is poorly understood， mainly due to insufficient reports. Induction treatment with cladribine isn't initiated until the disease is refractory to multiple treatments， which may contribute to the anecdotal opinions of some clinicians against the drug. Here we present three cases of patients whose disease was successfully managed with cladribine.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】Case 1： Male， Age 58\n\n【13】The patient presented with a history of histiocytic granulomatous disease involving his skin， uveal tract， testis， retroperitoneum，lungs， and diabetes insipidus (ECD)， and disseminatednocardiosis. At initial presentation to us thepatienthad received corticosteroids，vinblastine， IFN-a， and mycophenolate mofetil. Despite these treatments， his disease progressed as evidenced by intertriginous inguinal erosive and ulcerative dermopathy and dermatologic involvement of external auditory canals. The patient had initially been diagnosed via testicular biopsy， which revealed granulomatous infiltration. Upon referral to our clinic， he was treated with local radiotherapy for intertriginous rash but was switched to IV cladribine (0.14 mg/删除2换行kg) on the aforementioned schedule due to disease uncontrolled locally and systemically. He received a total of five cycles. There was immediate control of the skin disease. His course was complicated by opportunistic gram-positive disseminated nocardia infection of the wrist， chest， and pleura during his final cycle. (Was that really the timing? Can you provide me with a treatment synopsis?). Since treatment over thirteen years ago， there has been persistent retroperitoneal fibrosis， but no return of cutaneous， ocular， skeletal， lung， or testicular manifestation of ECD since and remains clinically stable. BRAF mutation status is unknown and the patient's disease is followed via CT.\n\n【14】Case 2： Female， Age 27\n\n【15】A 27 year old female presented to clinic with a history of fevers， chills， night sweats， and recently had begun experiencing weight loss attributed to anorexia. Upon physical examination， splenomegaly was noted. A CT at the time revealed osseous lytic bone disease， with a subacute fracture at the posterior 10th rib and femoral neck lesion. A subsequent CT revealed extensive bone disease， with involvement in the right humoral shaft， proximal left radius， a larger fracture in the 10th rib， and thickening of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries. Pathology was negative for both S100 and CD1a， leading to the diagnosis of ECD after the pathologist noted fibrosis that was inconsistent with Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis. The patient was stated on zoledronic acid (4 mg per 28 days) for the lytic lesions and IV cladribine (0.14 mg/kg) for management of the disease. The patient was treated for three cycles and experienced mild nausea and manageable leukopenia， but bone surveys revealed decrease in lytic lesions in the right humeorous， left radius， bilateral ribs， and was accompanied by increased sclerosis indicative of healing. After being clinically stable for thirteen months， the patient returned with increased bone pain. A subsequent PET showed greater radiographic evidence of extensive disease， with recurrence of disease in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries. Due to prior treatment with cladribine， the patient was started on IFN-a but had progression of the disease and was switched back to cladribine for sixadditional cycles. This time leukopenia was mild but the patient developed thrombocytopenia and intermittent bruising on the hands， arms， and legs on the final two days of each cycle. A bone marrow biopsy and PET showed no residual abnormalities ， but did show signs of mild reticulin fibrosis and significant megakaryocytopenia. The patient is once again clinically stable with no signs of progression for over fifteen months， although she did develop renovascular hypertension. She， and continues to be followed. BRAF mutation status is undetermined，but under evaluation.\n\n【16】Case 3： Female， Age 66\n\n【17】This patient presented for consultation after being evaluated for idiopathic cardiac tamponade. Before coming to our clinic， she experienced upper respiratory symptoms that were due to pericardial effusions diagnosed via echocardiogram. The management of her disease prior to presentation at our clinic consisted oftwo pericardial drainages， placement of a pericardial win dow， pericardial stripping， empiric trail of corticosteroids， bronchodilators， and a trial of indomethacin； none showed any improvement. The patient then presented to our hospital with dyspnea， chronic cough， fatigue， chronic shoulder pain， and exertional dyspnea. Pathology of the pericardial tissue revealed infiltrates that were positive for CD68and CD163， and negative for S100 and CDla， leading to her ECD diagnosis. She started her treatment with cladribine (0.14mg/kg) that was continued for four cycles. Her course was complicated by neutropenia attributed to the treatment， but did not result in any significant infections. The patient noted a significant improvement in energy， alleviation of her fatigue， and no recurrent pericardial effusion. Her disease has been clinically stable for over four vears and follow-up ECHOs have revealed no abnormalities. Her BRAF mutation status is undetermined.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Erdheim-Chester diseaseeisarare， non-Langerhanscell histiocytosis marked by CD68positive， CDlanegative， and S100-negativehistiocytes densely infiltratingbone，Lymphhnodes， retroperitoneum， and systemic vasculature. Despite consensus guidelines put in place in 2014 by Diamond et al. clinicians often have difficulty in diagnosing ECD and therefore turn to more well-known treatment options for management. Fortunately multiple drugs are now being evaluated for treating ECD， which is changing the outlook for the disease and providing clinicians with study data to aid their treatment decisions. ECD most commonly presents with osteosclerosis of the long bones， centering primarily in the metaphysis diaphysis. There is a large variance in the extra skeletal manifestations， with common presentations in the form of diabetes insipidus， retroperitoneal fibrosis， aortic sheathing， pericardial involvement， and spectrum of neurological manifestations.\n\n【20】Despite an advantage for IFN-a in survival， it has not shown been shown to be curative. With this in mind， more targeted therapies have been used to treat the disease. One such drug is vemurafenib，a BRAF-V600E inhibitor， has been used to successfully treat patients with ECD 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，13]</u>. In the most recent study of eight patients with proven V600E mutations showed weakened metabolic uptake as seen by PET scan at six months，partial cardiac response in all but one patient， and objective decreases in the size of neurological lesions when treated with vemurafenib 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. In one patient， treatment with vemurafenib following IFN-a resulted in dramatic improvement of functional capacity as well as a reduction in bone，renal， and orbital involvement of disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Lastly， in a trial of three patients with refractory ECD and mutated BRAF， a substantial reduction in clinical symptoms， regression of aortic and orbital involvement and disappearance of skin lesions was observed 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Other treatment methods used include cytotoxic agents， radiation therapy， bisphosphonates， imatinibmesylate， infliximab， anakinra， and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation， each with variable efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【21】Cladribine， the purine analog that is cytotoxic to monocytes， has been advocated as a second-line therapy for ECD.Originally approved for the treatment of Hairy Cell Leukemia，a hematologic malignancy删除1换行characterized by proliferation of cells from the mononuclear cell line， it is believed that its effects may extend from plasma monocytes to tissue histiocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Evidence for its efficacy are scattered throughout the literature. Cladribine has been used successfully along with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone to achieve partial remissions in two patients with CNS and bone symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. In another case study， treatment with cladrabine resulted in remission of orbital，pulmonary， bone， and ocular manifestations of the disease with normalization of macrophage counts 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Finally， partial p remission of CNS lesions following treatment of cladribine was consolidated with lenalidomide and resulted in a complete remission删除4-1:<u>21</u>.\n\n【22】Mutations in the proto-oncogene BRAF have been found in as few as 50% and as many as 100% of cases， with the variability dependent on the method of detection used. A member of the Raf kinase family， BRAF plays a role in cell proliferation via the RAS MAPK pathway通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. An activating mutation， BRAF-V600E， may play a role in the proliferation of cells derived from the mononuclear cell line 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. The BRAF-V600E inhibitor vemurafenib has been successfully used in treatment of patients， most recently in a cohort of eight patients with proven V600E mutations whose reduction in disease was measure via reduced metabolic activity observed on PET scans 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Two single case studies in which Mazor et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> and Tzoulis et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> noted an excellent response in intramedullary disease， both of whom treated with vemurafenib 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. Lastly a study of three patients with V600E mutated refractory ECD observed substantial reduction in clinical symptoms， regression of aortic and orbital involvement， and the disappearance of skin lesions when treated with vemurafenib 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【23】Another targeted therapy that is gaining momentum with ECD is sirolimus. Sirolimus is mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-inhibitor and has antiproliferative and immunosuppressive properties通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. If the previously presented hypothesis of ECD's pathogenesis is correct， mTORinhibition would manage both paths of the disease. In a study conducted by Gianfreda and Nicastro et al ten patients were treated with sirolimus， of whom eight were able to achieve stable disease or an objective response with mild treatment related toxicities通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Additional immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence done by the group on the ECD biopsies revealed mTOR pathway activation via phosphorylated forms of mTOR and its downstream kinase p70S6K. Other studies have also shown PIK3CA and NRAS mutations， which are mTOR pathway activating mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>.\n\n【24】Here we presented three patients who presented in our clinic for the management of their ECD. One of the patients presented after extensivee treatments (corticosteroids， vinblastine， IFN-a， and mycophenolate mofetil)； the other two had no other systemic therapies.Each of the three patients was treated with cladribine (0.14mg/kg) via IV infusion for two hours a day for five days on a twenty-eight day cycle. All patients have sustained disease regression after treatments spanning five， nine， and four cycles respectively. All three patients received anti-PCP， anti-viral， and anti-fungal prophylaxis for one year after the completion of their therapy. The first and third patient required no further treatment； patient two required further treatment whose disease is now clinically stable.\n\n【25】Current trials include a Phase II study with dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with the BRAF mutation ， lenalidomide ， sirolimus with prednisone(ACTRN12613001321730)， tocilizumab ， and d 2long-term outcome after vemurafenib inhibitor interruption study.\n\n【26】Here we have presented our experience with three ECD patients with varying sites of disease whose disease was successfully managed with cladribine. Despite this， there is a patient population who are ineligible for investigational treatments and who would benefit from an alternate therapy. It is here we suggest cladribine to be used as an initial or early therapeutic option based on our experience with the drug and the success our patients have had. Beyond this， it would be interesting to see a larger study with cladribine or a study that compares it to one of the targeted therapies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The role of this disease and its complications on the patient's sleep is not clear yet.\n\n【2】Case Report： The patient was a 20-year-old female with a history of congenital sternum cleft referred to the Sleep Clinic of Rasoul Akram Hospital in Tehran for a split-night polysomnography test due to daytime sleepiness，morning headache，and insomnia.\n\n【3】Conclusion： This case report aimed to investigate the parameters and sleep disorders in a patient with asternia. Considering the complications of this rare disease， it is essential to pay more attention to sleep disorders， especially sleep-related breathing disorders， in these patients.\n\n【4】Keywords： Asternia； Sleep disorder； Obstructive sleep apnea；Iran\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Asternia or complete sternal cleft is a very unusual chest wall deformity caused by a sternal fusion deficiency during embryonic development. This anomaly can cause serious consequences and，like other congenital anomalies， can be linked to other birth disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\n\n【7】Asternia carries several risks， including mediastinal injury， hypothermia， and insensible fluid losses. Also， respiratory and dynamic complications may occur. Paradoxical breathing pattern can lead to cyanosis and recurrent chest infections due to impaired gas exchange and inadequate secretion clearance. In addition， changes due to intrathoracic pressure can decrease venous return删除4-1:<u>2</u>.\n\n【8】Another sternal cleft abnormality includes Pentalogy of Cantrell (POC)， which involves abnormalities of the sternum， pericardium， heart， diaphragm， and abdominal wall. Seemingly unrelated processes such as PHACE (posterior fossa anomalies， hemangioma， arterial anomalies， cardiac anomalies， and eye anomalies) syndrome can also be present 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【9】The optimal time to conduct sternal cleft repair is during infancy， when the chest wall is extremely malleable and can therefore be initially closed without considerable cardiac constraint. As the patient ages and the chest wall stiffens， closure might become progressively more challenging as venous return and lung flexibility are reduced 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【10】Given that respiratory disorders induced by defects in the chest wall muscles during sleep are likely to worsen and no study has been conducted on sleep disorders in patients with sternal defects， this study aimed to evaluate sleep parameters in patients suffering from this rare disease.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】The patient was a 20-year-old female with a history of congenital sternum cleft and repair in childhood. The patient referred to a pulmonologist and complained of daytime shortness ofbreath. The patient was referred to the Sleep Clinic of Rasoul Akram Hospital in Tehran， Iran to be assessed for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). All necessary tests were performed and paraclinical parameters， including spirometry were normal.\n\n【13】According to the patient’s records， she complained of fatigue， excessive daytime sleepiness，and morning headaches. The patient did not report snoring or breathing problems during sleep and complained of frequent inability to sustain sleep， which raised the possibility of OSA. The patient got into bed at 12 AM， fell asleep in about half an hour， and woke up at 10 AM in the morning. She did not report such symptoms and disorders as restless legs syndrome， sleep paralysis， cataplexy， hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations， sleepwalking， nightmares， and other parasomnias.\n\n|  | TST (Total Sleep Time)=380min SE (Sleep Efficacy)=85% W]TH 3 sleep cycles Sleep Latency=16 min REM Latency=141 min PLM index= 2/hr sleep Average Heart Rate=57 bpm Without SPO2<90% AH]=7/hr sleep Duration of Sleep Stage： REM=27 min (7%)/N1=19 min (5%)/N2=207 min (54%)/N3=127 min (34%)  |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】There was no history of psychiatric disorder， suicidal ideation， delirium，hallucinations， or medical conditions. In her childhood，she had sternal reconstructive surgery and tonsillectomy. Also， there was no history of using medications， smoking cigarettes， using drugs， or a family history of sleep or psychiatric disorders.\n\n【16】The patient’s blood pressure was normal (80/110)， Body Mass Index (BMI) was 18 kg/m， neck circumference was 34 cm， the distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin was 9 cm， and Mallampati score was 2.\n\n【17】Herscores in the Restless Legs Syndrome Screening Questionnaire， STOP-BANG Questionnaire， Insomnia Intensity Index， Epworth Sleepiness Score， and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were zero， one， nine， four， and three， respectively .\n\n【18】In polysomnography， various sleep parameters were assessed. ： The sleep parameters， including total sleep time， sleep latency， REM latency (the time between the onset of sleep and the first stage of REM sleep)， and Periodic Leg Movement index (PLMS； average frequent movements of the lower limbs in one hour of sleep) were normal. Heart rate was also normal and no snoring was reported. The number of sleep cycles， including both the REM and non-REM sleep， was also normal for the age of the patient. However， sleep efficacy (the ratio of a person's total sleep time to bed time) decreased slightly. AHI (the average of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep) was equal to seven， which is classified as mild OSA syndrome.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】The present study examined sleep parameters in a patient with asternia， which is an extremely rare condition that can develop alone or in conjunction with other malformations of abdominal wall， diaphragm， pericardium， or heart. The baby will have the highest chance of survival if diagnosed and treated early 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The prevalence of asternia has been reported as one per 100，000 live births 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【21】In fetal life， the sternum develops from the mesoderm's outer surface. In the tenth week， the cells from the two mesoderm bands on either side of the anterior chest wall migrate to the midline and fuse together to form the sternum. Primordia between the ventral ends of the growing clavicle produce the manubrium. The sternum columns fuse in a cephalocaudal manner. The sternal columns do not always unite in the middle， resulting in a complete sternal cleft 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The etiology of the sternal cleft is unknown.\n\n【22】External clefts can be classified into three main groups： (A) sternal cleft without associated abnormalities； (B) thoracic or true ectopia cordis with varying degrees of sternal cleft where the heart is outside the thoracic wall； and (C) thoracoabdominal ectopia cordis， also known as POC 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【23】In her childhood， the patient under study had her congenital sternal cleft corrected by posterior sternal wall plus chondral grafts plus total correction surgery.\n\n【24】During infancy and youth， the chest wal and upper airway alter to accommodate the growing organism's physiological needs. Compression is possible in the newborn's chest wall， which aids in the removal of pulmonary fluid. The adaptation rate of the chest wall in infants is three times that of the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. This causes paradoxical movement ofthe chest inward， especially during Rapid Eye Movement(REM) sleep， which is associated with increased respiratory activity and decreased intercostal muscle activity during inhalation. The sternum and vertebrae ossify in the womb and continue until the age of 25， resulting in chest wall rigidity.\n\n【25】In our patient， the look of the chest was unaffected and there were no paradoxical chest motions. Children with upper airway obstruction sleep with more inconsistency compared to adults. Normal adolescents do not experience paradoxical internal chest movement during inhaling. The form of chest might also change during childhood. The ribs are placed horizontally in babies， resulting in a circular chest with limited expansion potential. As a result， at one month of age， the share of chest breathing current in non-REM sleep is just one-third of that in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【26】Tomohisa Nagasao et al. concluded that when the full length of the sternum is missing， chest breathing is substantiallyhampered，and that correction of the defect is required to treat the disorder. However， since the upper half of the sternum is more crucial for respiration， the upper part should be prioritized in reconstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【27】There are some limited studies on the respiratory disorders associated with sternal cleft. However， no studies have been carried out on sleep disorders in patients with asternia so far. Although some respiratory illnesses， such as sleep apnea， exclusively occur during sleep， practically all respiratory disorders， including upper airway obstruction， central hyperventilation， and chronic lung disease， get worse during sleep than wakefulness. Thus， the impact of sleep on breathing is a crucial concern because when we are awake， we breathe more deeply than sleeping； also， ventilation is reduced during sleep通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【28】Respiratory drive is reduced and breathing becomes irregular， especially during the REM sleep. The respiratory rate and current volume are variable and are associated with recurrent central apnea. REM sleep is also associated with decreased intercostal and upper airway muscle tone. Therefore， breathing is impaired during sleep compared to wakefulness， and REM is more impaired during sleep. This is especially important in children， as they sleep more than adults and have relatively more REM sleep.\n\n【29】The patient under study was diagnosed as having normal sleep parameters， except for sleep efficacy and Apnea-Hypopnea Index(AHI). The patient’s AHI was indicative of mild OSA 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【30】OSA is the most common sleep disorder characterized by recurrent collapse of the soft tissue in the rear of the throat during sleep. According to the latest research， its prevalence is 17% in women and 35% in men 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. These intermittent collapses reduce airflow， which lead to two consequences： Arousal in sleep to resume airflow， and gas exchange disorders caused by hypopnea (decreased breathing) or apnea (stopped breathing) 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Frequent arousals in OSA lead to neurological cognitive consequences， such as decreased memory， daytime drowsiness， and decreased quality of life. However， the mechanisms contributing to these adverse outcomes are complex and not yet fully understood.\n\n【31】Also， Mallampati score was equal to 2 in our patient. This has been identified as an independent risk factor for OSA in previous studies， so that for each degree of increase in Mallampati score， the chance of OSA doubles 通用删除6(英):<u>[171</u>； this should be considered in the analysis of results.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n\n【33】This case report evaluated the parameters and sleep disorders in a patient with asternia. Considering the complications of this rare disease， it is essential to pay more attention to sleep disorders， especially sleep-related breathing disorders， in these patients. Further studies are needed to investigate the chest anatomy defects causing OSA syndrome in patients with congenital sternum cleft.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Her vitals remained stable and physical exam was remarkable for dullness on percussion and decreased breath signs of the right upper lung fields. Chest X-ray showed right apical consolidation and follow up CT thorax showed large cavitary mass that involved the upper lobe of the right lung and the superior segment of the right lower lobe. Bronchoscopy with biopsy was consistent with necrotizing pneumonia and patient was treated with IV antibiotics. However her symptoms did not resolve and surgery was consulted.

Major bleeding， including pericardial bleeding with PT， is a known adverse effect of antithrombotic therapy， e.g.， heparin， thrombolytic agents， and anticoagulants. Pericardial bleeding (hemopericardium) with subsequent Pericardial Tamponade(PT) is a rare but life-threaten ing condition that requires emergency pericardiocentesis.\n\n【2】Case Report： We describe a 44-year-old woman who was admitted to our Emergency Department(ED) after syncope. Eleven days before， she was treated for Pulmonary Embolism (PE) with low molecular weight heparin，recombinant plasminogen activator，and apixaban and had an uneventful course. The patient was promptly diagnosed with PT by use of transthoracic echocardiography and treated with acute pericardiocentesis.\n\n【3】Conclusion： We aim to highlight this delayed and potentially fatal complication of anticoagulant and/or thrombolytic treatment. PT should be considered in patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with circulatory shock， while receiving antithrombotic therapy. Rapid diagnosis of PT is of paramount importance and echocardiography should be immediately available in the ED as well as access to acute pericardiocentesis. Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) is the most important imaging modality for assessing the presence of pericardial effusion and its severity and in the case of severe effusion leading to PT.\n\n【4】Keywords： Cardiac tamponade； Pulmonary embolism； Apixaban； Reteplase\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Major bleeding is an adverse effect of heparin， thrombolytics， and anticoagulants. Pericardial bleeding (hemopericardium) with subsequent Pericardial Tamponade (PT) is a rare but life-threatening condition that has been described after thrombolytic treatment， primarily in patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction or stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Major bleeding during the use of vitamin K antagonists or Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOAC) is also a well-established risk and for several therapeutic indications， e.g. non-valvular atrial fibrillation， deep venous thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism (PE)， DOACs have become preferred anticoagulation agents owing to lower risk of major bleeding， availability of fixed dosages， fewer drug interactions， faster onset of action and shorter drug half-lives 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>. Heparin， thrombolytic agents， and anticoagulants all have indications for treatment of PE where their use is associated with improved survival 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-9]</u>. However， use of these agents entails risk of major bleeding including rare cases of pericardial bleeding with PT.\n\n【7】We here report a case of PT caused by pericardial bleeding eleven days after treatment ofPE with unfractionated heparins and thrombolytic therapy， followed by a DOAC. This case underscores that in patients receiving antithrombotic therapy and presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with circulatory shock， PT should be considered. Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) is the most important imaging modality for assessing the presence of pericardial effusion and its severity and in the case of severe effusion leading to PT； emergency pericardiocentesis is a life-saving procedure.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 44-year-old woman was evaluated at our ED because of a sudden and unannounced syncope. Her medical history included endometriosis treated with hormonal IUD and desogestrel， and infrequent migraine.\n\n【10】Eleven days before admission， the patient was diagnosed with a large saddle PE at another hospital. TTE at that time showed a dilated Right Ventricle (RV)， D-shaped left ventricular cavity，with abnormal Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE) of 1.1 cm. The ECG revealed new-onset incomplete right bundle branch block. She received tinzaparin 175 IE/kg subcutaneously. The following day the patient was tachycardia with increased shortness of breath and decreased systolic blood pressure to 90 mmHg to100mmHg. Accordingly， thrombolytic therapy was administered with two intravenous boluses of 10 E reteplase over 5 min administered in a peripheral vein. The rest of the hospital course was uneventful and during the admission， there were only slightly abnormal liver tests\n\n【11】. The patient was discharged after five days with apixaban 10mg twice per day.\n\n【12】On evaluation in our ED after the syncope， the patient was awake and alert in moderate distress with dyspnea and chest pain. Heart rate was 119 beats per minute， blood pressure 118/97 mmHg， respiratory rate 17 per minute， and oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The ECG showed sinus rhythm with low voltage of the QRS-complexes .\n\n【13】The patient was initially treated with a rapid infusion of intravenous fluids and antibiotics for suspected septic shock， possibly induced by a post-hospital-acquired infection. However， after four hours the condition quickly deteriorated with signs of hemodynamic collapse with a rapid drop in blood pressure， increased dyspnea， and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with an oxygen saturation of 85% and arterial blood metabolic acidosis despite conventional oxygen therapy . Therefore， high-flow nasal oxygen 50 L/min was started. Abnormal liver biochemical tests were also apparent suggestive of acute liver failure .\n\n【14】Acute TTE showed PT with a massive circumferential pericardial effusion measuring up to 3 cm to 4 cm and compressing cardiac chambers and the RV in particular . Apixaban was discontinued and the patient was immediately transferred for emergency pericardiocentesis at the Trauma Centre in the Capital Region of Denmark. Here， 1200 ml of blood-containing fluid was drained leading to immediate improvement of the condition. During the next four hours， another 400 ml of pericardial fluid was drained. Two days later， the pericardial sac was re-drained for another 1，150ml of blood-containing pericardial fluid. On day three， no signs of bleeding from the pericardium were apparent on repeat TTE. Therefore， tinzaparin 7000 IE twice daily was administered. A CT pulmonary angiogram revealed small remnants of arterial thrombosis in segmental arteries of both lungs and a segmental pulmonary infarction in the right lung. The patient remained hospitalized for ten days and was discharged with tinzaparin treatment. Further evaluation in the outpatient clinic showed normalization ofliver tests and no signs of malignancy or thrombophilia. Forty-two days after discharge， the patient's tinzaparin was discontinued and rivaroxaban20 mg daily was administered with subsequent uneventful complete recovery.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Eleven days before the present admission with PT， the patient received heparin， thrombolysis， and DOAC for PE， with subsequent删除表格换行continued DOAC treatment. In PE， thrombolytic therapy leads to faster improvement of pulmonary artery obstruction compared with heparin alone 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. The indication for thrombolysis in PE is determined by clinical instabilityand RV dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-9]</u>. Therefore， thrombolytic treatment for PE was well-indicated in the current case at the first admission and this condition quickly improved hereafter.\n\n| Timeline  | Description  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Day -11  | Diagnosed with a large saddle pulmonary embolism.Echocardiography.

Formerly known as Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis (APD)， the condition has been increasingly referred to as PH due to a body of evidence suggesting its pathogenesis is most likelyan IgE-mediated reaction and not due to the production ofautoantibodies通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. We present a case of this rare disorder that was found in an African-American female of child-bearing age and without exogenous Progestogen use.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 41-year-old African-American female patient presented to the Allergy Clinic complaining of swelling of her lips， tongue and face for the past few years. Other symptoms included difficulty swallowing， and changes in her voice. The patient denied shortness of breath，rash， visual changes， sneezing， rhinorrhea， cough， or wheezing. At the time of initial office visit the patient had no known allergies. She reported that these symptoms have been recurring every month a few days after her menstruation period， coinciding with the ovulation window. Skin testing was performed revealing positive results against progesterone. Having never been on any medication containing progesterone， it was concluded that her allergy was to endogenous progesterone. The patient was initiated on prednisone 20 mg orally every month for symptomatic control and was also given two epinephrine auto-injectors in case of emergency. Allergy shot immunotherapy was initiated to immunize to progesterone， however the patient did not respond appropriately. After a long course over 9 years to conservatively treat her rare allergy， she was ultimately referred to Gynecology for planned oophorectomy.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】PH may present clinically with a heterogeneous range of dermatological and systemic symptoms including， but not limited to， urticaria， angioedema，pruritic clustered vesicular rashes， anaphylaxis， wheezing， and chest tightness in response to exposure to progestogens 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. While the underlying derangements in physiology required to develop PH have not been elucidated， a prominent theory proposes that exposure to exogenous progestogens (oral contraceptive pills， In-Vitro Fertilization(IVF) treatments) causes the development of progestogen-specific IgE antibodies that cross-link to mast cells which subsequently degranulate in a type I hypersensitivity reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. However； this theory does not account for the reported cases in which the patient had no know previous exposure to exogenous estrogens 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【6】Diagnosis of PH involves a careful history that temporally associates symptoms with exogenous progestogen administration or the progesterone surge of luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. This can then be followed by skin prick， progesterone challenge， or serological testing to confirm the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【7】Multiple therapeutic approaches to PH have been reported with variable success. Importantly， therapeutic choices should be guided by the goals ofthe patient， specificallywith respect topregnancy desires and side effect tolerability. Generally， treatment is aimed at relief of hypersensitivity symptoms， ovulation suppression， or desensitization to the offending progestogen. Regarding symptomatic relief， oral H1 antihistamines and oral corticosteroids have demonstrated incomplete efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>， while corticosteroids have well-documented and compliance-limiting side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. In a recent case， omalizumab， a monoclonal antibody directed at the IgE surface receptor on mast cells and basophils， was used successfully to treat PH 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. In future practice， use of biologics like omalizumab may be limited by high costs 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>； however， they offer a promising potential treatment option for PH.\n\n【8】Ifa trial of symptomatic relieftherapy fails， ovulation suppressants have been used as a next line of treatment. These medications have their own potential drawbacks. Unsurprisingly， combination Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCP’s) are poorly tolerated due to the chance of a hypersensitivity reaction to low-dose progesterone within the OCP 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. GnRH agonists and selective estrogen receptor modulators have been used to control symptoms with incomplete success and undesirable side-effect profiles that result from estrogen withdrawal通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. For patients with severe symptoms who do not respond to the above therapies or desire pregnancy， cases of desensitization to progestogens with intramuscular， oral，and intravaginal progesterone have been reported to be successful 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>.\n\n【9】Ultimately， in patients with severe and refractory symptoms to the aforementioned therapeutics， oophorectomy is a viable option for patients who are past child-bearing years or do not desire pregnancy that was first described by Shelley et al. in 1964 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. However， oophorectomy is a procedure with well-documented risks including decreases in cognition and sexual function along with increases in cardiac risk and osteoporosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[13-16]</u> and should be used as a last resort.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】PH is a very rare disorder that has little to no known incidence and prevalence in the U.S population. There are fewer than 200 reported cases worldwide. We present a rare case of PH that was refractory to standard therapies such as H1-antagonist， corticosteroids， and even Allergy shot immunotherapy. This patient was passed her child-bearing years， making her an appropriate candidate for surgical intervention.

We present the case of a schizophrenic patient who murdered his mother. Questions about criminal imputability and the importance of prevention and treatment measures in these cases are discussed.\n\n【2】Keywords： Psychosis； Violent behavior； Responsibility\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Violence committed by individuals with severe mental disorders has become a growing focus of interest among physicians， law enforcement officials， and the general population. For several decades， there has been a debate in the psychiatric and legal literature on the correlation between violence and mental disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>.\n\n【5】Traditionally， the homicide rate is considered a “thermometer for the prevailing degree of violence. The main approaches for investigating this relationship are studies of homicidal individuals， since homicide is considered the most serious expression of violence in a given society.\n\n【6】The association between schizophrenia and violent behavior is a robust finding： It has been described by several groups of independent researchers working in industrialized countries 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> and developing countries 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， with different cultures， social and health services and criminal justice systems， in studies examining different samples and using different methodologies. These findings imply great suffering， both for the VITIMES and the perpetrators， as well as a high financial cost to society. In addition， evidence has found that people with severe mental disorders have a higher risk of being victims of physical aggression 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【7】There are few studies on violent behavior in individuals with schizophrenia in Latin America. In one of them 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> which included 253 stabilized outpatients. The prevalence of violent behavior in this sample was 3.5% in Chile， 14.6% in Peru and 55.4% in Bolivia. In this study， violent behavior was associated with the severity of psychotic symptoms， low family income， young age at onset of the disease and a higher number of hospitalizations.\n\n【8】Our aim is to report the case of a patient with psychotic disorder who murdered his mother.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】Paul， 30 years old， without profession， residing with his mother and brother. In the year 2020 he struck his mother with a knife in the back， which resulted in her death.\n\n【11】History of psychiatric problems since the age of 26， having been admitted several times in psychiatric hospitals， due to agitation， aggressive behavior against his mother， persecutory and mystical delusions and listening to voices， which said that he was the “beast of the apocalypse\". According to his brother， he used of several antipsychotic medications in the past. There are no reports of alcohol or drug use. The patient had not been undergoing psychiatric treatment in recent删除1换行months before the crime.\n\n【12】When asked about the reason for the crime，he stated that heheard the voice of God asking him to pray. He took a picture of himself and concluded that he was God. His mother asked to see the photo， but the voice said that only him could see it. He claims his mother insisted on seeing the photo and he decided to stab her. He states that he then heard the voice of God tell him to take off his clothes and go to the street，having obeved that voice.\n\n【13】In the psychiatric examination， thepresence of mystical delusions， auditory hallucinations， dissociated thinking and affective impoverishment was observed. The established psychiatric diagnosis was schizophrenia.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】In Brazil，the criterion adopted bythe penal code 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> for assessment of criminal responsibility is biopsychological： Responsibility is only ruled out if the agent， at the time ofthe crime and due to mental illness or intellectual disability， was incapable of understanding (knowing the act’s illegality) and determination (being free to choose between carrying out and refraining from the crime). The biopsychological model requires verification of a causal nexus between the abnormal mental state and perpetration of the crime. In other words， the abnormal mental state must be contemporary with the offense， and it mut partially or completely deprive the offender of either of the psychological capacities (intellectual or volitional). According to Brazilian penal code， there also is also the possibility of cases with limited criminal responsibility， resulting from partial impairment of cognitive or volitional functions. In cases oflimited responsibility， the courts can also order the individual's compulsory treatment.\n\n【16】Several studies have investigated specific groups of patients with mental disorders， with the purpose of establishing correlations between violent or homicidal behavior and sociodemographic and psychopathological variables. Undoubtedly， schizophrenia is the most well-studied mental disorder in this regard.\n\n【17】In this case， there was a causal nexus between the mental illness and the homicide， so Paul was ruled not guilty by reason of insanity， in the forensic psychiatric assessment. Most of crimes committed by individuals with schizophrenia occur in the family setting and in the first years of the disease， as in this case. The case illustrates the importance of delusions and auditory hallucinations in the violent behavior.\n\n【18】Various studies have shown that the risk of violent behavior can increase in patients presenting delusions and auditory hallucinations通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Other studies have found an association between auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusional ideas and motivation for homicide 通用删除6(英):<u>[9-11]</u>. More severe paranoia is associated with increased aggressiveness， even after controlling for factors like impulsiveness， command hallucinations， treatment with antipsychotics， substance abuse， age， and gender 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【19】Mental healthcare professionals should increase the surveillance of patients that present delusions related to their parents， history of violent behavior in the acute phases， reports of threats toward family and friends， and absence or refusal of psychiatric treatment. It is important for social support and mental health services to be made available to families. Measures to protect the child should be offered actively to parents who present stress and lack of emotional equilibrium when they need to care for children.\n\n【20】Access to hospitalization when indicated or to alternative homes(protected homes， therapeutic communities) for individuals with mental disorders， when necessary， could help reduce the incidence of parricide and filicide and improve the quality of life for parents and children in many of these families.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】The issue of criminal responsibility of individuals with mental disorders is challenging for criminal justice， psychiatry， and society. Determination of criminal responsibility is essential for adequate referral of persons in any system of criminal law， thus ensuring psychiatric treatment for those in need while safeguarding their human rights.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In this unusual case， abnormality of the cortisol axis was considered after finding a low level of the adrenal androgen precursor， dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate， during an infertility evaluation for anovulation. Low dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate proved secondary to decreased pituitary adrenocorticotropin hormone production from hypercortisolism associated with an adrenal adenoma. Although dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels naturally decline with aging， abnormally low levels should raise suspicion for Cushing’s syndrome.\n\n【2】Keywords： ： Cushing's syndrome； Infertility Oyulatory dysfunction： Amenorrhea； Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Given the low incidence of Cushing's disease and syndrome of 0.7 to 2.4 per million per year and the often non-specific and common symptoms of weight gain， menstrual abnormalities， hypertension， lethargy and mood disorders， this diagnosis is rarely initially considered. Many cases are not diagnosed until symptoms have progressed in severity such as muscle weakness with wasting of the limbs， facial rounding， frontal balding， osteoporosis， diabetes and easy bruising. The case described herein shows a very unusual situation where an abnormality of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis was considered due to a low level of the adrenal androgen precursor， Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEAS). This level was drawn for evaluation of infertility with an ovulation. This abnormal laboratory value leads to the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome secondary to an adrenal adenoma.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 41 year old G0 female with primary infertility revealed a history of irregular menses with subsequent amenorrhea for the last 4 months. She denied any vasomotor symptoms， galactorrhea or pelvic pain. She had not previously received fertility evaluation or treatment.

Review of systems was pertinent for inability to lose weight， occasional irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea， menstrual migraine history and long-term history of dysthymia without current medical treatment.

Laboratory testing showed anti-mullerian hormone 0.53 pmol/L (0.074 ng/mL)， follicle stimulating hormone8.7 IU/L，estradiol 168.88 pmol/L (46 pg/mL)， thyroid stimulating hormone 2.44 mIU/L， prolactin12.89 ug/L， DHEAS 0.081 umol/L (3 ug/dL； normal 35-430) and total testosterone <0.24 nmol/1 (7ng/dL). Due to verylow androgen and androgen precursor levels， additional testing of the pituitary-adrenal axis was performed including morning ACTH 0.44 pmol/L (2 pg/mL； normal 15-66)， cortisol 361.38 nmol/L (13.1 ug/dL； normal 5-25)， late afternoon cortisol 361.38 nmol/L (13.1ug/dL) and 24 h urinary free cortisol 193.2 nmol/d (70 ug/24 hr； normal 3.5-45). A 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test failed suppression with a cortisol level of 300.69 nmol/L (10.9ug/dL). A non-contrast CT of the abdomen showed a 3.9 cmx 2.6 cm mass of the left adrenal . A left adrenalectomy was performed with pathology showing an adrenal cortical adenoma. Follow-up laboratory testing showed normalization of cortisol levels.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Cushing’s syndrome， secondary to supraphysiologic levels of glucocorticoids， most commonly arises from ACTH producing pituitary tumors (Cushing’s disease) 80% of the time or from direct secretion of cortisol from adrenal tumors 20% of the time 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The majority of adrenal tumors are unilateral with 80% benign and 20%malignant 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【9】With an annual incidence of 0.2 to 5 per million people and a characteristic insidious onset of non-specific symptoms， evaluation for Cushing's is typically delayed 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>. Diagnosis can be particularly challenging in cases with mild hypercortisolism and a subtle clinical presentation. Weight gain is the most common symptom in Cushing's syndrome and evidence of protein wasting， such as proximal weakness， thin skin and easy bruising， can most reliably distinguish Cushing's syndrome from other causes of weight gain通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. There is no single sign or symptom that is pathognomonic for Cushing's syndrome and clinical presentation is influenced by age， sex， severity and disease duration. The symptom complex includes hirsutism， acne， weight gain， hot flashes， hypertension， moon facies or buffalo hump， osteopenia， depression， emotional lability， menstrual abnormalities， decreased libido， glucose intolerance， dyslipidemia and decreased growth velocity in children 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，6]</u>. Diagnosing and treating Cushing's syndrome is critical given a two to three-fold increased risk of mortality with higher rates of venous thromboembolism， myocardial infarction and stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，7]</u>. Appropriate screening tests for Cushing’s include 24-h Urinary Free Cortisol (UFC)， Late Night Salivary Cortisol (LNSC) and overnight Low-Dose (1 mg) Dexamethasone Suppression Test (LDDST). The UFC has an advantage of determining hypercortisolism irrespective of altered corticotropin-binding globulin levels as seen in pregnancy and with estrogen therapy. Disadvantages include inaccuracies from high fluid intake， incomplete urine collection and abnormal renal function 通用删除6(英):<u>[81</u>.LNSC detects loss of diurnal cortisol production seen in Cushing’s syndrome， differentiating from pseudo-Cushing's syndrome， associated with depression， malnutrition or alcohol dependence. However， LNSC is not reliable with tobacco abuse， critical illness or disturbed sleep patterns 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. A LDDST should normally suppress the morning cortisol to less than 50 nmol/liter(1.8ug/dL). Due to loss of feedback inhibition on the HPA axis， an elevated cortisol level suggests Cushing’s. The LDDST has decreased reliability in patients with malabsorption disorders， liver or kidney failure or patients taking medications that interfere with CYP3A4metabolism 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【10】With positive screening tests， a morning ACTH level is used to differentiate between ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent causes. High ACTH suggesting a pituitary secreting adenoma or ectopic ACTH production requires brain MRI， while low ACTH suggesting an adrenal tumor requires an abdominal CT scan. Elevated ACTH without radiographic evidence ofa pituitary adenoma requires additional testing. Noninvasive testing to help discriminate a pituitary source from ectopic source includes High Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test (HDDST) and CRH (Corticotropin Releasing Hormone) stimulation. The former works on the principal that pituitary corticotroph lesions retain partial inhibition by high-dose glucocorticoids whereas ectopic tumors do not. Similarly， the CRH stimulation may help differentiate due to retained response in pituitary lesions， not seen in ectopic tumors. The gold-standard for diagnosis remains bilateral inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling. A删除2换行adrenal adenama showing characteristic lipid filled cells.\n\n【11】central to peripheral ACTH ratio of 2：1 prior to CRH administration or 3：1 after CRH administration has a sensitivity of approximately94% and a specificity >99% for a pituitary source 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【12】In the case subject presenting with infertility， oligomenorrhea， inabilityto loseweight and dysthymia1。morecommor diagnoses of polycystic ovarian syndrome， hypothyroidism， and hyperprolactinemia would be considered. In addition， obesity and dysthymia most commonly lack a secondary cause. The finding of a very low DHEAS level led to the suspicion of ACTH suppression with Cushing’s syndrome resulting from an adrenal tumor. Although DHEAS is not a screening test for Cushing's，abnormal levels warrant further evaluation. In a study of 28 patients with Cushing's syndrome from an adrenocortical adenoma， 100% had abnormally low DHEAS levels. In contrast， 29% of 36 patients with Cushing's disease had abnormally high DHEAS levels 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【13】Hypercortisolism1 contributestOinfertility via ovulatory dysfunction. In 45 premenopausal women with Cushing's syndrome，80% of patients had menstrual irregularities， 33% with amenorrhea and 31.1% with oligomenorrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. The primary mechanism is cortisol-induced inhibition of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone(GnRH) release from the hypothalamus and LH and FSH release from the pituitary 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. At the level of the gonads excess glucocorticoids can inhibit sex steroid hormone production and cell apoptosis通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Examination of ovarian tissue in premenopausal patients with Cushing's syndrome has shown a trend towards reduced primordial follicles and fibrosis consistent with a mechanism of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Decreased libido with Cushing's syndrome may also contribute to infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>.\n\n【14】With ACTH-dependent Cushing’s， adrenal androgen excess results in increased peripheral conversion to estrogens along with decreased hepatic production of Sex-Hormone Binding Globulin(SHBG) resulting in higher free estradiol levels， both yielding inappropriate feedback on the HPO axis 通用删除6(英):<u>[15，16]</u>.\n\n【15】Adrenocortical adenoma， seen in this patient， is the most common cause of ACTH-independent Cushings 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\n\n【16】These tumors average 3.5 cm in size with a direct correlation of size and malignancy， while size does not correlate with hormone levels. Approximately 73% of cells within the adenoma are lipid-rich yielding lower attenuation on unenhanced CT compared to the spleen. Similarly， Chemical Shift Imaging (CSI) on MRI shows a relative signal loss compared to the spleen due to the lipid content. CT and MRI are the best imaging modalities， typically with the former preferred. Benign adenomas are characteristically round or oval with smooth walls and homogeneous interior. In contrast， adenocarcinomas are irregular in shape with heterogeneous interior often due to hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. In summary， this case of Cushing's syndrome found in a woman presenting for ovulatory dysfunction related infertility highlights the non-specific symptoms of the disorder along with the common finding of suppressed DHEAS. Very low DHEAS levels would be unisual in other causes of ovulatory dysfunction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

GCRO can be easily misdiagnosed as giant-cell tumor (GCT) in pathology and imageology， and such misdiagnosis results in the loss of the optimal opportunity for treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>. Therefore， early diagnosis is critical to GCRO prognosis. GCRO has low incidence 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， and the nine cases of GCRO reported by Bathurst et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> for the first time in1986 accounted for 3% of the osteosarcoma incidence during that period. GCRO occurs in the long bones of limbs and is extremely rare in skulls 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，6]</u>. In this paper， the case of a 43-year-old patient with temporal bone GCRO was reported. In addition， the clinical， imageological， and pathological features of GCRO， as well as differential diagnosis， were discussed in combination with previous studies.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Clinical history\n\n【9】The patient was a 43-year-old male who accidentally noticed a painless hard bump about the size of a finger in the left tempus a year ago and did not seek treatment. A month ago， the bump progressively grew and was accompanied by occasional dizziness. Physical examination revealed a local uplift bump in the left tempus felt by hand. The bump had a wide base and no obvious boundary， was hard and cannot be pushed， was about 3 cm x4 cm in size， had no surface ulceration， and was swollen. Laboratory examination revealed that the hemoglobin level was 98.3 g/l. No other abnormality was found.\n\n【10】Imageological examination\n\n【11】German Siemens Multi-slice spiral CT (Siemens Sensation 16) was used to conduct head CT plain scan， enhancement， and three-dimensional multiplanar reconstruction (MPR). The CT scanning parameters were as follows： voltage， 120 kV； electric current， 100 mAs； reconstruction layer thickness， 2 mm； and layer spacing， 0.8 mm. About 370 mg/ml Iopamiro was used as the contrast agent for enhancement scanning at a dosage of 1.5 ml/kg and injection flow rate of 3 mL/s， with flushing by 30 ml of normal saline. Image post-processing was conducted in a Siemens random\n\n【12】Operation\n\n【13】After successful general anesthesia administration， the patient was asked to be in supine position with head to the right. The arc incision of the left temporal bone was marked， and the towel was regularly disinfected and paved. Craniotomy was conducted until the local bump of the left temporal bone was fully exposed. The left temporal bone was destroyed， becoming jelly-like and brittle. The jaw joints and the external auditory canal were eroded， but the删除1换行endocranium was not destroyed. The tumor boundary was stripped， and most of the tumor tissues were removed. The tumors around the temporomandibular joint were retained to reserve functions. After conducting thorough hemostasis and scalp suturing， an indwelling drainage tube was placed.\n\n【14】Pathological examination\n\n【15】Intraoperative inspection of grey red and grayish yellow brittle left temporal bone and tumor tissues with a size of 9 cm 8 cm 1cm was conducted. HE staining showed diffuse infiltration of a large number of polygonal tumor cells， with large tumor cell nucleus， visible nucleoli， evident pleomorphism， osteoid matrix， and tumor osteogenesis. A large number of osteoclast-like giant cells were scattered among the tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed CD68 (+) and S-100通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> of osteoclast-like giant cells， as well as S-100(+) and CD68 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> of mononuclear tumor cells. The pathological diagnosis was left temporal bone GCRO .\n\n【16】Follow-up visit\n\n【17】The patient receeiivveedd postoperativebi not七preoperative chemoradiotherapy. More than 2 years after the operation (May2012)， the patient experienced suppuration with no incentive in the left ear； accordingly， biopsy and surgery were conducted. The pathological diagnosis was recurrence of osteosarcoma， so adjuvant postoperative chemoradiotherapy was conducted. Three years later(March 20， 2013)， head MRI detected tumor relapse ， so radiotherapy and chemotherapy were conducted.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Based on the WHO Classification of Bone Tumor Pathology and Genetics 通用删除7(英):<u>(2002)</u>， GCRO is an unusual osteosarcoma that is a subtype of normal bone osteosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. GCRO involves the presence of osteoclast-like giant cells with an abnormal increase in number， thereby almost disguising the osteosarcoma composition as the tumor core. GCRO can be easily misdiagnosed as GCT in pathology and imageology， thereby resulting in the loss of the optimal opportunity for treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3，7]</u>. Therefore， early diagnosis is critical to GCRO prognosis.\n\n【20】According to previous reports， GCRO mostly occurs in adolescents， especially those under the age of 30. The long bones of limbs such as femur and tibia are the main pathogenic sites， and occurrences in the skull are extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，6]</u>. Clinically， GCRO is nonspecific and mainly characterized by local bumps and progressive pain. Laboratory tests showed increased alkaline删除1换行phosphatase. Imageological examinations including X-ray， CT， and MRI showed that the main symptoms of GCRO were eccentricity(a few centricities)， mild swelling， osteolytic destruction， visible tumor bone， formation of soft tissue bump in some cases， and obvious enhancement of the substantial part of tumor (found by enhancement scanning). Histologically， GCRO on HE dyeing showed a large number of osteoclast-like giant cells with a background of osseous osteosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry examination showed osteoclast-like giant cells， a small amount of histocyte-like mononuclear CD68(+) cells， abnormal mononuclear cells， and tumor CD68通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. We reported for the first time a case of GCRO that occurred in the temporal bone of a 43-year-old male. This age was higher than the average age reported in literature but was consistent with the age preference of GCT occurrence. Given that GCRO has a long course of disease and shows no progressive pain， no specificity was detected in the laboratory examination. This finding brought a certain challenge to the early diagnosis of this case Imageological examination showed obvious swelling of the temporal bone， dissolving bony destruction， invasive growth， wide range of involvement， and obvious enhancement of the substantial part of the tumor (found by enhancement scanning). Given the dotted high-density lesions scattered in the tumor， we believed it was the pathological tumor bone. In this case， no obvious periosteal reaction was found. The above imageological findings were basically identical to previous reports. Pathological studies also revealed a large number of osteoclast-like giant cells in the background of osteosarcoma.\n\n【21】GCRO is treated the same as traditional osteosarcoma， i.e.， by amputating the bone in the tumor segment and by implant surgery， supported with preoperative and postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. GCRO prognosis is related to the pathological types of its background osteosarcoma. For example， if the background is centricity osteosarcoma， it is deemed to be highly malignant with poor prognosis. Conversely， if the background is periosteal osteosarcoma， it is deemed to be less malignant with better prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Differential diagnosis： GCRO should be mainly differentiated from conventional osteosarcoma and GCT. Key points to differentiation from conventional osteosarcoma： Imageologically， GCRO mainly manifests as osteolytic destruction， but the osteogenic tumor and periosteal reaction are often less obvious than those in conventional osteosarcoma. Pathologically， GCRO manifests as a large number of osteoclast-like giant cells in the background of osteosarcoma， whereas the latter shows no giant cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Key points to differentiation from GCT： 1) the onset age of GCRO is those of children and adolescents，\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】GCRO can be easily misdiagnosed as GCT， and early diagnosis is very important for its prognosis. Clinically， GCRO is mainly characterized by local bumps and progressive pain. Imageologically， GCRO is mainly characterized by osteolytic destruction， its tumor osteogenesis and periosteal reaction are often less obvious than those of conventional osteosarcoma， and it is obviously enhanced in enhancement scanning. Pathologically， GCRO is characterized by a large number of osteoclast-like giant cells in the background of osteosarcoma.

Cases of stroke patients with mild thrombocytopenia who received IVT were occasionally reported， but reports of patients with platelet count below 80，000/uL are scarce.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： We report an ischemic stroke patient with a platelet count of 56，000/uL who received IVT. The patient did not have any hemorrhagic symptoms before stroke and no symptomatic hemorrhagic complications after IVT. The stroke was caused by internal carotid artery dissection， and stenting of the right internal carotid artery was performed to prevent cerebral infarction recurrence.\n\n【3】Conclusion： This case exemplifies the need to reassess the threshold of platelet count for withholding intravenous thrombolysis. We often encounter cases with management uncertainties， having no available high-quality evidence. In these cases， clinical decisions must be made on an individual basis.\n\n【4】Keywords： Thrombocytopenia； Acute ischemic stroke； Intravenous Thrombolysis； Tissue plasminogen activator\n\n【5】Background\n\n【6】Intravenous Thrombolysis (IVT) with alteplase is approved for Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) patients. Nevertheless， IVT use is limited not only by its short therapeutic window， but also by the numerous contraindications. Having a platelet count of less than 100，000/uL is considered an absolute contraindication for IVT， according to trial selection criteria and expert opinions 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. As unsuspected thrombocytopenia is rare， the 2013 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines recommend clinicians not to wait for the platelet count results before administering intravenous alteplase to AIS patients unless there is a suspected bleeding thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The rate of unsuspected platelet count <100，000/uL of patients at stroke presentation was reported to be 0.3% by prior studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. However， there are two issues. First，the two prior studies were conducted in the U.S population， which may differ in clinical characteristics from populations of other countries. For instance， people residing in Southwestern part of China such as Chengdu， have an average platelet count below 100，000/pL 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Second， the two studies both excluded patients with a history of thrombocytopenia. In fact， very few of such patients are reported in the English literature. Whether a platelet count of 100，000/uL is a justified threshold for withholding IVT remains unclear. So， we report the case of an AIS patient with thrombocytopenia who received IVT，hoping to provide some advice for the management of such patients.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\nA 57-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension presented with left-sided weakness and transient loss of vision in the right eye for the past three hours. The patient denied any neck pain or trauma. Vital signs were notable for a blood pressure of 163/88 mmHg and a heart rate of58 bpm. Neurological examination revealed left-sided central facial palsy， left hypoglossal nerve palsy， left limb weakness， and left Babinski sign with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS) score of 4.

After IVT， the symptom of left-side facial palsy and hemiplegia disappeared with an improvement of NIHSS score to 0， but a partial right-side Horner’s syndrome with right mitosis and right ptosis was observed. To clarify the cause and artery stenosis， the patient had brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and cerebral Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) at 24 hr after symptom onset. MRI showed AIS in the head of the right anterior limb of the internal capsule . DSA disclosed mild stenosis and dissecting aneurysm in the initial position of the right Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) . The dissecting aneurysm was confirmed by cervical Magnetic Resonance Angiography(MRA) . 24 hr after IVT， anti-platelet therapy was strengthened with 100 mg of aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel per day for 3 months. Subsequently， stenting of the right ICA was performed to avoid recurrence of cerebral infarction. The Horner's删除1换行syndrome disappeared， and the blood flow of right ICA normalized after the stenting . The patient had later resumed work without neurological deficits after being discharged. Three months later the platelet count had increased to 88，000/uL and anti-platelet therapy was changed to aspirin 100 mg daily for lifelong.\n\n【9】Discussion and Conclusion\n\nPrior studies reported the rate of having unsuspected platelet count of less than 100，000/uL at stroke presentation to be only 0.3%通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. However， both of these studies were conducted in the U.S population and excluded known thrombocytopenia patients. Another Chinese study showed that having a platelet count of below 100，000/uL was common in Southwestern part of China， such as Chengdu 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The mechanism leading to normalization of platelet count after stroke in our patient with thrombocytopenia was unclear. It is possible that thrombocytopenia was acutely caused by stroke. More detailed investigation is needed on the incidence of thrombocytopenia in|删除段之间换行|Chinese stroke patients.\n\n【11】Platelet count is associated with the risk of bleeding. Generally， those with platelet counts between 30，000 and 50，000/uL may note easy bruising， whereas platelet counts above 50，000/uL are usually discovered incidentally 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Considering the risk of bleeding complications， thrombocytopenic patients are usually excluded from IVT and hence there is very limited data regarding the safety of IVT in thrombocytopenic stroke patients. Whether a platelet count of 100，000/uL is a justified threshold for withholding IVT remains unclear. We often encounter cases with uncertainty regarding management， for which high-quality data are not available. For these cases， clinical decisions must be made on an individual basis. Based on the scanty literature available on this subject， we would recommend thrombolytic therapy for an ischemic stroke patient with a platelet count of between 50，000/uL and 100，000/pL，provided there is no evidence of a bleeding diathesis.\n\n【12】Grants Details删除1换行i) Clinical Vascular Grant In Chinese Physician 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2017-CCA-VG-029)</u>； ii) Independent Fundation of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu Medical College 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. CYFY2017DL06)</u>； iii) National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81870940)</u>； iv) Sichuan Science and Technology Program (No.2018JY0026)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Record as of August 29h，2021； The COVID-19 pandemic worldwide in a total confirmed number of cases， 216 million cases， and 4.49 million cases of death. In Taiwan， 15，954 in a total number of diagnosed cases and 833 cases of death. Making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in severe global social and economic disruption； it has exacerbated widespread supply shortages by panic buying， agricultural disruption， food shortages， and decreased emissions of pollutants. As a result， numerous educational institutions and public areas have been partially or fully closed， restricted freedom of daily life activities， and canceled or postponed many events. Furthermore， delayed the illness patients treatment on schedule or the limitation of medical supplies due to shortage of production materials， local or international traffic transportation， etc.， has led to the删除1换行potential of life-threatening issue of ethics chaos. Misinformation has circulated through social or mass media； the political tensions have evenexpanded internationally. In addition，the pandemichastriggered racial and geographic discrimination and the balance between public health requirements， ethics， and individual rights. Initially， it is manifesting in the respiratory system. Most people under infection with COVID-19 usually experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment. However， severe illness with life threatening may appear and require medical intensive care attention. It can occur wider in systemic complications， such as neurology， gastrointestinal， cardiovascular， thromboembolic coagulation， and immune system， leading to multiple organ dysfunction. Therefore， the need for vaccines to prevent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) infection is considered the method as the light in the dark for controlling the pandemic worldwide. COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild， short-term adverse effects， such as low-grade fever， joint or muscle pain， or redness at the injection site； mostly， symptoms subside within days. The possibility of severe or long-lasting adverse effects of vaccines can occur but is extremely rare.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】We report two cases，one of a 64-year-old female with the medical history of adenocarcinoma of lung over left upper lobe status post lobectomyofleft upperlobe and mediastinal lymph node dissection in2012， pT2aN0M0， stage IB， under oral chemotherapy with UFUR for2 years； complicated with supraclavicular lymph node metastasis and EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation status post supraclavicular lymph node excisional biopsy in February 2018， ypT2aN3M0， stage IIIB， under target therapy with Iressa till present days in 2021.

In Taiwan， the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273， Spikevax) and Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine(AZD-1222，adenovirus ChAdOx， Vaxzevria) have received use authorization. After reviewing the literature， ipsilateral injection side axillary lymphadenopathy has been reported. SWENI et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> report five cases undergoing FDG PET-CT demonstrating various uptake patterns， including an ipsilateral deltoid muscle， axillary， supraclavicular， and subpectoral lymph nodes post COVID-19 vaccination. In addition， Rebecca et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> report a false positive as found in the FDG PET/CT scan compared to ultrasound exam in the left axilla of a woman treated for metastatic breast cancer after COVID-19 vaccination， which indicated no metastasis， and the lymphadenopathy was likely due to an immune response following the COVID-19 vaccination. Finally， Balraj et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> report a case that developed left (ipsilateral) axillary and pectoral lymphadenopathy detected on FDG PET/CT scan 3\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】We report two cases with lung adenocarcinoma who were underwent imaging with Positron Emission Tomography (FDG PET/CT) scan for diagnosis staging， has found to have hypermetabolic uptake (SUVmax： 5.3) in the dominant vaccinated side of deltoid muscle of ipsilateral left axillary level I-III lymph nodes due to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273，Spikevax) administrated one month ago before FDG PET/CT scan. Therefore， detailed history regarding COVID-19 vaccination inoculation time and injected arm should be obtained before imaging to ensure the accuracy of the staging/restaging， inform patients of potential false-positive results to reduce patient anxiety， and avoid unnecessary biopsy following the COVID-19 vaccines have become widely available， especially in oncology patients， to prevent the possibility of a misdiagnosis.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1.

A third or more of people with Diabetes (DM) might developed DR. As a result， the purpose of this study was to evaluate adult diabetic patients knowledge about diabetes retinopathy and its complications in Sana'a， Yemen. On this foundation， we also suggest using a public health strategy to combat DR in the researcharea.\n\nMethods： At the Al-Kuwait University Hospital and the National Center of Public Health Sana'a(NCPHL)， a cross-sectional study was conducted. After receiving informed consent， responses from 885 people (men and women) with DM were gathered using a validated questionnaire. The goal of the questionnaire was to measure respondents' level of knowledge with DR， its detection， prevention， and treatment. The results of the questionnaire were then used to see whether there was a correlation between the individuals characters and their level of DR awareness|删除段之间换行|Results： About 59% of the respondents have heard about DR. 46% of them correctly defined DR as one of the complications of DM that could cause blindness， whereas 208 (23.5%) knew that DR is related to damage to retinal vessels and 186 (21%) to high blood sugar due to uncontrolled diabetes.285 (32.2%) had a good level of knowledge， while 67.8% showed a poor level of knowledge of DR. There was a better level ofknowledge with male patients (37.3% vs. 27.1% for females)， younger age(18-30 years) (42.2%，OR=1.5，p=0.03)，and college graduate patients (75.7%， OR=11.2，p=0.0001). Older than 50 years old， widowed， divorced， and illiterate and those who attained high school education or less， showed poor levels of knowledge equal to 73%，79.3%，83.3%，93.7%，and 74%， respectively， with significant p=0.05.\n\n【3】Conclusion： In this study， most patients indicated insufficient levels of awareness regarding DR. This lack of proper understanding was connected with low levels of education， female sex， and older ages. Additionally， there was a lack of compliance with routine eye inspections. These findings are of major concern； hence， the implementation of efforts to enhance the knowledge of DR and the significance of early retinal screening among affected patients is very vital. Health education campaigns should engage schools， as a portion of the community may not be able to acquire a higher education. Additionally，a comprehensive strategy of mandated referrals to ophthalmologists should be introduced by general practitioners throughout Yemen. Eventually， screening methods for DR ought to be adopted.\n\n【4】Keywords： Blindness； Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)；Diabetes Mellitus (DM)； Knowledge\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Diabetes， often known as diabetes mellitus， is a set of common endocrine illnesses defined by sustained high blood sugar levels 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. Diabetes is caused by either the pancreas not making enough insulin or the cells of the body not responding effectively to the insulin produced 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Diabetes， if left untreated，leads to several health issues， one of which is Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)， which is a leading cause of blindness 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. As of 2021， an estimated 537 million individuals worldwide have diabetes， accounting for over 10% of the adult population， and type 2 diabetes accounts for around90% of all diabetes cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[5，6]</u>. The prevalence of the disease continues to increase， most dramatically in low- and middle-income nations 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Yemen is one of the countries with a greater prevalence of diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Yemen s diabetes prevalence was 5.4% in 2021， and there were 2，852.000 documented cases of diabetes in 2021 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Diabetic retinopathy is the primary microvascular consequence of删除1换行diabetes mellitus； in addition， Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a priority disease in the Vision 2020 effort for the global elimination of avoidable blindness. The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged its member nations to integrate a program strategy for DR within their prevention of blindness programs 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>.\n\n【7】In Yemen， the prevalence of DR was 55% (95% CI 49.6.60.1)， while the proportions of Background Diabetic Retinopathy (BDR)， Pre-ProliferativeDiabeticRetinopathy(PPDR)，Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR)， and diabetic macular edema were correspondingly 20%， 13%， 17%， and 22%. Blindness was 16%common among DM patients. Glaucoma and cataract incidence rates were respectively 34.3% and 8.6%通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In Yemen， diabetic individuals have relatively high rates of obesity， hypertension， and dyslipidemia通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， making them more prone to developing diabetic retinopathy. Therefore， our study seeks to evaluate the knowledge and awareness of the risk of diabetic retinopathy among adult diabetic patients in order to reduce the incidence of diabetic retinopathy and to improve the quality of life of diabetic patients.\n\n【8】Subjects and Methods\n\n【9】Study area： The proposed study was carried out in Sana'a， Yemen. The number of diabetics in the city of Sana a is estimated at 212，000通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Study conducted in September 2022.\n\n【10】Study design： A cross-sectional study was conducted at the National Center for Public Health Laboratories in Sana'a (NCPHL) and Kuwait Hospital in Sana a City targeting adult diabetic patients from Sana a city who were undergoing blood glucose tests at the two centers.\n\n【11】Sample size： Sample size was determined using epi info software version 7， according to a population survey. Taking into account later criteria， the population of Sana’a is 4，000，000 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. As previously reported in Yemen， the expected frequency of RP among DMs is equivalent to 50%通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>， and the worst accepted accuracy is equal to2.95% at a 95% confidence level. The sample size required to achieve meaningful results was 885 patients.\n\n【12】Data collection： The data was collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire contains 16 questions(8 questions related to demographic and clinical data， and 8 questions assessing the knowledge about diabetic retinopathy). In order to facilitate answering the questionnaire it has been translated to Arabic language.\n\n【13】Data analysis： Utilizing Statistical Epi-Info version 7， data were examined. The distribution of the sociodemographic characteristics and the diabetic patient's knowledge of DR were analyzed using descriptive statistics (frequency， percentages， and median). Each accurate response received one points toward the overall knowledge score， while incorrect or unknowing responses received zero. Scores over the median score 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> were thus seen as indicating a good level of knowledge. To further explore the connection between sociodemographic characteristics and the patient's knowledge of diabetic retinopathy， OR， 95% CI， and Chi-squared test were calculated. P values less than 0.05 were regarded as significant.\n\n【14】Ethical approval： On May 01， 2022， with the reference number2022-1， the Medical Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of Sanaa University issued its official approval. A permission form was signed by each study subject. The confidentiality of all information， including clinical details and patient identification，删除表格换行was maintained.\n\n| Characters  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | No  | %  |\n| Sex  |  |  |\n| Female  | 450  | 50.8  |\n| Male  | 435  | 49.2  |\n| Age (years)  |  |  |\n| 18-30  | 116  | 13.1  |\n| 31-50  | 327  | 36.9  |\n| >50  | 442  | 49.9  |\n| Marital state  |  |  |\n| Marriec  | 654  | 73.9  |\n| Single  | 115  | 13  |\n| Widow  | 92  | 15.7  |\n| Divorced  | 54  | 6.1  |\n| Educationallevel  |  |  |\n| Illiterate  | 221  | 25  |\n| High school or less  | 469  | 53  |\n| College graduate  | 185  | 20.9  |\n| Post graduate  | 10  | 1.1  |\n| Type of diabetes mellitus  |  |  |\n| Typel  | 165  | 18.6  |\n| Type ll  | 522  | 59  |\n| don't know  | 198  | 22.4  |\n| Duration of diabetes (years)  |  |  |\n| 1-5  | 307  | 34.7  |\n| 6-10  | 256  | 28.9  |\n| 11-15  | 142  | 16.05  |\n| >15  | 180  | 20.3  |\n| Number of visits to an ophthalmologist  |  |  |\n| None  | 283  | 32  |\n| Once every year  | 309  | 34.9  |\n| More than once time a year  | 168  | 19  |\n| Once every 2 years  | 89  | 10.1  |\n| Once every 5 years  | 36  | 4.4  |\n| History of eye disease  |  |  |\n| No  | 716  | 80.9  |\n| Yes  | 169  | 19.1  |\n\n【16】Result\n\n【17】A total of 885 adult diabetic study participants flled out the questionnaire. With an almost equal sex ratio， 50.8% of them were female. Nearly half (442/885， 49%) of the respondents were over 50， and about a third (36.9%) were between the ages of 31 and 50. The majority of respondents (654， or 73.9%) were married； 221 had never attended school； and 469， or 53%，had just completed high school. The majority (522，59%) of those with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) were type II patients， whereas just 165， 18.6%， had type I. Additionally， only180(20.3%) of the respondents had diabetes for a longer period of time than 15 years， compared to 307 (34.7% of the patients) who had删除表格换行impairment. Longer periods of diabetes over 5 years were associated with better awareness in Turkey 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. However， the current study did not reveal an association between the duration of diabetes and the level of consciousness . The American Diabetes Association recommends annual eye exams for people with type 2 diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. According to this report， just a small percentage of people actually go to an ophthalmologist for annual eye exams. Only 34.9% of the participants maintained annual attendance. Additionally， there was a strong correlation between the weaker knowledge levels and this poor attendance . One of the predisposing elements that influences behavior， such as participation in screening， is suggested to be an individuals awareness 通用删除6(英):<u>[251</u>. Our members' lack of knowledge may be the cause of their irregular eye exams. However， despite having a high level of awareness regarding the value of getting an eye checkup， other research found that patients lacked the drive to do so. Patients with diabetes all around the world appear to exhibit a similar gap between awareness and compliance when it comes to regular eye exams. According to some reports， just half of the patients in Myanmar 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> and two thirds of the Japanese patients showed up for a routine eye checkup 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. Additionally， a recent study in Turkey found that 77.3% of diabetes patients had previously undergone an eye exam， despite the fact that only 41.9% of these patients were aware that they should have annual eye exams 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. The low level of visits to the ophthalmologist in Yemen may be due to the unavailability of this service and its cost， which can be barriers that must be taken into account in Yemen， especially at this time when the war is still going on， which has caused the cessation of government medical services.\n\n【18】Table 1： Baseline characteristics of the study participants (N=885).\n\n【19】Table 2： Knowledge of the study participants about diabetic retinopathy (N=885).\n\n| Questions  | No  | %  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Have you heard about diabetic retinopathy?  |  |  |\n| No  | 363  | 41  |\n| Yes  | 522  | 59  |\n| Can you define diabetic retinopathy as a complication ofdiabetes that leads to vision loss?  |  |  |\n| No  | 478  | 54  |\n| Yes  | 397  | 46  |\n| Can you define diabetic retinopathy as a complication ofdiabetes due to damage to the retinal vessels?  |  |  |\n| No  | 677  | 76.5  |\n| Yes  | 208  | 23.5  |\n| Can you define diabetic retinopathy as a simple eyedisease caused by high blood sugar?  |  |  |\n| No  | 699  | 79  |\n| Yes  | 186  | 21  |\n| Do you think the older you get， the more susceptible youare to DR?  |  |  |\n| Don't know  | 435  | 49.2  |\n| No  | 90  | 10.2  |\n| Yes  | 360  | 40.7  |\n| What would you complain about if you had DR?  |  |  |\n| Pain  | 49  | 5.5  |\n| Blurred vision  | 274  | 31  |\n| Loss of vision  | 159  | 18  |\n| Don't know  | 403  | 45.5  |\n| What do you think is the worst effect of DR?  |  |  |\n| Recness  | 27  | 3.1  |\n| Pain  | 32  | 3.6  |\n| Blindness  | 363  | 41  |\n| Low vision  | 150  | 17  |\n| Don't know  | 313  | 35.4  |\n| Do you think DR is treatable?  |  |  |\n| No  | 81  | 9.2  |\n| Yes  | 309  | 34.9  |\n| Don't know  | 495  | 55.9  |\n\n【21】DM： Diabetes Mellitus； DR： Diabetic Retinopathy删除1换行the diagnosis 1 to 5 years earlier. While 309 (34.9%) of the subjects have visited the ophthalmology clinic in a year， 283 (32%)have never done so. Only 169 of these patients (19.1%) provided a history of eye disease， mostly cataract procedures .\n\n【22】Table 2 displays the study participants understanding of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). A little over 59% of those surveyed have heard of DR. 46% of them correctly identified Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) as one of the DM problems that can result in blindness， while 208(23.5%) and 186 (21%) were aware that DR is linked to retinal vascular damage. Of the study's participants， 435 (49.2%) were unaware that aging raises DR risk， while 40.7% were aware that aging increases susceptibility to DR. When questioned about DR problems，403 (45.5%) of the participants had no idea， compared to smaller percentages who correctly identified blurred vision (31%) and vision loss (18%). Less than half (41%) correctly recognized blin dness as the worst complication of DR. About third (34.9%) correctly reported that DR is a treatable condition， while 55.9% did not know that.\n\n【23】The score for all of the knowledge was determined. It had a score range of 0 to 8， with a median of 4 (IQR=2-6). Good levels of knowledge were defined as values above the median. As a result， 285(32.2%) had a good level of understanding， whereas 67.8% displayed a poor level . Table 3 displays the correlation between knowledge level and sociodemographic information， diabetes type， duration， and number of ophthalmologist visits. Male patients had a higher level of knowledge， with a good level of 37.3% vs. 27.1%for female patients， and an odds ratio of 1.6， CI=1.2-2.1， p=0.0009. Additionally， respondents between the ages of 18 and 30 had a higher rate of good levels (42.2%)， OR equal to 1.5， CI=1.03-2.3， and p=0.03. Patients who had graduated from college had higher levels of knowledge； the good level was 75.7%， and the odds ratio for having good knowledge was 11.2， with a confidence interval of 7.6 to 16(p=0.0001). Additionally， postgraduate patients had a higher level of knowledge， with a good level of 90%， and a good level of knowledge was related with an odds ratio of 18.3， CI=2.3-14.5， p=0.0001. Additionally， type I diabetes patients had a higher level of knowledge， with a good level at 41.2%， and a good level was related with an odds ratio of 1.5， CI=1.1-2.1， p=0.01. Additionally， type II DM patients had a higher level of knowledge， with a good level of knowledge at36.4%， and an odds ratio of 1.4， CI=1.1-1.8， p=0.02 was related with a good level of knowledge. Older than 50， widowed， divorced， illiterate， and those who had just completed high school shown poor level of knowledge equal to 73%，79.3%，83.3%，93.7%，and 74% respectively with significant p<0.05. Additionally， individuals who were unsure of their diabetes type demonstrated a higher level of ignorance (86.4%with p<0.0001). Patients who did not see an ophthalmologist also had a lower degree of knowledge， which was 86.9% with a p value of0.0001 .\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】Being aware of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a critical first step in the early detection， diagnosis， and treatment of this condition. One of the leading causes of blindness and reduced vision bothinternationally and in Yemen is diabetic retinopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>. Therefore， the current study's implications for community health planning are absolutely crucial 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14</u>.\n\n【26】This study showed that 32.2% of DM patients had a good level of knowledge， while the majority (67.8%) showed a poor level of knowledge. The level of awareness of DR reported in our study is much lower than the levels reported in Jordan， where approximately80% of diabetic patients were aware of the nature and consequences ofDR 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Also， our result (32.2%) was even lower than the reported levels in Al-Ahsa， Saudi Arabia， where 66.6% of diabetic patients knew the nature and outcome of their diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. The existence of a well-established national eye health care program and referral standards related Diabetic Mellitus (DM) and DR management for primary care， according to the authors， is what accounts for the high awareness of DR in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Patients are referred for an eye examination once a diagnosis of DM has been made， despite Yemen's lack of a national eye health care program. A similar improvement in DR awareness was noted in Jeddah， Saudi Arabia(82%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>， and Malaya， Malaysia (86%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.

Cetin et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> conclusion that Turkey's lack of suitable knowledge and behavior for the management of DR is comparable to these findings. Furthermore， knowledge of ocular complications of uncontrolled DM and how to prevent them was very low among Saudi DM patients in Al-Ahsaa and Hispanic people， where only one-third ofparticipants who had recently been diagnosed and half of those who had had their diabetes diagnosed more than a year prior were aware that uncontrolled diabetes could result in eye disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，21]</u>.删除2换行about DR in the current study was their low levels of education.

The study reports the case of a 54-year-old male who presented with post Trans Arterial Chemoembolization(TACE) residual/recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). He had a history of hepatitis C for10 years. Dynamic MRI showed two distinct lesions， one located in caudate lobe and another in segment VII. The lesion in caudate lobe showed delayed and prolonged peripheral enhancement with non-enhancing central component. The segment VII lesion showed faint arterial phase enhancement which persisted in portal venous phase without any washout. Patient was scheduled forliver transplantation. On histopathologythe larger lesion showed spindle cells arranged in sheets having pleomorphic vesicular nuclei. Immunohistochemistry was positive for vimentin， AFP， Ck8/18， Pan Ck， desmin and myogenin and thus a diagnosis of sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma was established. Microscopy of segment VII lesion was consistent with high grade dysplastic nodule. This case describes the imaging features of sarcomatoid HCC and highlights the importance of histopathology and immunohistochemistry in final diagnosis.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Sarcomatoid Hepatocellular Carcinoma is a rare neoplasm of liver comprising carcinomatous and sarcomatous components. It commonly develops in patients with background of alcoholic cirrhosis， chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus infection. A close relationship has been seen between the sarcomatous appearance in HCC and anticancer therapies. It has very poor prognosis due to high grade on histology and a higher rate of recurrence or metastasis. Therefore identifying this type is important for patient management and treatment planning. Herein， we present a case of sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma. A detailed review of CT and MRI imaging characteristics with histopathological and immunohistochemical features are also discussed.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\nA 54-year-old male patient was referred to our hospital for liver transplantation. He had a past medical history of hepatitis C which was detected in 2009 for which he was not taking any treatment. He subsequently developed abdominal distension and was found to have Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) related cirrhosis in 2017. He was kept on diuretics and antiviral therapy. He developed sustained virological response to HCV in 2019. He was doing well six months back when he developed loss of weight and weakness for which he was evaluated and found to have Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) in segment V in outside hospital (Images not available). Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP)level was elevated measuring 5368. According to the records he underwent Trans Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) in august 2019 after which he developed sub capsular hematoma. He was managed conservatively for hematoma. A repeat CT was done there one month later which revealed background parenchymal cirrhotic changes， splenomegaly， splenic hilar and paraesophageal collaterals. A complex solid cystic lesion measuring 9.4 cm x 5.8 cm x 6.7 cm was noted in caudate lobe showing some soft tissue enhancement in delayed phases . Possibility of residual or recurrent tumor was suggested and he was referred to our hospital. On admission his general physical examination was normal. Vital parameters were unremarkable. Laboratory tests revealed elevated AFP (846； normal<10 ng/ml) and Protein induced by vitamin K absence-II PIVKA II (744.17； normal 17.36 mAU/ml to 50mAU/ml). Biochemical indices of liver functions revealed mildly elevated SGOT (105； normal 15IU/L to 37 IU/L)， ALP (196； normal 50 IU/L to 136 IU/L) and GGT (162； normal5 IU/L to 85 IU/L). Coagulation profile was deranged with elevated Prothrombin time (16； normal 11 sec to 13 sec) and fibrinogen (471； normal 200 mg/dl to 400 mg/dl). Antibody panel revealed non-reactive status for|删除段之间换行|HbsAg， positive for HBcAb， reactive for HCV Ab and negative for HDV IgG. HBV DNA titer was <20 and titer for HCV RNA was <15. Rest of the biochemical investigations， ECG and echocardiography were unremarkable.Arepeat contrast MRI was done with hepatobiliary specific contrast agent. The scan revealed background cirrhotic changes. Previously mentioned complex solid cystic lesion in caudate lobe appeared hetero-intense on T1/T2 with progressive delayed phase enhancement of peripheral solid component. Central\n\n【6】Segment VIl nodule is alsa seen on liver surface (arrow).\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) with spindle cell component has been referred to as sarcomatoid carcinoma. The pathogenesis of sarcomatoid carcinoma is not clear. There is a continuous debate on whether it is derived from the transition of an ordinary HCC to a sarcomatous morphology or it is a synchronous HCC and hepatic sarcoma. Presence of transitional features from HCC to spindle cell component and vimentin expression in the spindle cell on histopathology favors the dedifferentiation theory of sarcomatoid transformation in HCC 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>.\n\n【9】It mainly occurs in elderly patients. The cumulative incidence is 0.79%. The risk factors include cirrhosis， chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C and are same like non sarcomatoid HCC通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. KojiroM et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> have shown close relationship between the sarcomatous appearance in HCC and anticancer therapies. The developmentofthe sarcomatous appearance is presumed to be caused by the phenotypic change of HCC cells caused by anticancer therapy accelerating the proliferation of the sarcomatous cells existing in the original tumor as one of the histological components. The evidences suggesting this relationship are however poor in literature and there have been studies demonstrating its occurrence without any prior exposure to anti-cancer therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\n\n【10】Our patient also had history of hepatitis C infection for 10 years. He subsequenty developed cirrhosis and HCC. Development of sarcomatoid HCC after TACE is in keeping with the relationship of TACE and sarcomatoid HCC described in literature.\n\n【11】Sarcomatoid HCC is known to exhibit central necrosis and hemorrhage owing to its rapid growth and poorly differentiated morphology. Imaging findings on CT and MRI are in keeping with this growth pattern. The typical imaging features on CT include peripheral ring-like enhancement and central non-enhancing region. The peripheral enhancing tissue represents viable neoplastic tissue with fibrous stroma， and internal unenhanced region correspond to coagulation necrosis and hemorrhage. The peripheral enhancing tissue shows delayed and prolonged enhancement which correlates with extensive interstitial space allowing slow diffusion of contrast between vascular and interstitial spaces. The type of enhancement pattern is also seen in hemangiomas， metastases and in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma however， the delayed peripheral enhancement is more commonly seen in sarcomatoid HCC通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>.\n\n【12】On MRI，sarcomatoid carcinomashowslobulated OI irregular shapes. It shares few imaging features with intrahepatic删除1换行cholangiocarcinoma like lobulated shape， rim-like arterial-phase hyper enhancement， large necrotic area (if the lesion is large)， delayed central enhancement (if the lesion is small)， biliary dilatation and intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastases， although targetoid appearance or capsular retraction are less common than in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【13】In present case the large lesion in caudate lobe showed typical imaging features of sarcomatoid HCC. Progressive peripheral enhancement was seen on both CT and MRI images. Central part didn't enhance suggesting central necrosis.\n\n【14】On histopathologythesarcomatoid HCC demonstrates transitional features between sarcomatoid tumor and ordinary HCC. Immunohistochemical study for vimentin， cytokeratin， alpha fetoprotein and epithelial membrane antigen are helpful in the pathological diagnosis. It has been seen that sarcomatoid lesions are positive for both cytokeratin and vimentin which are the markers of epithelial and mesenchymal tissue respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The tumor in the present case was diffusely positive for vimentin and alpha-fetoprotein， which is consistent with sarcomatoid HCC.\n\n【15】Similar histopathological findings were seen in present case.On microscopy the large tumor showed a neoplasm with spindle cell arranged in sheets having pleomorphic vesicular nuclei， prominent nucleoli and moderate cytoplasm. On IHC the neoplastic spindle cells were positive for vimentin， AFP， Ck8/18， Pan Ck， desmin and myogenin.\n\n【16】It has very poor prognosis. There are higher chances of lymph nodeand distant metastasis. There are high chances ofearlyrecurrence even after curative therapy， such as RFA， surgical resection， or liver transplantation. Study done by Liao et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> estimated that 1， 3， and 5 vear recurrence-free survival rates of sarcomatoid HCC were50.0%，15.0%， and 5.0% as compared to 83.0%， 44.3%， and 22.6% for the non-sarcomatoid group. The clinical importance of this diagnosis lies in the fact that it is an independent predictor of recurrence after curative treatment and all-cause mortality.\n\n【17】There was no recurrence seen in follow up MR imaging done after1month of post transplantation. He is advised another follow up scan after 6 months.\n\n【18】In conclusion，sarcomatoid HCC is an aggressive tumor with high recurrence rate and tendency for rapid growth. It should be suspected whenever there is history of TACE therapy. The typical imaging features should prompt the diagnosis although the final word is from tissue sampling and intensive immunohistochemical analysis.\n\n【19】Learning Points\n\n【20】1. The risk factors for sarcomatoid HCC include cirrhosis， chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C and are same like non sarcomatoid HCC.\n\n【21】2 The typical imaging features on CT include delayed and prolonged peripheral ring-like enhancement and central non-enhancing region.\n\n【22】3. On histopathology the sarcomatoid HCC demonstrates transitional features between sarcomatoid tumor and ordinary HCC. Generally， components of sarcomatoid lesions are positive for both cytokeratin (epithelial marker) and vimentin (mesenchymal marker).\n\n【23】4.

The aim of this video is to describe a step by step video presentation of the surgical and reconstructive procedure.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 46-year old woman， previous stage IA vaginal carcinoma treated with radiotherapy. Two years after， she has a 5 centimeters centropelvic relapse that compromises pelvic organs， no pelvic wall infiltration or metastasis. A totaltype I pelvic exenteration with vulvectomy is performed. The surgical procedure involves four steps： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> diagnostic laparoscopy， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> laparoscopic total supraelevator pelvic exenteration with perineal-rectal vaginal resection， (3d) urinary (Bricker's technique) and digestive (colostomy) diversions performed extracorporeally， (4h) pelvic floor reconstruction with a biological mesh and bilateral gracilis myocutaneous flaps as a neovagina. Post-surgical minor complications were superficial ischemia of gracilis flaps，pyelonephritis， and recurrent pelvic abscess. The tumor was a high grade invasive squamous carcinoma with lymphovascular invasion and free surgical margins but microscopic residual tumor in the parametrium. Due to complications， adjuvant treatment could not be performed； the patient had a metastatic relapse a year later， she died. The radical excision of locally advanced gynecological cancers may produce a wide defect of perineal tissue that predisposes to complications， so pelvic floor reconstruction is recommended.\n\n【3】Discussion： Morbidity is close to 50%， OS and DFS 40 and 60% respectively. Prognostic factors are residual tumor， tumor size greater than 5 cm and lymph node involvement. Surgical rescue by pelvic exenteration should be seen as part of a multidisciplinary and experienced team.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Laparoscopy in pelvic exenteration is feasible in selected cases and reconstruction procedure should include proper handling of the pelvic floor.\n\n【5】Keywords： Laparoscopy； Minimally invasive surgery； Pelvic exenteration； Pelvic floor reconstruction； Vaginal carcinoma\n\n【6】Highlights\n\n【7】Minimal invasive surgery is technically feasible in selected patients.\n\n【8】Laparoscopic approach provides excellent local tumor control with low morbidity.\n\n【9】Multidisciplinary expert teams should perform it.\n\n【10】The main objective is free resection margins with no residual tumor.\n\n【11】A correct reconstructive procedure reduces complications improving quality of life.\n\n【12】Introduction\n\n【13】Total pelvic exenteration involves resection en-bloc of the tumour and pelvic organs affected followed by reconstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Pelvic exenteration remains the only therapeutic option in recurrent or persistent gynecological malignancies， after chemoradiation failed 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Most common indications for pelvic exenteration in woman are tumors of the uterine cervix， but it can be any pelvic tumor origin 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>.\n\n【14】Case Presentation\n\n【15】A 46-year-old woman， stage IA vaginal non-squamous cell carcinoma treated with external radiotherapy and brachytherapy.24 months after she had a five centimeters centropelvic relapse that compromised pelvic organs， without infiltration of the pelvic wall or distant metastasis . Surgical treatment was indicated and the patient was qualified for total type I pelvic exenteration with immediate reconstruction.\n\n【16】The surgical procedure involves four steps：\n\n【17】1. Diagnostic laparoscopy. We conducted a 4-port access (10mm umbilical trocar， 5 mm two side and one central trocars). Findings： an eight centimeters vaginal tumour that destroys the cervix and spreads to rectovaginal septum， posterior and right sides of the uterus and right side of the bladder. No abdominal spread.\n\n【18】2. Laparoscopic total supralevator pelvic exenteration with perineal-rectal resection. Abdominoperineal resection of the female genital tract en-bloc with adyacent pelvic organs such as the distal urinary tract (urethra， bladder and ureters) and the anorectum. The surgical procedure included a radical cystectomy and urethrectomy， radicalhysterectomy withdouble anexectomy， partial-central resection of the levator ani muscle， complete resection of sigma-rectum-anus and vulvo-perineal area with vaginectomy . A 12 mm trocar access was needed for the endocutter. Intraoperative biopsy margins of the pelvic wall were negative (R0).\n\n【19】3. Urinary and bowel reconstruction. Urinary diversion type Bricker and right ileostomy. The ureters are anastomosed directly into one end of the ileum， and the other end of the ileum is brought out to the level of the skin. Digestive derivation with a left colostomy. A minilaparotomy was necessary.\n\n【20】4. Perineal and pelvic reconstruction. The empty pelvic dead space predisposes to abscesses， fistula and intestinal obstruction， so the pelvic floor reconstruction is recommended. The pelvic defect was covered with a biological mesh and vulvoperineal-rectal resection with bilateral gracilis myocutaneous flap and neovagina.\n\n【21】Post-surgery complications were superficial ischemia of gracilis flaps， pyelonephritis and recurrent pelvic abscess.\n\n【22】The tumor was a high grade invasive squamous cell carcinoma with lymphovascular invasion and masive infiltration. Free surgical margins but microscopic residual tumor in the parametrium (R1). Due to complications adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and concomitant pelvic radiotherapy was not performed， the patient died a vear later because of disseminated disease.\n\n【23】Discusion\n\n【24】Although laparotomy is the most used technique， laparoscopic or laparoscopy-vaginal assisted pelvic exenteration followed by reconstruction can be performed in selected cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Explorative laparoscopy prior to exenterative surgery is an effective procedure for evaluation of patients who were candidates for exenteration and avoids unnecessary laparotomy ifextended disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【25】Magrina describes two classifications for pelvic exenteration， four groups： anterior， posterior， total or extended (exenterative procedures requirind additional resection of tissues like small bowel， bone， groin nodes or soft tissue) and three levels of resection： type I[supralevator]， type II (infralevator) and type III (with vulvectomy or perinectomy) 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\n\n【26】The surgery is carried out with a curative intention， aiming the excision of the tumor with microscopic free margins. Few exenterative procedures are performed for palliation of intractable local symptoms. Actually surgical contraindications are sciatic foramen tumor involvement or invasion of the pelvic sidewall， bulky retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis， extrapelvic metastatic disease and no good general condition 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，6]</u>. Inclusion criteria for pelvic exenteration include biopsy confirming recurrent pelvic carcinoma， no extrapelvic disease and good performance status. For Pomel et al， the ideal selected patients for laparoscopic approach were： small centropelvic recurrence less than 5 cm without pelvic sidewall involvement， BMI less than 30 kg/mand no need to perform pelvic reconstruction 1\n\n【27】Morbidity is close to 50% due to urinary or digestive anastomosis and plastic reconstructive complications， with a global perioperative mortality of 5% 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. The five-year PFS is 35%，OS is between 40 to60% and DFS is 57% respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.

She was wheeled into the operating theatre after receiving 1 mg of intravenous midazolam. Non-invasive BP， electrocardiogram and SpO. were monitored. After preoxygenation， intravenous ketamine 2 mg/kg， fentanyl 2 ug/kg was administered. Anesthesia was maintained with 100% oxygen with a minimum alveolar concentration of 2% sevoflurane with spontaneous mask ventilation to ensure normocarbia. 0.5 ml/kg of0.2% Bupivacaine with 2 mg/kg of Tramadol was deposited in the lumbar epidural space (L2-3) after adequate sterile precautions. She received adequate intravenous fluid and 15 mg/kg of Paracetamol to supplement intraoperative analgesia.

The pathophysiology of this complex lesion depends upon the pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio (Qp/Qs) that occur via the MAPCA's 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. On evaluation， our child belonged to the subset of MAPCA with suprasystemic pressures in the pulmonary vasculature (Qp/Qs >1) and thus was deemed inoperable. For the planned surgical procedure， a simple anesthetic plan was framed with minimal perturbations of the systemic and pulmonary vasculature and avoidance of cardiac and respiratory depression. The basic cardiac grid was followed which included maintaining normal range of heart rate and rhythm with euvolemia and multimodal analgesia， cardiac contractility was ensured with meticulously managing anesthetic agents and volume status. Ketamine with sympathomimetic effect increased SVR， HR and cardiac output. PVR was maintained low to optimal by avoiding triggers such as pain， hypoxia， hypercarbia and positive pressure ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. This was achieved with Midazolam used to calm preoperatively. Fentanyl， Paracetamol and Epidural analgesia-complemented the pain management plan. Fraction of inspired Oxygen saturation -0.75-1% was constant.\n\n【19】Spontaneous ventilation wasensured to avoid airwayinterventions that could increase PVR. Sevoflurane was titrated according0hemodynamic response andexpiratory gas concentration. Postoperative care should preferably be provided in the intensive care unit， which can facilitate invasive monitoring and early intervention.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】In conclusion understanding the pathophysiological changes of the disease aided management decisions. In our case we found that single shot epidural analgesia supplemental mask anesthesia with careful cardiovascular monitoring was a successful approach in a PA/VSD/MAPCAs patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This study describes the evolution of a patient throughout his hospital stay. The subiect underwent intensive motor physiotherapeutic treatment， where his initial functional clinical condition was of total dependence to perform activities of daily living and motor skills. At the end of the treatment， there was a significant improvement in motor skills and functionality，highlighting the fundamental role of acutely initiated physiotherapy.\n\n【2】Keywords： Spinal cord； Motor physical therapy； Empyema； Infection\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Abscesses that are within the bone limits of the spine are rare and can expand and compress the spinal cord， thus causing symptoms of the most varied intensities， from minimal involvement to severe changes or permanent complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Proper diagnosis and treatment can prevent complications and achieve cure in many cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Both the diagnosis and management of epidural abscess， which often includes a surgical procedure for aspiration or drainage of the infectious process， have been greatly aided by the advent of modern imaging techniques， such as computed tomography and， especially， magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n【5】Spinal epidural abscesses are more common in the thoracolumbar areas， where the epidural space is larger and contains more adipose tissue， being more prone to infections 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>. Bacteria can gain access to the epidural space via the hematogenous route， by direct extension of the contiguous infected tissue or by direct inoculation into the spinal canal (for example， during spinal anesthetic procedures， epidural or cases of surgical approaches)通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【6】Approximately one-third of patients with spinal epidural abscess have no identifiable source. For the two-thirds who have identified the entry point for infection， the most common sites of origin are skin and soft tissue infections and spinal surgery complications； or even other invasive procedures， including epidural catheters that are left in place， usually for pain control 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\n\n【7】A large study carried out in a North American Hospital revealed that the incidence of this type of condition is very low； about 5.1 cases per 10，000 admissions 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The average age of onset of spinal epidural abscess is approximately 50 years and the prevalence seems to be higher between 50 and 70years， however it can occur at any age， with some studies showing a higher incidence for males 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\n\n【8】Back pain is the most common symptom and is present in 70% to 100% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Fever is an important diagnostic clue but is the classic finding most likely to be absent at presentation； when absent， it canlead to diagnostic delays or failures 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.Neurological deficits have been reported in up to half of the cases and include motor weakness， radiculopathy， and bowel and bladder dysfunction通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast (gadolinium) is the imaging test of choice because it is usually positive at the beginning of the infection and provides the best visualization of thelocation and extent of inflammatory changes 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\n\n【9】Importantlesions to be considered as a differential diagnosis include： bone or intervertebral disc degeneration，herpes zoster， metastatic tumors， discitis and osteomyelitis，in addition to nonspecific mechanical overloads 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【10】The ideal treatment principles for spinal epidural abscesses are reduction in size and elimination删除1换行of the inflammatory mass and eradication of the organism causing the pathology. These goals are usually achieved by a combination of surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>， in addition to physical therapy work for the functional recovery of the patient.\n\n【11】Irreversible paraplegia occurs in 4% to 22% of patients， and is， therefore， a condition that can cause severe sequela in patients通用删除6(英):<u>[4，12，13]</u>. There are limited data on the long-term post-treatment outcomes of patients with neurologic deficits. A study of 29 patients admitted to a tertiary spinal center with neurological deficits due to spinal epidural abscess showed that some patients show significant to moderate， long-term improvement in their motor function after completion of rehabilitation treatment通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>.\n\n【12】Spinal epidural abscess is a rare disease that often produces neurological and motor changes in affected patients， limiting their functional status， therefore having a great impact on the quality of life of affected patients. As the records of the rehabilitation processes of these conditions are extremely scarce， this case report aims to contribute with more data to enrich the scientific literature about what Physiotherapy can contribute to the recovery of affected individuals.\n\n【13】Methods\n\n【14】Report of the evolution of the physiotherapeutic treatment， performed in the inpatient unit of a private hospital， of a patient diagnosed with spinal epidural abscess. This work was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein， number 5，475，037. The participant agreed to carry out the study and signed the informed consent form.\n\n【15】Two physical therapy sessions were held daily， with an average duration of 40 min each session， for a period of 20 days， totaling 40sessions. There was an intercurrence， after the fourth session， where the patient remained for 3 days in the semi-intensive care unit due to treatment of pleural effusion， returning to the hospitalization sector and continuing the treatment.\n\n【16】The following instruments were used to record the evolution of the patient's clinical and functional status over the days： Medical Research Council Scale (muscular strength)， Perme Scale (functional mobility)， Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scale and Borg Dyspnea Scale. The subjective perception of effort is presented as an important strategy to control exercise intensity 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Therefore， the Borg scale was used to monitor the patient's degree of effort in each physical therapy session， aiming at the quality and safety of the treatment， where it was interrupted (when necessary -usually 1 min to 2 min) so that the patient， through the rest could recover energy and vital parameters to continue presenting favorable performance and in a safe way to motor stimuli.\n\n【17】Case Presentation\n\n【18】Characterization of the pre-intervention patient's evolution and on the day of hospital discharge\n\n【19】Pre-intervention： The patient presented1with tetraparesis， in which the right hemibody had grade 4 (minimum resistance overcomes) of muscle strength in all joints； left hemibody with grade1 (sketch of muscle contraction) for the ankle joint， 2 (not overcoming gravity) for the knee muscle groups and 1 for the hip. Grade 2 muscle strength for the entire upper limb， except for the elbow flexor muscles， which had grade 3 (overcomes gravity). Hypoesthesia was present from the left foot to the middle third of the left thigh， in addition to the left hand and forearm.\n\n【20】Perme Scale： 5\n\n【21】FIM Scale： Total =50. Isolating only motor/mobility aspects： 18\n\n【22】In the topic “Discussion” the values of the measuremenittS performed using the scales will be explained\n\n【23】Hospital discharge day： Right hemibody with full recovery of muscle strength， that is， grade 5.\n\n【24】Left hemibody： Global grade 4 (for all joints).\n\n【25】Perme Scale： 25\n\n【26】FIM Scale： Total= 94. Isolating only motor/mobility aspects： 76\n\n【27】Hypoesthesia present， but to a lesser grade (subjective sensation of the patient) and covering a lesser extent of the left lower limb(foot and knee). Table 1 allows a better visualization of the patient's mobility performance， showing the evolution of the condition before and after the physical therapy intervention.\n\n【28】Physiotherapy treatment\n\n【29】Initially， resistance exercises were performed for the right hemibody， assisted exercises for theleft hemibody， electrostimulation for dorsiflexors and quadriceps of the left hemibody， strengthening of the antigravity muscles of the lower limbs and trunk， in addition to trunk control in sitting position. In the first sessions， the patient did not have trunk control， that is， he could only remain in the posture with the help of the physical therapist， for a few seconds and in a semi-flexed posture， due to extreme fatigue and weakness of the muscles responsible for maintaining this posture. No protocol was established， where the choices， volume and intensity of the exercises were based according to the evolution of the patient's condition； in this way， physiotherapy was performed according to the specific needs of the patient， where his potential could be stimulated to the fullest.\n\n【30】Intervention intensities were monitored by the Borg Scale， where we allowed a gradation report of 15 on the scale， meaning moderate tiredness. Above that， we temporarily interrupted the session， untilhe was recovered to continue with the exercises in a safe and quality way.\n\n【31】As the sessions went by and after the puncture of the pleural effusion， the patient gradualy acquired more strength， physical conditioning and postural control， allowing the sessions to progress in terms of the physical therapy procedures used and their degrees of complexity. The patient was stimulated and trained to roll over， assume the sitting position from the supine one and fully master the sitting position， aiming at functional indepen dence.\n\n【32】In order for the work to be carried out safely and seeking to stimulate the orthostatic posture as soon as possible， from the seventh session onwards this work started to be done through a “stand-table\". Then we started to explore the beginning of gait training (change of steps - 3 meters)， first with the “stand-table”and， later， with a device that partially removes the body weight. This intervention allowed us to stimuli his organism in a precocious way， favoring an accelerated rehabilitation. Functional exercises such as sitting and删除表格换行standing training were also explored in order to develop strength and endurance of the lower limb muscles so that the ability to walk was enhanced. In addition， balance training was also emphasized. The motor evolution had been obtained at each session and the last 4physical therapy interventions were marked by gait training with full load (the patient could trained supporting 100% of his weight without the lifting device) but with the aid of a 4-wheel walker for more than200 meters， when he was discharged from the hospital.\n\n【33】Table 1： Comparison of the functional evolution of the patient before and after the physical therapy intervention.\n\n| Pre-intervention  |  |  | Post-intervention  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Perme  | FIM Total  | FIM Motor  | Perme  | FIM Total  | FIM Motor  |\n| 5  | 50  | 18  | 25  | 94  | 76  |\n\n【35】Discussion\n\n【36】Neurological recovery is dependent on multiple factors such as：Time of onset of symptoms and diagnosis， extension of the lesion， initiation of adequate treatment in an “early\"way， physical therapy from the acute moment ofthe clinical condition， among other factors. All this interferes both in the restoration of the normal physiology of the organism， the plastic capacity of the nervous system and the locomotor system to respond to the treatments instituted.\n\n【37】About 5 to 7 percent of patients with spinal epidural abscess die due to uncontrolled sepsis or other complications 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，7]</u>， showing the need for adequate and always monitored transdisciplinary interyention.\n\n【38】There are extremelylimited data on the long-term post-treatment outcomes of patients with neurologic deficits under this diagnosis. A long-term outcome report of 29 patients admitted to a tertiary spinal center with neurological deficits due to spinal epidural abscess showed that some patients had significant to moderate long-term improvement in their motor function after completion of rehabilitation treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>.\n\n【39】There are numerous studies on the significant and positive impact of physical therapy when started early in the hospital environment通用删除6(英):<u>[16，17]</u> (intensive care unit). Obviously， these studies are more limited from the point of view of the patients motor skills， since they are in a clinical situation that prevents more aggressive motor interventions.\n\n【40】However， there are no data in the literature regarding in-hospital physical therapy interventions (outside the intensive care unit environment) in cases of spinal abscesses， making the characterization of this case evolution a starting point to analyze the impact of motor physical therapy at a time acute and sub-acute of this nature and within the hospital environment (ward/rooms sector).\n\n【41】The Functional Independence Measure (FIMI)) records the severity of disability in rehabilitation patients； 13 items define impairments in motor functions and 5 items define impairments in cognitive functions. Separate analyzes of the items representing these two indicators show that the two distinct measures provide more useful information from the scale than a combined measure、therefore justifying their use separately in this study (as described in“Results\")， which showed improvement of the patient's functional status superior to its use as a whole. Combining FIM items into motor and cognitive groups is practical and offers good measurement characteristics. Table 1 describes the evolution of scores from 5 to25 on the Perme Scale. The score 5 means a clinical condition of restriction to the bed， and 25 characterizes the need for little help to perform functional activities， evidencing a significant evolution of the motor and functional condition of the patient studied. Such evolution was corroborated by the capture of data demonstrated by the FIM scale， where， initially， the patient had a score of 50 (Total FIM) and reached 94 on the day of hospital discharge. These data also删除1换行mean moving from a position of maximum dependence to perform activities of daily living to a situation of little dependence at the time of discharge.\n\n【42】This evolution becomes even clearer when we isolate the comparison of beginning and end of hospital physical therapy interventions taking into account only the motor part of the FIM scale， where the evolution was from 18 to 76. The maximum score that the FIM scale is of 126， when it is applied in its entirety and 91， when only the motor part is taken into account. Thus， the evolution of the patient in terms of percentage was from 40% to 74% of the total score that can be achieved when the total FIM is applied； and from19% to 83% of the maximum score that can be obtained when the motor FIM is applied.\n\n【43】Study Limitations\n\n【44】The present study has some limitations as it is a case report，thus not allowing the generalization of the results to other patients with the same diagnosis. The ideal would be to carry out a randomized clinical trial with long-term follow-up； however， the low incidence of these cases makes this type of study unfeasible.\n\n【45】Conclusion\n\n【46】Motor physiotherapy applied intensively to the hospitalized patient with spinal epidural abscess proved to be highly effective， showing a motor and functional condition of total dependence at the initial of the physiotherapy treatment to little dependence for the performance of basic activities of daily living， at the time of hospital discharge.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The case patient was diagnosed with SRS， showing Potter sequence as a kidney anomaly at birth， growth retardation， and body asymmetry during growth. Kidney anomaly is not included in the diagnostic criteria for SRS. Since imprinting disorder can have multi loci mutation， genetic testing is required even if the NH-CSS score is low.\n\n【2】Keywords： Kidney； Phenotype； Silver-Russell syndrome\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】A fetus may develop when there is very little amniotic fluid in the uterus (in utero)， leading to pregnancy and a rare condition named Potter syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The amniotic fluid supports， cushions， and protects a developing fetus. When there is very little amniotic fluid， normal pressure exerted on the fetus during pregnancy can cause adverse physical features， such as abnormal facial features or skeletal abnormalities. When oligo-anhydramnios develops in the early stages of pregnancy， the lungs become underdeveloped (pulmonary hypoplasia) and lead to severe breathing difficulties. Oligohydramnios is the cause of Potter syndrome， but many factors can cause oligohydramnios. It can occur due to following renal diseases： Bilateral Renal Agenesis (BRA)， atresia of the ureter or urethra that causes an obstruction of the urinary tract， polycystic or multicystic kidney diseases， renal hypoplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3]</u>.\n\n【5】Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS，OMIM#180860， also known as Russell-Silver Syndrome，RSS) is a rare condition， which causes prenatal and postnatal growth retardation 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. Currently， the clinical diagnosis of SRS is based on a combination of characteristic features. Molecular testing can confirm the diagnosis of SRS in around 60% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The clinical diagnosis of SRS is confirmed when a patient scores at least four out of six in the Netchine-Harbison Clinical Scoring System (NH-CSS). The physical characteristics of SRS are as follows：(i) Prenatal growth retardation，(ii) postnatal growth retardation， (iii) relative macrocephaly at birth， (iv) a protruding forehead，(v) body asymmetry， (vi) feeding difficulties， and/or a (vii) a low body mass index (BMI) 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The most common underlying molecular mechanisms of SRS are the loss of methylation on chromosome11p15 (11p15 LOM； it occurs in 30% to 60% of patients) and maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome7 (upd通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>mat； it occurs in ~5% to 10% ofpatients) 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. And SRS is imprintingdisorder. Imprinting disorders (IDs) are a group of congenital diseases characterized by overlapping clinical features affecting growth， development and metabolism， and common molecular disturbances， affecting genomically imprinted chromosomal regions and genes 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Imprinting disorders： a group of congenital disorders with overlapping patterns of molecular changes affecting imprinted loci.\n\n【6】Here， we report a case of SRS； this patient was born with the phenotype of Potter sequence and renal malformations. The study was approved by the Jeju National University Hospital， and written informed consent was obtained from the patient's parents.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 34-year-old woman， gravid 2， para 2， was transferred to our hospital at 25 6/7 weeks of pregnancy because she was diagnosed with oligohydramnios， and her fetus had severely restricted growth with no visible kidney in right renal fossa. We antenatally diagnosed the fetus with Potter syndrome. She had no family history， past medical history， or medication history.\n\n【9】At 35 4/5 weeks of pregnancy， a cesarean section was performed on the woman as she presented\n\n【10】Her Apgar scores were 5 at 1 min and 8 at 5 min after birth. Soon after her birth， it was found that the baby had tachypnea， with SpO. values of 50%. Therefore， a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) was applied to her nose in the neonatal intensive care unit. She was intubated endotracheally， and she received an artificial pulmonary surfactant. Moreover， a High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilator (HFOV) was connected to her because her gradually increased oxygen demand could be suspicious of pulmonary hypoplasia associated with oligohydramnios. In fact， the chest X-ray showed an increased haziness in both the lungs and pneumomediastinum. The findings of laboratory reports， which were obtained on day 3 of hospital stay， were as follows： White Blood Cells(WBC)， 15，800/uL (segmental neutrophil 46%， lymphocyte 36.3%)； hemoglobin， 15.4 g/dL； hematocrit， 42%， Platelets (PLT) 308，000/uL； albumin， 3.2 g/dL； total protein， 5.3 g/dL； total bilirubin， 5.9 mg/dL； aspartate aminotransferase， 38 IU/L， alanine aminotransferase，8 IU/L； blood urea nitrogen， 32.3 mg/dL； Creatinine (Cr)， 1.9 mg/dL； sodium， 136 mmol/L； potassium， 5.8 mmol/L； calcium， 9.0 mg/dL； phosphorus， 8.6 mg/dL； uric acid， 5.0 mg/dL； and Parathyroid Hormone(PTH)， 289.6 pg/ml. By performing ultrasonography of the kidney， we found that the right kidney was not visible， and the left kidney was hypoplastic with a size of 2.09 cm . Moreover， a rotational variation was observed in the left renal fossa. Byperforming X-ray of hips， we found that the ossific nucleus of the femur’s head was not visible and the left femur was relatively shorter in length. By performing an ultrasonography of hips， we detected the deficient bony acetabulum had an alpha angle of 46°when subjected to stress in the left hip joint. This indicates the occurrence of Developmental Dyplasia of the Hip (DDH) in the newborn.\n\nIt was confirmed that the newborn had Potter sequence， chronic kidney disease， and DDH； however， her urination was normal and pneumomediastinum gradually improved with medical intervention. On day 6 of hospital stay， she received synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation from HFOV. On day 7 of hospital stay， the ventilator was weaned off from the newborn. Renal replacement therapy was not provided despite azotemia. Nevertheless， the oral intake of the newborn had increased. Finally， the patient was|删除段之间换行|discharged at 3 months of age. (Weight 2720 g， -5.97 SD； height 46.5cm，-6.32 SD；head circumference 35.8 cm， -3.01 SD).\n\n【12】At 24 months of age， the weight gain of the infant was insufficient， and she also did not catch up on growth . (Weight 5.5 kg，-6.63 SD； height 74.1 cm， -3.60 SD；head circumference 43.5 cm，-2.64 SD) Therefore， genetic testing was performed at the hospital. Hypomethylation was detected in the H19-Differentially Methylated Region (DMR)， and the diagnosis of RSS was confirmed in the patient.\n\n【13】She is currently receiving growth hormones， has undergone cleft palate surgery， and is scheduled to be operated on at an orthopedic clinic due to a difference in low limbs of more than 2 cm.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】The well-known features of SRS are as follows： Small for gestational age， postnatal growth failure， and relative macrocephaly at birth， protruding forehead，body asymmetry， and feeding difficulty. In addition， various clinical symptoms may also be present in the patient. In this study， the patient was Small for Gestational Age(SGA) due to Intrauterine Growth Restrictions (IUGR) and the development of Potter sequence， which included clinical features such as oligohydoramnios and renal hypoplasia. The most common cause of Potter sequence is kidney abnormality， and this patient had hypoplastic kidney. Her left kidney size was also small in size. However， even after rectifying azotemia， she could not catch up with growth and her body asymmetry worsened with age. Although feeding difficulties were not observed， she had a protruding forehead， a triangular face， a delay in speech， and motor delay. In addition， cleft palate was also observed in the baby. According to NH-CSS classification， since it is based on growth status after 24 months， we subsequentlyperformed genetic testing on patients who did not catch up with growth to diagnose SRS.\n\n【16】Kidneyproblems are uncommon amongthe clinical feature ofSRS. According to a study published by Haslam structural abnormalities of kidney were observed in 5 cases. This study also included cases of horse shoe kidney， renal tubular acidosis， and chronic kidney disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Walking compared ICR1 hypomethylation and mUPD7， identifying horseshoe kidney and unilateral kidney hypoplasia only in mUPD7 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[11</u>J.\n\n【17】However， ours is the first case of Potter sequence. The consensus statement of SRS was published in 2017. In this statement， kidney problem was not included as an additional clinical feature of SRS 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【18】However， a characteristic kidney problem may occur due to following reasons： Firstly， the molecular finding of the patient删除1换行may include hypomethylation of H19/IGF2 IG-DMR gene， which results in reduced expression of paternal IGF2 and an increased expression of maternal H19. This causes growth restriction of the patient. However， previous studies have reported about numerous Copy Number Variants (CNVs) associated with 11p15.5 region； the phenotype is dependent on the size of CNVs， their location， and their parental origin 通用删除6(英):<u>[13，14]</u>.\n\n【19】Therefore， there is aPpossibility that various undisclosed phenotypes appear， depending on the location or size of CNVs involved.\n\n【20】Second， in a study conducted by Eggerman multi-locus genetic testing wasperformed on 571 SRS subjects 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. This study showed that7.1% of SRS children were diagnosed with ICR1 hypomethylation and other genetic mutations. A considerable number of 11p15-associated imprinting disorder patients show additional molecular findings. In addition， the various phenotypes may be shown depending on additional molecular findings.\n\n【21】Although ICR1 hypomethylation was detected in our patient， multi-locus genetic testing was not performed on our patient.\n\n【22】In addition， according to Schwaibold 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>，there are cases in which SRS and Sotos syndrome are diagnosed simultaneously. According to the article， this patient was determined through genetic testing， and although Sotos syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome， the child was severely short stature， and it was mentioned that further research is needed on the mechanism. Therefore， we only conducted SRS genetic testing for our case patient， but we cannot exclude the possibility of accompanying genetic diseases.\n\n【23】We reported the first case of an SRS patient with Potter sequence.

Adult intussusception accounts for 5% of all cases of intussusception and 1% to 5% of all cases of intestinal obstruction with ileocolic intussusception being the most common type in adults and there are few reported cases of jejunojejunal intussusception. Feeding Jejunostomy (F) is a simple surgical procedure for enteral nutrition， but it can develop complications that may require re-exploration and can be life-threating. Common complications include mechanical ones such as tube migration or dislocation， infection， gastrointestinal symptoms， fluid and electrolyte imbalances. However， intussusception is a rare complication. Herein， we presented a patient with gastric cancer who had received subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth-II reconstruction and feeding jejunostomy， and then developed jejunojejunal intussusception following the placement of feeding tube into the jejunum.\n\n【2】Keywords： Intussusception； Feeding jejunostomy； Gastric cancer； Subtotal gastrectomy； Bilroth-II reconstruction\n\n【3】Key Messages\n\n【4】Unlike in the pediatric population， intussusceptions in adults are usually caused by a pathological lead point and the placement of an intestinal tube for feeding purposes has been rarely reported as a cause of intussusceptions. Here， we showed the rare case of jejunojejunal intussusception following the placement of feeding tube.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Intussusception is defined as the proximal bowel invaginating into the distal bowel. Feeding Jejunostomy (FJ)， inserting a tube in proximal jejunum surgically， is for enteral nutrition. About90% of the intussusceptions in adults， a definitive organic lesion causing intussusceptions presents. The postoperative intussusceptions are a special entity that can be idiopathic， or associated with mucosal，intramural or extrinsic causes； the placement of a long intestinal tube for feeding purposes has been seldom reported as a cause. Here， we demonstrated that a case of adult intussusceptions caused by the placement ofthe feeding tube and discuss the diagnostic process and management.\n\nA 60-year-old female， diagnosed with gastric cancer， received laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy plus Billroth-II reconstruction and feeding jejunostomy in February， 2022. After surgery， she received adjuvant chemotherapy (mFOLFOX4) and supplementary enteral nutrition from feeding jejunostomy. Unfortunately， she developed intermittent vomiting for one week in April， 2022. Associated symptoms were nausea，anorexia，intermittent abdominalpain and absence of defecation. At first， she came to our emergent department. The laboratory studies showed leukocytosis， elevated CRP (C-Reactive Protein) and acute kidney injury. The abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) demonstrated target sign over proximal jejunum by axial plane  and pseudo-kidney sign by sagittal plane . In the high suspicion of jejunojejunal intussusception， exploratory laparotomy was performed. Intraoperatively， it revealed jejunojejunal intussusceptions and the lead point was kinked tip of the FJ . Enterolysis with reduction of intussusceptions were performed  and the feeding jejunostomy was taken-down ； thereafter， her symptoms gradually improved and she was uneventfully discharged from our hospital. Currently， she receives regular adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX4) for gastric cancer and no more episodes of adhesive bowel obstruction nor intussusceptions have been found so far. In summary of this case， the tip of feeding tube acts as the leading point during a peristaltic wave. An illustrated picture is|删除段之间换行|Discussion\n\nEnteral feeding is a preferable route for perioperative nutrition due to its trophic effects on the intestine， causing less bacterial translocation and low infective complications for patients with a disease of the upper digestive tract. FJ is a surgical procedure for enteral feeding and it is indicated as an additional procedure during a major upper gastrointestinal surgery， ifa complicated postoperative recovery is expected. There are many techniques， including open longitudinal Witzel，Stamm， needle catheter technique， percutaneous endoscopy and laparoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. However， it is not free from complications and some studies have quoted the complication rate could be up to 53.6%通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Jejunojejunal intussusceptions are one such|删除段之间换行|complication rarely reported in the medical literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. One series evaluating complications following jejunostomy tubes detected an intussusception rate of 1% in contrast radiographs 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\n\n【9】Intussusception is defined as the telescoping of the proximal segment of the gastrointestinal tract within the lumen of the adjacent segment. The presentation of adult intussusception may be revealed by more chronic or vague abdominal pain (71%)，nausea and vomiting(68%)， abdominal distension with partial obstruction (45%)， or a palpable mass at physical examination 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Adult intussusception also differs from the pediatric one in that it is most often associated with a pathological lead point. Depending upon the site of the lead point， they can be classified into entero-enteric， ileocolic， ileocecal， and colocolic 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The placement of an intestinal tube for feeding purposes has been rarely known to cause intussusception， accounting for only1% of all cases of intussusceptions 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Different theories have been proposed for intussusception caused by the placement of feeding tubes 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. The theories included that 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the tip of the feeding tube acting as the leading point and dragging the proximal segment over the distal segment during a peristaltic wave. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> retrograde peristalsis of the jejunum during episode of vomiting. 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the injecting force from the pump during feeding possibly dragging the bowel， causing删除1换行intussusception. 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> poorly built patients having reduced fatty tissue in the omentum and mesentery， which may allow the free movement of the bowel causing a predisposition to intussusceptions； and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> an increased caliber or a longer length of the feeding tube used in the bowel segment possibly producing intussusception due to distal tip migration. The diagnosis of FJ tube-induced intussusceptions is challenging as the clinical presentation is mostly nonspecific with no obstruction to the jejunostomy feeding. Moreover， the patients might be asymptomatic in 20% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. A Contract-Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) of the abdomen is the most sensitive imaging modality to detect intussusception. Imaging features suggestive of intussusception are a target or sausage-shaped soft tissue mass enveloped within an eccentrically located area of low density， referring to a bowel within bowel configuration. Additionally， it can provide other important information such as length and diameter of the intussusception， possible lead point， the type and location of intussusception， the presence of strangulation or partial or complete bowel obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. A short segment or transient intussusception caused by the FJ tube can be managed conservatively by changing the tube to a standard or short tube over a guidewire under fluoroscopic guidance or reduction by injecting air or contrast material through the tube； however， cases with long segment persistent intussusception with features of partial or complete obstruction or features of strangulation required operative intervention. Definitive management is the surgical exploration and manual reduction， or resection of the intussusception segment based on the intraoperative findings and bowel viability. Nevertheless，there is no single established management strategy and the decision should be individualized for each patient as per clinical scenario 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】A jejunojejunal intussusception is a rare complication following FJ； additionally， it is often nonspecific and requires a high index of suspicion. CECT is the most sensitive tool for diagnosing and detecting any complications. Though a conservative approach can be tried for simple transient cases， definitive surgical intervention is required for cases with obstruction or strangulation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Five months ago， shehad an assisted birth using a ventouse. She complained of amenorrhea and urinary retention. Ultrasound at the emergency department showed a spherical cavity in her vagina. A vaginal atresia resulted in an accumulation of old menstrual blood. This hematocolpos was surgically opened and normal anatomy of the vagina was restored. The vaginal atresia was the result of an injury of the birth canal that occurred during childbirth.\n\n【3】Conclusion： We present a rare case of acquired vaginal atresia resulting in a hematocolpos. It is of pivotal importance to inspect the birth canal for any injuries after childbirth. A woman’s recovery postpartum should always be observed by care givers. When the recovery is atypical or abnormal， physical examination or extra investigation should be considered.\n\n【4】Keywords： Amenorrhea； Vaginal atresia/vaginal obstruction； Hematometrocolpos/hematocolpos； Urinary retention\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Hematocolpos is an accumulation of menstrual blood in the vagina 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. When a vaginal and cervical occlusion occurs， accumulation of blood in the vagina and uterine cavity is present. This is known as a hematometrocolpos 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Both conditions commonly present due to congenital anomalies通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. It can also occur after injury of the vaginal wall， such as after an operation， radiotherapy， severe infection or childbirth. This is often referred to as acquired vaginal atresia or obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Acquired vaginal atresia is very rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Damage of the birth canal during labor occurs rather often通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. These injuries will heal in most cases with no to minor residual symptoms. It is important that an injury of the vaginal wall or perineum is recognized and treated correctly 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. If an injury is not recognized and therefore not treated properly， it can lead to scaring of the vaginal wall and perineum， leading to vaginal stenosis or atresia. We report a rare case of complete vaginal atresia secondary to an injury during childbirth.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 34-year-old woman， gravida 2， para 2， came to the emergency department after suffering for two days from abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant. She had a history of vaginismus. She delivered twice by ventouse because of non-progressive labor during the second stage and fetal distress. Both times a healthy infant was born. She had a normal recovery after her first delivery without any residual symptoms. After her most recent delivery， examination of the birth canal was challenging due to her vaginismus. It was difficult for her to relax and she experienced the examination as very painful. This made it difficult to repair the second-degree perineal rupture. The first days of the recovery of her perineal rupture were uneventful. During the first week's post-partum she developed urinary retention， which was treated by an indwelling urinary catheter. She also noticed difficulties with penetration during sexual intercourse. Her menstruation had not vet resumed， but she noticed monthly pain in the lower abdomen. She did not take contraceptives. During physical examination， she had diffused abdominal pain in the lower part of the abdomen without defense musculaire. During vaginal examination， an adhesion of the vaginal walls was seen， with normal external female genitalia. The abdominal ultrasound showed a spherical cavity\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Injury of the birth canal during childbirth is common 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. These injuries heal without complications if they are recognized and treated correctly. If not treated correctly， it can lead to scarring of the perineum or vagina. In rare cases， it can even lead to vaginal stenosis or atresia. It is important to have trained attendance at birth and a thorough inspection of the birth canal directly postpartum. If necessary， correct treatment of the lacerations has to be done 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Complete vaginal atresia postpartum is rare. Congenital causes of vaginal atresia have an incidence of 1 in 5.000-10.000 women 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Acquired vaginal atresia is even less common and they are mostly caused by injuries， infections or radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. A hematocolpos is mostly caused by a congenital obstruction of the vagina， such as an imperforate hymen， transverse vaginal septum or an atresia 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. These are also known causes of primary amenorrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Vaginal atresia is also described as a cause of secondary amenorrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Our patient was not breastfeeding； hence lactation amenorrhea was less likely 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【11】Probably as a result ofthe hematocolpos， our patient had an abnormal recovery with occurrence ofurinary retention. She had an indwelling urinary catheter for several weeks. The occurrence of urinary retention together with a hematocolpos is mostly described when an imperforate hymen is present 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. In this case report， we emphasize the importance of recognition of an abnormal recovery postpartum. Clues in this case were the amenorrhea， urinary retention and inability for penetration. When an abnormal recovery is suspected， physical examination and if necessary further investigation should be considered.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】In this case report we highlight the risk of a hematocolpos caused by vaginal atresia due to injuries of the vagina after childbirth. Therefore， we advise to carefully inspect the birth canal after childbirth and to be aware when a patient has an abnormal recovery. In those cases， additional physical examination should be considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

On follow-up at 18 months after HSCT，he did not require transfusion， other clinical features are normal and mRNA transcript levels are the same as that of healthy controls.\n\n【4】Conclusion： This study highlights the outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplant on clinical， biochemical， molecular， and SEC23B gene expression levels in a patient suffering from congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II in India.\n\n【5】Keywords： Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia (CDA)； Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant； SEC23B gene expression； Iron overload\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia (CDA) is a group of rare， hereditary disorders characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis， anemia， and iron overload. CDA patients usually show anemia of variable degrees， icterus， hepatosplenomegaly， and distinctive bone marrow features 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. There are three main types of CDA -CDAI， CDA II， and CDA III. Other rare forms of CDA are also known. The most common type among these is CDA type II. Patients suffering from CDAII show anemia， icterus， pallor， and hepatosplenomegaly. The requirement for blood transfusion is variable. Some severe cases require regular blood transfusions while others require infrequent blood transfusions. The inheritance pattern ofCDAII is autosomal recessive and is caused due to mutations in the SEC23B gene 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. It has been reported that mRNA expression levels of SEC23B are reduced in CDAII 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. CDA II is diagnosed mainly based on microscopic observation of bone marrow morphological features， and molecular analysis. According to the literature， the Mean Channel Fluorescence (MCF) in the Eosin-5-Maleimide (EMA) test used for diagnosis of red cell membrane protein defect is also low or in the grey area for CDAII. This is because of the hypoglycosylation of band 3 protein in the red cell membrane of CDAII patients. The differentiation between hereditary spherocytosis and CDAII can thus be made based on the CD44 antibody bin ding test 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>.\n\nThe disease is commonly managed with regular blood transfusion and iron chelation. In some cases，the number oftransfusions has been reduced using splenectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Currently，Hematopoietic|删除段之间换行|Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) is known to be the only curative option for CDA 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>. Some reports suggest the efficacy of HSCT， but the data from the literature is very rare. There are very few reports of CDAII in the Indian population. Here， we report a case of CDAII having severe anemia， requiring regular blood transfusion， diagnosed with bone marrow analysis， biochemical and molecular tests， and managed with a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. On follow-up， we also evaluated the effect of hematopoietic stem cell transplant on mRNAtranscript levels of the SEC23B gene in this patient.\n\n【9】Materialand Methods\n\n【10】Patient\n\n【11】A 5-year-old male child born of consanguineous marriage complaining of weaknessSandlethargy，having transfusion-dependent anemia was referred to ICMR- National Institute of Immunohematology， Mumbai， India for a hemolytic anemia workup. Routine hematological studies were carried out by standard protocols. Complete Blood Count (CBC)， absolute reticulocyte count， and corrected reticulocyte count were taken. Morphological changes in blood cells were observed using light microscopy. Hemoglobinopathies were ruled out using hemoglobin variant analysis. To rule out red cell membrane protein defect， Eosin-5-Maleimide Assay (EMA) was performed according to the protocol describedearlier using BD FACSAria\" Fusion Flow Cytometer通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.Red cell enzyme (pyruvate kinase， glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase， glucose phosphate isomerase) studies were conducted by the methods recommended by the International Committee for Standardization in Hematology 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Serum ferritin level， Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) level， liver function test， and renal function test were performed. Bone marrow aspiration and light microscopy to study bone marrow morphology were performed 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was performed as per the standard protocol. He received Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant from an HLA-identical sibling's 15-year-old elder healthy sister， in whom CDA II was ruled out using genetic analysis.\n\n【12】CD44 antibody binding test\n\n【13】The patient showed low Mean Channel Fluorescence (MCF) in the EMA test. Therefore， for the differential diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis and CDAII， a CD44 antibody binding test was performed. The protocol used was： Whole blood (10 pL) was diluted with Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS). 30 uL of diluted blood sample and titrated volume of PE-anti-CD44 antibody (BD Biosciences) was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. To remove unbound antibodies， RBCs were washed with PBS and resuspended in 300 uL， and analyzed on BD FACSAria\" Fusion Flow Cytometer. Results were expressed in Mean Channel Fluorescence (MCF) values as described earlier 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>.\n\n【14】Molecular analysis of the SEC23B gene\n\n【15】The genomic DNA of the patient and parents was isolated using the Flexigene DNA extraction kit. 20 exons of SEC23B gene， flanking splice junctions， and 5-and 3'-untranslated regions were amplified with polymerase chain reactions. The PCR conditions were as follows：95°C for 5 min； 35 cycles of 94°C for 20 sec， 58°C for 20 sec and 72C for 20 sec； and 72C for 5 min. Amplified DNA was purified and sequenced using ABI Prism 3730xl Genetic Analyzer. CHROMAS software v2.6.6 was used for the analysis of sequences.\n\nReal-Time PCR and gene expression study删除1换行mRNA was isolated from the peripheral blood sample using the|删除段之间换行|TRIZOL-based standard method.cDNA was made from mRNAusing a cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. The PCR conditions for cDNA synthesis were as follows：25°C for 10 min， 40 cycles of 37℃ for 1 h， 37°C for 1 h， and 85℃for 5 min. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reactions were run on an Applied Biosystems StepOne\" Real-Time PCR system. The protocol used was as follows： 2 min at 95℃， 10 sec at 95°C， and 20 sec at 60℃ for 40 cycles. The stability of a control gene -Glyceraldehyde3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was determined for the normalization of RT-PCR products. We performed this assay in triplicate. The analysis of data for studying relative mRNA expression of the SEC23B gene was carried out using the 2-&c method 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【17】Results\n\n【18】Clinical details\n\n【19】Before the hematopoietic stem cell transplant， the patient required regular blood transfusions and had recurrent jaundice， pallor， and icterus. The patient's serum ferritin was 2546 ng/mL. Peripheral blood smear showed hypochromic microcytes， anisopoikilocytosis， and few spherocytes. He showed indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Activities of 3common red blood cell enzymes - Pyruvate Kinase (PK)， Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD)， and GlucosePhosphate Isomerase (GPI) were normal. Low Mean Channel Fluorescence(MCF) was observed in Eosin-5-Maleimide test. Thus， an anti-CD44 antibody binding test was used to rule out CDAII 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>. The patient showed significantly raised CD44 antibody binding. Bone marrow smear showed marked erythroid hyperplasia and mild dyserythropoiesis. Few binucleate and multinucleate forms (~9%) and occasional karyorrhectic forms.\n\n【20】Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was planned for the patient. The donor was an HLA-matched， 15-year-old elder sister， in whom CDA II was ruled out using genetic analysis. The transplant was successful and the patient was followed up since then. After 1.5 years of transplant， hematological， biochemical， genetic analysis， and gene expression study was performed for the patient. After 18 months of a bone marrow transplant， a peripheral blood smear was normocytic and normochromic. Serum ferritin was 1215ng/mL. The hematological and other biochemical parameters before and after bone marrowtransplant are normal .

Parents showed heterozygous mutation -c.1385 A>G， p.Tyr462Cys . The prediction of the severity of mutation was performed using bioinformatic tools such as PolyPhen 2.0， SIFT， and PROVEAN. According to all these bioinformatics tools， the mutation is damaging and deleterious. The Sanger sequencing of exon 12 of SEC23B gene post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant showed heterozygous c.1385 A>G， p.Tyr462Cys mutation in the patient.\n\n【24】Real-Time PCR and gene expression analysis\n\n【25】For the evaluation of the consequence of mutations in the SEC23B gene， we studied mRNA transcript levels of the SEC23Bin patient before and after HSCT and healthy individuals using quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). Before HSCT， the patient showed a significant reduction in the mRNA expression level of the SEC23B gene (p<0.05). Approximately 70% reduction was observed. The mRNA expression level of the SEC23B gene of the patient was almost equal to that of a healthy individual post-HSCT. There was no statistically significant difference in the mRNA transcript level in patients and healthy individuals (p>0.05) .\n\n【26】Discussion\n\n【27】CDAII is a rare hematological disorder. Due to difficulty in diagnosis， many cases remain undiagnosed despite having severe删除1换行clinical features. The diagnosis of CDAII needs to be suspected in congenital anemia cases having features of hemolytic anemia and patients showing low mean channel fluorescence values in the EMA test 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. The molecular analysis using Next Generation Sequencing and/or Sanger sequencing of the SEC23B gene is the confirmatory test for CDAII. The protein band 3 is hypoglycosylated in the red cell membrane of CDAII patients. Thus， the EMA test shows low MCF in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Therefore， differentiation of CDAII and HS is necessary using CD44 antibody binding test 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，5]</u>.\n\n【28】Clinical presentation in CDAII patients is variable. Some show severe anemia with splenomegaly， requiring regular blood transfusion and some show mild anemia with notransfusion requirement. Patients showing severe clinical features are managed mainly by supportive care by regular blood transfusions， iron chelation therapy， rarely splenectomy， and allogeneic HSCT. In many patients， throughout life iron accumulates steadily 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Currently， iron overload in these patients is managed by following guidelines used for the treatment of thalassemia major.\n\n【29】Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) using a fully matched sibling donor is currently considered to be a curative therapy for CDA 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. According to the literature， there are few reports of CDA managed successfully with HSCT， and the outcome was good. There is one report from the Indian population showing the clinical benefits of HSCT in CDAII. The patient reported here required transfusion every month and had continuous weakness and fatigue. Parents were not ready for lifelong transfusions followed by iron chelation therapy. Splenectomy was suggested but they were not ready because of the risk of infection susceptibility. Thus， the only curative option was HSCT. His elder sister has no symptoms of CDAII and was checked with the molecular test ofthe SEC23B gene.\n\n【30】For the first time， we have studied the molecular， biochemical， and clinical benefits of HSCT for the management of CDAII with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant may improve the prognosis in patients. The changes in the expression of the SEC23B gene regarding mRNA transcript levels were first time studied before and after an HSCT in a patient suffering from severe CDAII.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n\n【32】There are no definitive treatment guidelines available for CDA because of its rarity. But， in severe cases where an HLA-matched donor is available， allogeneic HSCT should be considered. In this study， we have reported the outcome of HSCT in a CDAII patient删除1换行having severe clinical features. This is the first study reporting the mRNA expression level of the SEC23B gene before and after HSCT in the CDAII case in the Indian population. The mRNA expression level was significantly decreased suggesting the clinical severity and it was almost equal to that of healthy individuals after treatment with a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Post HSCT， the patient is now normal， healthy， and completely transfusion independent.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Contrast enhanced CT (CECT) brain showed reduction of the tuberculomas size at the interim treatment.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】This case illustrates the tuberculomas mimic the presentation of other intracranial lesions (brain tumor， brain abscess) that showing from MRI and CECT brain. MRI brain is the best modality in differentiating tuberculoma with other intracranial lesions by showing hypo-isointense in T1weighted images and hyperintense in T2 FLAIR 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.

In the personal history there was a high blood pressure treated with ACE inhibitor and multiple sclerosis. Palpatory finding of the thyroid gland on admission was normal， and markers of inflammation， fibrinogen， and CRP were positive. The treatment with antibiotics for suspected urinary infection has been started， due to a finding of a positive urine culture. Given that the pain persisted， the tenth day of hospitalization thyroid hormones analyses were done， showing increased free fraction of thyroid hormones and suppressed TSH， with， still elevated fibrinogen. At this point， the patient was clinically moderately thyrotoxic with palpable， uneven， movable on swallowing thyroid gland， with slightly painful left lobe. On echosonography， thyroid gland was slightly diffusely enlarged， diffusely very heteroehogenous， predominantly hypoechogenic， with predominantly isoechogenic nodal formation distally in the right lobe， with diameter around 15，8x12，5x15，8 mm.

Focal SAT can mimic suppurative thyroiditis， and thyroid cancer as well 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>.\n\nThe therapeutic approach depends on the severity of the clinical picture. In some patients， there is no need for any medical therapy. Some times it is necessary to apply non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin to reduce pain.

It is usualy given in a single daily dose of 40 mg of prednisone and at 7 days the dose is gradually reduced by 5 mg for 6 weeks.

In the case of the development of permanent hypothyroidism after an episode of SAT， levothyroxine substitution is indicated.\n\n【26】We present an unusual case of a minimum painful SAT associated with functional adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid gland，which scintigraphy presented as a toxic adenoma in thyrotoxic phase， and in fact was a functional adenoma tissue unaffected with destructive thyroiditis. On the standard sonography adenoma tissue was more echogenic than the surrounding thyroid parenchyma， which showed a typical heterogeneous hypoechoic appearance， and the MIBI scan showed moderately intense tracer binding in the thyroid gland. Serum markers of inflammation were typically high， with suppressed TSH and elevated serum thyroxin in the acute phase， with a gradual normalization during follow-up， but without transient hypothyroid phase， probably as a consequence of the existence of regional autonomy.

Coronary Artery Angiography (CAG) revealed spasm of the left coronary artery and Right Coronary Artery(RCA)， which was relieved by intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin. Our findings suggested multi vessel spasm would be associated with a significant increase of the risk of clinical complications.\n\n【2】Keywords： Coronary spasm； Acute myocardial infarction； Ventricular fibrillation； Coronary artery angiography\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Coronary spasm is defined as a condition associated with main large epicardial coronary artery transiently abnormal contraction. While the coronary artery is completely or nearly completely occluded by spasm， the transmural ischemia would occur in the region perfused by the artery. Angina attacks with ST elevation on the standard ECG would observe at rest without any apparent trigger. This pathological condition is known as variant angina， which is less often used. However， vasospastic angina， which is a clinical entity characterized by episodes of rest angina that promptly respond to short-acting nitrates and are attributable to coronary artery vasospasm.\n\n【5】Coronary spasm usually appears at the same coronary artery in the same patient. However， it is not rare that ST segment elevation occurs in the anterior leads during one attack and in the inferiorleads in another in the same patients. There are also patients in whom ST segment elevation occurs simultaneously both in the anterior and inferior leads. These are patients with simultaneous multivessel coronary spasm and the attacks often result in sudden death. However， spontaneous and alternate Coronary Artery Spasm (CAS) leading to Myocardial Infarction (MI) and malignant arrhythmias has been uncommon reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-3]</u>. We reported a patient with multivessel CAS in setting of acute multisite MI who was treated with defibrillation 46 times.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 63-year-old man with history of hypertension and smoking was admitted as an emergency with severe chest pain for 2 h accompanied syncope in the heavy snow morning. On admission to the emergency room， he was no discomfort at heart rate of 69 beats/min and blood pressure of 81mmHg/50 mmHg. Surface Electrocardiography (ECG) on admission showed sinus rhythmia， II， III， avF， V5-6 ST depression . Blood tests obtained immediately at arrival showed cTnT normal (<0.1 ng/ml). Blood gas analysis revealed normal serum electrolytes were within normal limits. At 39 min after arrival， he developed VF . Immediately after defibrillation， he was successfully resuscitated， surface ECG revealed ST-segment elevation in I， avL， V1 through V6.\n\n【8】He was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation after VF 3 min，he had no conscious again. ECG showed a line ， cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started， and adrenaline and atropine were administered， with restoration of cardiac output， ECG revealed sinus bradycardia， ST elevation in the inferior leads II， III， avF leads . Defibrillation was successfully fulfilled 40times before CAG. Meanwhile， amlodipine， lidocaine， eslonal were used to control VF， Dopamine(at the most dosage 20 ug/kg min)， norepinephrine 60 ug/min were used to increase BP to 90 to 133\n\n【9】After admission to ED 370 min， emergent coronary angiography wasperformed via the right femoralartery.CAGshowed simultaneous CAS of Left coronary artery system and right coronary artery ， after intracoronary administration of nitroglycerin， there was normalization of coronary artery diameters . VF did not recur. He died 6h after admission to intensive care unit because of cardiac shock， pulmonary edema.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】In the present case report showed that the spontaneous and alternate coronary artery spasm in the entire coronary artery system删除1换行caused acute anterior and inferior MI，cardiac shock， VF and cardiac arrest. To the best our knowledge， this case has never previously been reported. In the present case the patient in the ED room treated defibrillation 40 times (6 times defibrillation during CAG)， mechanical ventilation， and inotropic support.\n\n【12】Our patient had anterior ST elevation during an episode of chest pain implying spasm in LAD. ST elevation in the inferior leads suggesting spasm ofthe RCA. The anterior ST elevation was associated with VF， electronic storm， and the inferior leads ST elevation with cardiac arrest. At the time angiography，spasm of the triple coronary artery was relieved by intracoronay NTG. Therefore， we infer that the left and right coronary spasm in this patient is alternately occurring.\n\n【13】There are a few reports of severe arrhythmias by simultaneous spasm of left and right coronary artery 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. One coronary spasm induced by another one is relatively rare.\n\n【14】CAS is not rare in clinical， mostly occur in signal coronary artery， single site. Multivessel spasm is relatively rare. It was reported that Japanese patients with multivessel coronary spasm accounted for 8%of the 2，251 study population 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> and 5.9% of 202 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Our patient had some typical manifestation， such as： 1) the attack occurs at rest， particularly from midnight to early morning；2) the attack is associated with STsegmentelevationtheECG. This case was diagnosed consistent with diagnostic criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. The risk of sudden death for patients with coronary vasospastic angina is approximately2% and is most common in patients with multivessel CVS. Arrhythmia caused by coronary spasm， in addition to the treated of coronary spasm， also targeted measure for different life threatening arrhythmias should be taken. This patient did not take active coronary angiograph and IABP implantation at the early stage of this case.\n\n【15】In conclusion， alternate multivessel CAS may lead to threatening arrhythmias： VF and cardiac arrest in patient without significant coronary stenosis. Such patients need to be aggressively treated with vasodilators. Our case stress the fact that although rare， when occurring， multivessel spasm is associated with a significant increase of the risk of clinical complications and showed therefore require careful attention.\n\n【16】2018 Sinopec CLinical Medicine Special Scientific Research Project (ZX18001).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It classically presents as dysphonia， dysphagia and deviation of tongue. This eponym signifies ipsilateral weakness of larynx and tongue while sparing function of the soft palate 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.

She had CSF opening pressure of 400 mm of water and did not have desirable improvement with medical management. She was planned for venous sinus manometry and stenting. Orotracheal intubation with laryngoscope with Macintosh blade size 3 was done， tube fixed at 22 mm mark and the cuff was inflated at normal pressure. The intubation lasted two and half hours without undue flexion or lateral rotation. Venous sinus manometry showed gradient of 13 mm and 12 mm across narrowing in right and left transverse sinus， respectively . The right internal jugular vein access was taken and balloon angioplasty was done at the level of narrowing bilaterally. However， there was no significant improvement in the pressure gradient. Thereafter， a self-expanding stent (8mmx40 mm) was deployed across the narrowing in right transverse sinus. Pressure gradient post stenting showed significant improvement and good flow was achieved across the stent . After wearing off of anesthesia， patient complained of change in voice with nasal intonation and difficulty in swallowing. There was flattening of the right palatal arch with deviation of uvula to left side， deviation of tongue to right and ipsilateral weakness of the tongue . No other cranial nerve or focal neurological deficits were observed. In view of the preceding stenting procedure， a brain imaging was performed to rule out medullary involvement. MRI brain and MR angiogram were normal. Right sided vocal cord palsy was confirmed by direct laryngoscopy. Patient was put on nasogastric feeds and was given injectable steroids for 5 days followed by oral steroids.

Bilateral Tapia syndrome has also been described following orotracheal intubation 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>. The proposed mechanisms following intubation include compression of nerves by pressure of the inflated laryngeal cuff across the lateral laryngeal wall and alternatively stretching of nerves due to undue head movements通用删除6(英):<u>[1，5-7]</u>. Tapia syndrome occurring after an intracranial procedure is unique due to the possible topographical association of intracranial lesions in relation to the procedure. Posterior fossa hemorrhage after stenting due to stent thrombosis has been noted and was ruled out in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. A similar presentation could be explained by the involvement of the nucleus ambiguous and hypoglossal nucleus or intramedullary fibers of the twelfth cranial nerve which was also删除1换行excluded by neuroimaging. Another notable finding in our patient was the involvement of soft palate suggesting involvement of the pharyngeal nerve， branch of vagus nerve， which carries the motor impulses to the soft palate. Most of the described cases of Tapia syndrome involved hypoglossal and recurrent laryngeal branch of vagus nerve as compression is believed to occur at the crossing of these two nerves 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-9]</u>. Therefore， palatal involvement in our patient makes it a triad of pharyngeal， laryngeal and glossal involvement. One possible explanation for this can be the short neck length in our patient (midline neck length- 6cm)； making it more likely that neurapraxia also involved the pharyngeal branch exiting proximally . This rarest entity can therefore be referred to as Triad of Tapia Plus syndrome’. Tapia syndrome has been found to resolve progressively in 6 to 12 months with steroids and dysphagia rehabilitation as in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，51</u>.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Tapia syndrome， especially Tapia syndrome plus is a rare unpredictable situation occurring after orotracheal intubation Through this case， the authors would like to emphasize the need for删除1换行high clinical suspicion by intensivists， neurologists and surgeons spanning all fields of medicine as timely clinical suspicion can help avoid unnecessary investigations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The presence of an abnormal Hb was confirmed in both instances by hemoglobin chain studies. Structural studies determined the two Hb variants to be heterozygous mutation of Hb D-Los Angeles (HBB：p. Glu121Gln) for mother and homozygous mutation of Hb G-Coushatta (HBB：p.Glu23Ala) for father. The fate of the baby was followed until the first year and an abnormal silent Hemoglobin (Hb) was also detected on her sample. In this report a very rare Hb variant homozygous Hb G Coushatta and also a heterozygous baby of the couple with Hb G Coushatta and HbD is presented.\n\n【2】Keywords： Hb G-Coushatta； Hb D-Los Angeles； Abnormal hemoglobin\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】A new hemoglobin variant，Hemoglobin (Hb) G Coushatta also known as G-Saskatoon (HBB：p. Glu23Ala)， has been firstly found in three generations of a family from the Alabama Coushatta Indian tribe in east Texas in 1960s 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> and was subsequently identified in several populations throughout the world in Canadian Indians， Chinese， Algerian and Japans 通用删除6(英):<u>[2-5]</u>. As it is found as prevalent variant in Native Americans and Chinese，haplotype studies were done and they suggested a multiple origin for this variant 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. In Turkey it was firstly described in a Turkish male and then in a Turkish family in 1980s 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，9]</u>.\n\n【5】It is abnormal hemoglobin of beta variant with a delta-like substitution. Instead of a negative charged amino acid glutamate， neutral alanine at the 22nd position of beta chains in Hb G Coushatta forms a slow migrating band in alkaline electrophoresis 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u>. So it is sometimes hard to discriminate the band with HbD or HbS.\n\n【6】Hb D Punjab， also known as Hb D Los Angeles， is an abnormal type of Hb with an amino acid substitution of glutamate to glutamine at codon 121 of the beta-globin gene (HBB：p. Glu121Gln) and it is one of the most commonly observed abnormal hemoglobin worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. Its incidence has been reported throughout Turkey with an overall frequency of0.2%通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. We reported before Hb D as the second most common hemoglobinopathy after beta-thalassemia trait in Kayseriprovince， a city in Middle Anatolia， in Turkey， accounting for 0.36% ofthe total， in premarital screening 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【7】The both hemoglobin variants are clinically silent or with slightly microcytosis. We here report a family； a rare case with homozygous hemoglobin G-Coushatta coupled with Hb D-Los Angeles who has an eight week pregnancy.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 25 year old male and 18 year old female admitted to Department of Biochemistry in Kayseri Education and Research Hospital for premarital screening. Firstly for separation and quantitation of hemoglobin types， gel electrophoresis (Interlab G26) was used. Full blood counts and red blood cell indices in this family were determined by the Sysmex XN-9000 semi-automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex Co.，Kobe，Japan). Two abnormal bands between HbA， and HbA。on HbS/D zone\n\n【10】Results\n\nThe hematological and Hb data are summarized in Table 1. In gel electrophoresis we detected the abnormal hemoglobins of mother and father migrating as Hb S/Hb D. In capillary electrophoresis the mother had an abnormal Hb at a level of 39.9% of total Hb， in|删除段之间换行|Zone 6 suggesting Hb D； and the father had an unknown Hb variant at a level of 97.7 % of total Hb， between Zone 5 and Zone 6， an unknown hemoglobin variant . In UHPLC the unknown hemoglobin of mother eluted just slightly after Hb A， with a retention time of 6.64 minutes， while the unknown Hb of father eluted in a large peak containing Hb A， with a retention time of 6.01 minutes.\n\n【12】As both male and female had abnormal hemoglobins during premarital screening the couple was invited to the meeting for information before giving birth. In the meeting it was learned that the women was pregnant for 8 weeks. The couple was suggested for molecular analysis and genetic counseling.\n\n【13】Molecular analysis of father had homozygosity at codon 68 of the beta-globin gene， an amino acid substitution of glutamate to alanine， called as Hb G-Coushatta (beta22(B4)Glu-->Ala，HBB：c.68 A>C). And the mother revealed a heterozygosity at codon 364of the beta-globin gene， an amino acid substitution of glutamate to glutamine  called as Hb D-Los Angeles (beta 121(GH4) Glu-->Gln，HBB：c.364G>C) .\n\n【14】All parameters of red cell indices and hemoglobin composition of baby was in reference range after birth. So， the fate of the baby was followed until the first year and an abnormal silent Hemoglobin (Hb) was also detected on her sample. Her molecular analysis revealed heterozygous Hb G Coushatta .\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Hemoglobinopathies are commonly present in populations of all Mediterranean countries， and are also common in Turkey. A review of abnormal hemoglobins reported from Turkey indicated that in addition to beta-thalassemia major， sickle cell anemia and sickle cell/B-thalassemia are major causes of public health problems 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. HbD and Hb O-Arab are prevalent abnormal hemoglobins in Turkey with a silent clinical state after Hb S. Although Hb G Coushatta is thought to be rare in some regions it is reported to be more than expected通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The major problem of the reported incidence of this Hb may be disability of separation of these Hemoglobin’s with Hb D and Hb Q Iran because of the same electrophoretic mobility in alkaline pH通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. However， in this study our suspicion for the hemoglobin of father because of the homozygosity in alkaline gel electrophoresis， we could have been able to discriminate the abnormal hemoglobin with other hemoglobins by both UHPLC and capillary electrophoresis.\n\n【17】Presumed mutation for Hb G Coushatta is GAA->GCA at codon68 in beta chain and is hematologically normal in heterozygote state.\n\n【18】Table 1： Red cell indices and hemoglobin composition for the members of studied family.\n\n| Complete Blood Count  | Father  | Mother  | Baby  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sex  | Male  | Female  | Female  |\n| Age (years)  | 25  | 18  | 1  |\n| HbA0(%)  | 0  | 56.2  | 55.4  |\n| HbA2(%)  | 3.20  | 1.90  | 3.1  |\n| HbF(%)  | 0.00  | 0.00  | 2.7  |\n| HbD (%)  | 0.00  | 39.90  | 删除8:<u>一 </u> |\n| HbG-Coushatta(%)  | 97.70  | 0.00  | 38.8  |\n| White Blood Cells (x10/ul)  | 6.72  | 7.54  | 9.15  |\n| Red Blood Cells (x106/ul)  | 6.32  | 5.02  | 5.02  |\n| Hemoglobin (g/dl)  | 17.4  | 13.4  | 12.4  |\n| HCT(%)  | 52.4  | 40.1  | 36.7  |\n| MCV(fl)  | 82.9  | 79.9  | 73.1  |\n| MCH (pg)  | 27.6  | 26.7  | 24.7  |\n| MCHC (g/dl)  | 33.3  | 33.5  | 33.8  |\n| PLT(x10/ul)  | 282  | 316  | 394  |\n| RDW-SD (fl)  | 40.5  | 39.8  | 8.7  |\n| RDW-CV(%)  | 13.8  | 14.4  | 13.6  |\n\n【20】For that reason it is usually found during HbAlc measurement by chromatographic techniques which are dissociated with blood glucose levels 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，15]</u>. Here we report a rare form of homozygous Hb G Coushatta at a level of 97.7% of total Hb.\n\n【21】In Hb G Coushatta there is a neutral alanine instead of negative charged amino acid glutamate at the 23rd position of beta chains. Usually such a replacement would affect the distribution of charges and disturb the functional value of molecule. However 23position of beta chain is not connected with heme or other globin chains. So it is expected that there is no unusual effect due to such a replacement. Our patient with homozygous Hb G Coushatta was also clinically silent， consistent with these expectations. Although we cannot predict for sure， we presume that the homozygous form of Hb G Coushatta， or a combination of this variant with Hb D would not be associated with severe conditions. However， exact determination of these variants by molecular technique is important.\n\n【22】Both Hb G Coushatta and Hb D migrate slowly and it is hard to discriminate them with each other and Hb S by alkaline gel electrophoresis. In HPLC and capillary electrophoresis we found a slight sliding in Hb G Coushatta according to Hb D which is hard to discriminate visually. Nevertheless， some variants cannot be separated and are eventually identified by DNA sequencing if they reveal unexplained hematological anomalies. This is an important issue for an analytical decision to be taken when abnormal hemoglobins are suspected. In this case， the homozygous Hb G Coushatta and heterozygous Hb D were found by chance during a premarital screening program. Even though they both did not reveal any hematological or clinical sign， the women was pregnant and not to miss any heterozygous state of these combinations with a probability of hematologic disease molecular analysis was applied. As there was no literature finding of heterozygote state of Hb G Coushatta and Hb D， the baby was investigated for possible hemoglobinopathy\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\nDifferent hemoglobinopathies are frequently reported from|删除段之间换行|Turkey， but this is the first report of a very rare homozygous Hb G Coushatta mutation married with a heterozygous Hb D and got a baby with heterozygous Hb G Coushatta， those all have no clinical sign. The members of the family those will born in future may have different abnormal hemoglobins with heterozygous state. Because of the same electrophoretic mobility in alkaline pH，Hb G Coushatta can be missed and not separated with other hemoglobins like Hb D and Hb S. But it is possible to discriminate them by UHPLC and capillary electrophoresis with a careful examination.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

His birth weight was below the 3d percentile (-2 SD). He had multiple facial dysmorphisms. An inspiratory stridor was noted and deep desaturations for which he was referred to the neonatal intensive care unit. He was started on continuous positive airway pressure. Laryngo-and bronchoscopy showed a laryngeal cleft grade I， a functional relevant laryngomalacia， a right sided tracheal bronchus and very proximal branching in the major bronchi. A CT thorax confirmed the abnormal branching of the bronchi. Cerebral ultrasound revealed a mega cisterna magna and partial atresia of the corpus callosum. The trio WES analysis in the patient revealed a 24.1 Mb de novo， interstitial deletion in 4q13.1q21.3 of the paternal allele of chromosome4(GRch37： chr4：62，383，011-86，491，865)， encompassing more than a hundred protein-coding genes and including the 1.37 M critical region of the 4q21 microdeletion syndrome. In literature no other patients with a 4q deletion have been described with bronchial abnormalities.\n\n【3】Conclusion： We present a patient with a 4q13.1q21.23 deletion and severe respiratory disease due to laryngomalacia and a tracheal bronchus. The respiratory anomalies in our patient add to the phenotypic spectrum of deletions in this region. Unexplained respiratory symptoms in patients with a 4q deletion could point to tracheal anomalies， suggesting that respiratory imaging could be indicated.\n\n【4】Keywords： 4q deletion； 4q microdeletion syndrome； Laryngeal cleft； Laryngomalacia；Bronchial anomaly\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】A laryngeal cleft is a rare congenital abnormality caused by a failure of posterior cricoid lamina fusion or incomplete tracheoesophageal septum development. The majority of patients have an additional congenital abnormality. Recognizable syndromes in which laryngeal clefts are reported include syndromes caused by a chromosomal aneuploidy， 22q11.2 deletion syndrome，Opitz/BBB syndrome， Pallister Hall syndrome， CHARGE syndrome and VACTERL association. Recurrence in families has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u>. In many patients， however， an underlying genetic cause cannot be identified. The 4q21 microdeletion syndrome (OMIM： #613509) was first described by Bonnet et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> in 2010 after identifying a commonly deleted critical interval of 1.37 Mb in nine unrelated patients with differently sized， overlapping， de novo deletions in 4q删除4-1:<u>21</u>. Patients with this syndrome have distinctive facial features (frontal bossing， hypertelorism， short philtrum)， severely delayed speech development， intellectual disability， neonatal hypotonia and a postnatal growth delay with a (relatively) normal head circumference. Since Bonnet's publication in 2010 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>， 22patients have been described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>[4-13]</u> and 78 are reported in DECIPHER， including a patient 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> with de novo loss of 19.5 Mb that completely falls within the deleted region in this patient. We present a newborn with a de novo 4q13.1q21.23 deletion who suffered from severe respiratory insufficiency due to a laryngeal cleft， laryngomalacia and an atypical bronchial tree. To our knowledge， laryngomalacia， a laryngeal cleft or atypical development of the bronchial tree have not been described before in patients with a deletion in the proximallong arm of chromosome 4.\n\nOur patient was born as the second son of non-consanguineous parents with an unremarkable medical history. He was conceived naturally. The pregnancy was complicated by fetal growth restriction at 30 weeks gestational age whereas normal growth was observed at20 weeks of gestation. The delivery was complicated by prolonged rupture of membranes and a postpartum rupture of a notably thin umbilical cord； which was clipped immediately after birth. His Apgar scores were 8/8 at 1- and 5-min post-partum with points withdrawn for color and reactivity. His birth weight was below the 3d percentile(-2 SD)， his height was -1.5 SD and his head circumference was +1.5SD. His physical exam showed low set ears， a wide frontal fontanel， broad nasal bridge， frontal bossing， hypertelorism， hypospadia and hypotonia. He was admitted to the neonatal ward for intravenous treatment of hypoglycemia， which was noted during routine glucose screening for children small for gestational age. An inspiratory stridor was noted as well as deep desaturations for which he was referred to the neonatal intensive careunit. He was started on continuous positive airway pressure. Laryngo-and bronchoscopy showed a laryngeal cleft grade I， a functional relevant laryngomalacia， a right sided tracheal bronchus and very proximal branching in the major bronchi. A CT|删除段之间换行|thorax confirmed the abnormal branching of the bronchi. Cerebral ultrasound revealed a mega cisterna magna and partial atresia of the corpus callosum. Cardiac and renal ultrasound showed no abnormalities. Multiple attempts to wean from respiratory support failed over a prolonged period. This was due to severe incidents with airway collapse when positive pressure support was weaned. This continuing dependency on respiratory support led to discussions on the proportionality of long-term invasive respiratory therapy. After much deliberation care was withdrawn .\n\n【8】Materials and Methods\n\n【9】Genetics\n\n【10】Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed with a trio based approach on genomic DNA extracted from blood leukocytes of the patient and his parents. Exomes were captured and enriched using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V5 Kit， according to manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent Technologies， Santa Clara， California， USA). Sequencing was performed using a NovaSeq Sequencer (Illumina， San Diego， California， USA). Read alignment to the human reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) and variant calling was performed using the BWA and GATK software， respectively. Variant annotation was performed using a custom designed in-house annotation and variant prioritization pipeline. Copy Number Variation analysis was performed using CoNIFER software and annotated using an in-house strategy. Patient-parents trio analysis of the WES data was done using a gene panel of 3，741 genes associated with Mendelian inherited disorders .\n\n【11】Database search\n\n【12】DECIPHER was consulted June 2022 to identify additional cases of laryngeal clefts， laryngomalacia or tracheal bronchus .\n\n【13】Results\n\n【14】The trio WES analysis in the patient revealed a 24.1 Mb de novo， interstitial deletion in 4q13.1q21.3 ofthepaternal allele of chromosome4 (GRch37： chr4： 62，383，011-86，491，865)， encompassing more than\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Over a hundred patients are reported with a deletion that is partly overlapping with the deletion in our patient. Overlapping clinical features are abnormalities of the corpus callosum， frontal bossing， neonatal hypotonia and growth delay with relative brain sparing. Laryngeal cleft with laryngomalacia and a tracheal bronchus are symptoms that have not previously been linked to the 4q13.1q21.23region. Bonnet et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> report on a patient with laryngeal diplegia. Others have reported on midline defects and 4q21 deletions such as a cleft palate 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Bronchial abnormalities have not been described in the literature in relation with deletions in the long arm of chromosome 4. In many patients with 4q abnormalities， however，no additional imaging of the thorax was performed. This could imply that more patients with 4q chromosomal deletions could have an abnormal bronchial tree. Therefore， we propose/suggest that in case of unexplained respiratory symptoms laryngeal and bronchial architecture should be evaluated in these patients.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】We present a patient with a 4q13.1q21.23 deletion and severe respiratory disease. The identification of a de novo deletion4q13.1q21.23 with a poor developmental prognosis played an important role in the decision making. This illustrates the usefulness of early genetic testing in severely ill newborns.

This complication is rare but serious， and most patients will be left with severe functional disability. At present， the causes of polyradiculoneuropathy， in patients after spinal decompression are not clear， which also affects the treatment of patients. We present two cases of tetraplegia after spinal decompression. These two patients developed rapid quadriplegia about 1 week after spinal decompression. What is special is that the paralysis of the patients was characterized by both spinal cord injury and peripheral neuropathy， and the neurological function recovered slowly after receiving immunoglobulin therapy. We compared these two patients with previously reported cases in an attempt to identify the cause of acute paralysis in the patients after surgery.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 46-year-old female patient， because of schwannoma (L2-3) and the left leg pain and weakness for eight years， accept + cut lamina decompression + lumbar posterior internal fixation spinal neoplasm resection 通用删除1(英):<u>(preoperative spinal cord image is shown in Figure 1a)</u>， and incision drainage after surgery， postoperative three days every day about 500 ml， drain the late flow gradually reduce， pull out the tube 7 days postoperatively.

Patients pathogenesis is not very clear at present， the literature reports， described the postoperative multiple neuropathies as more Acute Motor and Sensory Axonal Neuropathy (AMSAN)， it is a rare and serious GBS subtype，based on the diagnosis of patients usually accept gamma globulin or and plasma exchange treatment， but often less effective， behind are more serious in patients with functional disability 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5]</u>. GBS， also known as acute inflammatory demyelinating peripheral neuropathy， is an immune peripheral neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，3，5]</u>. It is self-limited and usually has an incubation period of 2 to 3 weeks， with symptoms reaching a peak within 2 to 4 weeks after onset and then disappearing within weeks to months 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，5]</u>. Common clinical manifestations of GBS include the absence of tendon reflex 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>， albumin cytological dissociation 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-20]</u>； besides， early in the onset of the disease， it can be seen that EMG motor nerve conduction velocity slows down， the latency period is prolonged， the amplitude is reduced， and F-wave showed prolonged latency period or disappeared 通用删除6(英):<u>[14，20]</u>. The previously reported cases and our two cases all have the above characteristics， which is the main reason why all patients were diagnosed with GBS. There are the following hypotheses for the causes of GBS in patients after spinal surgery： Surgery and anesthesia drugs damage nervous tissue， expose antigens (myelin， glycolipids， gangliosides)， activate the endocrine stress system， change the balance of the immune system， and thus trigger autoimmune response 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>； or the patient may have a potential subclinical exogenous infection before surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. These claims lack further experimental and clinical evidence.\n\n【16】But in the two cases，patients with GBS unexplained phenomena emerge： 1. Spinal cord injury， the two have the performance of the spinal cord injury patients， urine retention and sensory plane (the first level of T10， the second is C7 level)，and retrieved to literaturehas3 patients with a similar situation 通用删除6(英):<u>[2，4，15]</u>， spinal cord involvement is rarely seen in GBS 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. 2. Intracranial hemorrhage： Spontaneous subdural hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred in the first patient， which could not be explained by GBS.3. Short incubation删除1换行period andlong duration of disease progression. Tetraplegia occurred3 and 8 days postoperatively in two patients and lasted for more than a month. This is also inconsistent with the natural course of GBS. Immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis are effective methods for the treatment of GBS， and a good prognosis can be obtained with early treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[3-5，20]</u>. Our case did not see an obvious recovery of neurological function after receiving immunoglobulin shock therapy. All of these characteristics are enough to make us question the diagnosis of GBS. Further investigation found that both patients had cerebrospinal fluid leakage， and the cerebrospinal fluid drainage volume was both large， reaching 400 ml to 500 ml/day at most. Cerebrospinal fluid leakage is a common complication of spinal surgery， which is usually seen after lumbar surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. If the amount of CSF collected in the postoperative drainage tube is between 221and 250 mL/day， the possibility of postoperative CSF leakage should be suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Rapid loss of cerebrospinal fluid can lead to the occurrence of low intracranial pressure syndrome， and patients generally appear with sudden acute symptoms within 5 days after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Intracranial Hypotension Syndrome (IHS) is the result of decreased pressure or volume of cerebrospinal fluid. The common clinical manifestations of IHS include headache related to changes in body position， accompanied by nausea and vomiting， tinnitus and photophobia， dizziness， unstable gait， palpitations， sweating， etc.通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u>. Less common symptoms include numbness， weakness， facial paralysis， difficulty swallowing， and difficulty pronouncing words. Rare manifestations include radiculopathy， quadriplegia， epilepsy，and Parkinson s symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>. In severe cases， the level of consciousness drops， brain disease comas， and death may occur 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. In addition， subarachnoid hemorrhage and spinal epidural hematoma have also been described as a result of low intracranial pressure， with an incidence of approximately 16% to 57% 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Typical manifestations of MR include subdural effusion or hematoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>， diffuse dural enhancement， venous sinus dilatation， cerebral ptosis， and cerebellar tonsil hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Does IHS cause multiple peripheral nerve damage? Through a literature search， we found no related reports， but there are pointed out in the literature of intracranial pressure can lead to a wide range of nerve root disease， can appear in patients with facial nerve paralysis， bulbar paralysis，legs， and shallow breathing， tendon reflex disappears， electromyography of F wave disappear or lengthen the incubation period， motor nerve demyelinating change 通用删除6(英):<u>[12，13]</u>. This kind of change and the two patients and 1/4/5/6 patients were similar 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2，17，22]</u>. Therefore， we speculated that the sharp decrease of intracranial pressure in the patient led to spinal cord injury and nerve root injury， and the postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage was the reason for the quadriplegia of the patient. One patient was positive for ganglioside antibody GM1 IgG. GM1 is a peripheral nerve antibody associated with GBS， but it is also seen in a variety of immune neuropathy， such as Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN)， Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)， and para-tumor associated peripheral neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[19-24]</u>. Other studies have shown that the positive rate of GM1 is related to the degree of an inflammatory response， the severity of the disease， and the prognosis of the disease， and a positive GM1 means that patients respond well to gamma globulin treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. However， our patients did not respond well to gamma globulin therapy. Therefore， we believe that the patient in this paper cannot be diagnosed as CBS because ofGM1positivity， which only indicates that there may be antigen exposure and activation of relevant antibodies in the course of the patient's disease. GBS is lack of effective means of prevention and treatment删除1换行for complex， and cerebrospinal fluid leakage can prevent remedy，删除1换行found that the cerebrospinal fluid leakage after can be treated through blood patch， stay in bed， and rehydration methods such as improving symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[6-8]</u>， also can be repaired by epidural for example fat transplantation， fibrin glue， glycoprotein acid， such as bone wax prevention or repair of CSF leakage 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8，11]</u>. These two cases provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of quadriplegic patients after spinal decompression and alert surgeons to the importance of cerebrospinal fluid leakage as a common complication.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The timeline of the patient management is detailed in . Timeline of Events， He initially presented with a painless mass over his left jaw that he first noticed 9 months ago. He denied pain， intermittent swelling， foul taste， paresthesia， facial nerve weakness and redness to the area， exposure to pet cats， travel outside of the country， fever， chills， cough， weight loss， dysphagia， or dyspnea. He was recently diagnosed with essential hypertension. He denied any prior surgeries. He reported no known allergies. He denied any history of cancer in his family. He denied tobacco and alcohol use. His only medication was carvedilol. Review of systems was unremarkable.\n\n【17】On physical exam there was facial asymmetry with left sided facial swelling. There was no erythema. Palpation over the left parotid gland revealed a 3 cm somewhat well-defined mass. There was clear salivary flow from both Stensen’s ducts. The remaining physical exam was unremarkable. A CT soft tissue neck with contrast showed a rounded somewhat ill-defined in homogeneously enhancing mass involving the anterior aspect of the left parotid gland and posterior aspect of the adjacent masseter muscle， measuring 3.9 cm × 3.1cm ×3.6 cm. Multiple nonspecific cervical lymph nodes were also evident including inferior left periparotid nodes， left submandibular nodes， and internal jugular nodes more on the left， all of which demonstrated homogenous density and well-defined margins. An ultrasound guided aspirate biopsy (multiple with 18 gauge needle) of the left parotid mass was performed； the imaging showed an enlarged hyperemic left parotid gland demonstrating multiple solid and single6 mm × 6 mm cystic masses. The biopsy pathology showed lesion cells with no high-grade features identified； complete excision was recommended for further classification.\n\n【18】Table 2： Timeline of Events.\n\n| Date  | Event  | Outcome  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1/14/2019  | Presented to ED for evaluation of painless leftjaw mass for past 9 months  | lmaging ordered  |\n| 1/14/2019  | CT Soft Tissue Neck with Contrast  | 3.9 cm x 3.1 cm x 3.6 cm ill-defined in homageneously enhancing mass along anterior aspectleft parotid gland and posterior aspect of adjacent masseter muscle  |\n| 1/20/2019  | Initial consult with oral & maxillo-facial surgery  | Recommended US guided biopsy of parotid mass  |\n| 1/30/2019  | US guided aspirate biopsy left parotid mass  | Pathology：lesional cells present with no high-grade features identified - recommend completeexcision  |\n| 2/13/2019  | Seen by general surgery clinic  | Complete excision recommended  |\n| 03-01-19  | Left subtotal parotidectomy  | Intraoperative frozen section was not diagnostic for malignancy.  |\n\n【20】Table 3： Immunohistochemical Stains & Special Stains.\n\n| Immunohistochemical/Special Stain  | Result  |\n| --- | --- |\n| CK5/6  | Positive  |\n| CK7  | Positive  |\n| CK14  | Weak positive  |\n| p63  | Diffuse nuclear positivity  |\n| Ki-67  | <10%  |\n| CK903  | Positive  |\n| CK20  | negative  |\n| GCDFP  | Negative  |\n| SOX10  | Negative  |\n| Androgen receptor  | Interpreted as negative  |\n| GATA3  | Interpreted as negative  |\n| PAS-D  | Positive intracytoplasmic globules  |\n| Mucicarmine  | Intracellular positivity in mucocytes  |\n\n【22】The decisionnwas made to proceed with a left subtotal parotidectomy to achieve complete excision. Subcutaneous flaps were made over the parotid capsule and platysma， and the superficial parotid gland was bluntly dissected out. There was a firm， suspicious mass present in the gland which involved the masseter； deeper parotid tissue， en bloc with part of the masseter muscle， was excised in order to remove the suspicious tissue. The facial nerve was identified and preserved， with the exception of the buccal branch， which coursed straight into the lesion. Intraoperative frozen section was not diagnostic for malignancy； neck dissection was not performed.\n\n【23】Materials and Methods\n\n【24】Grossly the specimen was a left parotid gland weighing 65 g and measuring 10 cm x7 cm x2 cm. Sectioning revealed a tan firm lobular mass measuring 4 cm x 3 cm x3 cm that appeared to be partially encapsulated and surrounded by normal appearing parotid parenchyma. Representative sections were sampled and submitted in 17 cassettes， including frozen sections and normal uninvolved parotid gland. Two left parotid lymph nodes were also resected； grossly these appeared as irregularly shaped fragments of tan-brown tissue measuring 1 cmx1 cm x 0.5 cm and 1 cm x 0.3 cm x0.2 cm； each fragment was bisected and submitted in a single cassette.\n\n【25】Results and Discussion\n\n【26】Microscopic examination showed an ill-defined infiltrative tumor composed predominantly of solid sheets and nests. Focal(<20%) areas of the tumor showed cystic and microcystic areas. The tumor cells were predominantly oncocytic characterized by abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm， round nudei， and prominent nucleoli with focal pleomorphism. Scattered monocytes were present.\n\n【27】Mitotic figures were not identified. Intermixed and peripheral chronic inflammations were present； Sialaden itis was present. Focal lymphovascular invasion and perineural invasion were present. Adjacent to the tumor was uninvolved parotid gland tissue and uninvolved fibro connective tissue including skeletal muscle. Results of immunohistochemical stains and special stains performed are detailed in . Immunohistochemical Stains and Special stains. One surgical margin was involved by carcinoma. No metastatic carcinoma was identified in two lymph nodes (0/2). The overall findings supported the diagnosis of mucoepidermoid carcinoma， intermediate grade (modified Healy and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's grading schemes used)， 4 cm， oncocytic variant； pathologic TMS staging was pT2N0.\n\n【28】Based on the pathologic diagnosis of intermediate grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma， oncocytic variant，pT2N0， the patient will receive cervical neck dissection and radiation therapy， and likely chemotherapy. A rare case of oncocytic mucoepidermoid carcinoma in a 26 year old male was presented. To aid in this diagnosis， the following stains were done： CK5/6， CK7， CK14， p63， Ki-67， CK903， CK20， GCDFP， SOX10， Androgen receptor， GATA3， PAS-D， mucicarmine. The stains CK5/6 and p63 were performed to identify oncocytes. PAS-D and mucicarmine were performed to identify mucin and mucous cells. Androgen receptor and GATA3were performed to rule out salivary duct carcinoma. CK7，CK14，and GCDFP were performed to rule out salivary gland carcinoma. CK20was performed to rule out small cell carcinoma.CK903 wasperformed to rule out myoepithelial carcinoma. SOX-10 was performed to rule out acinic cell， adenoid cystic， epithelial-myoepithelial， myoepithelial carcinomas and pleomorphic adenoma. Ki-67 was performed to evaluate mitotic activity. Based on the histological evaluation and results ofthe immunostains and special stains， the diagnosis ofOMEC was made. In this case it was not necessary to order RT-PCR or FISH to test for MAML2 translocation. However， if the results of staining were equivocal MAML2 testing would have been the next step.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\nThis case report provides a comprehensive list of stains that are useful in the diagnosis of OMEC. The main limitation of this report is that all stains presented were not used in this case； therefore they were not all compared for usefulness in making the diagnosis (stains were chosen based on pathologist preference). The main lessons of this case report are：|删除段之间换行|1. OMEC is a rare tumor found most commonly in the parotid gland and|删除段之间换行|2.

Teratomas are composed ofone or multiple tissues such as hair， sebaceous glands. Teeth and other tissues derived from germ cells. Microscopically， it is composed of endodermal， ectodermal， mesodermal components. Pancreatic tissue， mucinous epithelium， respiratory epithelium， epidermal tissue with sebaceous glands， adipose tissue smooth muscle， and cartilage can be identified.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】An 18-year-old male presented to OPD with complaints of cough， shortness of breath， chest discomfort for two weeks. Cough was mainly non-productive in nature with no postural or diurnal variation. Shortness of breath was insidious in onset， gradually progressed from grade 0 MMRC to grade 2 MMRC in duration of two weeks. Patient gives a history of low-grade fever one episode two weeks back. On examination， Pulse rate -90/min， BP-110/70 mmHg， Temperature- 100°F， Respiratory rate -18/min， SpO， -96% at room air. Breath sounds are decreased in lower 2/3 of Right Lung.

Occurrence of dystrophic calcification in the cystic wall of the odontogenic keratocyst is a very rare entity with only few of significance， quoted in the literature. This article describes a case report of a 20 year old male patient treated for odontogenic keratocyst in the right mandible. It also provides an overview of the occurrence of dystrophic calcification in the cystic wall of odontogenic keratocyst and the various theories of etiopathogenesis of these dystrophic calcifications.\n\n【2】Keywords： Cyst； Odontogenic keratocyst； Calcifying odontogenic keratocyst； Dystrophic calcifications\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The term Odontogenic Keratocyst’(OKC) perplexes clinicians and pathologist a like consequent of its changing conduct with regards to its aggressiveness. Evolution of this enigmatic entity has been affiliated with many terminologies over the ages. In literature， the keratocyst was earlier described as a cholesteatoma (Hauer， 1926； Kostecka， 1929) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Robinson referred to this entity as a primordial cyst owing to its pathogenesis which is developmental in origin， arising from odontogenic epithelium. The term OKC was introduced by Philipsen in 1956. World Health Organization (WHO) accepted this terminology in 1992. In 2005， WHO christened OKC as Keratocystic Odontogenic Tumor (KCOT) owing to its aggressive behaviour，high recurrence rates and specific histological characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. In 2017， WHO rechristened KCOT back into the cystic category citing that true neoplasm does not regress spontaneously on decompression 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\n\n【5】OKC is described as “a benign uni or multi cystic intraosseous tumor of odontogenic origin， with a potentially aggressive infiltrative behaviour. It may present as a single/multiple lesion(s). The latter is usually associated with an inherited nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【6】OKC generally has a docile clinical presentation， often asymptomatic， unless secondarily infected or， if the affected teeth turn symptomatic. Large lesions can cause paraesthesia owing to pressure effects.\n\n【7】Histological diversity is a known feature of OKC which includes variations in the epithelial lining， basal layer and malignant transformation to name a few.\n\n【8】Hard tissue deposits， namely dystrophic calcifications， cartilage， dentinoid are uncommon in the connective tissue wall of the primary OKC 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Browne 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> reported a prevalence of 16.9%dystrophic calcifications， in primary OKC and 33.3% in syndromic OKC.\n\n【9】The incidence and implications of these calcifications on recurrence are unclear， either due to its rarity or due to lack of reporting. Hence， it is of paramount importance to report and follow these entities long term， to evaluate their true nature. This could aid us in formulating an ideal treatment protocol.\n\n【10】The following is a case report describing a 20 year old male patient treated for odontogenic keratocyst of right mandible demonstrating calcifications in the epithelial lining which is a rare histopathological appearance.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】A 20 year old male patient presented with a chief complaint of swelling on the right lower side删除1换行of his jaw present since 6 months. The swelling was initially small in size which gradually increased. No complaints of pain discharge or paresthesia of inferior alveolar nerve was elicited.\n\n【13】On examination， a diffuse swelling was seen on the right lower side of the face approximately 2 cm in greatest dimension extending anteroposteriorly about 3 cm posterior to the corner of the lip. Superoinferiorly extending about 2 cm below the line joining corner of the mouth to the inferior border of the mandible. On palpation a bony hard swelling，non-tender，non-compressible and non-reducible was evident. Skin over the swelling appeared uninvolved. Intra-oral examination revealed bony hard swelling indicative of buccal cortical expansion in relation to 45， 46 region， retained 85，84 was present with missing 43， 44 .\n\n【14】The orthopantomography (OPG) revealed1 a welldefined multilocular radiolucent lesion extending from distal of 42 to distal of48 anteroposteriorly and superoinferiorly extending from the height of the alveolar bone on the right quadrant to the base of the mandible with the displacement of the inferior alveolar canal towards the lower border of the mandible. The border of the mandible was intact. Deep vertically impacted 43， 44 were present along with a supernumerary tooth (bucco-version) between the retained deciduous molars and impacted permanent teeth. No root resorption was evident. The OPG also confirmed the presence of a supernumerary tooth between the upper first and second premolars bilaterally .\n\n【15】Cone beam computed tomography of right mandible confirmed the extensions of the radiolucent lesion along with the presence of vertically impacted 43， 44 and supernumerary tooth. Thinned out buccal and lingual cortex with associated expansion of the buccal cortical plate was present. With a well-defined breach in the buccal cortex noted at level distal to the tooth 45. This breach could be correlated to the site of biopsy which was done prior to the patient’s consultation with us. A breach was also evident on the lingual cortex of 47 .\n\n【16】The lesion was provisionally diagnosed as odontogenic keratocyst ofthe right mandible； with the differential diagnosis of ameloblastoma， aneurysmal bone cyst and central giant cell granuloma. Aspiration cytology and incisional biopsy of the cystic lesion was performed at the thinned out buccal cortical region between 45 and 46.\n\n【17】Aspiration fluid was smeared and revealed the presence of scattered abundant hematoxyphilic calcifications .\n\n【18】Incisional biopsy revealed cystic lining comprising of 5 layers to7 layers thick parakeratinized stratified squamous epithelium with surface corrugations. Basal cells are prominent and show palisading arrangement of nuclei. The unique finding in the cystic wall was the presence of hematoxyphilic； dystrophic calcifications resembling calcospherites . The histopathological features confirmed the diagnosis of OKC.\n\n【19】Enucleation of the cyst along with extraction of impacted 43， 44and the supernumerary tooth was done followed with treatment of bony cavity with carnoy’s solution and packing the same with BIPP(Bismuth Iodoform Paraffin Paste) soaked gauze.\n\n【20】Microscopic6examination of the excisional specimen revealed similar features as described in incisional biopsy and the histopathological diagnosis ofOKC was consistent with the incisional biopsy diagnosis. On follow up of 2 years， there was no recurrence.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】OKC has been recognized as a separate entity of benign cystic lesion of the jaws. This entity was also referred to as cholesteatoma， epidermoid cyst， sebaceous cyst， or primordial cyst of the jaw. In1971， the WHO simplified the classification of jaw cysts and made the terms \"primordial cyst\"and “keratocyst\" synonymous 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. OKC was categorized by thelatest WHO classification as a developmental， non-inflammatory odontogenic cyst that arises from cell rests of dental lamina 通用删除6(英):<u>[7，8]</u>.\n\nThe KCOTs (now renamed as OKC) are lined by a regular parakeratinized stratified squamous epithelium， usually about 5-8cell layers thick and without rete ridges. There is a well-defined， often palisaded， basal layer of columnar or cuboidal cells. The nuclei of the columnar basal cells tend to be oriented away from the basement membrane and are often intensely basophilic. This is an important feature in distinguishing KCOT from jaw cysts with|删除段之间换行|keratinization. The parakeratotic layers often have a corrugated surface. Desquamated keratin is present in many of the cavities. Mitotic figures are found frequently 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Separation of the epithelium from the supporting connective tissue of the cyst is common and is caused by metalloproteinases-mediated degradation of collagen in the juxta-epithelial regions 通用删除6(英):<u>[9，10]</u>.\n\n【24】Browne et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> found a high incidence of crystalline calcium phosphates，hydroxyapatite and whitlockite， and inorganic phosphates in the aspirated fluid ofthe odontogenic keratocysts. This may be responsible for the increased frequency of calcific deposits in the walls of these cysts.\n\n【25】Primary non-recurrent odontogenic keratocyst (which is a primary keratocyst without recurrence within 5 years) shows a slightly higher prevalence for dystrophic calcifications than primary odontogenic keratocyst that recurred (which is a primary keratocyst with recurrence within 5 years). However， in recurrent odontogenic keratocyst (a keratocyst that occurs in the exact area of a previously removed keratocyst or where there is a reliable history of cyst removal in the same location)， dystrophic calcification is comparatively uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>.\n\n【26】The most common calcification in solitary KCOT is dystrophic calcifications， reported to be 4.5% to 16.8% 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，13，14]</u>. These are usually caused by degeneration and degeneration can be the result of necrobiosis or a foreign-body reaction. Additionally， injured tissue of any kind is predisposed to dystrophic calcification. High incidence of crystalline calcium phosphates， hydroxyapatite， and whitlockite， and inorganic phosphates were found in the aspirated fluid of the KCOT. This may be responsible for the higher frequency calcium deposits in the walls of these lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\n\nThere are limited reports of presence of chondroid material in capsules of odontogenic keratocyst. There are several possible explanations for the presence of cartilage in the cyst wall which included the presence of a chondroma； persistence and displacement of vestigial remains of the Meckel’s cartilage and nasal septal cartilage；|删除段之间换行|a possible metaplastic change of the fibrous connective tissue in response to chronic irritation； a possible induction of the cyst wall by the epithelial lining； and/or increased presence of “trapped”glycosaminoglycans 通用删除6(英):<u>[16-20]</u>.\n\n【28】Exceedingly rare is the presence of dentinoid which can occur as irregular eosinophilic masses with tubule formation or calcospherite-like mineralization. The possible pathogenesis could be the inductive changes which mesenchymal cells， can undergo， leading to calcium deposits. Bone Sialoprotein (BSP) is synthesized and secreted by bone， dentine and cementum-forming cells and has been implicated in de novo bone formation and mineralization 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. The other alternative explanation is that the formation of dentin or dentinoid may represent a metaplastic change in the connective tissue通用删除6(英):<u> 4]</u>.\n\n【29】Andrade Santos et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> conducted a comparative study evaluating the immune-histochemical expression of nucear factor Kappa B， matrix metalloproteinase 9， and endoglin (CD105) in OKC， Dentigerous cysts (DC) and Radicular cysts (RC). The results suggest that the more aggressive biologic behaviour of OKCs compared with RCs and DCs is related to the higher expression of MMP-9 and NF-Kappa B in these lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\n\n【30】Few of the histopathological criteria predicting recurrence of an OKC includes， subepithelial hyalinisation， basal layer budding(increased basal layer mitotic figures)， separation of the epithelial lining from the capsule and the presence of odontogenic epithelial rests and/or satellite cysts within the capsule 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>.\n\n【31】Therapeuticapproaches varyin differentstudies from marsupialization and enucleation， which may be combined with adjuvant therapy such as cryotherapy or Carnoy’s solution， to marginal or radical resection. The recurrent rate varies from approximately 20% to 62%通用删除6(英):<u>[23-26]</u>. The recurrence of OKC is affected by 1) enucleation with or without rupture of the cystic capsule； 2) the surgical approach used (conservative approaches such as enucleation andmarsupialization vs. aggressiveapproaches such as total resection)； and 3) the use of adjunct therapy (e.g.， Carnoy's solution， cryotherapy，peripheral ostectomy)通用删除6(英):<u>[27，28]</u>.\n\n【32】A review study conducted by Chirapathomsakul and colleagues通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> revealed that all types of treatment， except marginal resection， gave rise to recurrence. The recurrent lesions occurred more frequently in parakeratinized OKCs， symphysis-body region， and patients who had lesions associated with the remaining teeth and were treated by enucleation and enucleation with curettage.\n\n【33】Long term studies on the significance of the presence of dystrophic calcifications in the cystic walls of OKC have yet to be evaluated. Prompt reporting of these rare entities will enrich our understanding in terms of their pathogenesis， behaviour of growth删除1换行and their aggressiveness.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We report a case of fine needle cytology of atypical medullary carcinoma. It was diagnosed in 43-years-old woman 18years ago. She alsosuffered from Morbus Hashimoto and hypothireosis. The tumour was detected by mammography in the upper part of the left breast. Fine needle aspiration cytology with ultrasound guidance of the tumour was performed. Cytological diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma of the breast was put. The patient was operated on (mastectomy) and histological diagnosis of atypical medullary carcinoma was put. The tumour was oestrogen and progesterone receptor negative. It was hyper dyploid with high proliferative activity by flow cytometric DNA analysis. The patient was without any sign of the tumour 15 years after the operation when she died because of the heart failure.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Medullary carcinoma of the breast is a rare tumour (4%-7% patients). Atypical medullary carcinoma is more rare (less than 4% patients). It is considered as distinctive subtype with a more favourable prognosis than invasive ductal carcinomas and other histologic subtypes despite it's an aplastic morphology 通用删除6(英):<u>[1-4]</u>. There is no specific pathological reason for this name of the tumour. It is named according its appearance which resembles the tissue of the medulla oblongata region of the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. This term medulla derives from the Latin root “medulla” that means \"marrow”通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Atypical medullary carcinoma of the breast has similar prognostic factors as medullary carcinoma but survival is better 通用删除6(英):<u>[4，6]</u>. It is usually diagnosed in younger female patients (age of 35 or younger) without family history .It differs from typical medullary carcinoma in terms of pathologic figures with an infiltrative margin， mild mononuclear infiltration， a low nuclear grade and presence of an intraductal component 通用删除6(英):<u>[3，6]</u>. Cystic type is diagnosed in premenopausal women or menopausal women 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. It can be detected in men as well 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. It is not hereditary as ductal breast carcinoma，but according to some authors the atypical medullary carcinoma has the same clinical and pathological characteristics and outcomes with those of the invasive ductal carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The tumour tends to be smaller than 3 cm with circumscribed margins and firm consistency. Therefore it can be mistaken clinically and radiologically for benign lesion. Axillary lymph nodes are often enlarged and they are not metastatic but reactive 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The prognosis is poor because 90% of the tumours are oestrogen and progesterone receptor negative 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Histological criteria for typical medullary carcinoma by Ridolfi are： predominantly syncytial growth pattern in more than 75% tumour area， circumscription with a pushing margin， moderate to marked lymphoplasmacytic infiltration， poorly differentiated nuclear grade with a high mitotic rate， scant stroma and absence of an intraductal component 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Although atypical medullary carcinoma has some morphological characteristics similar as typical medullary carcinoma， it is different because it has： infiltrative margin， mild mononuclear infiltration， a low nuclear grade and presence of an intraductal component， mild or negligible mononuclear infiltrate or infiltrate at margins only； nuclear grade 3 (higher than for medullary carcinoma) and presence of microglandular features (opposite to medullary carcinoma)通用删除6(英):<u>[3，4]</u>. Oestrogen and progesterone receptor negative tumours are 90 % 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Genetically medullary breast carcinoma is often associated\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 43-year-old woman， a mother of 22-years old daughter， presented with fibrocystic disease 18 years ago. Besides she suffered of Morbus Hashimoto and hypothireosis and therefore was cured with Vobenol (100 mg per day for 4 years). Mammography showed uniformly dense， non-calcified， round， well-circumscribed mass in the upper outer quadrant ofthe left breast .Ultrasonography showed indistinct lesion with inhomogeneous， hypoechoic texture in cystic tissue . Fine needle aspiration cytology with ultrasound guidance was performed using 23 gauge needle and 20ml disposable syringe. Cytological diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma was put. The patient has undergone surgery (mastectomy) and histological diagnosis of atypical medullary carcinoma was\n\n【6】Results and Discussion\n\n【7】Cytology\n\n【8】We had to be very cautious in cytological analysis of the smears because Vobenol can cause morphological changes to the benign epithelial cells and they can be very similar to malignant cells. The smears were hyper cellular. Groups of benign rather small epithelial cells with scant cytoplasm were intermixed with large， moderately to poorly differentiated malignant epithelial cells distributed individually or in loose syncytial groupings and clusters .\n\n【9】Malignant cells were rather large (more than 25 um in diameter)， slightly anisokaryotic and pleomorphic . The nuclei had irregular nuclear membrane and chromatin was dense and fine，often granuloreticular. Nucleoli were prominent， enlarged and usually multiple with irregular shapes and the cytoplasm was greyish-blue， often ill-defined， and scant to abundant . Apparent vacuolation was not true： aspect was caused by scattered fat droplets. Large naked tumour nuclei， some bizarre， with rare mitosis， few lymphocytes and stromal cells could occasionally be seen. Therefore we put the cytological diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma.\n\n【10】The fact that it is impossible to put the accurate cytological diagnosis of atypical medullary carcinoma is perhaps the reason why I could not find any cytological paper about it but the author have found only rare papers about cytology of medullary carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>[8，10-12]</u>.\n\n【11】Pathology\n\n【12】Well-circumscribed soft tumour mass with bulging surface measured 2 cm ×1.5 cm. Seventeen axillary lymph nodes were free of tumour. Tumour had predominantly syncytial growth pattern (over75 % of the tumour). There were large sheets of malignant epithelial cells with syncytial growth pattern and dense fibrous stroma infiltrated by lymphocytes . Malignant cells have vesicular pleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleoli . Tumour was oestrogen and progesterone receptor negative and katepsin D slightly positive.\n\n【13】DNA Analysis\n\n【14】DNA analysis was made by flow cytometry using program PARA l by EPICS-C flow-cytometer. Cytological material is adequate for DNA flow cytometric analyses (DNA content can be performed on 10000-2000 cells and regular fine needle sampling contains删除1换行approximately 100000 cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. Despite that， we have prepared suspension of single nuceli prepared from paraffin wax embedded blocks of the tumour because the results are better than from the fresh tissue because of intra-tumour heterogeneity 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Therefore we prepared cells from six slices for each paraffin block. The suspension of single nuclei was prepared from paraffin wax embedded blocks of the tumour because the results are better than from the fresh tissue because of intra-tumour heterogeneity 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. We prepared six slices for each paraffin block-a 30 micron section was cut， washed in xylene to remove the paraffin. After that it was rehydrated by repeat treatment with decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Mechanical disaggregation with metal mesh was performed and followed by enzymatic dispersion with pepsin. Then the samples were filtered through nylon mesh and stained with propidium iodide containing ribonuclease. Cellular DNA content was measured using program PARA I by EPICS-C flow-cytometer. Tumour was aneuploid-hyperdiploid with high proliferative activity (DNA index was 1，3； there were three peaks in G.-G. phase， P index was 33，6%； S phase fraction was 12，8%) .\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Ultrasound guided FNAC of impalpable lesions of the breast is very useful in searching and diagnosing of breast carcinoma. It is difficult to put the exact cytological diagnosis of atypical medullary carcinoma of the breast because the lymphocytes are not present in the smears or if there are only few lymphocytesin the smears Therefore pathohistological analysis was required for the definitive accurate diagnosis of atypical medullary carcinoma of breast in our patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is necessary to use serum biomarkers for assessment oflong-time follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. To be able to perform such a study it is often needed to work with stored serum samples for shorter or longer times. In a previous reported in 1990 it was shown that the stability of TK1 in serum probably was due to that TK1 formed a native macromolecule complex (730 KD) 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Incubation at 56℃ for 30 min remained about 70% of the enzyme activity， showing the rather stability of TK1 in serum 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In respect to serum thymidine kinase 1， analysis within 3 hours after preparing the fresh serum is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The collected serum samples can be stored in -80°C， for years before one-time analysis. There is absence of deep freezing at -80°C in some hospitals； serum samples were stored at -20°C for some years. However， no extensive investigation has been done to prove at -20C works well. Here we performed an investigation on serum TK1 concentration (STK1p) to see how the quality is affected after storage at -20°C for 10 years.\n\n【9】Materialand Methods\n\n【10】Patients and serum samples\n\n【11】The serum samples from breast and head & neck malignant patients were collected from Karolinska University Hospital， Sweden and the serum samples of the lung malignant patients were collected at Hubei Tumor Hospital， Wuhan， China. Serum samples were collected in the morning on fasting condition， collected without anticoagulant and then centrifuged at 800 x g for 5 to 8min. STK1p was determined within 3 hours. The results of the STK1p of patients with breast 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>， lung， head & neck carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> have been reported. The sera were divided into 4 to 6 tubes of200 ul each， at dry-ice and then kept at -20°C and stored for 10 years. At the time for reanalysis after 10 years， 69 serum samples were randomly collected from the cohort of 109 serum samples and re-analyzed for STK1p. The hemolysis， lipolysis， precipitation and repeated thawing of serum samples shall not be used.\n\n【12】STK1p assay\n\n【13】Serum samples were probed with chicken anti human TK1 IgY polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide (residue 195 225 of human TK1， amino acid sequence： GQPAG PDNKE NCPVP GKPGE AVAAR KLFAPQ). From the intensities of the TK1-calibrator of known concentrations， the STK1p concentration value was calculated and expressed as pM. Serum samples were probed without the antibodies as controls通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Samples were in duplicate analysis.\n\n【14】Statistics\n\n【15】Mean values， standard deviation and T-test were determined by SPSS Statistics (V20.0， IBM， USA.P≤ 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant value.\n\n【16】Results\n\n【17】Serum samples (n=109) were collected from breast，lung andhead& neck malignant patients， analyzed for Serum Thymidine Kinase 1Concentration (STK1p) and stored at -20°C. The serum samples(n=69) were randomly collected from the cohort of 109 serum samples and re-analysed for STK1p. The mean values of STK1p concentration decreased by 3%-15% in the breast， lung and head &neck carcinomas groups however not statistically significant (P>0.2). The results showed that no signal can be detected when the serum samples were probed without the antibodies as controls (Data not shown).\n\n【18】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【19】Although fresh biological material is tobe preferred when analysis clinical samples， it is not always possible when some hospitals are not available for the deep-freezing at -80°C. An alternative option is to store serum samples at -20℃. We have been working with serological tumor biomarkers during the last 30 years and particular with thymidinekinase 1， a proliferation serum biomarker 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Most of time our co-works were able to use fresh material. We mostly stored删除1换行the samples at -80°C； sometimes the samples were store at -20°C. However， we did not investigation on the quality effect on TK1 stored at -20°C for years. In this study we therefore reanalyzed the serum samples that have been stored at -20°C for 10 years. No significant changes in the STK1p concentration values were found.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】We conclude that the quality of TK1 in serum is not affected significantly by store at -20°C for at least 10 years. This opens up for the use of deep-freezing clinical serum samples less than -80℃， at least at -20°C， makes it possible to perform long-time follow-up of tumour patients or determine early tumor risk progress for evaluating the prognosis of patients.\n\n【22】Ethical Conduct of Research\n\n【23】All patients gave informed consent to participate in this study， which was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of the1964 Helsinki declaration and the Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice from the International Conference on Harmonization.

HSV-1 meningitis is exceptional but could be more frequently observed linked to the epidemiological changes in HSV infections.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Herpes Simplex Viruses (HSV) is known to invade the Central Neural System (CNS). HSV type 1 usually moves via the trigeminal and/or olfactory ganglia to the CNS， where it replicates， and causing life-threatening encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. HSV type 2 spreads from the sacral ganglia and is responsible for benign， spontaneously resolved but often recurrent， Mollaret’s meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\n\n【4】This report describes the case of an immunocompetent 11 year-old boy admitted in emergency to the Toulouse University Pediatric Hospital in November 2019 suffering from a fever， pulsatile frontal headache，neck stiffness，phono-photophobia， nausea and vomiting. The fever，headache and vomiting appeared ten days earlier in a context of a herpes-like gingivostomatitis.\n\n【5】Physical examination confirmed the pyrexia and meningitis with no focal neurological deficit or symptoms of encephalitis. He had no rash or vesicular eruption. The admission cranial computed tomography scan was normal.\n\nExamination of the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) revealed pleocytosis (548 cells/pl， 100%lymphocytes) and increased protein (2.7 N). CSF gram staining was negative as were cultures. Multiplex PCR targeting CNS bacterial， viral and fungal pathogens (n=14) (Film Array Meningitis/Encephalitis panel - BioFire Diagnostics， BioMerieux， France) was positive for HSV-1. This was confirmed with a specific in-house molecular system for detecting HSV-1 and 2 genomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The serum/blood C-reactive protein and white blood cell count were normal. Tests for HSV-1 and HSV-2 genomes were negative； that for anti-HSV-1 IgG was positive and that for anti-HSV-2 IgG was negative (Liaison XL HSV-1 and HSV-2 Type|删除段之间换行|Specific IgG-DiaSorin， Italy). At one month a control test for anti-HSV-1 IgG showed a four-fold increase in antibody titer. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging at diagnosis gave normal patterns.\n\n【7】The patient was given intravenous acyclovir (500 mg/m’every 8 h) for 2 weeks. He completely recovered and was discharged without any sequela. The detailed medical history， clinical manifestations and their evolution， anti-HSV-1-IgG kinetic suggest that the gingivostomatitis reflected a pauci-symptomatic HSV-1 primary infection.

We present two clinical cases of intramural duodenal haematoma following endoscopic biopsy， which caused partial duodenal obstruction and pancreatitis and resolved with conservative management.\n\n【2】Keywords： Intramural duodenal haematoma； Endoscopic biopsy complication； Conservative management\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Endoscopic biopsies are a widely used diagnostic tool for celiac disease， gastric ulcers and graft versus host disease. An intramural duodenal hematoma (IDH) is a rare complication ofendoscopic biopsy. To our knowledge， there have been 30 other reported cases in literature of this complication and 21 (70%)通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2]</u> of them presented in patients 18 years old and younger. Most IDHs require conservative management， however it is also associated with pancreatitis， duodenal perforation and biliary obstruction， and， therefore， it is a complication that all pediatric endoscopist should be aware and cautious. We present two clinical cases here of post-endoscopic biopsy IDHs and review literature regarding diagnosis and management of IDH. The first case is of a boy with no previous risk factors， while the second case is in a patient with long history of immunosuppression and a previous bone marrow transplant.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Case 1\n\n【7】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【8】A 12 year old boy underwent an upper endoscopy because of complaints of poor appetite， inconstant feces and abdominal pain. He had no history of bleeding or failure to thrive. The endoscopy was performed with“Olympus\"video gastroduodenoscope (8.8 mm diameter).Multiple lesions in the antrum area were observed and biopsies of the esophagus， stomach and duodenum were obtained using \"Olympus\"forceps. Histological examination showed mild inflammation of the esophagus and a pathological diagnosis of reflux esophagitis was concluded. After the procedure the patient was stable and was discharged home with no present complaints. Two hours after the discharge， he was re-admitted with abdominal pain (VAS-10) and frequent vomiting. On physical examination diffuse abdominal tenderness and bloated abdomen were observed， arterial blood pressure-106/75 mmHg， pulse- 86 b/min. Blood tests showed leukocytosis (14.00 x 10/l)， hemoglobin of 125g/l， and hematocrit 32.8%， and alkalosis (pH 7.49， pCO，21.3 mmHg， pO， 82.5mmHg， HCO， 16.4 mmol/L， SBE -6.3 mmol/L). His INR (1.4) was slightly prolonged. During the next few days his hemoglobin dropped to 109g/l， while the metabolic disorder and INR stabilized.\n\n【9】On admission an abdominal ultrasound  showed a solid mass， similar to a hematoma， compressing the liver and associated to the duodenum. In fear of a perforated duodenum， a contrast computer tomography (CT) was administered. Because of frequent vomiting， only intravenous contrast was used. The CT  confirmed a nonhomogeneous， well circumcised oval mass， filled with fluid， in the second part of the duodenum and local compression of the biliary tract- consistent with the signs of an IDH. Since no signs of a perforation were observed during the CT， conservative treatment， consisting of total parental nutrition， painkillers， proton pump inhibitors and nasogastric suction， was chosen. Repeated abdominal ultrasounds， a CT and video\n\n【10】Case 2\n\n【11】A 13 year old boy with history of graft versus host disease after a bone marrow transplant due to meylodisplastic syndrome was examined because of weight loss. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed to determine the presence of chronic graft versus host disease. Before the procedure the patient had slight anemia(Hemoglobin- 115g/L) and thrombocytopenia (Platelet count-58x10/L). The gastroduodenoscopy revealed erosive esophagitis， varicosis of the esophageal veins， gastropathy and duodenogastric reflux. Histological examination confirmed low activity graft versus host disease ofthe gut.\n\n【12】Immediatelyafter theprocedure the patient presented with intense abdominal pain and frequent vomiting. On physical examination the patient had a compulsoryposition， diffuse abdominal tenderness. The hemoglobin level had decreased to 92g/L， while amylase levels were increased (3783.4U/L).\n\n【13】Suspecting acute pancreatitis an abdominal ultrasound was ordered. It revealed a 70 by 50mm mass， resembling a hematoma by the duodenum with no oedema signs of the pancreas . A CT and upper endoscopy confirmed an intramural hematoma in the second part of the duodenum.\n\n【14】Conservative management， consisting of intravenous fluids， parenteral nutrition， antibiotics and painkillers， was chosen. After 13days a resolution of the hematoma was observed and the patient was transferred to the oncohematology ward for further treatment.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Even though the first case of IDH was reported in 1838， the incidence of it is still unknown. IDH is usually a consequence of a blunt abdominal trauma and predominant in children as mentioned before. Guzman reports that endoscopic complications in children present only in 2% of cases， and most are associated with the anesthesia or bleeding and perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. The only 2 patients that developed an IDH post endoscopy in our hospital are described here. One of the mechanisms， thought to contribute to the development of an IDH is the duodenum's fixed retroperitoneal position and the rich submucosal vascularplexus，which is prompt tobleeding通用删除6(英):<u>[1，4]</u>.Though there are no proven risk factors for IDH after an endoscopic biopsy， previously reported cases have been associated with malnuritment， anticoagulant therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>， and post transplant patients. Some authors report an IDH in patients with no previous medical history 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，7]</u> such as in our first clinical case. Our second case portrays the reported association of an IDH in transplant patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[6，3]</u>. J Ramakrishna et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> reports that IDH after endoscopic biopsy is usually the result ofthrombocytopenia and levels of over 50x10°/L should be sustained at least for 48 hours after the procedure. It should also be noted that a study of 24 bone marrow transplants with suspicion of graft versus host disease， showed that gastric antrum biopsies were more sensitive for the diagnostics than biopsies from the duodenum or rectum 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\n\n【17】In consideration this and of the risk factors of a developing IDH for such patients， duodenal biopsies may not be necessary for the diagnosis of graft versus host disease and should be performed only with strong indications.\n\n【18】Because of its’ retroperitoneal position， any trauma to the duodenum can present itself with unspecific symptoms. The most common are reported to be abdominal pain and vomiting or hematemesis usually within 48 hours of the trauma mechanism， diffuse abdominal tenderness 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，2，6，7]</u>. Laboratory findings are also unspecific and are associated with such complications of an IDH as pancreatitis and cholestasis. In our first case， the admission findings showed only metabolic alkalosis， which was most likely due to the patients vomiting. Later on， hemoglobin level fell slightly， but did not require any blood transfusions. And as the obstruction of the biliary tree by the hematoma progressed， total bilirubin levels elevated. The second patient had decreased platelets and hemoglobin due to his primary disease， after the biopsy he first presented with high amylase levels， followed by increased pancytopenia and anemia.\n\n【19】Imaging techniques such as ultrasound， CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 通用删除6(英):<u>[10，11]</u> are used for diagnosing IDH. In our first case， an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was also used as a diagnostic tool. Though not standardized， each one of the imaging techniques has its own place in the diagnostics of an IDH. Ultrasound is usually one of the first to be performed for a child presenting with abdominal pain. D Antoniou et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> reports that a nonperistaltic hypoechogenic mass associated to the duodenum should give a big suspicion of an IDH. However， it is hard to distinguish the hematoma from a pancreas pseudocyst or abscess and ultrasound should not be used as the only diagnostic test. Due to its low cost and safety for the patient， it should be considered as one of the main tools for the control of the hematoma during the course of treatment.\n\n【20】Computer tomography is one of the primary diagnostic tools of a duodenal trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>， which can help differentiate an IDH from a perforated duodenum and， thus， help determine the treatment of choice. In a retrospective study， done by Jeffrey R et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>， pneumoperitoneum and extravasation of contrast were found to be associated with a duodenal perforation. However， KM Kassai et al reported that in 5 children with a duodenalperforation， none showed extravasation of contrast on their CT scans， while of the 14 with an IDH no specific signs on a CT were seen at all，andthey were diagnosed either using an ultrasound or video endogastroduodenoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\n\n【21】Literature indicates that conservative management should be of choice for IDH. 16 of the 21 previously reported cases of and IDH in pediatrics were treated in this manner. Nonoperative management consists of nasogastric suction， no oral feeding， intravenous fluids， and parenteral nutrition 通用删除6(英):<u>[1，7，12]</u>. The resolution of a hematoma is usually observed within 2-3 weeks.\n\n【22】Surgical treatment is to be preferred in the case of duodenal perforationornoclinical improvementwith conservative management after 7-14days 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Percutaneous drainage of the hematoma guided by CT 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> or ultrasound 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> can also be of choice. J Y Lee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> described endoscopic decompression of an IDH after unsuccessful conservative treatment. The patient， first presented here， had total duodenal obstruction and， if conservative management would not have been successful，endoscopic drainage of the hematoma could have been considered as the treatment of choice.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】There have been only a few cases as of yet of IDH after upper intestinal endoscopybiopsy. Though it is a rare complication， without appropriate treatment it can have lethal results， whereas a timely diagnosis can often lead to successful conservative management. That is why every patient， especially one with medical history of anticoagulation or immunosuppression， presenting with abdominal pain and vomiting after a video gastrointestinal endoscopic biopsy should be examined for an IDH. Ultrasound and CT are both adequate choices for the diagnostics of IDH，however CT is preferred for the primary diagnosis， where as ultrasound can be used as a safe technique to monitor the resolution of the hematoma. Non-operative management should be preferred for stable patients with surgical treatment reserved for unstable patients and unsuccessful conseryative treatment cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
