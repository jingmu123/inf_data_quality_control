Simultaneous bilateral rupture is usually associated with certain chronic generalized conditions. It is more common in older people and is thought to be the result oftendon weakening due to obesityand arteriosclerosis induced fibrotic changes， or previous injuries. There are only few cases reported in the literature where the onlypredisposing cause is previous anabolic steroid abuse通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-6\\]</u>. We describe the simultaneous rupture of both quadriceps tendons in a bodybuilder who had taken anabolic steroids for vears.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 51 year otherwise healthy male had used anabolic steroids and testosterone for ten years to enhance his physique and performance. The drugs he used were Sustanon (testosterone) and Deca Durabolin (nandrolone) both of which he injected to him. He claimed that he used both of the drugs mostly in the spring time and summer and only small doses at autumn and winter. Previous to this accident he had used both drugs on a weekly basis. He had not suffered from other steroid related problems.\n\n【7】He experienced sudden severe pain in both knees after a vigorous leg exercise while attempting to front squat 100 kg of weight. He was unable to stand or walk and in the emergency department he was not able to raise a straight leg from the bed. He has also bilateral swelling and hematoma in both knee joints. In the x-rays . There was a bilateral front tilting patella and patella baja and massive swelling. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed with ultrasound which showed a complete bilateral quadriceps tendon rupture. The patient was checked thoroughly but no other predisposing cause to this incident was found. In laboratory tests creatinine and parathormone levels were normal.\n\n【8】At the operation in the both side a complete avulsion of the quadriceps tendon from the patella extending to medial and lateral retinacula . The tendons were re attached with sutures(5 Ticron) using three vertical bone tunnels to the patella. The retina culums were also repaired. In the operating table the right knee could be flexed up to 90 degrees and the left up to 60 degrees. Both legs were immobilized in hinged brace for eight weeks and the range of motion was gradually increased. The patient was allowed to return full weight bearing immediately after the operation.\n\n【9】The patient was able to make straight leg raise with minimal lag and could flex his knees up to90 degrees three months after operation. He was also able to walk normally and maintain full weight bearing. No further visits in day care unit were organized but patient was contacted by phone almost a year after the injury and at that point he was able to flex his knees up to 115-120 degrees and he had returned to the gym.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】There are several case reports regarding different tendon ruptures associated to the anabolic steroid abuse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3，7\\]</u>. But very few of them are in the quadriceps tendon.\n\nSimultaneous bilateral ruptures of the quadriceps tendons are rare and associated with some predisposing generalized conditions. Chronic renal failure， gout and hyperparathyroidism are implicated in younger patients， with diabetes and obesity in the older. These|删除段之间换行|conditions were excluded in our patient and it is reasonable to attribute the injury to his steroid ingestion. The effect of anabolic steroids to induce tendon pathology is well supported in animal experiments， especially in combination with exercise. Michna found dose-related abnormalities of collagen fibrils in mice tendons and it was greatest degree in steroid-treated mice with combination of exercise. These morphological changes in the mice tendons with anabolic steroids and exercise are accompanied by changes in the mechanical properties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Wood et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> postulated that these biomechanical changes can result in complete tendon failure and predispose to a rupture.\n\n【13】There are only a few previous case reports which describe simultaneous bilateral quadriceps tendon rupture after anabolic steroid abuse. Conclusive cause-effect relationships cannot be established in any ofthem but this case report supports the suggestion that anabolic steroids in exercising individuals play a significant role in their tendon ruptures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Craniofacial skeleton is usually affected and temporal bone involvement is uncommon. Furthermore， when a concomitant rare mastoid mucocele is already affecting the same region， the related diagnosis can be even more challenging.\n\n【2】The Methodology： Here we report a radiological and surgical case， with CT， MRI and surgical imaging of a patient affected by a mastoid mucocele to be considered as a first sign of fibrous dysplasia onset.\n\n【3】Conclusions： Mastoid mucocele is a rare finding. To date， in medical literature only three cases are depicted. Etiology is still unknown even if multiple have been the hypothesis put forward. Although fibrous dysplasia temporal bone localization is well known， to our knowledge， this is the very first case in medical literature of a mastoid mucocele as an alert of fibrous dysplasia onset.\n\n【4】Keywords： Mucocele； Mastoid； Temporal bone； Head CT； MRI\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Mucocele is an expansile collection of sterile mucus which， lined by epithelium or covered by granulation tissue， could be frequently found in oral mucosa. Though only sporadically observable in the air bones cavities， among them paranasal sinuses are the most predominately involved areas while temporal bone is hardly affected. Pathology uncommon in adults and rare in childhood， mucocele is supposed to arise from the obstruction of the normal drainage of mucus in normal air cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. As a matter of fact， mucosal thickening， bone overgrowth or fibrosis might lead to progressive inspissation of mucus and bone remodeling with local inflammation， thus determining the compression ofthe neighboring structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Clinical diagnosis， mostly relied on neuroradiological imaging (especially CT and MRI)， can be challenging. Surgery is the gold standard for treatment whilst pathologic confirmation could be needed in atypical cases. Nowadays， medical literature provides for five cases of temporal bone mucoceles. Among them only three refer to the mastoid region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-5\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Craniofacial localization of fibrous dysplasia， especially concerning paranasal sinuses and midface involvement， is well documented in medical literature as these regions are the most frequently affected. A recent article by Frisch has extensively presented which the clinical features of the fibrous dysplasia are and how temporal bone affection can be managed as the pathology is less common in this bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Also in consideration of the shortage of articles referring to temporal bone mucoceles available in medicalliterature， a case study ofa mastoid mucocele tobe considered an alert of fibrous dysplasia onset in a young patient treated with surgical drainage will follow.\n\n【10】Case Report\n\n【11】An 8-years-old boy， with medical history of right purulent otitis media occurred 3 years before， presented with subtle pain and swelling behind the right ear. For diagnostic reasons the patient underwent head CT and head MRI. Consequently a mastoidectomy was performed in order to drain the cyst. After the surgery the patient underwent a follow up head CT.\n\n【12】A) Brain MRl， axial T2 image showing a hyperintense mass in the right mastoid (arrow) dislocating the sigmoid sinus， consistent with a mastoid mucocele. B) Head CT axial image showing isodense tissue and loss of bone septa in the right mastoid (arrow). C) Head CT coronal image showing a loculated cavity (arrow) in the inferior right mastoid clearly divided by the healthy aerated mastoid. D) Head CT 3D reconstruction showing the enlargement of the right mastoid (arrow) compared to the contralateral one due to bone remodeling. E) Head CT coronal image showing a new cystic cavity (arrow) posterior to the middle ear.\n\n【13】A) The open right mastoid shows the healthy bone (white arrow)， the cavity of the mucocele (black arrow) with a highly vascularized wall and a bone septum dividing the twa regions (arrowhead). B) The surgical field after the expasure and drainage of the mucacele with decampression of the sigmoid sinus. The wide aditus ad antrum (small white arrow) provides a proper aeration of the cavity.\n\n【14】After the clinical evaluation， the patient underwent head CT that showed a cyst-like lesion  clearly divided from the healthy aerated mastoid cells by a bone septum ； the mastoid proved to be enlarged . At MRI， the lesion appeared hyperintense on T2  and iso-hypointense on T1 and diffusion weighted imaging revealed an intense peripheral contrast enhancement (not shown in figure). The surgical inspection disclosed a mucus collection with a highly vascularized cyst wall .\n\n【15】After surgery the patient underwent a follow up CT ， which show a growing cystic lesion， similar to the one that drove to mastoidectomy in a more anterior area， in the posterior part of the middle ear.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Fibrous dysplasia is a rareidiopathic，progressive bone remodeling disorder. Etiology is still unknown. Craniofacial involvement is frequent， particularly with regards to membranous bones such as maxilla， mandible， frontal ethmoid， and sphenoidal. Temporal bone affection is reported to range from 25% to 70% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The bone remodeling pattern can be monostotic， affecting a single cranial bone (70% of cases)， or polyostotic thus involving multiple cranial bones (30% of cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Typically， first symptoms debut during the first or the second decade of life， males are less frequently affected and clinical features depend on both the site and growth of the lesion. Prepubertal adolescents can show rampant bone remodeling slowing down in adulthood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\nWhenevermastoidiiss involved， recurrent mastoiditis and|删除段之间换行|conductive hearing loss can be symptomatic indicators.\n\n【19】To our knowledge， no case report in medical literature even suggests that fibrous dysplasia might appear concomitantly to a mastoid muicocele.\n\n【20】Only five cases of temporal bone mucoceles are covered by medical literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-5\\]</u>， the latter one reporting lesions found three times in the mastoid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-5\\]</u>and only once in the middle ear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> or in the petrous apex删除4-1:<u>3</u>.\n\n【21】According to the most recent literature， CT andMRI neuroimaging techniques are crucial for diagnosis and surgical planning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In fact， neuroimaging findings provide with sufficient information to differentiate mucocele from other osteolytic lesions of the mastoid (e.g. cholesteatoma， cartilaginous tumors， schwannoma， meningioma， petrositis， glomus tumors， metastatic tumors， giant cell tumors， large air cell， cholesterol granuloma， histiocytosis and lymphoma) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> while， at the same time， disclosing data about both the involvement of the neighboring structures and the best surgical approach to the lesion.\n\n【22】Although surgical intervention can be delayed in case of asymptomatic lesion， in light of the fact that mastoid mucocele， likewise paranasal sinuses mucocele， is expansile 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， drainage of the cyst must be performed whenever adjacent structures are involved通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，9\\]</u>. For such a purpose， mastoidectomyshould be considered a valid approach to drain the lesion and provide for an adequate aeration.\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\nThe etiology of temporal bone mucocele is still unknown although some authors reported history of chronic otitis media in patients affected by a temporal bone mucocele 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5，10\\]</u>， noteworthy，|删除段之间换行|our patient suffered of right purulent otitis media 3 years before the exordium of the retroauricular swelling. The very same authors suggest that recurrent local inflammation is supposed to potentially determine mucosal or bone thickening affecting the ostium of a normal air cell thus causing a local mucus collection.\n\n【25】In our specific patient， bone remodeling typical of the fibrous dysplasia might have been started proximal to a mastoid cell ostium， therefore determining its occlusion causing the collection of mucus and such atypical bone remodeling.\n\n【26】Postsurgical neuroradiological CT examination showed typical fibrous dysplasia cystic bone remodeling.

Infection， stone disease， primary bowel mass， and recurrent urothelial cell cancer are among the causes to consider. Here， we report a case of a 61 year old male who developed hematuria secondary to neobladder varices which was managed with TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt) and variceal embolization.\n\n【2】Keywords： Neobladder； Hematuria； TIPS； Cirrhosis； Bladder cancer； Varices\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The standard of care for muscle invasive bladder cancer is a radical cystectomy. While different urinary diversion techniques are utilized， an orthotopicneobladder allows the patient to utilize the natural orifice for urine drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. By utilizing bowel， neobladders are uniquely susceptible to pathologies associated with the gastrointestinal system as well as the genitourinary system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This creates a diagnostic problem in these patients when presenting with hematuria. This is a case report of a male with hepatic cirrhosis who developed hematuria from neobladder varices that was managed by TIPS and variceal embolization. To our knowledge， this is the first case of TIPS and variceal embolization being utilized to successfully stop hematuria in this setting.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nA 61 year old male with idiopathic hepatic cirrhosis who had undergone cystoprostatectomy for muscle invasive bladder cancer with ileal neobladder ten years prior presented with a one month history of hematuria. He maintained follow up after his original surgery as it was complicated by wound dehissence resulting in neobladder cutaneous fistula. It was eventually closed andhe was lost to follow up about 7 years ago. He reports that he was doing well in the interim until he developed hematuria but did not seek treatment until he developed clot retention and went to an outside hospital. There， he had cystoscopy which revealed diffuse mucosal hemorrhage. He continued to have hematuria requiring continuous bladder irrigation and blood transfusion so he was transferred to our academic institution. On presentation， he was actively hemorrhaging from his neobladder so he was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU). His liver function was compromised as he had Child Pugh class B cirrhosis with total bilirubin of1.5mg/dL， albumin at 2.4g/dL， prothrombin time of 16.7s， moderate ascites on CT scan， and no evidence of encephalopathy. After the patient received resuscitation， cystoscopy was performed to evacuate clots revealing hemorrhage emanating from multiple sites but no mucosal abnormalities indicative of neoplasm. CT angiogram did not show active extravasation but did show prominent varices surrounding the neobladder . During the diagnostic workup， he remained in the ICU as his hematuria persisted such that he received a total of 20 units of packed red blood cells， 6 units of platelets， and 8 units of fresh frozen plasma to maintain hemodynamic stability. The medical team's recommendation was to obtain hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement to assess the varices as a cause of the bleeding. His pressure gradient was found to be elevated at 19 mmHg (normal <5mmHg) so 10 mm TIPS endoprosthesis consisting of a nitinol stent with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft was placed lowering the gradient to 6 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> . Unfortunately， variceal flow remained retrograde and his bleeding continued 2 days later so embolization of the neobladder varices was performed with vascular coils and Amplatzer plugs . Subsequently， his|删除段之间换行|hematuria resolved. He remained free of signs ofTIPS complications without development of encephalopathy， fever， or worsening ascites. He was able to void spontaneously by Crede，external compression of the bladder， after foley catheter removal and had low urine residual before discharge.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\nHematuria as a result of neobladder varices is a rare entity. Review of the literature only revealed one other case. That patient was unsuccessfully treated with diathermy of the mucosa at the sites of hemorrhage resulting in his death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Additionally， there is a handful|删除段之间换行|of case reports of patients who developed hematuria from varices associated with an ileal conduit. Two of these were successfully treated by a TIPS procedure while another was managed by revision ofthe conduit and ligation of the varix 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Although very few cases have been reported， the etiology of the bleeding suggests this pathology carries a high risk of death. In the current case， the patient was improved a combination of TIPS and variceal embolization. Additionally， he benefitted from having relatively preserved liver function in the face of cirrhosis severe enough to induce varices and ascites.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】varices. The difficulty associated with managing patients who develop hematuria from varices mandates that liver function and cirrhotic state are factored in when considering type of urinary diversion. Based off the limited number of case reports available， ileal conduit may be a safer option in these patients as management of hematuria from the varices appears to be more successful. Although many factors influence the overall survival of a patient with muscle invasive bladder cancer considering radical cystectomy， underlying hepatic disease must be included. We present a treatment option for patients who develop hematuria as a result of portal hypertension induced neobladder varices.\n\n【12】删除6:<u>1\\.

TAIRS is often caused by mutations in the INSR gene， which leads to insulin receptor dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The condition usually presents at post puberty and is characterized by insulin resistance， acanthosis nigricans and hyperandrogenism， but without obesity or lipodystrophy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. A number of different mutations in the insulin receptor gene have been reported in patients with TAIRS. Although this syndrome is inherited as autosomal recessive traits， a clear correlation between genotype and phenotype has not yet been established.\n\n【5】In this report， we describe a girl who presented with severe acanthosis nigricans， along with high levels of fasting insulin with normal plasma glucose， suggested severe insulin resistance. An INSR mutation 通用删除11(英):<u>(P1205L)</u> was identified in the proband and his father， grandfather and little aunt. Interestingly， her family members shared the same mutation but showed different clinical course.\n\n【6】The proband， a girl of 12 years old， was referred to our hospital because of acanthosis nigricans and hirsutism more than 11 years and change voice for 4 months. She was born with birth weight of 2，650 g (-1.65 SDS)， without significant past medical or developmental concerns. The parents are Chinese and nonconsanguineous. With age， hirsutism and acanthosis nigricans were more pronounced. Her pubic hair appeared and increased rapidly eight months ago and began to change voice 4 months ago. No symptoms of polydipsia and polyuria. At presentation， she was not obese， but showed severe skin pigmentation and hirsutism. She also existed acanthosis nigricans at the neck and axilla.

Her serum levels of cortisol， adrenocorticotropic hormone， growth hormone and prolactin were normal. Gonadotropin baseline values， including Luteinizing Hormone (LH)， Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)， and Estradiol (E2) are normal levels. Testosterone (T)， 128.7 ng/dl； Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEAS)， 76.45 ug/ml； Androstenedione， 5.03 ng/ml were significantly higher than girls of the same age. Bone age is about 13 years old.

Ultrasound scan revealed findings of polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS) with bulky ovaries and small peripheral follicles.\n\n【10】Based on the clinical manifestations and laboratory findings of hirsutism， acanthosis， severe insulin resistance， hyperglycemia， hyperandrogenism， we clinically diagnosed TAIRS. We first gave metformin hypoglycemic therapy. As a result of drug-induced diarrhea in patient， we changed to pioglitazone treatment. To controlhyperandrogenism， we administered flutamide tablets. Because of concerns about drug side effects， flutamide was changed to spironolactone. After 6 months of treatment， the patient’s neck acanthosis nigricans and lower voice were better than before.

The detection of INSR gene revealed a heterozygous mutation of c.3614C>T/p.P1205L， and the diagnosis of TAIRS was clear.

The Insulin Receptor is a type of tyrosine kinase receptor， in which the binding of an agonistic ligand triggers autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues. The addition of the phosphate groups generates a binding site for the insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1)， which is subsequently activated via phosphorylation. The activated IRS-1 initiates the signal transduction pathway and binds to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)， in turn causing its activation.\n\n【17】TAIRS can be expressed as autosomal recessive inheritance or autosomal dominant inheritance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. The INSR gene c.3614C>T/p.1205L heterozygous mutation was found in 4 individuals in this family， which was autosomal dominant. The phenotype of heterozygous P1205L differed substantially among the current family members. Although the proband showed hirsutism， acanthosis， severe insulin resistance， and newly discovered diabetes. Her father andgrandfather only presented impaired fasting glucose and relatively mild hyperinsulinemia. In addition， her little aunt did not show insulin resistance after fasting. Takahashi I et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> consider this difference may be conditioned by heredity and environment. The lifestyle for children has changed over the last few decades in Japan通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However， we report that the three generations of the family are living in the rural areas of Zhejiang. Living environment， eating habits and manners are similar. The birth weights were all within the normal range， and no special habits were found. Therefore， it has not been found that living environment and dietary changes are closely related to the differences in clinical phenotypes； this view is not supported.\n\n【18】In this study， we found that the fasting insulin levels of 4individuals with INSR gene c.3614 C>T/p.1205L heterozygous mutation increased， especially in probands. The proband insulin levels (OGTT 0 min， 90 min， and 120 min) were 258.9 mIU/L，>1500mIU/L，and>1500 mIU/L，respectively. Testosterone from the ovaries and body tissues， as well as androgen (DHEAS and androstenedione) from the adrenal reticularis are significantly elevated. She showed severe hairy and black echinoderms. Grandpa and his father's fasting insulin were 46.5 mIU/L and 48.0 mIU/L， and had 3 and 4 years of impaired fasting glucose， respectively. Fasting insulin in little aunt was 32.3 mIU/L and the age was relatively small. All patients with insulin resistance syndrome have hyperinsulinemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-12\\]</u>. We found that the degree of insulin resistance is closely related to the heterogeneity of the clinical phenotype of the INSR gene mutation. Under the same genetic background and environment， the higher the serum insulin level， the more serious the clinical performance.\n\nMutations in the insulin receptor gene lead to insulin and its receptor binding disorders， the target organ response to insulin decreased， causing feedback hyperinsulinemia. High insulin levels in turn reducethe synthesis of sex hormone-bindingglobulin in the liver， and at the same time stimulate the synthesis of androgen in ovarian follicle endometrial cells， adrenal glands， and peripheral tissues， resulting in hyperandrogenism. The higher the serum androgen level， the more severe the insulin resistance and metabolic abnormalities通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. The finding that DHT exposure to cultured islets up-regulates Insl and Ins2 mRNA suggests insulin is a physiological target for DHT and that androgens can directly regulate the transcription of insulin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Therefore， insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism promote each other in the development of disease in TAIRS. Hyperinsulin promotes the synthesis of androgen and metabolic|删除段之间换行|disorders， and high androgen can also promote insulin secretion and increase insulin resistance and metabolic abnormalities， causing a vicious circle. Based on the above view， we treated rosiglitazone， an insulin sensitizer. After treatment， our patient， the level of insulin was significantly decreased， blood glucose was stable， but the level of androgen was not significantly reduced， which was consistent with many other reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. This suggests that the TAIRS induced by the INSR gene mutation may be different from the polycystic ovary syndrome in the metabolic pathways between the insulin resistance and hyperandrogenemia， even if the patients have PCOS.\n\n【20】Management of patients with severe IR should aim to prevent long-term complications from diabetes and reduce the effects of hyperandrogenism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Wei 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> considered that beta-cell function ultimately deteriorates and patients are at risk of long-term complications of diabetes， although the timeframe is unclear. After treatment， our patient， the level of insulin was significantly decreased， blood glucose was stable，but thelevelofandrogen was not sign ificantly reduced， which is consistent with Wei report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Although many reports suggest that TAIRS can present in early adolescence and is more frequently diagnosed in young adult women with features of hyperandrogenism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. However， ourpatients developed clinical manifestations of insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism(pigmentation and hirsutism) in early childhood， which is aggravated during adolescence. Impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes is often asymptomatic and only recognized through subsequent biochemical screening. The presence of severe hyperandrogenism in the non-obese patient should alert pediatricians to consider severe IR as a possible diagnosis. Management of patients with severe IR should aim to preventlong-term complications from diabetes and reduce the effects ofhyperandrogenism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In addition， maintenance of healthy weight and BMI play a significant role in glucose homeostasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】We report a family of TAIRS for the heterozygous mutation in the INSR gene. Although there are also heterozygous mutations in the INSR gene in the four members of the paternallineage， the clinical manifestations are very heterogeneous. Phenotypic heterogeneity correlates with insulin levels. The treatment of hyperandrogenism in children with TAIRS is still difficult.

Non ruptured aneurysms may be asymptomatic and incidentally discovered， or they manifest acutely with mass effect on adjacent cardiac structures. Ruptured Valsalva sinus aneurysms result in an aorto-cardiac shunt and manifest as acute chest pain，dyspnoea and progressive congestive heart failure， or cardiac arrest. These are more common to involve the coronary cusps， with very few case reports of an unruptured non coronary cusp involvement. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is critical as both ruptured and non ruptured Valsalva sinus aneurysms may have potentially fatal complications. The treatment of choice is surgery. Most valsalva sinus aneurysms are diagnosed on the basis of echocardiography， with or without angiography. However， both contrast enhanced computed tomography and Magnetic Resonance(MR) imaging can provide excellent anatomic depiction. MR imaging can provide additional functional information. We present a case of patient with acute onset of symptoms and diagnosed as unruptured large sinus of Valsalva aneurysm.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 58-year-old woman presented with 1 month history of breathlessness， chest pain and palpitation. On clinical examination patient had bilateral pedal oedema. Cardiac auscultation revealed a pan systolic murmur in the aortic region. A chest radiograph was obtained . The frontal radiograph obtained with the patient erect showed cardiomegaly with increased convexity ofright heart border. On transthoracic echocardiography， she was found to have a large blood filled structure compressing left atrium posteriorly. Contrast enhanced CT study of thorax was done and cardiac Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging was performed few days later.\n\n【7】删除5:<u>1209.</u>\n\n【8】Contrast enhanced CT study of thorax showed a saccular out pouching of size 7.2x7.1x5.8cm arising from the aortic root on its postero-lateral side towards right . The aneurysmal wall towards its medial aspect shows thrombosis of maximum thickness 1.6 cm and multiple areas of discontinuous peripheral calcification. No definite communication of the sac with any of the heart chambers could be demonstrated.\n\nMRI showed a well defined saccular aneurysm arising from the non coronary sinus at the root of ascending aorta on right side， with circumferential partial thrombosis . Aneurysm was seen bulging into and moderately compressing the left atrium. Interatrial septum appears displaced. Mild indentation noted on right atrium and right ventricle. SVC is laterally displaced and|删除段之间换行|compressed by the aneurysm and is draining into the right atrium. No SVC thrombosis. Compression of right pulmonary artery noted which was seen draping over the superior aspect of the aneurysm. Pulmonary trunk and left pulmonary artery is of normal calibre. The right and left coronary cusps appear normal in morphology. The right and left coronary artery appeared normal in course and calibre. Rest of the aorta， arch and its branches are normal in enhancement and morphology.\n\n【10】The patient underwent repair of the aneurysm with a prosthetic patch. Patient was put on follow up post procedure.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\nThe sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is rare and accounts for about0.15-3.5% of congenital heart diseases. These aneurysms are three to four times as common in men as in women， and five times as common in Eastern and Asian countries as in Western countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. The Valsalva sinuses are three subtle dilatations of the aortic root wall that arise between the aortic valve annulus and the sinotubular ridge. Each sinus is associated with a corresponding right， left or non coronary aortic valve cusp. Valsalva sinus aneurysms can be congenital or acquired. Congenital aneurysms occur due to fundamental localized weakness of the elastic lamina at the junction of the aortic media and the annulus fibrosis or associated with an underlying deficiency|删除段之间换行|of normal elastic tissue， such as in Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. Acquired aneurysms commonly are caused by infectious diseases such as bacterial endocarditis， syphilis and tuberculosis； degenerative conditions such as atherosclerosis and cystic medial necrosis； and injury from deceleration trauma.\n\n【13】The right sinus of Valsalva is most commonly involved (75%-90%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The common cardiac anomalies that occur with Valsalva sinus aneurysms are ventricular septal defect (supracristal type)， aortic insufficiency， bicuspid aortic valve and less frequently， coronary anomalies. The characteristic diagnostic features of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm incude aneurysmal sac originating above the aortic annulus， saccular shape of the aneurysm， and normal diameter ofthe aortic root and ascending aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【14】When Valsalva sinus aneurysms rupture， they most commonly rupture into the right ventricle， followed by the right atrium and rarely into the left-sided heart chambers，pericardium and pulmonary artery or superior caval vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Recently echocardiography has replaced angiography as the principal technique to diagnose the aneurysm. In patients who have suboptimal evaluation at echocardiography， CT and MR imaging are useful to delineate sinus of Valsalva aneurysm. Both show the structural appearance of the aneurysm， but MR imaging offers direct multiplanar depiction without the need for iniection of contrast material. MR imaging shows turbulence within the aneurysm and gradient-echo images may document aortic regurgitation. Cine phase-contrast MR imaging delineates the site of fistula formation and can be used to determine the extent of shunting caused by rupture of the aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The clinical manifestation of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm varies widely. Unruptured aneurysms are mostly asymptomatic and when symptoms are present are mostly related to aneurysm rupture or mass effect on adjacent cardiac structures. Most common presenting symptom is dyspnoea， seen in about 56% cases and most common clinical sign is cardiac murmur.\n\nTherefore， large unruptured aneurysms of the non-coronary sinus of Valsalva may compress the adjacent mediastinal structures|删除段之间换行|and patients may present with symptoms， similar to the present case. Very few cases of large unruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm have been found in literature. The reported cases of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm have usually been associated with ruptured aneurysm and resultant fistula formation with right cardiac chambers or RVOT.\n\n【17】The mainstay of treating a case of symptomatic unruptured and ruptured SVA is cardio-pulmonary bypass surgery with excision of aneurysmal sac and the resultant defect will be repaired either by direct suturing or patch closure. Coexisting lesions will be repaired within the same surgical procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Percutaneous transcatheter closure can also be used for treating sinus of Valsalva aneurysm. In asymptomatic patients surgery can be deferred if the aneurysmal sac is small，however， large aneurysms should undergo surgical repair to avoid complications.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm can involve coronary or non coronary sinus of aortic root. Large unruptured aneurysms are relatively rare but can present with cardiac failure and RVOT obstruction. Computed tomography and cardiac MR are essential investigations to depict the exact site oforigin and extent oflesion in addition to rule out rupture.

The authors report the occurrence of dilated cardiomyopathy in an asymptomatic 25-year-old patient with a history of chemotherapy(Fludarabine and ATG- antithymocyte globuline) and radiation therapy prior to stem-cell transplantation for septic granulomatosis， which was diagnosed 10 years after transplantation. This proved to be refractory to the initiated medication and made the implantation of a CRT-D (cardiac resynchronization with defibrillation therapy) device necessary. The long-term outcome especially in young patients is unknown and the need for assist device or heart transplantation should be closely evaluated in case of further worsening of the cardiac function.\n\n【2】Keywords： Dilated cardiomyopathy； Chemotherapy； Fludarabine； ATG； Total body irradiation； Septic granulomatosis； Arterial hypertension； Cardiac resynchronization therapy\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】A 25-vear-old man was admitted to the department of internal medicine in November 2014 for the management ofa new diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathywith severelvimpairedejection fraction. The patient was asymptomatic at the time of diagnose. His history revealed arterial hypertension， hyperlipidemia， overweight as well as septic granulomatosis (X-chromosomal hereditary). As a result of the septic granulomatosis he suffered from many episodes of Aspergillus pneumonia (in the Year 1996， 2000 and 2002)， which led to resection of the left upper lobe (in the year 2000) and of the inferior left lobe of the lung (in the year 2002). Afterwards， the patient received in 2004 stem-cell transplantation. Before transplantation a conditioning treatment involving chemotherapy with Fludarabine， ATG (antithymocyte globulin) as well as total body irradiation was performed. The last cardiologic follow-up was performed in January删除4:<u> 2014</u>. Back then a stress test showed no sign for ischemia. Furthermore， the patient had a family history of cardiac disease (his uncle suffered from sudden cardiac arrest and his grandfather had a pacemaker). The patient denied using alcohol and drugs.\n\nActual physical examination revealed no signs of cardiac decompensation and the auscultation provided physiological murmur sounds. The ECG (electrocardiography) at admission revealed a sinus rhythm with narrow QRS complex. A transthoracic echocardiography showed an impaired ejection fraction at 22% with global hypokinesia. Furthermore， a diastolic dysfunction II° was reported (E>A，E/E’10). The diameter as well as the volume of the left ventricle (65 mm，respectively220 ml) were considerably above the normal range (36-54 mm， respectively <155 ml). The right ventricular function was slightly reduced (TAPSE 16 mm).The performed coronary angiography demonstrated a one-vessel coronary artery disease involving the left anterior descending artery， in which a drug-eluting stent was implanted. Because of the complex medical history and unclear etiology of the disease， we also performed a myocardial biopsy. The investigation revealed a chronic myocardial damage due to an incipient dilated cardiomyopathy. Furthermore， there were signs of a moderately active lymphocytic endocarditis without relevant inflammation in the heart muscle. The patient was discharged with dual antiplatelet therapy (ASS and Clopidogrel) for 12 months and optimized heart-failure therapy including an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor， a beta blocker as well as an aldosterone inhibitor.To prevent sudden cardiac arrest the patient received a Life Vest. Furthermore， in order to achieve a very close follow-up， the patient received telephone monitoring over our special ambulance for heart failure. This way the heart-failure therapy was|删除段之间换行|safely further optimized. Ivabradine， an inhibitor of the funny channel， had to be discontinued because of adverse effects (burning sensation of the tongue). The echocardiography at the next follow-up in February 2015 revealed a minimal improvement of the ejection fraction (30%) with no significant changes in size or volume of the left ventricle (66 mm， respectively 233 ml). Furthermore， there was also a reduction of the NT-pro-BNP (brain-type natriuretic peptide) value from initially 4218 ng/l to 503 ng/l. Considering this slight amelioration， a reevaluation ofthe CRT-D(cardiac resynchronization with defibrillation therapy)was organized in2 months. The patient had remained asymptomatic since admission. A genetic follow-up was realized to search for inherited dilated cardiomyopathy even though the results in April 2015 showed no evidence of mutations of the LMNA (Lamin A/C)， MYH7 (cardiac beta myosin heavy chain)， TNNT2 (cardiac troponin T) and MYBPC3 (cardiac myosin binding protein C) genes.\n\nOn the next follow-up in April 2015， the patient presented with a declined ejection fraction (EF 20%) as well as a higher NT-pro-BNP value of 1044 ng/l. The patient denied the occurrence of any new|删除段之间换行|symptoms. Considering the already optimized heart failure therapy and the new wide total left bundle branch block (QRS 150 ms) with pronounced asynchrony in the echocardiography， we decided to move forward with the cardiac resynchronization by defibrillation therapy (CRT-D)， which was performed 3 weeks later. On the last follow-up in October 2016 the echocardiography revealed no relevant changes in size or volume of the left ventricle (65 mm， respectively258 ml) despite the implantation of the CRT-D device with 100%biventricular stimulation. The ejection fraction remained severely impaired (EF 20%) and the NT-pro-BNP value was 893 ng/l.\n\n【7】In conclusion， after ruling out several other causes， we suspect that the performed chemotherapy and total body irradiation are the cause for the dilated cardiomyopathy in this very young patient.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Dilated cardiomyopathy is a disorder characterized by chamber dilatation， mostlyleft ventricle， and cardiac dysfunction， which is not the result of an ischemic or valvular heart disease. Despite elaborate investigations， in many patients there is no obvious cause for the disorder， which is why most of them are assigned the diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\nFirst of all， studies report several genetic mutations in a significant percentage of cardiomyopathies， such as sarcomere DCM genes(TNNT2， B-MHC， MYBC3) which account for 35-40% of genetic dilated cardiomyopathy， as well as Z band proteins and costamere genes (MLP， CARP) or nuclear membrane defects in LMNA genes通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. In our case the genetic investigation presented no evidence of mutations in the above mentioned genes making the familial dilated cardiomyopathy unlikely. Secondly， a relevant differential diagnosis could be arterial hypertension. Our patient received antihypertensive Therapy since 2005， but the myocardial biopsy showed no specific changes in this regard. Thirdly， another possible cause for the dilated cardiomyopathy could be represented by the chemotherapy or|删除段之间换行|radiation therapies，both ofwhich our patient received 10 years earlier. In long-time cancer-survivors with thoracic radiation， cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of mortality， especially when additional chemotherapy is performed. The side effects of the radiation occurs mostly 10 to 20 years after therapy. Radiation therapy leads to the generation of free radicals and DNA damage， leading to endothelial dysfunction of the microvasculature， thrombosis and small-vessel disease. Larger vessels， such as coronary arteries， can also be affected， leading to stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Typical atherosclerosis gets along only with intimal plaque formation， though， in radiation-induced coronary artery disease it also comes to thinning of the media and extensive adventitial fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. An approximate duration of 82months to develop a radiation-induced coronary artery disease has been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Myocardial damage induces progressive fibrosis， diastolic dysfunction and finally restrictive cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Systolic dysfunction associated with radiation therapy alone， occurs in less than 10% of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. The relative risk of coronary artery disease associated with radiation therapy increases with time after exposure， at 10 years the risk of ischemia， sudden cardiac arrest or heart failure is 2.9%， compared with 24.7% at 25 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. This complication is usually asymptomatic and difficult to diagnose， as most of the patients do not experience any chest pain as a consequence of impairment from radiation injury to sensory nerves in the chest通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In our case， the patient denied angina.\n\n【11】Anthracycline-based chemotherapy and its cardiac toxicity are well known. However， there are many chemotherapeutic agents in which late cardiac complications have not been very well studied and described. Our patient was treated with fludarabine and anti-thymocite-globulin (ATG). In this regard our search through the literature revealed no scientific evidence for cases of cardiac toxicity related to these two drugs and future investigations in this area would be required.\n\n【12】Lastly， autoimmune processes could play an important role in developing cardiomyopathies. Autoantibodies directed at heart cell receptors (muscarinic receptors， beta-adrenergic receptors as well as myocyte proteins) have been described in the literature， although the prevalence remains unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The anti-B1-adrenergic receptor antibodies are suspected to promote cardiomyocyte apoptosis leading to cardiac remodeling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In our patient， the tumor history induding radiation and chemotherapy could have possibly triggered a production of auto-antibodies； still there have been no testing regarding this matter. Further studies in this area could raise awareness of the importance of testing for auto-antibodies， which could also improve the actual therapeutic strategies. In our case， the diagnosis was made in an already advanced stage. The pump function was refractory to medication， so that an additional therapy (cardiac resynchronization with defibrillation therapy) was performed. The long-term outcome is unknown， especially because of the young age， and the patient should be monitored very closely in order to initiate further investigations and therapy at an optimal time. At this moment we don’t see the indication for an assist device or heart transplantation.\n\n【13】In summary we emphasize the importance of further and periodical evaluation， especially of young patients with a history of chemotherapeutic and radiation therapy， because of its insufficiently known side effects， especially its cardiac toxicity. Taking into consideration the well-established side effects of the radiation therapy we assume that an additional chemotherapy can aggravate and also accelerate the process of cardiac damage. Clinical examination and trans-thoracic echocardiography should be regularly performed， in order to early diagnose cardiac dysfunctions and allow proper treatment on time.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Over time， these patients develop morbid obesity along with multiple endocrinopathies including adrenal insufficiency， hypogonadism， hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency. Here， we describe an 11 year old male with adrenal insufficiency， seizure disorder， morbid obesity， and intellectual disability ofunknown etiology recently confirmed to have POMC deficiency based on whole-exome sequencing (WES). This case highlights the advances in molecular genetic testing and opportunities for diagnosis in patients with complex medical histories or atypical clinical manifestations.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency， a rare form of monogenic obesity， is characterized by early-onset marked obesity， adrenal insufficiency and reduced cutaneous pigmentation. In the first months of life， most children with POMC deficiency experience hyperphagia， cholestasis， and adrenal insufficiency. POMC deficient patients commonly present with severe hypoglycemia and seizures in the neonatal period as well as hyperbilirubinemia. Hyperphagia is apparent soon after birth leading to rapid weight gain throughout the first year of life and severe childhood obesity. Central hypothyroidism， adult-onset growth hormone deficiency and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism have also been observed in POMC deficient patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】POMC， the polypeptide precursor of several biologically active peptides， is cleaved by a series of prohormone convertases to produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and the three melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH)： alpha， beta and gamma. These hormones are the endogenous ligands of the melanocortin family of receptors (MCR) of which there are five known members. The hair and skin manifestations， adrenal insufficiency and obesity are caused by lack of activation of the MC1， MC2，and MC4 receptors respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. POMC deficiency may be initially diagnosed clinically due to the unique constellation of symptoms and then confirmed by mutation analysis.\n\n【5】Here we report a case of POMC deficiency confirmed via whole exome sequencing (WES) with a unique presentation， including lack of neonatal hypoglycemia and red hair， as well novel clinical manifestations including duodenal perforation， a seizure disorder not related to hypoglycemia， severe developmental delay and autism.\n\n【6】An 11 year old male with a history of adrenal insufficiency， seizure disorder， acquired primary hypothyroidism and morbid obesity was referred for genetic evaluation of profound developmental delay， seizures and continued rapid weight gain. He was born at 40 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 28 year-old mother with A1 (diet-controlled) gestational diabetes and a 30year-old non-consanguineous father， both of Hispanic ethnicity. His birth weight was average for gestational age at 3153 grams. After delivery， he was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for seizures secondary to presumed hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. He had no documented hypoglycemia during this period. He remained hospitalized for two months for hyperbilirubinemia， intra-hepatic cholestasis and persistent seizures. He was subsequently diagnosed with a seizure disorder and progressive intra-hepatic cholestasis and was discharged to home on medical therapy. He was then readmitted at 5 months of age with spontaneous duodenal perforation and septic shock. During this admission， the patient had refractory hypotension and a low morning cortisol level of 1.7 ug/dL. He was started on hydrocortisone therapy which was\n\n【7】Table 1： Laboratory Evaluation.\n\n| Date  | Test  | Result  | Range  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 10/2003  | AM Cortisol  | 1.7 ug/dL  | 3-21ug/dL  |\n| 12/2003  | Baseline Cortisol  | <0.2 ug/dL  | 3-21 ug/dL  |\n| 12/2003  | ACTH  | <1 pg/mL  | 9-52 pg/mL  |\n| 12/2003  | Stimulated Cortisol  | 1.5 ug/dL  | 3-21 ug/dL  |\n| 5/2004  | TSH  | 10.45mU/L  | 0.5-4.0mU/L  |\n| 5/2004  | Free T4 (equilibrium dialysis)  | 0.9 ng/dL  | 0.8-2.0 ng/dL  |\n| 5/2004  | Total T4  | 6.3 ug/dL  | 4.5-11 ug/dL  |\n\n【9】weaned after recovery from his acute illness. At 7 months of age， physiologic dosing of hydrocortisone was initiated after cosyntropin stimulation testing revealed undetectable baseline cortisol and ACTH levels and a low stimulated cortisol level of 1.5ug/dL. The results of his endocrine testing are listed in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n【10】The patient was noted to have rapid weight gain between 8to 12 months and his weight was >99h percentile by 21 months of age. He continued to have exponential weight gain despite dietary modification and increased physical activity. He was started on levothyroxine supplementation at 18 months of age for persistently elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in the context of negative thyroid antibodies. He has profound developmental delay and autism and continues to have seizures twice monthly despite antiepileptic medications. There has been no reported hypoglycemia during any of his seizures to date. His linear growth rate has been appropriate throughout childhood. He was recently referred to our genetics clinic for a new consultation by the neurologist for genetic testing related to his seizures and autism. On exam， his height， weight and body mass index were： 151.9 cm (72%，Z=0.58)，68.6kg (99%， Z=2.25)， and 29.23 Kg/m² (99%，Z=2.25) respectively. He was a well-appearing， non-dysmorphic male with tan skin and dark brown hair. He was in early puberty with Tanner II pubic hair and 4cc testes bilaterally. He had marked acanthosis nigricans of the posterior neck， axillae and groin. Molecular genetic studies were obtained with informed consent from the patient's mother. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples.\n\n【11】Results\n\n【12】A karyotype was performed on a sample of this patient’s blood to rule out the presence of chromosomal aneuploidies and unbalanced translocations. This result was normal， 46， XY. Whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray analysis was performed to rule out the presence of chromosomal microdeletions and microduplications greater or equal to 50 kilo bases in size. No abnormalities were detected via microarray； however， this patient was noted to have areas of homozygosity， consistent with a family history of consanguinity and increasing the risk for the presence of an autosomal recessive disorder in the patient. Fragile X syndrome PCR analysis and Prader-Willi syndrome methylation studies were within normal limits. Metabolic screening studies including plasma amino acid levels， urine organic acids， urine orotic acids， and plasma ammonia levels， were performed to assess the likelihood for an underlying inborn error of metabolism. While the patient’s initial plasma amino acid levels were suggestive of hyperornithinemia， his follow-up additional metabolic studies were within normal limits. His lipid profile showed a low HDL level，otherwise within normal limits.\n\nClinical whole exome sequencing was then performed at Ambry Genetics via their ExomeNextTM assay in an attempt to identify an|删除段之间换行|underlying genetic cause for the patient’s phenotype， given his previous uninformative workup. A blood sample from the patient’s biological mother was submitted to aid in the analysis. While testing a trio， typically the proband and two first degree relatives， increases the likelihood of a definitive result， the biological father was unavailable to provide a sample for analysis. Testing revealed homozygous frame shift deleterious mutations in this patient's proopiomelanocortin(POMC) genes， at chromosomal location 2p23.3. The mutation， c.20\\21ins25， is a frameshift mutation altering the translation of the proopiomelanocortin protein. This mutation is classified as known disease-causing/pathogenic and is consistent with a diagnosis of POMC deficiency. The patient’s mother was identified as a carrier of a heterozygous POMC gene c.20\\21ins25 mutation. It is suspected that this patient's father is also a carrier of the same mutation， though confirmation was not possible.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】POMC deficiency has been previously described as a syndrome of central adrenal insufficiency， obesity and characteristic hair and skin pigmentation which may be associated with childhood and adolescence-onset central hypothyroidism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. This case illustrates a unique instance of POMC deficiencyinwhichthepatient did nothavehypoglycemia documented in the neonatal period or external abnormalities in hair and skin pigmentation. Additionally， his seizure disorder and developmental delay is thought to be secondary to perinatal anoxic brain injury and not from hypoglycemia secondary to congenital ACTH deficiency as has been previously described in cases of POMC deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-6\\]</u>. Instead， his adrenal insufficiency was diagnosed at 5 months of age during evaluation for refractory hypotension concomitant with sepsis. The patient’s lack of characteristic neonatal hypoglycemia and red hair/fair skin coupled with his history of seizure disorder and developmental delay likely obscured his diagnosis and led to a considerable delay in obtaining confirmatory genetic testing.\n\n【16】In this case study， we successfully confirmed the genetic diagnosis in a patient with POMC deficiency after 11 years of extensive inpatient hospitalizations and outpatient care. Given his history of developmental delays/intellectual disabilities (ID) and seizures， this patient went through an extensive series of testing without informative answers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. The lack of major facial dysmorphisms， absence of congenital anomalies， along with an unclear etiology of early adrenal insufficiency made clinical diagnosis difficult until WES identified this single frameshift mutation. In our patient as well as those in recent studies， this case highlights how a definitive diagnosis of a genetic disorder can provide valuable information about prognosis， anticipatory guidance， and recurrence risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In children， this knowledge becomes increasingly important in terms of intervention， medical therapy and preventative health care. Accurate diagnosis for patients with POMC deficiency can allow for timely surveillance and management of hypoglycemia as well as treatment of ACTH， TSH， GH， LH， and FSH deficiencies. Unfortunately， the true prevalence of POMC deficiency remains unknown as these syndrome likely remains under diagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. With improving our knowledge of genetic mechanisms causing neonatal hypoglycemia or metabolic disorders in early childhood， further studies of earlier treatment approaches can be tailored for the individual patient to maximize neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n\nAdvances in moleculartestingare becoming increasinglyavailable in the clinical setting. There are over 340 genes just associated with|删除段之间换行|epilepsy， many of which have overlapping phenotypic features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The improvements in sequencing technology and bioinformatics， turnaround time as a commercial service， and better insurance coverage for testing have allowed patients and family to access this diagnostic tool. WES is becoming more cost effective compared to traditional protocols involving serial genetic testing， particularly for conditions characterized by genetic heterogeneity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. There are limitations to whole exome sequencing which may be overlooked by nongeneticists， particularly when receiving a negative WES result. Mutations and/or causal variants may be in an exon of a gene that is poorly covered in the assay. Disease causing variant(s) may also be in non-coding regions of the genome such as deep intronic or promoter regions. As with any genetic test， it is important that families be counseled about risks， benefits， limitations of genetic testing by certified geneticists and/or genetic counselors. As molecular testing improves at an exponential rate， it is important for families to understand that future diagnostic opportunities may exist in the short and long term despite given a negative test result.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

She has had frequency， weight loss， and anorexia recently. She has been married for 8 years and had one child. She had hospitalized due to heavy vaginal bleeding and got a massive blood transfusion many times. When she arrived at Ghalib Teaching Hospital，her laboratory examinations showed hemoglobin <8 mg/dl. Three packs of fresh blood have been given to her in order to make her hemoglobin remain stable during the operation.

A huge uterus with multiple fibroids had adhesion to the omentum， cecum， and abdominal wall. All adhesions were removed and abdominal organs were checked. Ovaries， fallopian tubes， and all other organs were normal. Gross examination showed multiple masses with projections|删除段之间换行|all over the uterus that measured 10 cm × 12 cm x 15 cm and 4.2kg. The specimen was sent for histopathological examination， and microscopic examination revealed multiple benign leiomyomas with atypical degeneration .\n\n【7】After the operation， the patient was hospitalized for 2 days and discharged on a postoperative day删除4:<u> 3</u>. A two-month follow-up with repeated ultrasonography was done and no abnormality was reported.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Uterineleiomyoma is the most common， solid， and benign tumor of the pelvis affecting 20% to 30% of women in their reproductive ages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The weight of these tumors can be different as the multiple ones tend to grow rapidly that can be so large without any signs and symptoms. Until now the largest and multiple fibroids that have been reported is weighting 63.3 kg， which was found in a woman after her death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Of multiple leiomyomas， which the patient has survived after removing the mass was 45.4 kg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The mass in our patient weighs 4.2 kg， which was the same as tumors by Panayaoditis C， Karim T and Mulayim B 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-12\\]</u>.\n\n【10】These tumors have a high prevalence in multiparous women and those in their reproductive ages. Our patient was 25 years old. About60% of tumors are multiple as was seen in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. Most of these tumors especially the small ones are asymptomatic. Symptoms in larger and multiple ones include abdominal pain， abdominal mass， abnormal vaginal bleeding， menorrhagia， infertility， constipation， urination problems， and so on 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Our patient presented with many of these symptoms especially prolonged heavily bleeding and anemia as she got blood many times. Due to insufficient distribution of blood， multiple and huge masses can get degenerations like hyaline， cystic， myxoid， atypical， and so on. Our case has atypical degeneration.\n\n【11】The initial step in evaluating a woman with a leiomyoma is pelvic examination. However， the small tumors are not palpable but the larger and multiple ones are 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The next step is the radiological examination， which is used to reveal the size， location， number， and extension of the tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Among all radiological examinations， the initial diagnostic adjunct should be ultrasonography， owing to its diagnostic accuracy， cost-effectiveness， and wide availability. MRI and CT are used for differentiation and observation of malignancy changes. Tumor marker tests can be very helpful to diagnose malignancy but the most important diagnostic tool is histopathology that was done with our case.\n\nThe treatment of these tumors depends on the symptoms， types， size， and location ofthe tumor as well as the patient’s age， menopause，|删除段之间换行|fertility， and facilities. The treatment of these tumors includes medical， surgical， and uterine artery embolization. The patients with severe symptoms like massive bleeding，long history of menstruation， history of blood transfusion， history of myomectomy， and risk of malignancy the best treatment consist of hysterectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4-19\\]</u>. Our patient has the same symptoms and despite the different treatments， it was not cured so a hysterectomy was done.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Uterine leiomyomas are one the most common tumors. Patients with leiomyoma have different types of clinical features. The initial step in evaluating a woman with apelvic and abdominal mass is pelvic examination. Ifleiomyoma is suspected the initial， diagnostic adjunct should be ultrasonography， especially in poor countries owing to its cost-effectiveness and wide availability.\n\n【15】It is necessary to take the abdominal masses under monitoring in their early stages because the larger ones often cause diagnostic and therapeutic problems as well as poor prognosis. Accurate diagnosis can be performed with laparotomy and histopathology so it is needed to rule out malignancy for all abdominal masses by this examination. Whenever the diagnosis is made earlier the problems and complications will be fewer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

GCRO can be easily misdiagnosed as giant-cell tumor (GCT) in pathology and imageology， and such misdiagnosis results in the loss of the optimal opportunity for treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. Therefore， early diagnosis is critical to GCRO prognosis. GCRO has low incidence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， and the nine cases of GCRO reported by Bathurst et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> for the first time in1986 accounted for 3% of the osteosarcoma incidence during that period. GCRO occurs in the long bones of limbs and is extremely rare in skulls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6\\]</u>. In this paper， the case of a 43-year-old patient with temporal bone GCRO was reported. In addition， the clinical， imageological， and pathological features of GCRO， as well as differential diagnosis， were discussed in combination with previous studies.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Clinical history\n\n【9】The patient was a 43-year-old male who accidentally noticed a painless hard bump about the size of a finger in the left tempus a year ago and did not seek treatment. A month ago， the bump progressively grew and was accompanied by occasional dizziness. Physical examination revealed a local uplift bump in the left tempus felt by hand. The bump had a wide base and no obvious boundary， was hard and cannot be pushed， was about 3 cm x4 cm in size， had no surface ulceration， and was swollen. Laboratory examination revealed that the hemoglobin level was 98.3 g/l. No other abnormality was found.\n\n【10】Imageological examination\n\nGerman Siemens Multi-slice spiral CT (Siemens Sensation 16) was used to conduct head CT plain scan， enhancement， and three-dimensional multiplanar reconstruction (MPR). The CT scanning parameters were as follows： voltage， 120 kV； electric current， 100 mAs； reconstruction layer thickness， 2 mm； and layer spacing， 0.8 mm. About 370 mg/ml Iopamiro was used as the contrast agent for enhancement scanning at a dosage of 1.5 ml/kg and injection flow rate of 3 mL/s， with flushing by 30 ml of normal saline. Image post-processing was conducted in a Siemens random|删除段之间换行|a\n\nworkstation. CT plain scan showed a quasi-round bump in the left tempus that was about 6.3 cm 4.7 cm 5.5 cm， had uneven density， was dotted， and had mottling low-density lesions. In addition， scattered dotted high-density calcification or ossification and osteolytic destruction were observed in the left temporal bone (involving the latter halfofthe left zygomatic arch， the left sphenoid wing， and the left mastoid and structures). The bump progressively grew and invasively crossed the inner and outer board of the skull. The bump edge showed visible thinning and an incomplete bony shell without periosteal reaction. The bump also moved inward into the middle cranial fossa， causing obvious displacement of the left temporal lobe， compression of the left lateral ventricle， and right shifting of the midline structure. Conversely， the bump moved outward causing local uplift of the left temporal soft tissue. The bump descended into the left temporal fossa along the left front part of the medial pterygoid. Enhancement|删除段之间换行|scanning showed obvious continuity and uneven enhancement of the bump. The median and posterior cerebral arteries of the left brain were moved， and the anterior， median， and posterior cerebral arteries ofboth sides were not invaded . The preoperative diagnosis was malignant or low-grade malignant tumor in the left tempus， possibly a meningioma or temporal bone-sourced bone tumor.\n\n【13】Operation\n\nAfter successful general anesthesia administration， the patient was asked to be in supine position with head to the right. The arc incision of the left temporal bone was marked， and the towel was regularly disinfected and paved. Craniotomy was conducted until the local bump of the left temporal bone was fully exposed. The left temporal bone was destroyed， becoming jelly-like and brittle. The jaw joints and the external auditory canal were eroded， but the|删除段之间换行|endocranium was not destroyed. The tumor boundary was stripped， and most of the tumor tissues were removed. The tumors around the temporomandibular joint were retained to reserve functions. After conducting thorough hemostasis and scalp suturing， an indwelling drainage tube was placed.\n\n【15】Pathological examination\n\n【16】Intraoperative inspection of grey red and grayish yellow brittle left temporal bone and tumor tissues with a size of 9 cm 8 cm 1cm was conducted. HE staining showed diffuse infiltration of a large number of polygonal tumor cells， with large tumor cell nucleus， visible nucleoli， evident pleomorphism， osteoid matrix， and tumor osteogenesis. A large number of osteoclast-like giant cells were scattered among the tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed CD68 (+) and S-100通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> of osteoclast-like giant cells， as well as S-100(+) and CD68 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> of mononuclear tumor cells. The pathological diagnosis was left temporal bone GCRO .\n\n【17】Follow-up visit\n\n【18】The patient receeiivveedd postoperativebi not七preoperative chemoradiotherapy. More than 2 years after the operation (May2012)， the patient experienced suppuration with no incentive in the left ear； accordingly， biopsy and surgery were conducted. The pathological diagnosis was recurrence of osteosarcoma， so adjuvant postoperative chemoradiotherapy was conducted. Three years later(March 20， 2013)， head MRI detected tumor relapse ， so radiotherapy and chemotherapy were conducted.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Based on the WHO Classification of Bone Tumor Pathology and Genetics 通用删除7(英):<u>(2002)</u>， GCRO is an unusual osteosarcoma that is a subtype of normal bone osteosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. GCRO involves the presence of osteoclast-like giant cells with an abnormal increase in number， thereby almost disguising the osteosarcoma composition as the tumor core. GCRO can be easily misdiagnosed as GCT in pathology and imageology， thereby resulting in the loss of the optimal opportunity for treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3，7\\]</u>. Therefore， early diagnosis is critical to GCRO prognosis.\n\nAccording to previous reports， GCRO mostly occurs in adolescents， especially those under the age of 30. The long bones of limbs such as femur and tibia are the main pathogenic sites， and occurrences in the skull are extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6\\]</u>. Clinically， GCRO is nonspecific and mainly characterized by local bumps and progressive pain. Laboratory tests showed increased alkaline|删除段之间换行|phosphatase. Imageological examinations including X-ray， CT， and MRI showed that the main symptoms of GCRO were eccentricity(a few centricities)， mild swelling， osteolytic destruction， visible tumor bone， formation of soft tissue bump in some cases， and obvious enhancement of the substantial part of tumor (found by enhancement scanning). Histologically， GCRO on HE dyeing showed a large number of osteoclast-like giant cells with a background of osseous osteosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry examination showed osteoclast-like giant cells， a small amount of histocyte-like mononuclear CD68(+) cells， abnormal mononuclear cells， and tumor CD68通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. We reported for the first time a case of GCRO that occurred in the temporal bone of a 43-year-old male. This age was higher than the average age reported in literature but was consistent with the age preference of GCT occurrence. Given that GCRO has a long course of disease and shows no progressive pain， no specificity was detected in the laboratory examination. This finding brought a certain challenge to the early diagnosis of this case Imageological examination showed obvious swelling of the temporal bone， dissolving bony destruction， invasive growth， wide range of involvement， and obvious enhancement of the substantial part of the tumor (found by enhancement scanning). Given the dotted high-density lesions scattered in the tumor， we believed it was the pathological tumor bone. In this case， no obvious periosteal reaction was found. The above imageological findings were basically identical to previous reports. Pathological studies also revealed a large number of osteoclast-like giant cells in the background of osteosarcoma.\n\nGCRO is treated the same as traditional osteosarcoma， i.e.， by amputating the bone in the tumor segment and by implant surgery， supported with preoperative and postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. GCRO prognosis is related to the pathological types of its background osteosarcoma. For example， if the background is centricity osteosarcoma， it is deemed to be highly malignant with poor prognosis. Conversely， if the background is periosteal osteosarcoma， it is deemed to be less malignant with better prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Differential diagnosis： GCRO should be mainly differentiated from conventional osteosarcoma and GCT. Key points to differentiation from conventional osteosarcoma： Imageologically， GCRO mainly manifests as osteolytic destruction， but the osteogenic tumor and periosteal reaction are often less obvious than those in conventional osteosarcoma. Pathologically， GCRO manifests as a large number of osteoclast-like giant cells in the background of osteosarcoma， whereas the latter shows no giant cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Key points to differentiation from GCT： 1) the onset age of GCRO is those of children and adolescents，|删除段之间换行|especially those under 30 years old， and is rare in those over 30 years old； GCT mostly occurs in adults over 30 years old. 2) The primary sites of GCRO are the metaphysis oflong bones， whereas GCT mostly occurs in the capitulum oflong bones (extremities after the epiphysis is closed， and the lesions often directly reaching under the bony articular surface).3) Both GCRO and GCT show centrality， swelling， and osteolytic destruction， but GCRO has tumor osteogenesis and periosteal reaction， and GCT generally has neither periosteal reaction nor tumor osteogenesis. 4) Both GCRO and GCT have giant cells， but GCT has no tumor osteogenesis 8J.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】GCRO can be easily misdiagnosed as GCT， and early diagnosis is very important for its prognosis. Clinically， GCRO is mainly characterized by local bumps and progressive pain. Imageologically， GCRO is mainly characterized by osteolytic destruction， its tumor osteogenesis and periosteal reaction are often less obvious than those of conventional osteosarcoma， and it is obviously enhanced in enhancement scanning.

Clinically， CMT can be subdivided into demyelinating (CMT1， CMT3 and CMT4) and axonal forms (CMT2) based on electrophysiological and histopathological characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The demyelinating neuropathies are mainlyassociated with reduced Nerve Conduction Velocities (NCVs；<38 m/s) due to the damage to the myelin sheath. Axonal forms of CMT are assumed to originate on the neuronal side and present with decreased compound muscle action potential amplitudes. Besides， the other CMT types with electrophysiological and histopathological presentations overlapping CMT1 and CMT2 are referred to as “intermediate CMT”(NCVs range from 38 m/s to 48 m/s) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. So far， over 80 genes are known to be a cause of CMT with autosomal dominant， autosomal recessive， or X-linked inheritance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. CMT4 is an autosomal recessive demyelinating form that has an earlier onset and more severe phenotypes than CMT1. In 2007， FGD4 was first identified as the causative gene for CMT4H，which islocated to chromosome 12p11.21-q13.11 intwo consanguineous families of Mediterranean origin by homozygosity mapping通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>.FGD4 encodes frabin， an F-actin GDP/GTP nucleotide exchange factor， specific to Cell-division cycle 42 (Cdc42)\n\n【7】and Racl， which belong to the members of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins (Rho GTPases)， to control several aspects of Schwann cell biology and function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. All patients described to date， with mutations in FGD4are affected with early-onset and slowly progressive demyelinating CMT， presenting severely reduced motor NCVs and loss of myelinated fibers companion with focally folded myelin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，11，12\\]</u>. With the widespread use of molecular genetics technology， more CMT4H cases with a broad phenotypic spectrum have been reported. Due toa strong clinical variability and progressive course， the current information concerning frabin function is limited. Herein， a Chinese patient with novel FGD4 mutations was described and a further overview ofCMT4H was made to summarize the clinical and genetic spectrum， as well as the current pathogenesis progress of the disease to discuss genotype-phenotype correlations， and shed light on the pathogenic and molecularly targeted therapeutic study for this disease.\n\n【8】Materials and Methods\n\n【9】Patients\n\n【10】Extensive clinical evaluation including medical history， physical and electrophysiological examination was performed in a 12-year-old Chinese male patient. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Sixth People's Hospital， Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai， China. Written informed consent， which also included the consent for the publication of medical information， was obtained from the guardians.\n\n【11】Sural nerve biopsy\n\n【12】The right sural nerve biopsy was performed on the proband after obtaining informed consent. Tissue sections were stained using conventional histologic methods for hematoxylin and eosin， modified Gomori Trichrome， and Congo Red. Separate portions of specimen was fixed in 2% PFA/2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer， processed， and embedded in Epon. Transverse， semithin sections were stained with Toluidine Blue for evaluation by light microscope. Ultrathin sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate andlead citrate for examination by electron microscope to ultrastructural studies(PHI LIP CM-120).\n\n【13】Genetic analyses\n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using the standardized phenol/chloroform extraction protocol； exome sequencing was conducted in the proband. The screened variants were|删除段之间换行|analyzed as follows： The related database including 1000 Genomes Project ， dbSNP ， andgnomAD  were used as references to exclude all variants present in the population at greater than 5% frequency. In addition， MutationTaster ， PolyPhen-2 and SIFT  were used to predict the pathogenicity of the mutation. Then the pathogenic of the variant was interpreted and classified following the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) Standards and Guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Putative pathogenic variants were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing of both the forward and reverse strands among family members.\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】Clinical findings\n\n【17】The index patient was aa 12-year-old boy from a：non·consanguineous family referred to our neurology department with a complaint of 1-year history of progressive gait disturbance， toe walking. Through detailed medical history tracking， the boyhad slow running with occasional falls since middle school when at exercise training time. The patient had normal developmental milestones， and there were no similar affected family members. Neurological examination showed a toes walking， bilateral mild pes cavus deformities， and deep tendon are flexia. Cranial nerve examination was normal， and Babinski signs were not elicited. No weakness， amyotrophy， sensory deficits， and scoliosis were observed. Motor conduction studies revealed slightly reduced amplitudes (1.08 mV to 4.0 mV)， prolonged distal motor latencies， and severely reduced velocities (17.6 m/sec) at bilateral median nerve， while no motor or sensory action potentials could be obtained in the lower limbs. Needle electromyography examination found no abnormalities. The X-ray showed bilateral foot deformities with pes cavus .\n\n【18】Neuropathological findings\n\n【19】Electron micrographs from transverse sections of sural nerve revealed a moderate decrease in density of myelinated fibers， scattered thinly myelinated fibers， accompanied by a small amount of thickened， grossly distorted， and excessively folded eccentric myelin.\n\n【20】Genetic findings\n\nExome and Sanger sequencing identified the patient carried the|删除段之间换行|represented for FGD4， the FAB (F-actin binding)， DH (Dbl hamalagy)， PH (Pleckstrin homology) and FYVE (Fab 1， YOTB， V ac 1， and EEA1zinc finger) domains. The novel mutations detected in this paper are marked in black box. The previausly reparted homozygous mutations are marked in red and heterazygous mutations in black. The three grass deletian mutations， including c.1192-48\\1233del 90bp deletion， a hamozygous 61 kb intra-genic duplication， encompassing exans 3-14， and deletion of the entire allele.\n\n【22】compound heterozygousFGD4mutations with c.1688C>A and c.1951C>T ， which were from his heterozygous state mother and father ， respectively. Both two variants are novel， which were not found in 1000 Genomes Project， dbSNP， and ExAC database， and pathogenicity assessment according to the ACMG revealed that both the mutations are likely pathogenic.\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】In our study， we described a Chinese case with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of CMT4H. The patient displayed marked demyelinating peripheral nerve， from clinical manifestations to electrophysiological and neuropathological features. Since the first two families with CMT4H were described， this condition has been regarded as a very early onset demyelinating disease with a severe phenotype that involves delayed walking， pes cavus， kyphoscoliosis， and an early loss of ambulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，14，15\\]</u>. To date， 40 cases from 24families with CMT4H have been reported， the average age of onset is 5.5-year-old， ranging from early infancy to the late second decade， and the disease course is chronic and progressive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，11，12，14-18\\]</u>. Individual CMT4H cases have recently been reported with pupil asymmetry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，19\\]</u>， multiple cranial nerve involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>， sensory ataxia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，21\\]</u>， spinal syringomyelia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>， autonomic neuropathy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， and cauda equina thickening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， hence gradually broadening the known CMT4H phenotype. However， the significant clinical variability even among siblings with identical FGD4 genotype， suggesting a high clinical heterogeneity among individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，23\\]</u>. Including the present case， almost all the affected patients were showed severely reduced velocities in electromyogram. In addition， nerve biopsies disclosed a demyelinating neuropathy characterized by myelin thickening， redundant myelin loops， and numerous infoldings and outfoldings of the myelin sheath 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， which were taken as the striking pathological hallmarks of the disease， although these features can also be found in other CMT4 subtypes (CMT4B or CMT4F)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\nThe responsible gene FGD4 contains 17 exons， of which 15 are coding exons . The encoding protein frabin is a 766-amino acids GDP/GTP Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF)， a member of the Rho GTPases， and plays a role in Cdc42-mediated cell shape changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，25\\]</u>. The ubiquitously expressed protein contains， in order from the N- to the C-terminus， five functional domains： One F-Actin Binding (FAB) domain， one Dbl Homology (DH) domain， two Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domains， and one cysteine-rich FYVE domain . DH domain plays a vital role in the catalysis of GDP-to-GTP exchange， whereas PH and FYVE domains are mainly involved in interactions with different forms of phosphoinositides and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，26\\]</u>. As a GEF， frabin stimulates the exchange of GDP for GTP to generate the activated form， which then modulates the activity of downstream targets and effect or molecules. It was demonstrated that frabin likely has a key role in proliferation， polarization， endocytosis， and survival of Schwann cells， all of which are distinctively required for correct nerve development and accurate myelin maintenance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，10\\]</u>. In cultured Schwann cells， the normal form of frabin colocalized with F-actin and induced the formation of microspikes， whereas the expression of truncated frabin significantly inhibited this effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，27\\]</u>. What’s more，lack of frabin causes dysmyelination in mice in early peripheral nerve development， followed by profound myelin abnormalities at later stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Besides， the Frabin-Cdc42 axis exerts a crucial effect on developmental Schwann cells and myelination. When frabin was over expressed in cultured cells， it can enhance GTP-loading of GTPases， then Rho GTPases function as molecular switches that are implicated in a wide variety of downstream signal-transduction pathways， including regulation of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton during cell migration， morphogenesis， polarization， and proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Previous studies have demonstrated that Cdc42 and Racl are required for Schwann cells migration and proliferation， and regulate Schwann cells process extension and stabilization， allowing|删除段之间换行|efficient radial sorting and myelin sheath folding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. A significant reduction in active Cdc42 was found in FGD4knockout mice. Genetic disruption of Cdc42 in Schwann cells of myelinated nerves resulted in demyelination similar to those observed in frabin-deficient mice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， while axon sorting deficits in Schwann cells lacking laminins were improved after forced activation of Cdc42 and/or Racl 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.Overall， it is strongly suggested that CMT4H is a disease of various impaired signaling pathways.\n\n【26】Up to now， about 29 FGD4 mutations have been reported in patients with CMT4H， most of them predicted to result in truncated or absent protein (nonsense， frame shift， or splicing mutations)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18，23，30\\]</u>. The mutations mainly affect the DH domain， two PH domains， and FYVE domain . It seems that patients homozygous for nonsense or splicing mutations may be related to an infantile-onset and delayed motor milestones. However， there is no notable trend between the disease progression， phenotypic severity and the mutations of different types or in different domains. Previous studies suggested that a nonsense variant might translate a truncated protein since the affected mRNA wasn’t degraded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Additionally， reduced microspike formation was found in cell cultures transfected with truncated forms of frabin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，27\\]</u>. The two novel mutations described here were highly functional conservative and located in domains FYVE and PH2， which were interacted with polyphosphoinositides and implicated in morphogenesis， membrane trafficking， signal transduction， and cytoskeleton dynamics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，26\\]</u>. In addition， the nonsense mutation c.1951C>T  in our study resulted in a prematurely truncated protein. Thus， we can speculate that the rapid protein degradation and resulting haploinsufficiency caused by the mutations may consequently result in the impaired Rho GTPase signaling and dysregulation of membrane-transport processes， which subsequently perturb Schwann cell morphology， polarity， or proliferation， and impel the formation of myelin outfoldings， causing aberrant myelination in peripheral nerves通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，10\\]</u>. Further detailed molecular mechanism underlies the signaling is warranted to be explored. Since the relative rarity and progressive course， affected patients with autosomal recessive or sporadic early-onset， slowly progressive CMT disease should be considered to screen the FGD4 mutations. Currently， there is no therapy progress for this hereditary peripheral neuropathy. Individuals with CMT4H are often evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists， physiatrists， orthopedic surgeons， and physical therapists.

They can be either congenital (due to non-hereditary fetal malformations or genetic mutations) or， more rarely， acquired.\n\n【2】The Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor-1beta (HNF1B) gene is known to play an essential role in the embryonic development of several organs (such as kidneys，pancreas，liver and parathyroid glands). Molecular genetics has allowed the identification of new mutations occurring in this gene and HNF1B-associated disease is now recognized as a clinical entity of variable and multisystemic phenotype.\n\n【3】We present the case of a male child， referred to a pediatric nephrology unit at age 4， after presenting the first signs of nephropathy. Abdominal ultrasonography had shown cortical renal cysts. The patient had a stage 2 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). He later presented an insulin-dependent diabetes， at age删除4:<u> 7</u>. The combination of early onset diabetes and renal cystic disease was suggestive of an HNF1B-associated condition. Genetic testing of the patient and his parents confirmed a de novo nonsense mutation on heterozygosity at HNF1B (c.301G>T，exon 1).\n\n【4】Even though a strictly renal phenotype may occur， the association of renal disease and diabetes at a young age should particularly alert nephrologists and pediatricians to the possibility of an HNF1B-associated disease. Furthermore， the early detection of this genetic mutation will warrant screening of other potential extrarenal disorders or malformations and allow appropriate genetic counseling to patients and their families.\n\n【5】Keywords： Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-beta； Cystickidneys； Maturity-onset diabetes of the young； Type 5\n\n【6】Introduction\n\nHepatocyte Nuclear Factor-1Beta (HNF1B) gene is located on chromosome 17 and encodes a widely spread transcription factor， with a known major role in endodermal development， thus explaining the frequent multiorgan involvement in affected patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Even though HNF1B mutations translate into a large phenotypic spectrum， affected individuals commonly present with isolated renal disease (including hypoplastic glomerulocystic kidney disease， multicystic renal dysplasia， horseshoe kidney， hypoplasia and hydronephrosis)， isolated diabetes (maturity-onset diabetes of the young-MODY)， or both (namely， the Renal Cysts And Diabetes syndrome， RCAD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. Nevertheless， not all patients with an HNF1B mutation actually have renal cysts and/or diabetes and other disorders have also been described， such as agenesis of the pancreas， urogenital malformations， hyperparathyroidism， hyperuricemia/gout， cognitive delay， autism spectrum disorders and hepatic disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.HNF1B-associated disease is currently recognized as a|删除段之间换行|clinical entity of variable and multisystemic phenotype， even though， at the same time， it remains the most common monogenic cauise of Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and the Urinary Tract (CAKUT)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Noteworthy is also the fact that， although the HNF1B was initially associated with MODY type 5 diabetes (MODY5)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>，renal involvement is more prevalent than diabetes in HNF1B mutation carriers， particularly in pediatric cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 4-year-old male child was initially admitted to thehospital for an acute gastroenteritis， complicated with impairment of renal function. Since the latter persisted after correction of the fluid balance， a renal ultrasound was performed and revealed signs of renal disease (diffuse hyperechogenicity， absence of corticomedullary differentiation)， as well as bilateral multiple small (<12 mm) cortical renal cysts (even though both kidneys were normal in size) . The patient was then referred to the pediatric nephrology unit， with the suspicion of Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD).\n\n【10】The patient was not obese， and the physical examination was unremarkable. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure profile remained under the 90h percentile for age， height and gender. The urine sediment examinations were normal. No urinary tract infections were diagnosed during the follow-up period. The renal function remained stable， despite a stage 2 Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD) (with an eGFR around 75 ml/min/1.73m).\n\n【11】Three years later， the patient was again admitted to the hospital， this time for the first clinical presentation of diabetes (without ketoacidosis). He was started on insulin therapy， with good glycemic control. An abdominal CT scan performed at this point confirmed the abovementioned echographic signs and revealed an atrophy of the bodyand tail of the pancreas. The patient also presented increased levels of parathormone (up to 108 pg/ml). A RCAD syndrome was suspected.\n\n【12】There was no family history of renal disease or diabetes. Parents were non consanguineous. There had been no complications during pregnancy， delivery or the postnatal period. The ulterior ophthalmological， gastroenterological and cardiological evaluations revealed no anomalies. No learning disability had been detected.\n\n【13】In order to confirm the diagnosis of RCAD， genetic testing from peripheral blood leukocytes was carried out by Sanger sequencing of the HNF1B gene. The variant c.301G>T ， on exon 1， was identified in heterozygosity. Parental segregation study was normal and proper genetic counseling was given to the patient and his family.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】In our case， although Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD) was a possibility， the kidneys were normal in size， the cysts were numerous and confined to the cortical region. These characteristics， associated with the diabetes later diagnosed， made us suspect another genetic syndrome.\n\nGermline heterozygous mutations in the HNF1B occur relatively frequently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and can arise de novo or be inherited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> (at least100 different mutations have been identified) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. This autosomal dominant disorder is associated with a wide clinical spectrum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>， but it is particularly known for producing the RCAD syndrome通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In fact， HNF1B mutations were detected in 9% to 24% of adult patients with chronic renal failure of unknown origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u> and|删除段之间换行|the renal function has been found to be impaired in 86% of HNF16associated disorder cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> (with eGFRs widely ranging from 8ml/min/1.73 m’ to 113 ml/min/1.73m²)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. MODY， on the other hand， accounts for 1% to 2% of cases of diabetes and the reported prevalence of diabetes in HNF1B mutation carriers (characterized by the fact that the C-peptide is persistently detectable and there are no pancreas autoantibodies) is about 45% (the diagnosis of diabetes occurring after the onset of renal failure in the vast majority of cases)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Other relatively common extrarenal phenotypes include genital tract malformations， gout and disturbed liver function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3，15\\]</u>， but there was no evidence of these in our case.\n\n【17】What makes our case unusual and noteworthy is， on one hand， the age at which the renal disease was detected (most cases being diagnosed at the beginning of adulthood) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> without any previous clinical warning signs and， on the other hand， the fact that neither parent presented any mutation for the HNF1 gene (which made his a de novo mutation in a case where no particular risk factors were identified). Nevertheless， it is important to note that only a minority of children with HNF1B mutations has diabetes and that not all their renal malformations contain evident cysts on ultrasound 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> (even though renal cysts are usually detected in over 80% of cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【18】To the best of the authors'knowledge， this is the first report of a RCAD syndrome in a Portuguese child presenting an HNF1B de novo mutation. This is an important diagnosis that clinicians should consider when non-diabetic nephropathy， particularly renal cystic disease， is diagnosed in a patient with early-onset diabetes， or vice-versa. This casealsohighlights the point that testing for such mutations should not be discouraged by the absence of a family history of renal disease or diabetes. A timely diagnosis is not only important in preventing avoidable complications， but it will also prompt screening for other medical conditions that it may be associated to (such as hyperparathyroidism or hypomagnesaemia) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In addition， it will allow screening of other family members and genetic counseling about future offspring (among other reasons， because there can be variability in the renal tract manifestations between generations， in the RCAD syndrome). For such reasons， we suggest that this screening is undertaken with pediatricians， nephrologists and clinical geneticists working closely together， in order to better guide the choice of treatment and to inform carriers about how they can avoid exacerbating or complicating factors (such as obesity).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

When being 51 years old， he had found a movable mass without tenderness in his left axilla which had been 2-3cm in diameter. He had attributed this to his busy working； however， the mass progressed gradually. He visited a local hospital and experienced tumor excision in the year of 2006. After surgery， he didn’t get further treatment until his return to China in 2011. He visited an oncologist in Shanghaiand found swelling lymph nodules in his left axilla by ultrasound. He was then admitted to have removal of axillary lymph nodes. The histology documented surgery's involvement of subclavicular lymph nodes and pectoralis minor with infiltration ofcarcinoma cells. On gross pathologic review， the mass measured3.5 cm x 2 cm and appeared granular and pale white to gray-tan in color. Microscopic evaluation(hematoxylin-eosin) revealed low differentiated adenocarcinoma with inclination of apocrine carcinoma showed in Figure 1A， B and C with different magnification. The patient then received an|删除段之间换行|adjuvant local radiotherapy at 50 Gy in left mammary and clavicular regions. In November 2014 he presented at our department with the chief complaint of intermittent pain in his back which could persist for 2-3 days before remission.\n\n【16】A SPECT-CT Whole-body bone scan was performed 4 hours after injection of 25 mCi (925MBq) 99mTc-MDP. The whole-body SPECT image revealed extensive metastatic disease both in his axial skeletons included bilateral rips， sternum and vertebral， and the appendicular skeletons included right clavicle， right scapula， right humerus head， hip bones and bilateral femurs of the patient . The SPECT-CT image in the sagittal plane and the axial plane showed that high density shadow in the skeleton in the CT image was found where the high radioactivity concentrate in the SPECT image.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\nApocrine carcinoma was first reported by Gates et al. in series|删除段之间换行|with 5 cases being discovered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In the following years， there are a few reports worldwide to describe the disease in series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>.

Apocrine carcinoma mainly spread through the lymphatic， but hematogenous spread also occurred in 3 cases including liver and brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. In our case the patient was found recurrence 5 years after onset and metastasis 3 years afterwards. His metastasis was found in axial skeleton which was aligned with one case reported before， but without more detailed imaging resources 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. This is the first report with SPECT and CT bone image.\n\n【19】Actually， apocrine carcinoma with bone metastasis is not reported the first time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. But no author has described and analyzed the bone scan image from the patients with apocrine carcinoma. In this case， the multiple metastatic foci in the skeletons are almost osteogenic metastasis， with the high concentration of radioactivity.\n\n【20】The same character was mentioned in two case reports in China通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，11\\]</u>， without bone scan image， however. Therefore， we have reason to guess osteogenic metastasis is a main style of the bone metastasis of apocrine carcinoma. In addition， in our case， the bone metastasis not only occurred in axial skeletons but also in the appendicular skeletons. The distribution of the bone metastasis is the same as a case report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>，but bone metastasis is also found in long bones in another case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Therefore， the bone metastasis of apocrine carcinoma should not be only limited in axial skeleton.\n\n【21】Generally， patients with apocrine carcinomas are usually more than 50 years of age， with a mean age of 57-61 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. No clear gender， racial or ethnic predilection is observed in the latest research通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Clinically， typical lesions ofapocrine carcinoma are slow-growing， painless， palpable cystic or solid nodules with normal appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Our case was just a movable mass without any skin lesions which made it hard to have any clinical differential diagnosis. Because of its rarity， apocrine carcinoma remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Biopsy is still the gold-standard for diagnosis and several pathological features can help in this process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【22】The treatment of apocrine carcinoma mainly includes surgery， chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Initial surgical treatment is proved to be important； if complete resection is possible，long-term survival can be expected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，13\\]</u>. Patients with apocrine carcinoma show different diagnosis which seems no relation with treatment method or clinical course but correlate with degree of tumor differentiation. Those patients with well-differentiated tumor cells did extremely well and could achieve long-term remission with surgery alone. However， patients with moderately or poorly differentiated tumor cells had higher local recurrence rates after resection and were far more likely to have metastasis， just like our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，13\\]</u>. After 8 years later he was firstly diagnosed with apocrine carcinoma， he performed bone scan because of intermittent pain in his back and found bone metastasis. But actually he had already had bone metastasis for some time and there are no bone symptoms. For some patients who had lived more than 5 years， they may have bone metastasis. The whole-body bone scan exams could find bone metastasis earlier and provide guidance for further treatment， and maybe extend the patients' survival time. Therefore， the whole-body bone scan exam must be recommended for patients with apocrine carcinoma， especially with moderately or poorly differentiated apocrine carcinoma， just like what we do for patients with other cancers.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Slit-lamp examination revealed moderate conjunctival hyperemia and diffuse white coloration to the entire anterior chamber ， no distinct abnormality in corneal confocal microscopy nor ocular B-ultrasound.\n\nRoutine laboratory tests revealed grossly creamy plasma， there was dense chylomicron floating on the top layer， it was significantly different from normal serum 通用删除1(英):<u>(left sample in Figure 2)</u>. his serum triglyceride was 27.06 mmol/L (normal， up to 1.8 mmol/L)， total cholesterol was 17.24 mmol/L(normal， up to 6.2 mmol/L)，and blood glucose was 21.8 mmol/L (normal， up to 6.1 mmol/L)，heart rate was 136 per minute， but blood pressure was normal. Hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic agents were used immediately for controlling of blood-lipid and blood-sugar， besides， intraocular pressure lowering medication and topical antibiotic were used for symptomatic treatment and preoperative preparation. 48 h later， the thick milky fluid was diminished，and gradually absorbed， thus we found the crystalline lens was visible and normal ， iris neovascularization was absent， his visual|删除段之间换行|was intact.\n\n【6】acuity was improved significantly to 20/20， and IOP was declined to be normal progressively.\n\n【7】The clinical manifestation of this case was similar to hyphema， furthermore， considering on his milky serum sample appearance， we suspected the milky fluid in anterior chamber was very likely to be hyphema. Therefore， after written informed consent was obtained from the patient for surgery， anterior chamber irrigation was performed， we observed there was a tiny active bleeding spot\n\n【8】Video： A surgical video of active bleeding spot on inferior iris during irrigation.\n\n【9】on inferior iris when the pressure was fluctuating during irrigation procedure . A few erythrocytes were found in aqueous humor biopsy specimen under optical microscope . He was diagnosed non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy， without lipemia retinalis by Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA)  and fundus photography . During 3 years following-up， both of his eyes showed to be stable since he had got reasonable diabetic therapy， and his diabetes and hyperlipoidemia were well controlled too.\n\n【10】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【11】Chylaemia was a characteristic representation of severe hyperlipoidemia， which caused by the chylomicrons accompanying extremely high triglyceride and total cholesterol in serum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Patients with chylaemia usually related to history of diabetes mellitus or disturbance in the lipid metabolism. Various ocular abnormities had been related to hyperlipoidemia， such as lipemia retinalis， arcus senilis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Our patient demonstrated neither of them despite extreme hyperlipoidemia， the final diagnosis of chylaemia of anterior chamber and hyperlipoidemia was made by irrigation surgery and biochemistry examination.\n\nHyphema could present with a diffuse white look in patients with hyperlipoidemia during or following ocular trauma or operation. In1972， af Ursin and Alho et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>had reported a 41-year-old man was found corneal erosion and 3 mm hyphema in the bottom， while the white opaque milky fluid was filled with in upper anterior chamber after his eye was hit by a stone.

Hirst， Hazzard 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> observed a 58-year-old man with hypertension， obesity and insulin-dependent diabetes initial red coloration of hyphema had turned to be whitish， fibrinous clot within seconds during suture in cataract surgery. Subsequently， diffuse white fluid occupied entire anterior chamber，but it disappeared within 24 h.\n\nUnlike these previously reported cases， our patient was a chef with high-fat diet， without any ocular trauma or surgery history. He had not taken his diabetes seriously， which resulted in severe lipids metabolism abnormity. It was difficult to recognize what the milky fluid in anterior chamber was at first glance of slit lamp examination without detail systemic disease history and examination. Lens rupture or endophthalmitis were excluded because of lacking relevant history|删除段之间换行|and appearance. Furthermore， the biochemistry testing revealed disturbance in the lipid and sugar metabolism. Considering on his milky serum and the milky fluid in anterior chamber progressively spontaneous assimilation， we suspected it might be chylaemia，finally， erythrocytes in aqueous humor biopsy testified it was true. After iris neovascularization was excluded and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy were diagnosed by FFA and fundus photography， irrigation surgery revealed the bleeding spot probably originated from rupture of iris capillary.\n\n【14】In a word， we reported a rare whitish hyphema case， it actually was chylaemia of anterior chamber.

Chest X ray revealed pleural effusion and subsequently a CT scan of abdomen and chest  confirmed right pleural effusion and showed a paramediastinic nodule (16x 18 mm) in absence of ascites or abdominal mass， and the uterus and the ovaries were described as normal. A PET/CT showed slight increased uptake in the paramediastinal lesion and in the right parietal pleura， without other area of pathological accumulation in the remaining part of the body. She underwent a video-assisted-thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies. The biopsy material consisted of fragments of parietal pleura with chronic fibrosing pleuritis and foci of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma both infiltrating the connective tissue  and superficially spreading between the reactive mesothelium . Neoplastic cells were focally aggregated in papillary structures containing occasional psammoma bodies . No benign tubal epithelium was described in the pleura. A similar histopathological picture imposes a differential diagnosis between a metastatic carcinoma， conceivably from ovary or lung and a mesothelioma.

Lauchlan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> extensively described these lesions in 1972， hypothesizing the existence of the \"secondary miillerian system\". Extregenital millerian neoplasms have been reported not only in women， but also in men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In literature there is only another case of a miillerian tumor originating from the pleura， and not from ovaries or peritoneum. This could be explained in that also pleura share the same embryological origin of the peritoneum.\n\nIn our case， pleural biopsies revealed a neoplastic epithelial component forming papillary structures and containing psammoma bodies. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for WT-1， BerEp4， MOC-31， PAX-8， ER； negativity for： calretinin， TTF-1，HBME-1， D2-40， cytokeratin 5/6， caldesmon， cytokeratin 20， CD删除4:<u> 141</u>. Overall， the staining for epithelial glycoproteins (Ber-EP4 and MOC-31)and the lack of calretinin and CK5/6 staining was felt not to support a mesothelial differentiation. Immunohistochemistry contrasted also with a pulmonary origin (TTF1-). Positivity of ER， WT-1 and PAX-8 was highly suggestive for pleural malignant miillerian neoplasm. Fewspecific immunohistochemical markers are available for|删除段之间换行|carcinomas of miillerian origin. ER， PR and WT1 have been used in combination with other immunohistochemical markers to suggest possible millerian origin， however， their relatively low specificity is well known. ER and PR are present in breast carcinomas in addition to other gynecologic tumors. WT1， a nuclear transcription factor important for the development of the miillerian duct system， has been used as a surrogate marker for ovarian carcinoma. WT1 is also detected in benign and malignant mesothelial cells. PAX8 is a member of the PAX gene family encoding for nine well-characterized transcription factors. PAX8 is detected in the specialized precursor cells of the millerian ducts in the coelomic epithelium in the early embryonic stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The millerian ducts subsequently separated from the coelomic epithelium， grow caudally and in female fetus eventually become fused at the midline to form the uterine corpus and cervix and the upper third of vagina. The non-fused portions form the fallopian tubes and fimbrial ends. Remnants of the most proximal miillerian ducts that do not participate in organogenesis constitute the secondary miillerian system which is hypothesized to be the source of ovarian and paraovarian disorders including the so called miillerianosis (endometriosis， endocervicosis and endosalpingiosis)， epithelial ovary carcinomas and peritoneal serous carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. All these tissues， both normal， ectopic and neoplastic， consistently express PAX8 3，6\\].\n\n【16】Therefore PAX8 is a very useful marker for diagnosingcarcinomas of Mullerian origin in serous effusions， whichcan help us to distinguish betweenmiillerianffiromnon-miillerian origin1ofmetastatic carcinoma (including breast， lung， pancreas， gastrointestinal tract and malignant mesothelioma)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>. Conceivably the case described herein and the other reported so far 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> might be derived from embryonic remnants of the cranial portion of the primitive coelomic epithelium. In our patient it was decided to administer chemotherapy with carboplatin-paclitaxel and bevacizumab， as miillerian tumors of ovarian or peritoneal origin typically are responsive to this regimen.

During the past decade， there has been notable progress in characterizing the disease and understanding its pathophysiology. It is now assumed that MacTel type 2 is a neurodegenerative disease with vascular alterations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Recent genetic studies demonstrated that MacTel type 2 is a complex disease with specific involved pathways. Significant associations were identified at three independent loci at5q14.3，2q34，and 1p12 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.

The presented patient interestingly has a severe phenotype despite his young age. Investigators have studied macular|删除段之间换行|abnormalities in Down syndrome patients during the past decade. O'Brien et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> demonstrated that the central subfield thickness for the full retina and inner and outer retinal layers were all significantly greater in the Down syndrome children compared to a control group， suggesting an abnormal macular development in children with Down syndrome. In line with this study， Mangalesh et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> found abnormal foveal morphology and persistence of inner retinal layers using OCT in Down syndrome children.\n\n【14】Recent studiess also tie Down n syndrome withperipheral neuropathy andddegeneration dueetogenetic andmetabolic abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. For instance， Patel et al1.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> found that abnormal increase in a regulator of calcineurin 1 -an endogenous inhibitor of the calcineurin phosphatase that is triplicated in Down syndrome- impairs neurotrophic support of neurons by inhibiting endocytosis of the nerve growth factor receptor TrkA. Furthermore， investigators have shown metabolic abnormalities involving the serine/glycine pathway in Down syndrome patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. Given the neurodegenerative nature of MacTel type 2 and recent discoveries regarding serine/glycine pathway abnormalities in MacTel patients， it would be ofpotential value to further investigate the possibility of an association between the two diseases.\n\n【15】A common finding in Down syndrome is a high number of vessels crossing the margin of the optic nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， as seen in this case. This has been attributed to the mild systemic angiogenesis deficiency associated with Down syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.

We recognize that there could be other， yet unknown pathways contributing to the pathophysiology of MacTel as well. It is notable that in early stages， the clinical findings of MacTel type 2 can are very subtle， and mild changes in the macula might not always be appreciated as possible primary changes of MacTel.

Despite her insulin dose of 1.5 units/kg/day， she still had uncontrolled blood glucose and was frequently admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) with a total of 5 admissions since her diagnosis，and HAlc level reached 16.9% on one occasion. We decided to provide her with intensive psychological support and give her frequent clinical appointments with the Pediatrics Endocrinology Clinic and a diabetic educator. She decided to change her lifestyle to prevent any diabetic complications and to improve her quality of life， therefore， she changed the types of food she consumed， eliminated most carbs， become physically active， walking around for an hour per day. In September 2020she was admitted to the PICU due to frequent hypoglycemic attacks， with no history of fatigue or decreased energy， no symptoms of cough， shortness of breath， and chest pain， and no history of new medication use. A physical examination determined she had pitting edema on her lower limbs， lower back， and a puffy face. She had warm skin with no tingling or burning sensations at the site of edema and no pain， aching， or numbness. Another systemic exam showed she was within normal， a bodyweight of 58 kg， and had a BMI of 23 kg/m’， with no abnormalities in her chest or heart. A normal thyroid exam and showed no lipohypertrophy at the injection site. Investigations were conducted to rule out any organic cause of the edema， included renal function test， liver function test， and cardiac exams with ECG. All were normal apart from her albumin being on the lower side with a level of 35 g/L. Other labs tests showed a high HA1c level of 15.8%. ACTH and cortisol tests were performed to rule out Addison disease and the results were within normal ranges. The celiac|删除段之间换行|profile showed negative antibodies. Thyroid function tests revealed a low FT4 level of 8.2 pmol/L and positive thyroid antibodies. Insulin doses were adjusted with the total daily dose decreasing from 1.5 to1.3 and then 0.7 units/kg/day to control her blood glucose level， and her long-acting insulin dose was changed to another type of long-acting insulin (Tresiba) to minimize her hypoglycemic attacks. On clinical follow-up， she showed much improvement in her glycemic status， and her edema resolved without any medical interventions. Her last measured HA1c level was 7.8%，levothyroxine was initiated with a dose of 50 mic daily， and her last FT4 level was 10.3 pmol/L. Her hemoglobin Alc level decreased from 15.8% to 9.1% and then decreased again in December 2020 to 7.9%.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\nInsulin edema is a known complication of the initiation or intensification of insulin therapy. It was first described in 1928通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and occurs in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus， especially in newly diagnosed cases of type 1 diabetes mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is a benign transient condition that is usually self-limiting and resolves spontaneously with a rare or no need to use any intervention，treatment， or diuretic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Although the manifestations can vary widely from mild peripheral edema to cardiac failure and massive serosal effusions and may occur in local areas， such as the periorbital，pretibial， and sacral regions， or as generalized edema， there was a young patient who is diagnosed as a newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes， when generalized edema and pericardial effusion developed after initiation of insulin therapy， the treatment was only supportive and all symptoms resolved within 20 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. As well， it can be presented at any age with the youngest age was reported was a 9 years old male who developed insulin edema few days after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and was treated as a case of DKA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. There are no criteria or a risk stratification system for the diagnosis of insulin edema， and it is diagnosed by the exclusion of other common causes of body edema. However， aged being from 20 to 40 years，poor control diabetes either by having frequent hypoglycemia or following DKA treatment， newly diagnosed diabetes with higher doses of insulin therapy， poor glucose control， and low body mass index have been suggested as risk factors for insulin edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. The true incidence of insulin edema remains unknown but some reports have estimated the incidence to be in the range of 3% to 3.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. There have been several presentations of insulin edema， William et al. reported a 15-year-old girl with a history of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus who presented with generalized anasarca which was started gradually over her limbs till extend to all of her body including her face and genitalia associated with a significant increase in her weight， her labs were within normal level apart of albumin which was in the lower normal， these symptoms were noticed after 1-week of compliance with insulin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Furthermore， another adult patient with latent autoimmune diabetes was reported to have insulin edema associated with neuropathy. She was a 35-year-old， diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and subsequently developed latent autoimmune diabetes， she was on an oral hypoglycemic agent and her glucose level was high with an HbA1c of 13%. She was admitted to the hospital under plastic surgery service when she presented with a painful discoloration of her right finger. During that admission developed DKA， after treatment of the DKA insulin was initiated and after 3 days she developed significant pitting edema up to her umbilicus associated with neuropathy that was diagnosed by nerve conduction studies. Other causes of edema were excluded， and because her edema was severe so， she was treated with furosemide diuretics and fluid restriction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Another adult|删除段之间换行|case was reported by Wong and Balakrishnan. The patient was a40-year-old woman， newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus who developed generalized edema just after diagnosis and treatment initiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Sugiyama et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported that a 50-year-old female patient， who is known to have Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) post bone marrow transplantation and type 2 diabetes mellitus， was on multiple medications as prophylaxis and treatment from transplant rejection. Her blood glucose become poorly controlled so； intensive insulin therapy was given to her， after by around 4weeks found to have insulin edema over her lower limbs. The same presentation was found in a 57-year-old male patient with a 5-year history of type 2 diabetes， he was poorly controlled and his urinalysis showed positive ketones and protein. He developed bilateral lower limbedema which was induced by the rapid improvement of glycemic control with insulin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Despite that， insulin edema is a rare finding and usually， it is self resolved， although it can be serious with significant complications as in this patient who was a 35-year-old woman diagnosed recently with type 1 diabetes who presented with polydipsia andpolyuria for over 1 year， and at the last 2 months before presentation， she lost approximately 2 kg of weight. She presented with signs of severe DKA indicated by Kussmaul's breathing and low pH levels and was treated with insulin. On the 2nd day， her renal function started to deteriorate， she had high creatinine levels and then presented with generalized edema， serous effusions， and acute renal failure. This case was different due to the presence of more serious complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Pediatric patients also can have insulin edema； a case report of a 12-year-old boy newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes， presented with edema of the lower extremities approximately one week after the initiation of insulin therapy. This case was considered a typical presentation of insulin edema that appeared soon after the initiation of insulin therapy in a patient newly diagnosed with DM type 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Furthermore， Hirshberg et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> reported a 49-year-old female， who was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and developed severe generalized edema following the initiation of insulin therapy. The edema was severe enough to be treated with diuretics but unfortunately， it was impossible to continue the treatment because of the severe side effects of this medication the patient experienced. Even the patients who are on an insulin pump can develop insulin edema； Greco et al. described the case of a 39-year-old woman with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus who developed generalized edema with severe weight gain a few days after the start of an insulin pump therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】Several cases have been reported about generalized edema in patients with diabetes. However， most of the cases reported on patients with either newly diagnosed type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus that developed edema after the initiation or intensification of insulin treatment or even after sudden compliance with insulin therapy. There were no case reports about the development of insulin edema after only improvements in the patient s lifestyle and without any change in insulin dose.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Bacillus cereushas found notoriety as a cause of gastroenteritis， but bone infections involving this bacterium are very rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. We report a case of B. cereus osteomyelitis in an otherwise healthy young girl with no identifiable risk factors， the first of its kind in the literature to our knowledge.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A healthy， five-year-old Caucasian female with no significant past medical history was seen in the pediatric orthopedic clinic with an 8 week history of left sided gait abnormality. She refused to heel weight-bear and had no clear history oftrauma，insect bites， superficial abrasions or penetrating injuryto her left foot. There was no history of fever or systemic features of infection， and no history of immunodeficiency. She had no urinary， chest， ENT (including dental) or skin evidence of infection. Her hindfoot was swollen， and was tender to palpate over the calcaneus.\n\n【4】Several areas of lucency and sclerosis within the calcaneus were seen on radiographs. She was admitted for further investigations. Hematological tests revealed a CRP of <3， ESR 8， and WCC of10.6×10. Blood cultures showed no growth.\n\n【5】An MRI was performed the following day which showed increased signal within the calcaneus， talus and cuboid bones， consistent with multifocal osteomyelitis .\n\n【6】A calcaneal biopsy under general anesthesia was performed. Alateral approach was undertaken to access the calcaneus. Nofrank pus was seen， but the bone was friable and dark， altered interosseous blood was encountered. Multiple， non-cross-contaminated fresh tissue samples of bone fragments， tissue swabs and blood aspirate were sent to the lab for culture.\n\n【7】Microbiological culture revealed growth of Bacillus cereus in 4/4 samples， and StaphylocoCCUS hominus in 2/4 samples. Histology revealed trabecular bone with absent normal marrow， having been replaced by fibrous tissue， foamy histiocytes， and lymphocytes， consistent with chronic osteomyelitis.\n\n【8】Following discussion with our infectious disease physicians， intravenous Vancomycin was initiated. Following initial administration in hospital， it was continued in the community for a total of 6 weeks， during which she was kept in a non-weight-bearing below knee cast. Vancomycin was chosen to provide anti-staphylococcal cover in addition to B. cereus， although it was less clear that this was a pathogenic organism in this patient's case. The duration was chosen due to the poor vascular supply to the calcaneus， and the poorer efficacy of vancomycin compared with beta lactam antibiotics.\n\n【9】A follow up MRI was obtained to confirm resolution of infection， four weeks after cessation of Vancomycin. This was consistent with resolving osteomyelitis， with reduced signal intensity in the hind foot and mid foot.\n\n【10】Weight bearing commenced after 6 weeks in cast. By 3 months she was running and jumping normally， without any symptoms of pain or disability. At 6 months post biopsy she continued to be symptom free with normal radiographs and was discharged from routine clinic follow-up.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\nBacillus cereus is a Gram-positive aerobic or facultatively anaerobic， spore-forming， motile，rod-shaped bacterium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Its environmental reservoir includes soil， marine and fresh water， and the|删除段之间换行|intestinal tracts of invertebrates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It is also one of the most common bacteria cultured from the drug associated paraphernalia of heroin addicts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Having a spore form allows B. cereus to survive standard food cooking processes in a dormant state. Once in an active state， it produces a number of tissue destructive exo-enzymes， including an emesis-inducing toxin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. It is the emesis effect of B. cereus which gives it most notoriety， causing fried rice syndrome' following the consumption of cooked rice stored at room temperature after its initial preparation.\n\n【13】B. cereus is often regarded as an insignificant contaminant in positive clinical specimens. However， it is recognized to cause a multitude of pathologies， including fulminant sepsis， cutaneous infections，anthrax-like progressive pneumonia， severe eye infections， and meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， as well as osteomyelitis.\n\n【14】While uncommon， osteomyelitis due to B. cereus is certainly recognized， though less than 10 cases have been described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. All of these cases were associated with surgical or accidental trauma， IV drug use， pre-existing infection or sickle cell disease. Only two cases have been reported in children - an 11-year-old boy with a depressed skull fracture and B. cereus osteomyelitis of the bone fragment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， and a 13-year-old girl with distal femoral osteomvelitis due to S. aureus and subsequent superimposed infection with B. cereus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. To our knowledge， this case represents the only case of B. cereus osteomyelitis in a child without any identifiable risk factors or history of inoculation injury， with confirmed deep infection. The patient had no other site of infection， and no definite trauma. The difficulties of history taking in a young child were illustrated in this case given the delay from symptom onset to presentation； no history of significant antecedent trauma could be recounted from the child or parents. Of note the patient was a very active child with a new trampoline； minor trauma may have had an association with this case but was below the sensitivity of the history taking to detect.\n\n【15】While microbiology contamination with B. cereus is common， we are confident our case represents a true causative effect as it was recovered from all four tissue samples， whereas S. hominis was only seen in two ofthese. Furthermore，there was a clinical and radiological resolution of infection following appropriate antibiotic treatment.\n\n【16】Osteomyelitis due to B. cereus has previously been successfully treated with gentamicin， cloxacillin， clindamycin， penicillin and vancomycin； antibiotic optionstypically revolveearoundthe susceptibility profile of the isolated strain and the antibiotic resistance is variable.

Her UC symptoms were alleviated after administration of mesalazine， however， she was repeatedly found to have abnormal liver function. The diagnosis of Cholangiocellular Carcinoma (CCC) was made via ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical data of the patient was retrospectively analyzed and relevant literature was reviewed to investigate the possibility for Ulcerative Colitis (UC) to progress to Cholangiocellular Carcinoma (CCC). A review of the literature suggested that UC is commonly associated with concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis， which progresses to CCC in 11% of cases. Clinicians should be aware that UC may progress to CCC.UC patients with recurrent abnormalliver function， especially in those with serum alkaline phosphatase elevation， should undergo relevant examinations to clarify diagnosis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Ulcerative colitis； Primary sclerosing cholangitis； Cholangiocellular carcinoma\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is the most common hepatobiliarycomplication related to ulcerative colitis (UC). The majority of PSC cases ultimately progress to end-stage liver disease， and~11% are associated with concomitant Cholangiocellular Carcinoma (CCC). This study provides a clinical analysis of a UC patient with concomitant CCC and a review of relevant literature was conducted to raise awareness regarding possible progression of UC to CCC.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】General data\n\nA 24-year-old female patient was admitted to Zhongshan hospital due to recurrent abnormal liver function over a period of 14 years and upper abdominal pain for over 1 month. She was treated with mesalazine after the diagnosis of UC in 1999. Several follow-up examinations revealed elevated Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)， Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)， Alkaline Phosphatase(ALP)， and y-Glutamyl Transpeptidase (GGT). Specifically， ALP and GGT were elevated to2-3-fold of the Upper Limit of Normal (ULN). During regular follow-ups， the patient did not report any symptoms of discomfort such as bloating or abdominal pain； no nausea， vomiting or anorexia； no fever， rash or xanthochromia ofthe skin and sclera. No further diagnosis or treatment was commenced. In 2009， her UC was well controlled and the dose of mesalazine was gradually reduced to withdrawal. Six months after withdrawal of mesalazine， repeat liver function tests showed elevated liver enzymes， especially ALP and GGT， which were 1-2-fold of ULN. The patient sought medical attention， but the subsequent liver biopsy did not reveal any obvious abnormalities. She was given intermittent， symptomatic treatment for liver dysfunction. In February 2015， the patient experienced postprandial upper abdominal pain. The patient denied acid reflux， belching， nausea， vomiting， diarrhea， fever， rash， jaundice， joint pain and other discomforts. She visited a local hospital and liver function tests showed： total bilirubin 21 umol/L， conjugated bilirubin 14umol/l， albumin 42 g/l， ALT 117 IU/l， AST 131 IU/l and ALP 962 IU/l. She tested negative for hepatitis A， B， C and E viral markers. Gastroscopy showed superficial gastritis， polypoid bulge，and erosion in the gastric antrum， and cardiac polyp (most likely inflammatory). Gastric antral mucosal biopsy showed severe active chronic superficial inflammation with mucosal erosion. Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly， diffuse liver lesion， hypoechoic mass in the left hepatic lobe，and gallbladder wall edema. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT showed focal liver lesions， suspicious for neoplastic lesions， likely atypical hemangioma or bile-duct-derived tumors. To clarify the nature|删除段之间换行|of focal liver lesions， the patient was admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology of Zhongshan hospital. Since the onset of disease， she maintained a clear state of consciousness with normal mental health and appetite， sufficient sleep， normal urination and defecation， and denies significant weight fluctuation. The patient is allergic to cephalosporin. She denied a history of hepatitis， tobacco smoking or alcohol consumption， and toxicant exposure. She was single and has no children， and has a normal menstrual cycle. Her parents were in good health.\n\n【8】Physical examination\n\n【9】Upon admission， her body temperature was 36.8°C， pulse rate was 78 beats/min， respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min， and blood pressure was110/78 mmHg. She was conscious， mentally normal， physically active and cooperative upon examination. Her skin and sclera showed xanthochromia with no evident hemorrhagic spots， liver palm， or spider angioma. She had no palpable enlargement of superficial lymph nodes. The percussion and breath sounds of both lungs were clear. She had no precordial bulge and the border of cardiac dullness was within normallimits. Her heart rhythm was regular and no pathological murmurs were auscultated in the auscultatory sites. Her abdomen was flat and soft， with right upper quadrant tenderness but no rebound tenderness， muscle tension or abnormal mass. Her liver was palpable with one finger under the costal margins， while the spleen was not palpable. Her renal and hepatic regions were not sensitive to percussion. Shifting dullness was negative. Bowel sound frequency was 3 times/min. Neurological examination was negative. No pitting edema was observed on either lower extremities.\n\n【10】Laboratory tests\n\n【11】Blood： erythrocyte count 3.60 ×102/l， hemoglobin 104 g/l， platelet count 501 ×10%l， leukocyte count 9.67×10/l， percentage of neutrophils 71.3%， percentage of lymphocytes 16.2%； erythrocyte sedimentation rate： >120 mm/H. Urine： bilirubin ++， without any other abnormalities； stool： normal； fecal occult blood： negative. Liver function： total bilirubin 64.4 umol/l， direct bilirubin 59.7 umol/l， albumin 33 g/l， globulin 38 g/l， ALT 55 U/l，AST 61U/， ALP 561 U/I， GGT 382 UA，lactate dehydrogenase 201 UA， cholinesterase 4132 U/I， prealbumin 0.12 g/l； kidney function： urea 1.8 mmol/l， creatinine 39\n\n【12】umol/l， uric acid 139 umol/l. Coagulation： prothrombin time 12.2 s， international normalized ratio 1.05， activated partial thromboplastin time 36.5 s，D-dimer 2.17 mg/l. Tumor markers： carbohydrate antigen(CA)125 451.3 IU/ml； a fetoprotein， carcinoembryonic antigen， CA199 was within the normal range. Ferritin >2 ug/ml. Electrolyte and autoantibodies were within the normal range.\n\n【13】Auxiliary examination\n\n【14】Upper abdominallcontrast-enhancedImagneticresonance imaging  revealed a space-occupying lesions in the left hepatic lobe， with a tubercle in the caudal lobe involving blood vessels of the left lobe， suspicious for atypical hemangioma or bile duct Malignant Tumor (MT)； other features included mild porta hepatis lymphadenopathy and edema， as well as thickening of the gallbladder wall. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound for liver imaging showed multiple solid lesions in the left lobe， highly suspicious for MT (cholangiocyte-derived)； embolization of the left portal vein； and porta hepatis lymphadenopathy. Computed Tomographic Angiography(CTA) of thehepatic artery and Computed Tomography Venography (CTV) of the portal vein， hepatic vein and inferior vena cava revealed invasion ofthe left hepatic artery，left and middle hepatic veins， and left portal vein. Nuclear medicine imaging of systemic cancer by Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT indicated high suspicion for MT in the left lobe with intrahepatic metastasis， and porta hepatis， retroperitoneal and thoracic lymph node metastases， as well as abdominal and pelvic implantation metastases， with a small amount of peritoneal fluid.\n\n【15】Diagnosis and Treatment\n\n【16】The patient presented with progressive jaundice after admission. A Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangial Drainage (PTCD) was performed on March 17，删除4:<u> 2015</u>. Intra-operative cholangiography revealed a slight right intrahepatic bile duct dilatation and irregular right hepatic duct stricture. Jaundice was alleviated following PTCD.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\nInflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is an immune-mediated and non-specific inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by repeated recurrence and chronicity， including UC and Crohn's disease. It is reported that 21-47% of IBD cases are associated with extra intestinal manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Extra intestinal manifestations involving the skin， eyes， and joints are often presented in parallel with disease activity of IBD， while hepatobiliary system diseases such as PSC， small-duct PSC， primary biliary cirrhosis， non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases， and cholelithiasis are inconsistent with IBD progression but generally occur independent of intestinal inflammation. PSC is an unexplained chronic cholestaticliver disease characterized by progressive inflammation， fibrosis and multiple stenosis of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct systems. PSC is currently well recognized as the most common hepatobiliary complication ofIBD. The relationship between PSCand IBD has been reported mainly in Western countries. Up to 80% of PSC cases are associated with IBD in Northern Europe and the United States. The incidence of IBD-PSC is 50% in Southern Europe and 35% in Asia， reported mainly in Japan and Korea. Few studies have been reported in China， of which， recent reports on the incidence of IBD-PSC were single-center studies with small sample size. Despite large differences in the results， the incidence of IBD-PSC is significantly lower in China compared to that of Europe and the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. In other countries， 1.4-7.5% of IBD patients develop concomitant PSC|删除段之间换行|during disease progression， with a UC incidence of 2.0-7.5% and a CD incidence of 1.4-3.4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Similar results have been obtained by recent studies in China 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The pathogenesis of PSC-IBD remainsunclear. From a microbiology viewpoint，IBD is diagnosed when permeability of the intestinal-mucosal barrier increases， allowing bacterial endotoxins and toxic cholic acids concentration to increase in the blood， then transported to the liver to activate Kupffer cells， triggering inflammatory mediators (eg. tumor necrosis factor)， facilitating bile duct damage and hyperplasia resembling the pathological changes in PSC. This point of view is supported by the finding of intestinal bacilli in the portal veins of an animal model， although the exact pathogenesis remains unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Significantly diverse clinical manifestations can be found in PSC， which may range from asymptomatic to recurrent episodes of jaundice， fatigue， anorexia， weight loss， abdominal pain， pruritus， hepatosplenomegaly， ascites， fever and diarrhea. Most PSC patients are asymptomatic upon diagnosis， but merely presents with elevation of serum ALP or other biochemical indices of hepatic function. Thus， PSC is easily over looked， leading to clinical misdiagnosis. Clinical awareness should be stressed in IBD patients with persistent abnormalities of liver function， especially those with persistent ALP elevation， for possible diagnosis of concomitant PSC. Current diagnosis of PSC is based primarily on imaging studies. Although Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) remains the gold standard 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> for diagnosis， its invasive nature can lead to serious complications. Owing to its non-invasiveness and ease of operation， Magnetic Resonance Cholangiography (MRCP) is increasingly used for diagnosis of PSC， with a sensitivity of 80%and specificity of 90% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The typical pathological feature of PSC is the “onion-skin\"type bile duct fibrosis. This pathological change can be used as the basis for diagnosis and determination of lesion severity. However， such pathological feature only applies to 10% of PSC patients， thus limits its diagnostic value. Research has shown that liver biopsy cannot provide additional diagnostic information for IBD patients after being examined by cholangiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Therefore， liver biopsy is not recommended for patients with typical lesions evident on cholangiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Liver biopsy needs to be further considered only when the diagnosis by ERCP is inconclusive. The patient reported in this study had a 14-years history of UC and previouslytreated with mesalazine for an extended period of time. During the course of disease， her liver function was repeatedly found to be abnormal， with prominent elevation of ALP and GGT， without obvious clinical manifestations. She was misdiagnosed with mesalazine-induced liver damage， without further relevant examinations. After admission to our hospital， MRCP showed irregular intrahepatic biliary stricture . Cholangiography during PTCD showed right intrahepatic bile duct dilatation and irregular right hepatic duct stricture. No abnormalities was reported by the liver biopsy. However， as previously discussed， liver biopsy poses limitations and therefore， the patient was still considered to have UC with concomitant development of PSC.\n\nPSC has a poor prognosis， with an average survival period of9.6-18 years. The risk ratio of PSC associated with various malignant tumors is 13-14%； most commonly CCC (11%) followed by colorectal carcinoma (9%). Other concomitant malignancies include hepatocellular carcinoma， gallbladder carcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Progression of PSC into CCC occurs mainly in patients|删除段之间换行|with history of IBD of over 15 years， or patients who have pancolitis， regardless of disease severity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. CCC-PSC is present in adolescents as well as adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. After admission to our hospital， MRCP， contrast-enhanced ultrasound and PET-CT all suggested bile-duct-derived malignancy in our patient. Hence， she was considered to have developed concomitant PSC during the course of UC， which further progressed to CCC. Since the patient evident distant metastases， she was diagnosed with end-stage CCC.\n\n【22】Currently， there are no available treatment that can alter disease progression or the natural course of PSC. Studies have shown thatlow-dose ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA； 13-15 mg/kg/day) has a positive role in improving liver function in patients with PSC， whilehigh-dose UDCA (28 mg/kg/day-30 mg/kg/day) does not provide additional benefits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Recent clinical follow-up studies with large samples have indicated that although UDCA can improve biochemical indices for PSC patients， it has no effect on liver histology and no significant impact on mortality， need for liver transplantation， and prognosis of CCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Endoscopic intervention and surgical procedures can alleviate biliary obstruction and reduce liver damage to a certain extent， however， liver transplantation is still preferred for end-stage PSC or CCC-PSC. Liver transplantation is the only effective treatment， with 5-and 10-year survival rates of 85% and 70% post-transplantation， respectively. Unfortunately， our patient had distant metastases and liver transplantation was contraindicated，thus， only interventional therapy was applied to alleviate her symptoms.\n\n【23】AN Ananthakrishnan“et al.”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> reported that patients with IBD-PSC had significantly increased overall risk of cancers including cholangiocarcinoma compared to patients without PSC. Tsuchiya“et al.”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> reported a case of concomitant colitic cancer and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in a patient with history of UC recently. Clinicians should be aware of the disease and closely monitor UC patients who repeatedly have abnormal liver function test results. Specifically， in patients with persistent ALP elevation， MRCP or ERCP should be employed to clarify diagnosis and provide timely intervention when necessary.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In this case Concerns about managing a non-obstetric traumatic vulvar hematoma in an obstetric patient at term gestation are highlighted in this instance.\n\n【2】Keywords： Hematoma； Pregnancy； Traua； Vulvar\n\n【3】Synopsis\n\n【4】Presentation case of spontaneous vulvar hematoma occurring during labor， managed expectantly.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Vulvar Hematoma refers to a \"collection of blood inside the vulva\"通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. A common obstetrical complication highly related to injury of the labial branches of the internal pudendal arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Mostly， it is observed amongst the obstetric community following birth traumas involving repaired episiotomies and lacerations. Vulvar hematomas are uncommon amongst the non obstetric population and typically occur after physical trauma. Saddle injuries have been linked to a variety of things， including bicycle crossbars， children's toys， and snowboard boot bindings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>. Vulvar hematomas may suddenly occur without warning and cases have been documented in both pregnant and non-pregnant women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. It may be fatal when left undiagnosed and untreated通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Furthermore， there is very little research on the preferred management after a spontaneous hematoma appearance in terms of delivery route. The current case discusses the difficulties in managing a spontaneous rapidly expanding vulvar hematoma in a pregnant woman who is at term gestation.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 26-year-old Filipino primigravida presented at 38 weeks of gestation to our delivery suite reporting labor discomfort. The patient had a smooth pregnancy course and was followed in our outpatient department； she denied any history of bleeding or any other complaints. All her Antenatal investigations were within normal range， an Ultrasound done on 36+3 weeks revealed a single intrauterine pregnancy.\n\n【9】Patient was seen and examined upon arrival to the delivery ward； her vitals were within normal range with pulse 86 bpm and blood pressure 110/70. On per Vaginal examination cervix was 6cm dilated， with 80% effacement. She was admitted， and epidural analgesia was given at the request of the patient. The patient had a normal labor progression and reached full cervical dilation around10 h after admission. When the patient was being prepped and draped for normal vaginal delivery， in-out catheterization of the urinary bladder was done， given the patient was on epidural analgesia.\n\nMoments later， we noted the development of a right-sided vulvar hematoma， expanding rapidly and causing the patient exquisite pain despite the epidural. The hematoma reached a size of 10 cm x 5 cm  in less than 5 min and was still expanding while the patient is reporting a sudden|删除段之间换行|and was still expanding while the patient is reporting a sudden excruciating|删除段之间换行|back pain.\n\n【11】excruciating back pain.\n\n【12】Decision was taken to proceed with emergency cesarean delivery. On cesarean section， a live born baby girl weighing 3330 gm was delivered and transferred to the nursery. Intra-operatively， Uterus was normal， no intra-abdominal or pelvic hematomas were seen.\n\n【13】After the cesarean section， we noted no further expansion of the hematoma. Decision was taken to apply ice packs and monitor the hematoma closely for any increase in size.\n\n【14】IV antibiotics were given， and the urinary Foley catheter was kept for 48 h. Serial lab investigations revealed a drop in hemoglobin seen on day 1 post-op . Her vital signs were within normal range post-partum. The patient did not require any transfusion.\n\n【15】The patient was discharged on day three post-delivery in stable condition； she was instructed to continue oral antibiotics for a total of 10 days.\n\n【16】She presented for a wound check-up 10 days later， the hematoma had then decreased in size. Follow up at 6 week post-partum revealed that the vulvar hematoma had resolved completely.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Vulvar hematomas are relatively common in the obstetrical community. They occur usually due to an injury involving a branch originating from the pudendal artery， this may occur after episiotomy or from perineal lacerations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Many factors are involved in the development of a spontaneous vulvar hematoma including： First baby， macrosomia， rapid labor， extended second stage of labor， hypertension， varicosities or even clotting disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. The incidence of non obstetric hematoma is not clear. The literature is limited to a few recorded cases. Due to its rarity， no general management guidelines exist. However， when the product of both hematoma diameters，longitudinal and transverse， is less than 15 cm Benrubi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> observed that conservatively handled patients had a longer hospital stay and required more procedures in the future.\n\n【19】Table 1： IV antibiotics were given， and the urinary foley catheter was kept for 48h.\n\n| Time ofinvestigations  | Atadmission  | After the delivery Day 1  | After the delivery Day 2  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBC(10/L)  | 18.7  | 20.5  | 20.6  |\n| Hemoglobin (g/dl)  | 13.6  | 9.5  | 9.05  |\n| Hematocrit%  | 39  | 27  | 26.2  |\n| Platelet (10/L)  | 212  | 177  | 182  |\n\n【21】Kanai et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> reports managing large hematoma with surgery if the diameter reached more than 5 cm. He reported complete recovery of all his patients without any complications. In our case the vulvar hematoma occurred spontaneously without instrumentation prior to delivery. Spontaneous vulvar hematomas are more common on the right side as in our case， because of the dextrorotation of the uterus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In our case the patient was primiparous however none of the other factors are applicable. Conservative therapy was typically beneficial in the absence of acute hematoma growth according to a retrospective analysis by Propst et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Selective arterial embolization was suggested to be useful in treating vulvar hematomas in both puerperal and non-puerperal women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，8\\]</u>. Only few case reports exist in the literature on the treatment of vulvar hematoma intrapartum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In another example， a spontaneous antepartum hematoma was successfully drained at 35 weeks gestation followed by an uncomplicated vaginal birth four weeks later 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Authors were doubtful about the mode of delivery in the instance of a second mother at 32 weeks. The woman arrived with a huge vulvar hematoma， despite that the hematoma was drained quickly the abdominal route was chosen for delivery at term due to the potential rebleeding of the arteries in the hematoma cavity during normal vaginal delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The hematoma which presented in a patient who was pregnant to term was steadily increasing in this case as well. Management of vulvar hematomas depends on： The hematoma size m， degree of expansion， the hemodynamic state of the patient and the medical resources available. Small non-expanding hematomas will mostly resolve with expectant management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，8\\]</u>. This includes ice packs， sitz bath， antibiotics and even blood transfusion if needed in addition to administration of suitable analgesia or painkillers. Surgical management can involve surgical exploration or selective arterial embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，9，10\\]</u>. Large and expanding hematomas require surgical intervention in which ligation of the bleeding vessels is done to achieve hemostasis， followed by obliteration of the dead space then vaginal packing to compress the culprit site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In case of failed surgical management arterial embolization is a therapeutic option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【22】In our case the hematoma reached a significant size of 10 cm×5 cm in less than 5 min. However it stopped expanding on its own within a few moments after cesarean delivery. Thus we decided to go with conservative management. Vulvar injurytrauma scoring systems should be updated to include clear guidelines on the management of hematomas. This will allow patients who report to the emergency room receive early care. Perplexities about the route of delivery for women in active labor after a rapidly expanding vulvar hematoma appearance must be addressed. More such instances must be reported in order to make evidence-based decisions about the route of delivery.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\nVulvar hematoma is a serious complication； we need clear scoring systems in order to manage further emergency complications properly. Vulvar injury scoring systems should take pregnancy into consideration. This will allow patients who arrive to the emergency room to receive proper care in a timely manner to ensure a positive outcome on both the fetus and the mother. In cases were a woman in active labor may possibly require surgical therapy following hematoma repair. The question of whether a vaginal delivery is safe or whether a caesarean delivery is necessary in order to avoid further wound disturbance must be addressed. The more such occurrences are reported， the more evidence-based decisions concerning distribution routes may be made taking into consideration stable|删除段之间换行|hematoma size in addition to the hemodynamic status of our patient. In certain cases， vulvar hematomas could be treated expectantly with complete resolution.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Stoma formation complications are most commonly associated with emergency operations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Complications include stenosis， necrosis， prolapse， herniation and retraction of bowel following stoma formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The risk of a parastomal hernia in the presence of an end colostomy is up to 48.1%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Evisceration is defined as an uncontrolled exteriorization of intraabdominal contents outside of the abdominal cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. While parastomal hernias are common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>，traumatic evisceration of small bowel at the site of a parastomal hernia is a rare life-threaten ing phenomenon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， with very few cases reported in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. This report presents such a case to bring attention to and promote learning from this uncommon presentation with a high morbidity and mortality.\n\nA 62-year-oldgentleman presented to the accident and emergency department with evisceration of small bowel， originating from a pre-existing end colostomy in the left iliac fossa. He had a past medical history of rectal carcinoma， for which he underwent a sigmoidectomy and colostomy formation in 2017. A parastomal hernia developed at the colostomy site shortly after the operation. In 2018， further imaging demonstrated secondary malignant neoplasm of his liver and intrahepatic bile duct， which was confirmed on liver resection that same year. In 2019 further pelvic recurrence of the disease manifested itself， for which he completed radio-chemotherapy. His past medical history also included osteoarthritis. He is independent for all Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)，with minimal alcohol consumption and is a non-smoker. The mechanism of injury was an unwitnessed mechanical fall， without head injury or loss of consciousness. The patient sustained an impact onto his left side， directly onto a pre-existing long-standing para-stomal hernia. The patient presented to the hospital five hours after the injury occurred. Approximately one meter of bruised small bowel was eviscerated on arrival . At the bedside examination， the eviscerated small bowel was strangulated and obstructed， but there was no evidence of perforation. His serum lactate was normal. The patient was rapidly resuscitated， optimized and transferred to theatre within one hour of his presentation. While further imaging was considered， it was not deemed appropriate to delay transfer to theatre， as a Computerized Tomography (CT) scan would not change the overall management plan. It is important to note that consideration was made for the risk of COVID-19 and a rapid|删除段之间换行|associated mesentery. Although the eviscerated segment was bruised， it was deemed viable and well-perfused (motility was still present) on assessment. After reduction， it became apparent that the bowel had eviscerated through a full thickness four-centimeter mucosal tear in the medial margin of the colostomy . While there was some discussion on refashioning of the stoma， the priority was to salvage the bowel and avoid submitting the patient to a to a longer procedure. There was minimal necrosis at the tear site， and a minimal debridement was performed to healthy tissue. A primary repair was performed on the defect with interrupted 3/0 PDS sutures . Following a final washout， the midline incision was closed with a1-loop Maxon continuous mass closure. Postoperatively， the patient’s vital signs were closely monitored， routine bloods were taken daily and medications were prescribed to minimalize any pain or nausea.\n\n【3】Outcome and follow-up\n\n【4】There were no peri-operative complications or post-operative concerns. The stoma started functioning on postoperative day four. The patient was discharged from hospital on day five， with outpatient follow up in six weeks from the date of discharge.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Spontaneous evisceration through a parastomal hernia usually occurs secondary to skin weakening and necrosis (for example from direct pressure from a parastomal hernia itself or steroid use)， traumatic injury， or in conditions where there is an increase in intrabdominal pressure (for example a chronic cough or ascites)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Traumatic evisceration of intra-abdominal organs outside of the abdominal cavity can be due to penetrative injury， blunt trauma or a combination of them both 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Abdominal evisceration as a direct consequence of blunt trauma is far less common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Ten publications (one of which document two patient cases each)， were identified that described evisceration of bowel at a parastomal hernia通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，8，10，13-20\\]</u>. However， there is the first case report to specifically describe two unique features resulting in small bowel evisceration.\n\n【7】COVID-19 swab was sent prior to transfer to theatre. However，as per NCEPOD classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， this was an emergency-immediate and organ saving surgery，hence transfer to theatre was not delayed for the result of the swab. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) measures in line with local and national guidance were put in place， to minimalize the overall risk of COVID-19 as much as possible.\n\n【8】The mechanism ofinjury was blunt trauma to a pre-existing parastomal hernia.\n\n【9】Treatment\n\n【10】The small bowel eviscerated through the wall of the stoma(not next to it) hence the first description of an ‘intra-stomal'small bowel evisceration.\n\nThe patient underwent a laparotomy. The contaminated small bowel was cleaned with saline wash  and gently retracted back into the abdominal cavity and organized into the appropriate anatomical position. The bowel was handled and manoeuvred with caution in an effort to diminish the risk of bowel injury or strain to the|删除段之间换行|This case report is unique in that the patient sustained a direct blow over the colostomy site， from a mechanical fall onto a solid blunt surface. We suspect this impact caused the full thickness tear\n\n【12】in the colostomy mucosal surface. The impact together with the pre-existing parastomal hernia is the most likely cause of the small bowel to eviscerate through the stoma in this unique way. Such circumstances are time sensitive， as the exposed abdominal content is at risk of contamination， perforation， strangulation， incarceration and consequential ischemic necrosis of bowel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. In this case， the patient presented five hours following from the injury. The eviscerated small bowel was discolored and bruised. Although the small intestine was both strangulated and incarcerated， the extent of ischemia was estimated to be reversible. Tissue viability was estimated by looking at the color of the serosal surface of the small bowel and assessing the presence of bowel peristalsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Evisceration of a hollow viscus is an indication for immediatelaparotomy， while evisceration of omentum only may not mandate a laparotomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The timely manner in which this patient was optimized and transferred to theatre prevented further complications arising and was in line with best evidence-based practice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Learning points\n\n【14】Abdominal evisceration due to trauma to a parastomal hernia is a rare， but life-threatening condition that requires urgent operative management and a timely multidisciplinary approach. For this reason， it is imperative that all surgeons are aware of the presentations， complications and operative treatments of bowel evisceration.\n\n【15】Because of the high prevalence of parastomal hernias in patients with stomas， combined with the probability of blunt abdominal wall trauma， this case is important to highlight the possibility of small bowel evisceration through this mechanism.\n\n【16】Accurately identifying acute intestinallischemiaand infarction is a critical aspect of managing such cases. Despite this， there is yet to be a widely available， accurate and cost-effective technique to do so 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. This case further highlights the need for more research into intestinal tissue oxygenation and intraoperative assessment of intestinal viability，like fluorescein and doppler studies通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>， to contribute to a more evidence-based approach in managing such presentations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The majority of malignant tumors in the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinus are squamous cell carcinoma， accounting for approximately 60% of cancers in these locations. In August 2014， an80-year-old woman sought treatment at the Department of Otolaryngology (Ear， Nose & Throat)， Taichung Tzu Chi Hospital， with the main complaint of a 40-year history of recurrent Epistaxis in the right nasal cavity. The endoscopic examination revealed bleeding tumors in the right nasal cavity. The computed tomography examination revealed that the right nasal cavity and the right paranasal sinus were filled with homogeneous tumors. The patient underwent an endoscopic resection of the tumors in the paranasal sinus in October删除4:<u> 2014</u>. The pathological examination confirmed a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. After explaining the pathological result to the patient's family， follow-up radiotherapy and chemotherapy were recommended for the patient，but the proposed treatment was reiected by the family members because the patient was old and weak Squamous cell carcinomas in the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinus are rare； therefore， this case is report edhere. This case is unique because the patient was older (80 years old) and had a long history of recurrent Epistaxis (40 years). The patient had never sought treatment for this disease at any hospital or clinic and had never received any related examination， treatment， or surgery. This case was unique because it allowed for the observation of the original features of nasal malignant tumors after 40 years of growth.\n\n【2】Keywords： Squamous cell carcinoma； Epistaxis； Paranasal sinus； Homogeneous\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The nasal cavity the and paranasal sinus are closely related. They not only are in close proximity anatomically but also contain similar epithelial tissue. The paranasal sinus has a natural ostium that connect stothenasal cavity. Therefore， malignant tumors that occur in the nose can easily directly invade the adjacent anatomical structures and continuously increase the extent of the disease. In the case reported in this study， the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinus contained a large amount of tumor tissue.\n\n【5】Malignant tumors in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus account for1% of all cancers in the body， and the incidence of these cancers in descending order is as follows： squamous cell carcinoma， adenoid cystic carcinoma， and adenocarcinoma.The main symptoms include nasal congestion， nasal bleeding， facial swelling， facial pain， and possibly headache， diplopia， or proptosis if the tumor involves the skull base or the orbit. The early symptoms are not obvious and are often ignored by the patient，leading to a later diagnosis， which results in delayed medical treatment. For example，in the present case， because the recurrent nose bleeding was not severe， the patient had not sought any related medical treatment for 40 years. At the first visit， the right nasal cavity and the right paranasal sinus contained a large number of tumors. CT scan reveal that the tumor invades some surrounding structures and erodes bone (medial wall of maxillary sinus， skull base， nasal septum).\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\nIn August 2014， an 80-year-old female patient sought treatment for the first time at the Department of Otolaryngology (Ear， Nose & Throat) of our hospital， with the main complaint of a 40-year history of recurrent epistaxis in the right nasal cavity. She had no history official trauma，|删除段之间换行|had never been in any hospital or clinic for related treatment， and had never received any related examination， treatment， or surgery. On the day of her initial visit， an endoscopic examination revealed bleeding tumors in the right nasal cavity ， and a computed tomography examination revealed that the right nasal cavity and right paranasal sinus contained many homogeneous low-density tumors. CT scan reveal that the tumor invades some surrounding structures and erodes bone (medial wall of maxillary sinus， skull base， nasal septum). In October 2014，the patient underwent an endoscopic resection of the tumors in the paranasal sinus with general anesthesia， and many neoplastic pieces tumors were removed . The results of the pathological examination indicated squamous cell carcinoma， and increased nuclei and hyper chromatic chromatin were observed in the pathological microscopic sections .\n\n| ANT Figure 6： Skeletal scans.  |\n| --- |\n\n【9】Neck CT Figure 5 reveal no cervical lymph node metastasis (No). Skeletal scan Figure 6 and chest X-ray Figure 7 show no distant metastasis (Mo). The tumor tissue had extended into the nasal cavity， maxillary sinus， frontal sinus， and ethmoid sinus， indicating a clinicalstageofcT4aNoMo. Because the family of the patient refused subsequent radiotherapy and chemotherapy， follow-up evaluations every six months were recommended.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Malignant tumors of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus account for 1% of all cancers in the body and 5% of head and neck cancers. The most common histological type is squamous cell carcinoma， and the most common site is the maxillary sinuses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The lesions of malignant tumors produce histological components in areas of the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses such as the Schneiderian mucosa， salivary glands， neural tissue， and lymphatics. Thelocations of malignant tumors in descending order of incidence include the maxillary sinus (60%)， the nasal cavity (20%)， the ethmoid sinus (5%)， and the frontal and sphenoid sinuses (3%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Malignant tumors in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus are more likely to occur in men， with a male to female ratio of 2.26：1.Racially，these tumors occur more frequently in Caucasians. Studies have confirmed that the occurrence of malignant tumors in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinusis related to Epstein-Barr virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， and the development of squamous cell carcinoma is related to human papilloma virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\nMalignant tumors in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus may not have any symptoms. Symptoms may be observed only when the tumor has invaded the adjacent organs. The common clinical symptoms include nasal congestion， nasal bleeding， palate mucosal ulceration， loose or lost teeth， facial swelling， facial pain， diplopia， and proptosis. The symptoms of malignant tumors in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus are not obvious； therefore， early diagnosis is difficult. The disease is usually in an advanced stage at the time of diagnosis， with a five-year survival rate of 30%-40%. Similar to other malignancies， the clinical manifestations of malignant tumors in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus include 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> regional symptoms such as neck lumps， diplopia， and epiphora； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> local symptoms such as|删除段之间换行|nasal obstruction and epistaxis； and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> distant metastasis of the bone通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.The survival rate of patients with distant metastasis the lowest of all cases. Dulguerov et al. found that the survival rate of the patients in the T4 stage was the lowest of all cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【13】For malignant tumors in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus， localized lymph node metastasis is more likely to occur in T2 tumors than inT3 and T4 tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> because T2 tumors invade the floor of the maxillary sinus. A T2 tumor may involve in the following areas：通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the hard palate mucosa， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the upper gingiva mucosa， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the inferior nasal cavity mucosa. These three structures contain a dense， rich lymphatic network，while the mucosa of the paranasal sinus lacks ofthis feature； in terms of the incidence oflymph node metastasis， the behavior of T2 tumors is more similar to that of oral cancer than that of paranasal cancer. If the tumor tissue has invaded key structures(the skull base， dura mater， brain， orbit， cavernous sinus， and infra-temporal fossa)， the survival rate will be significantly reduced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Treatment mainly consists of surgery combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The so-called tri modality therapy consists of the following three methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> partial maxillectomy， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> intra-arterial chemotherapy， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> radiotherapy. The intra-arterial chemo therapy regimen includes cisplatin (100 mg/m， four times weekly)， and the median irradiation dose of radiotherapy is 70Gy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. For patients with an advanced tumor stage (T3orT4)， most scholars recommended prophylactic radiotherapy (50Gy) on the non-meta static cervical lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Except for lymphoma， radiotherapy and chemotherapy have shown no direct efficacy on malignant tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The role of radiotherapy is to control the “regional symptoms \"and\"local symptoms，\" and the role of chemotherapy is to reduce the \"tumor growth， \"i.e.， radiotherapy and chemotherapy are clinically performed as adjuvant therapies for surgery.\n\n【15】For early stage tumors (stage I and stage II)， radical resection is the best surgical approach； for advanced stage tumors (stage III and stage IV)， adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy are necessary for a better prognosis. Endoscopic surgery is also an alternative approach for early stage tumors. Many studies have reported than endoscopic surgical treatment achieves excellent efficacy for treatment of early stage malignant tumors in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The advantages of endoscopic surgery include 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> a small incision， less bleeding， and a reduced chance ofpost operative infection； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> no surgical scar on the face； and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> a shorter hospitalization period. Although the endoscopic surgery approach has obvious advantages， it is not recommended for the following cases： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the lesion involves the frontal sinus， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the lesion involves the bone structure of the maxillary sinus， 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the ulceration at the bottom of the nasal cavity has extended to the upper jaw， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the lesion has invaded the orbit and skull base. The boundary of the tumor should be assessed before the surgery. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are the routine imaging examinations used for these cases.\n\nThe straight line from the medial canthus of the eye to the angle of the mandible is called Ohngren's line 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> . This line divides the paranasal sinuses into anterior-inferior (infrastructure) and superior-posterior (supra structure) sections. A carcinoma in the infrastructure has a better prognosis， while a carcinoma in the supra structure has a worse prognosis because the supra structure carcinoma could extend into the eye orbit， skull base， and pterygoid and infra-temporal fossae. Patients with early stage tumors may have no symptoms， and advanced stage tumors could invade the bone|删除段之间换行|structures of the orbit and skull base，leading to diplopia， proptosis， and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea.\n\n【17】The prognostic factors that affect local recurrence and distant metastasis include 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> an advanced disease stage， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> a non-surgical treatment， 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> an aggressive histological types， 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> an intra-cranial extension，and通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> a cervicallymph node metastasis； ofwhich， cervical lymph node metastasis is the most important prognostic factor. According to the clinical statistics， cervical lymph node metastasis occurs in 7% to 15% of patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We screened the articles in English from 2000 to2019， only 13 cases of tuberculosis complicated with pulmonary thromboembolism are reported totally，another 7 cases were reported as TB complicated with DVT. The average age was 35.10±15.33 years|删除段之间换行|old. Gender might be associated with DVT incidence in TB patients，16 males and 4 females in this study， and our patient was also male. In these cases， there are 2 extrapulmonary TB cases (10%)，none showed both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB，the remaining 18 cases were severe pulmonary TB and one with tumor， of which， 13 cases were destruction of both lung lobes or complicated with multiple cavities；3 cases had pleural effusion； 2 cases had military TB， 1 case had malignant mesothelioma of pleura. The majority of patients was in developing countries and had a longer disease history. These patients had dyspnea (75%)， fever (45%)， chest pain (45%) and hemoptysis(5%). Only one of the 20 patients with TB was positive for MDR-TB， and none had HIV. ECG showed typical S.QT in 2 cases (10%). D-dimer was performed in 3 cases (15%). CTPA showed bilateral pulmonary thromboembolism in 6 cases (30%)， right pulmonary artery embolization in 5 cases (25%)，left pulmonary artery embolism in 1 case (5%). CT venography of chest and abdomen showed multiple deep vein thrombosis in 1 case (5%). In the course of anticoagulant therapy， 2 patients (10%) were adjusted warfarin due to the difficulty of acenocoumarol treatment， 1 patient stopped warfarin and only used LMWH due to difficulty in attaining target INR， and 1 patient was treated with dabigatran after discontinuation of warfarin. The|删除段之间换行|remaining 18 patients all required large dose warfarin maintenance treatment range INR value， a high dose of acenocoumarol(8 mg day1) was needed to obtain a therapeutic INR. The development of VTE in all 20 patients was not coincident with the time of TB diagnosis， 12patients developed DVT soon after TB diagnosed， and in 8 patients， the DVT event had preceded TB diagnosis.\n\nIn our report， the patient was the oldest among those mentioned above， 85-year-old. PTE which associated with TB was a rare occurrence， and very few cases have been reported in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. PTE can be the presenting feature of TB， occurring a few days after the diagnosis or late in the course of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In our study， the patient developed pulmonary embolism before TB diagnosed，but pulmonary embolism was still a complication of active tuberculosis. The prevalence of VTE among TB patients was 1.5% to 3.4%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.In|删除段之间换行|the treatment.\n\n【16】a multivariate analysis model， adults with active TB had a greater risk of VTE than those without (P<0.001)， close to the previously reported risk associated with neoplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Severe TBcan resulIttina hypercoagulableestate and thromboembolic complications. TB， as a chronic inflammatory state， in the lung activates the coagulation cascade and leads to pulmonary and systemic thrombin generation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>， it intervenes all the three parts of Virchow's triad， may play a role in pathogenesis of the disease. The presence of a hypercoagulable state in TB patients was considered as a consequence of elevated plasma fibrinogen with impaired fibrinolysis， along with a decrease in factor III， protein C， increased platelet aggregation， and direct endothelial damage promoted by the mycobacterium tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>. White et al. also demonstrated a possible association between DVT in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and the use of rifampicin with a relative risk of 4.74 in patients treated with rifampicin-containing regimens通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In addition， the hypercoagulable state persists for 2 weeks after the initiation of anti-tuberculosis medication and improves while continuing the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，16\\]</u>. Our patient also chose rifampicin in the ATT regimen because it is used as a bactericidal agent and is often included in first-line anti-TB drug therapy. Rifampin not only increases the occurrence of thrombus， but also has a great influence on warfarin. The metabolism of warfarin increases in the presence of rifampicin， and the doses of warfarin sometimes have to be increased to more than double the recommended level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>. During warfarin is added for treating thromboembolism， bleeding is common and sometimes fatal. Novel Oral Anticoagulant (NOAC) agents are ideal choice for control of PTE/DVT in patients receiving anti tuberculosis medication. Our patient chose rivaroxaban for the treatment of PTE. Finally， he discharged successfully.\n\n【18】In conclusion， active TB has been considered as a risk factor for PTE.

The second excitation mapping of endocardial surface was performed， indicating that the potential of the posterior wall of the left atrium conducted from the atrial septum to the free wall， and the potential conduction of the anterior wall of the left atrium was the same as the posterior wall . The atrial septum of the right atrium excited earlier， but the A waves of CS could not be reset by right atrial premature beats ， which suggested that the potential of the origin might come from the septum of atrium. Although the excitation mapping indicated that the septum of theleft atrium locally excited earlier， the ablation was in vain. Thus the re-entry between the CS and the posterior wall of the left atrium might be possible . The septum of the left atrium was locally ablated later， and the TCL extended to 330 ms.

Observing the CS excitation sequence， a coronary sinus potential associated with posterior atrial wall could be found ， which indicated the re-entry between coronary sinus and posterior atrial wall， and confirmed that the position is located at the posterior septum .

The existence of the CS potential was considered as the mechanism of this tachycardia. Based on the above findings， the most likely mechanism is the re-entry located between the CS and left atrium .

Although it mainly occurs in postmenopausal women， it can hit younger patients as well. Hysterectomy is considered the standard treatment and it could represent a problem for those young women who desire to preserve fertility. A conservative management can be offered to these patients when the tumor is well differentiated and advanced stage is excluded. Several studies are available in literature about fertility-sparing treatment in young women. Progestin treatment， seem to be the most validated conservative management. We report the case of a 43 years old patient， nulliparous， diagnosed by directed biopsy guided by hysteroscopy of grade (G)1 endometrial cancer stage IA. After the conservative treatment levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) (Mirena@， Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc.； 52 mg)， the patient entered in complete remission. She conceived by In vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment and delivered at 31 weeks multiple gestation by cesarean section for obstetric indication. After evaluation the case， total laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy was performed five months after delivery.\n\n【2】Keywords： Endometrial cancer； Fertility-sparing therapy； Progestin； Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device； Reproduction； Outcomes\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】We present a case of a nulliparous patient of 43-year-old with a 12 months history of abnormal bleedings was referred on July删除4:<u> 2013</u>. Menarche was at age 12 and menses were irregular. The patient didn't suffer dysmenorrhea， nor other gynecologic disease.\n\n【5】Her body mass index was 30， she was not affected by diabetes mellitus， and her family history was negative for ovarian， uterine and colonic cancer.\n\n【6】After several months of irregular bleeding， a transvaginal ultrasound was carried out and showed a normal-sized，anteverted uterus with a thickened endometrium and increased vascularity within the endometrium. Ambulatory endometrial biopsy obtained with Cornier'spipelle showed endometrioid adenocarcinoma grade I. The immunohistochemical study revealed positivity for estrogen (85%) and progesterone (60%) receptors. Hysteroscopy (Betocchi hysteroscope5 mm， Karl Storz) revealed a friable and sessile mass inside the uterine cavity with atypical vascularization. Isthmus and cervix were unaffected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) discarded myometrial infiltration. Lymph nodes were not involved by MRI. The patient desired future fertility and conservative management of her disease， and therefore underwent levonorgestrel-releasing IUD placement. Patients with endometrium-confined， well-differentiated， endometrioid adenocarcinoma are the proper candidates for this treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Endometrial sampling obtained by betocchi hysteroscope in out patient basis， using semirigid grippers three months following IUD-LNG placement， showed complete regression of the adenocarcinoma. The patient has subsequently undergone endometrial sampling， using Betocchihysteroscope (5 mm) and semirigid grippers， every three months. All specimens have been negative. Two follow-up MRI scans have been performed with no other evidence of intrauterine or metastatic disease. The patient remained without evidence of disease 10 months after initial IUD-LNGplacement.\n\n【7】Thus， LNG-IUS was removed at 11 months after diagnosis， and it was decided， given the age of the patient， an ovodonation to achieve the best index of gestation. This is in line with the recently published European Society of Gynecological Oncology (ESGO) guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， stating that patients with previous infertility or risk factor of in fertility should be referred and encouraged to consider ART. Actually， evidence shows that ART is a safe and effective procedure in this setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The preparation consisted in an inhibition with triptorelin depot prior to and subsequent endometrial estradiol transdermal preparation to have an endometrial thickness greater than 8 mm but with blood estrogen levels no greaterthan 200 pg /ml. Afterwards， endometrial maturation was made with micronized progesterone in high doses (800 mg/24h).\n\n【8】Two embryos were transferred. Twelve and 14 days after embryo transfer， serial blood B-hCG assays showed a biochemical pregnancy. At 5 weeks from embryo transfer， a single viable pregnancy was detected at ultrasound. At 27th week the patient was admitted due to the threat of preterm labor. At 31 weeks + 4 days of gestation， two healthy male babies delivered by cesarean section by obstetric indication.\n\n【9】DuringcesareanSsIection， multiple decidual上biopsieesSfor intraoperative frozen sections were performed (resulting negative)， the abdomen was carefully inspected showing no macroscopic cancer spread and random peritoneal biopsies were also obtained. All definitive histological examinations of decidual， peritoneal， and placental biopsies resulted negative.\n\n【10】A total laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed four months after cesarean section. Histological examination of the uterus showed no areas of complex atypical hyperplasia or endometrial cancer. After 6 months of follow-up， the patient is free of disease.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Endometrial cancer is the most common of the gynecologic malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Although it is primarilya disease of postmenopausal women， 25% are premenopausal and 3%-5% are under age 40 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Endometrioid adenocarcinoma， the most common type， is typically an estrogen driven disease affecting obese women.\n\n【13】Risk factors\n\n【14】Obesity and any condition that cause hyperestrogenic state are the main risk factors for endometrial cancer in young women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【15】A literature review， about fertility sparing treatment in young women with endometrial cancer， reported that the majority of patients had a history of anovulation， ovarian dysfunction， nulliparity and obesity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Amongyoung patients，thin women seem to havea moreadvanced stage compared to those who are obese. Duska 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， demonstrated that patients with BMI lower than 25 were more likely to have advanced disease and high-risk histology (uterine serous papillary， clear cell) compared with those women with a BMI over删除4:<u> 25</u>. Lee et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> reported that young women who were obese， hypertensive and diabetic， tended to have well-differentiated tumours more frequently compared to whose patients without metabolic disease.A comparison of the disease in young and old-women is mandatory. The differences between two groups were exposed in the study of Setiawan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> and Colombo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The distribution of stage from I to IV and the histological type were similar， but grade I endometrial cancer seem to occur more frequently in young patients with less aggressive behaviour.\n\n【18】In this study， they demonstrated a higher prevalence of synchronic ovarian malignancies in the younger group. The higher prevalence of synchronous ovarian cancer in younger women is demonstrated in several studies. Walsh 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>reported a rate of 25%， while Gitsch 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> reported a rate of 29%.\n\n【19】In addition to this， young women with endometrial cancer should always be carefully consulted about the need for a genetic test for detection of Lynch syndrome， depending either on their family history of cancer or depending of testing for mismatch repair protein expression using microsatellite instability testing and immunohistochemistry analysis. This will alert and identify patients with Lynch syndrome who need a very close monitoring and tailored consultation about their further follow-up and management. It is debatable whether a patient with Lynch syndrome should be candidate to conservative management.\n\n【20】Extensive counselling of the patient is the integral part of the management. The detailed information about all aspects and risk of conservative treatment has to be provided and informed consent obtained， before initiation of the treatment.\n\n【21】Patient selection\n\nThe selection of endometrial cancer patients for whom fertility-sparing treatment is appropriate is the aim to achieve the best|删除段之间换行|outcomes. All relevant studies recommended for patients with early-stage， well-differentiated， endometrioidtype endometrial adenocarcinoma with no evidence of myometrial invasion or extrauterine spread. According to the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology  staging system， stage IA (confined to endometrium)， grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma cases are eligible for fertility-sparing treatment.\n\n【23】Well-differentiated tumours have a very low risk of mvometrial invasion and extrauterine spread (lymph node， ovarian or peritoneal metastasis). In addition to this， well-differentiated tumour cells express more progesterone receptors and therefore respond to progesterone therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【24】In the other hand， the absence of myometrial invasion is also important clinical aspect of endometrioid adenocarcinoma， because implies a very low risk of extrauterine disease.\n\n【25】Navarria et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> reported the estimated number of patients who may need fertility- sparing treatment is a based population as a rate of 0.3 in 100.000 women of these criteria.\n\n【26】However， because the incidence of 0young womenwith endometrial cancer is increasing and the number of women who want to delay having children， the future need for fertility - sparing treatment will increase.\n\n【27】Management\n\n【28】Although hysterectomy represents the standard treatment for endometrial cancer， it is often not accepted when the patient is young and desires a pregnancy in the future.\n\n【29】In these cases， a fertility-sparing treatment could be offered as an alternative option to accurately selected patients. Hormonal therapy alone or combined with endometrial ablation by hysteroscopy are identified in literature as the most used and effective conservative treatments. However， patients must be informed that data about medical treatment are incomplete because of the limited number of treated patients and that there is a risk of disease progression during treatment or after initial response.

The follow-up was performed by hysteroscopic biopsy after one month starting the treatment， and then repeated every three months until delivery. After delivery， the follow-up was performed at 4， 8 and 12 months by hysteroscopic biopsy. Of 15 women， 11 had complete remission and 4 of them attained pregnancy with 4 live births.

Seven women had complete response and two of nine patients partially responded to treatment. Two patients developed recurrent disease 10 and 22 months after the last control (25% recurrence). In addition to this， of eight patients who sought conceive， four had a pregnancy and three of them delivered. The other aim of this study was to predict complete response investigating expression pattern of five markers (IGF1R， PTEN， progesterone receptor， estrogen receptor and ki67). This study conclude that progesterone receptors are reliable markers to predict complete response of endometrial cancer.\n\n【34】In a more recent experience， Chen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> performed， between January 2000 and December 2011， a retrospective study evaluating the outcome of 53 patients with endometrial carcinoma， stage IA，whounderwent conseryativeetreatment with progestin(medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) at doses of 250 mg/day -500mg/day or Megestrol Acetate (MA) at doses of 160 mg/day - 480mg/day. This study demonstrated the feasibility of fertility-sparing strategies in women of childbearing age with Progesterone Receptors(PR)-positive. Also， concluded that to decrease the risk of EC recurrence， the identification of relevant factors that predicttreatment success is necessary. Obese patients (BMI 230) had alower Complete Remission (CR) rate to progestin treatment， and practitioners should be particularly concerned about weight reduction in these patients. In patients without a histologic response to progestin after 12 months， the mode of therapy should be revaluated； these patients should be counselled on the increased probability of failure.\n\n【35】Several studies are available in literature about progestin-releasing IUD，as an alternative option to oral administration in the conservative management of endometrial cancer. There are several progestin-releasing IUDs， but the IUD that has been studied most commonly for EC treatment is LNG-IUD that releases levonorgestrel20 mcg/day (LNg20； Mirena). Progestin IUDs may be used for treatment alone or in combination with an oral progestin.\n\n【36】In 2004， Montz 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> in a prospective study from 1999 to 2003intrauterine progesterone appearsto eradicate some cases of presumed stage IA， grade 1 endometrioid cancer.\n\nCade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> reviewed his experience of all patients receiving intrauterine progesterone therapy for stage-1 endometrial cancer.

They reviewed the existing literature on the use of hysteroscopic resection in conservative management of endometrial cancer to preserve fertility and concluded that hysteroscopic resection to conservative management of early-stage endometrial carcinoma may be a way to improve response and recurrence rates in women wishing to preserve fertility.\n\n【40】Falcone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u> included 28 women， aged 18 to 40 years with early stage of endometrial cancer. Hysteroscopic Resection (HR) was performed to remove the tumour lesion， the endometrium adjacent to the tumour， the myometrium underlying the tumour. If final pathology confirmed a G1 endometrioid EC with no myometrial invasion and PR positivity at immunohistochemistry， hormone therapy was started 1 week after HR. Adjuvant hormonal therapy consisted of oral progestins (megestrol acetate) or intrauterine progestin device for 6 months. A complete response was observed in96.3% of the patients 85.7% of patients achieved a durable complete response， with a median duration of 95 months.\n\n【41】Follow up during conservative treatment\n\n【42】Although today no clear guidelines about follow-up for women who undergo conservative treatment have been expressed， most authors consider performing the first endometrial biopsy after three months of hormonal therapy and then every three months until 24months.\n\n【43】Chiva et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u> reported that a follow-up with endometrial evaluation should be taken after 12 weeks of treatment. When a positive biopsy occurs， another biopsy should be performed after 24weeks of treatment. If the second biopsy results positive， a radical treatment should be carried out. If the second biopsy results negative the patient could start to attempt conception. Endometrial sampling could be taken every 3 months.\n\n【44】Eskander et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u> suggested an endometrial evaluation with curettage after three months of treatment. In case of disease progression or persistence of cancer，he recommended hysterectomy. If response to conservative management is confirmed， hormonal therapy should be continued for 6 to 9 months.\n\nChen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> proposed a strict follow up with endometrial evaluation 3 months after initiation of progestin treatment. Then it recommendedhysteroscopicand histologic evaluation every3 months until 12 months.

He found a regression rate of 76.2% and a relapse rate of40.6%. He concluded that because of the high rate of recurrence after successful fertility-sparing therapy prophylactic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is the best option for patients who have completed family planning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29，30\\]</u>.\n\n【50】Conclusions\n\n【51】Even though endometrial carcinoma is mainly diagnosed after menopause， it may occur in young women as well and anytime a young woman complains abnormal bleeding， endometrial carcinoma should be ruled-out and all diagnostic tools should be used to exclude the pathology. This is particularly important if risk factors for endometrial carcinoma are present. This subiect is important as the number of younger women with endometrial cancer is rising because ofincreasing obesity. The standard treatment for endometrial cancer is total hysterectomy. In recent years， the surgical management of the majority of endometrial cancers has become less extensive. Hysterectomy removes the primary source of the cancer and allows the assessment of the degree of local invasion. The ovaries are removed to eliminate a source of estrogen， and to remove metastatic or synchronous tumours. The role of lymph node dissection is controversial. Although this procedure is usually performed in women in menopause， conservative treatment could be a reasonable option to propose to young patients with stage IA grade I endometrial cancer and endometrial hyperplasia who desire to retain fertility. An exhaustive evaluation of grade， stage， histology type， hormonal receptors expression， myometrial invasion and metastatic diffusion is necessary before introducing hormonal therapy as alternative treatment. Today most of controlled studies about the conservative treatment concerns patients with endometrial hyperplasia and endometrioid adenocarcinoma grade I. Translation research in EC cell lines has very recently yielded very interesting results regarding the use of the antidiabetic drug metformin and its effect on EC cells. These studies have shown that metformin suppresses EC cell growth and exhibits an antiproliferative effect in women with EC and insulin resistance. Aprospective phase II study is announced and will further elucidate the role of metformin in combination to progesterone and active weigh management for the treatment of early stage EC in the future.\n\n【52】There is often a debate when cancer is diagnosed in young patients who wants to preserve fertility： risks and benefits of conservative treatment should be widely discussed with patients.We conclude， that nonsurgical approach is a valid option but indications and eligibility of different therapies must be carefully considered and strictly followed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

If organ function is a particular consideration (e.g. ovarian function)， then the un derlying assumption is usually made that the peripheral blood concentration， for example， of a steroid hormone is a valid reflection of the relevant organ’s synthesis and secretion. Clinical decisions are based on the further assumption that a blood sample is representative for the body as a whole， and irrespective of from where the sample is taken. Practitioners need to be made aware that these assumptions are not always factually correct and that hormone measurements obtained in peripheral blood -usually from a cubital vein - is open to misinterpretation. A major reason for potential misinterpretation involves counter-current exchange mechanisms between intimately-apposed veins and arteries in the vicinity of a specific organ， the flow of such blood vessels coursing in opposing directions. The extent of counter-current exchange between an organ's venous drainage and corresponding artery will influence the systemic blood concentration of the hormone or molecule in question 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Not to be overlooked，lymphatic vessels are part of the local transfer system. Even though lymphatic flow is relatively slow， the hormone concentrations are high.\n\n【13】The overall extent of counter-current exchange may vary with time and can be influenced by diverse factors. These include posture of the body， heart rate， stage of the menstrual cycle and intrinsic diurnal rhythms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Nonetheless， such a system of molecular redistribution generates increased concentrations oflocally produced substances in the neighboring artery compared with aortic concentrations. Such increased concentrations may have influences on other cell groups within the given organ or in other organs supplied from the same local artery. Furthermore， they may act to influence the effectiveness of the exchange system itself. As to relevant details， diffusion in and out of blood vessels is mainly a passive process. Smaller molecules diffuse more effectively than larger ones， but substances with a molecular weight of 500 Daltons or more may be transferred. Lipophilic substances diffuse more readily than hydrophilic ones of similar molecular weight. A low blood velocity in capillaries will facilitate equilibrium of substances between extracellular fluid and plasma. Edema will delay diffusion to and from the capillaries and may disrupt normal capillary flow.\n\n【14】Many substances become bound to plasma proteins like albumin and diverse globulins. Only the non-bound fraction is physiologically active and transferred from venous to arterial blood. Locally-transferred hormones may have a huge impact， but plasma binding kinetics in vivo remain largely unexplored. Despite so much effort being devoted nowadays to molecular biology， it would be advantageous also to continue with classical investigative physiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In conclusion， experience shows that the concentration in cubital vein blood of endogenous substances provides an empirically useful tool to establish the functional state of the body in a clinical setting. However， if an exact description of the production of an organ is needed， samples from the local artery and vein must be used for the assessment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Despite continuous improvement in therapy， breast cancer represents the main cause of cancer death in women. Notwithstanding the notable increase in the early diagnoses made possible by the spread of screening tests， still， 5% of breast malignancies show up as metastatic ‘de novo’. We report the case of a 56-years-old woman who， under a first-line therapy with Ribociclib and Fulvestrant developed pseudocirrhosis of the liver， i.e.， liver cirrhosis due to the malignancy， but unrelated to the presence of liver metastases. This condition is a rare and poorly known clinical entity. There is no consensus on the criteria needed for diagnosis. Pathogenic mechanisms underlying etiology may be chemotherapy's toxicity or architectural changes in response to neoplastic micro-infiltration. However， an increase in transaminases and liver dysfunction are described with CDK 4/6 inhibitors therapy， probably due to direct drug-induced hepatotoxicity， immune-mediated activity， and production of toxic metabolites. Early hepatic alterations and/or radiological evidence of liver cirrhosis in the absence of neoplastic liver involvement， should suggest the diagnosis of such a rare condition.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】About 6% of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients present at initial diagnosis with “de novo”metastatic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most common sites of distant metastases are bones (85%)， liver (50%)， lungs (25%)， and brain (16%). According to statistics updated to 2022， the 5-year survival rate for mBC is 29%， but tumor histotypes affect survival outcome： indeed， women with TNBC and HER2overexpressing tumors have a worse prognosis as compared to patients with Luminal one neoplasms通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Currently， CDK4/6 inhibitors have changed the natural history of Hormone Receptor-positive(HR+)， HER2-negative， mBC. Indeed， from 2015 to 2017， Palbociclib，Ribociclib and Abemaciclib， in association with hormonal therapy， have been approved in both aromatase inhibitors-sensitive and - resistant HR+，HER2-negative mBC， based on the benefit in median Overall Survival(mOS) and median Progression Free Survival (mPFS) evidenced by the randomized phase III PALOMA， MONALEESA， and MONARCH trials， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】CDK 4/6 inhibitors， which are widely used in clinical practice， differ in their safety profiles：neutropenia， QTc prolongation， diarrhea being often observed although at different rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Hepatotoxicity associated with CDK 4/6 inhibitors is an uncommon occurrence， characterized by an increase in AST and ALT (G3-G4) due to direct drug-induced， immune-mediated activity， and production of toxic metabolites. Moreover， in literature few cases of CDK 4/6 inhibitors-pseudocirrhosis are described. Pseudocirrhosis is defined by radiological features as in the case of true cirrhosis， appearing in patients without a history of heavy alcohol use， hepatitis B， hepatitis C， or pre-existing chronic liver disease； this condition predominantly affects patients with liver metastases who have previously received multiple chemotherapy regimens. The outcome is often worsened by portal hypertension and hepatocellular failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. To our knowledge， this condition is a rare entity， most commonly observed in breast cancer patients. The absence of diagnostic criteria and the lack of data in the literature， make this unlike condition difficult to diagnose and， consequently， also to manage. Herein， we report an atypical presentation of pseudocirrhosis with peculiar radiologic features in a breast cancer patient， with progressive liver failure.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nA 53-years-old female patient was referred to our center in November 2017 for a histological diagnosis of breast cancer. She has undergone a right breast quadrantectomy in October 2017 for a ductal mammary carcinoma staged as pT1bN2a (st. IIIa)，G2，Luminal A. Sequencing analysis of the BRCA2 gene by Next Generating Sequencing (NGS) revealed the presence of a pathogenetic variant of the gene. After excluding distant metastasis， the patient received 4cycles of Epirubicin plus Cyclophosphamide followed by 12 cycles of Paclitaxel as adjuvant chemotherapy. After chemotherapy， she started hormonotherapy with Letrozole. In March 2021， during follow-up， an abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) showed a vertebral lesion， confirmed by bone scintigraphy with additional evidence of multiple lesions affecting all bone segments examined. A total body CT scan identified no further distant metastases. Therefore， in May2021， she started a first-line therapy with Ribociclib plus Fulvestrant， together with an anti-resorptive therapy with Zoledronic Acid. In August 2021 owing to the elevation of transaminases (AST 97 UI/l， ALT 67 UI/l)， an abdominal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed the presence of hepatic nodules (more likely cystic) of the|删除段之间换行|size of 12 mm to 16 mm， in the segments V，VI and VII . In November 2021， a control abdominal MRI evidenced a dysmorphic， irregular， and micronodular hepatic pattern， suggestive of liver cirrhosis . Hepatitis virus infection tests and autoimmune hepatitis markers were negative. The patient denied alcohol abuse. An increase in CA15.3 levels was also documented (93 U/ml) . Hence， the patient underwent liver biopsy， which evidenced a micro-infiltration of breast cancer in the liver parenchyma， the neoplastic population being GATA 3+， CK 19+， E-caderin+/-， ER <1%， PgR<1%， Hepatoyte-，Ki-67 7%， Her2 score 0). A disease progression was thus diagnosed. She refused chemotherapy， and thus Talazoparib monotherapy was administered as second-line therapy， due to the presence of the BRCA 1/2 mutation. In February 2022， a PET scan found unexpectedly no liver uptake， but a lesion in the brain's temporal lobe (SUVmax 16.5) was documented . A total-body CT confirmed a stable disease. Lab tests showed a worsening of liver function， with hyperbilirubinemia， hypoalbuminemia， and hyperammonemia . She exhibited signs of ascites and. progressive clinical and cognitive deterioration. Talazoparib treatment was stopped， and we referred her to the best supportive care unit.\n\n【7】Table 1： Progress of tumor markers.\n\n| Lab Tests  | 15-09-2021  | 10-11-2021  | 18-01-2022  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CEA ng/ml 通用删除7(英):<u>(0-3)</u>  | 2.56  | 2.76  | 2.65  |\n| Ca 19.9 UI/mL 通用删除7(英):<u>(0-40)</u>  | 5  | 7.7  | 38.5  |\n| Ca 15.3 UI/mL (0-32.4)  | 74.2  | 93  | 142.8  |\n\n【9】Table 2： Progress of lab tests and Child-Pugh score.\n\n| Lab Tests  | 20-12-2021  | 04-02-2022  | 22-02-2022  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bilirubin  | 1.2 mg/dl  | 1.46 mg/dl  | 4.60 mg/dl  |\n| Albumin  | 3.66 g/d  | 3.40 g/d  | 3.00 g/d  |\n| INR  | 1.04  | 1.22  | 1.26  |\n| Ascites  | No  | Yes  | Yes  |\n| Encephalopathy  | No  | No  | No  |\n| Child-Pugh score  | A  | B7  | C12  |\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Liver cirrhosis from cancer also called pseudocirrhosis， is a rare and poorly understood clinical entity， most common in breast cancer patients. Pseudocirrhosis is characterized by architectural changes resulting in the reduction of liver volume， development of irregular and dysmorphic nodularity， and fibrotic retraction. In contrast to true cirrhosis， fibrotic bridges between nodules are absent and clinical status rapidly declines caused by hepatic failure complications(ascites， splenomegaly，and varices). Pathogenicity factors associated with liver disease involve changes induced by the micro-infiltration of the tumor and toxicity linked to systemic therapy. The liver is one of the most common sites of breast cancer spread， thus in liver metastases of chemotherapy-naive patients， a desmoplastic reaction surrounding the tumor may lead to hepatic impairment. On the other hand， necrosis induced by chemotherapy likely causes nodular regenerative hyperplasia with sinusoidal obstruction syndrome， a process underlying vascular injury andlong-term fibrosis. Moreover， the response of liver metastases to chemotherapy exacerbates scarring and fibrotic retraction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Most cases of pseudocirrhosis described in the literature， are thus related to chemotherapy. Dan Engelman et al.\n\n通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> suggested that hepatic alterations arise after a median of 2 lines of chemotherapy and after a median of 4 lines of systemic treatments for metastatic disease (endocrine therapy， CDK 4/6 inhibitors or chemotherapy). Particularly， this condition occurs mainly during treatment with 5-FU， cisplatin， and a combination of 5-FU and cisplatin in advanced stages. Therefore， careful anamnesis， blood tests for hepatitis virus infection， and markers of autoimmune hepatitis are needed to exclude other possible causes of cirrhosis. When the first abnormalities of the hepatic parenchyma emerge from the diagnostic imaging， the liver function is preserved， delaying the diagnosis of pseudocirrhosis. Signs of liver failure such as hypoalbuminemia， hyperbilirubinemia， and coagulation disorders may arise in more advanced stages with the onset of hepatic failure； this dramatic condition， of course， must be differentiated from hepatic failure from cancer progression in the liver. Furthermore， in advanced cancer patients， malnutrition represents a confounding factor， because of altered levels of albuminemia in the blood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The lack of valid data in the literature makes it difficult to manage these patients： Potential therapeutic approaches include supportive care， steroid treatment， and a change in systemic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In our case， at the time of presentation， our patient had completed adjuvant chemotherapy and had no liver metastases， unlike most cases of liver cirrhosis that arises on pre-existing liver metastases or after multiple lines of systemic therapy. Liver disease onset is very unusual with unexpected evolution. Hepatic neoplastic micro-infiltration reported in MR images revealed an atypical liver involvement. In addition， PET showed no hepatic uptake， but FDG avidity in brain’s temporal lobe with no morphological abnormality on corresponding CT images. We supposed that bilirubin elevation triggered hepatic encephalopathy， causing hypermetabolism in the area of the limbic system， as reported in some case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Furthermore， she experienced liver cirrhosis during Ribociclib plus Fulvestrant therapy， only sporadic cases of hepatotoxicity related to CDK 4-6 inhibitors having been described in the literature to date. To our knowledge，Ribociclib is most frequently associated withliver-related adverse events compared to the othertwo agents (Palbociclib and Abemaciclib)， dueto the suppressionofhepatic transporters and direct drug-induced hepatotoxicity， resulting in the|删除段之间换行|production of toxic metabolites. In the MONALEESA-3 trial， which investigated Ribociclib plus Fulvestrant for postmenopausal women after progression on endocrine therapy， Grade 3 or 4 hepatobiliary adverse events occurred in 13.9% of patients who received Ribociclib， but none of these cases resulted in death or hepatic impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，8\\]</u>. Despite the discontinuation of CDK 4/6 inhibitors therapy，liver tests did not normalize. The patient was considered to have progressive disease after liver biopsy. She refused chemotherapy； thus， we chose Talazoparib therapy based on the results of EMBRACA trial. Unfortunately， our patient died few weeks after starting Talazoparib，8.5 months since the initial diagnosis of pseudocirrhosis. This data reflects the findings of a small retrospective observational study of patients with liver cirrhosis from breast cancer， where the mOS from diagnosis of pseudocirrhosis was 10.0 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Despite chemotherapy is the best choice to prevent severe organ dysfunction referred to as visceral crisis， the gold standard therapeutic strategy for pseudocirrhosis remains an unmet need due to limited available data and the aggressive behavior of the disease.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Liver cirrhosis from breast cancer is a condition rarely found in these patients， usually diagnosed at an advanced stage， and characterized by a poor prognosis. Prospective data are lacking and this， together with the absence of specific diagnostic criteria and to provenly active therapeutic interventions， makes this condition difficult to identify and treat. Early recognition of the disease and its complications (such as hepatic encephalopathy) could prevent rapid progression to liver failure and increased morbidity. Unfortunately， due to poor performance status and liver dysfunction， the best supportive care is often the only viable way. Early hepatic alterations and/or radiological evidence of liver cirrhosis in the absence of neoplastic liver involvement， should suggest the diagnosis of such a rare condition.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We report a case report of a middle aged male who presented to the emergency room with very high blood sugar level， altered sensorium and high fever， chills and rigor. On evaluation with Computed Tomography (CT) of abdomen， there was a 1.9 cm calculus at the uretero-pelvic junction， densely impacted and obstructing the drainage from right kidney and class 3b Emphysematous pyelonephritis extending to perinephric space and psoas sheath. Various prognostic factors and risk stratification strategies are documented by multiple authors that decide the final outcome in these patients. Our patient fell in the intermediate risk category， which necessitated a prompt glycemic control， correction of acid base imbalance， immediate disimpaction of stone and decompression of the pelvicalyceal system with percutaneous drainage of the perinephric and psoas collection. This case report illustrates the lethal combination of obstruction and uncontrolled blood sugar levels in patients with gas forming infection of the kidney. Physicians should be alert and be well aware of this fatal combo and ensure that a prompt diagnosis is made and triaged accordingly in order to salvage the kidney and safe the life of the individual.\n\n【2】Keywords： Emphysematous pyelonephritis； Renal calculus； Hydronephrosis； Psoas abscess\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Emphysematous Pyelonephritis (EPN) is a life-threatening severe infection of the kidney that leads to accumulation of gas within the renal parenchyma，collecting system and perinephric tissue. Most of these patients (up to 90%) have underlying uncontrolled diabetes mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In non-diabetic patients， the major associated pathology is urinary tract obstruction which is mostly due to the necrosed papilla or by ureteral calculi. Other contributing factors like renal failure， drug abuse immunosuppression， anatomic abnormalities， polycystic kidney disease， neurogenic bladder， alcoholism also can cause EPN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. Here， we present a case of EPN due to calculus obstruction at the Uretero Pelvic Junction (UPJ) in a diabetic male with uncontrolled sugar levels.\n\n【5】cited.\n\nA 49-year-old male， diabetic and hypertensive for more than 15 years， presented to the Emergency Room (ER) with high-grade fever， chills and rigor for 3 weeks. His body mass index was删除4:<u> 21</u>. The spikes of temperature were associated with bilateral loin pain. On admission， he was febrile and mildly disoriented to time， place and person. The body temperature was 102°F. His serum creatinine was 265 umol/L and the total count was 19.8 x 10/uL. He also had a blood pressure of 70 mmHg/40 mmHg with a heart rate of 126/min and a respiratory rate of 32/min. His blood sugar at ER was 29.16 mmol/L， with urine analysis showing abundant pus cells and positive for ketone bodies. The blood gas and biochemical analysis suggested severe metabolic acidosis， hypoalbuminemia (20 g/L) and hyponatremia (127 mmol/L). The platelet count was 110×10°L and the International Normalized Ratio (INR) was 1.1. On abdominal examination， the right kidney was palpable and tender， while there was tenderness on deep palpation on the left loin. The overall clinical picture suggested diabetic ketoacidosis with septic shock and a clinical diagnosis of bilateral acute pyelonephritis was considered. A bedside ultrasound of the abdomen revealed heterogeneity within the bulky right kidney. However， no stones were identified. Urine grew E. coli，|删除段之间换行|105 colony forming units per ml. Figure 1 illustrates the Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen in axial (1a， 1c) and coronal (1b，1d) sections. A 1.9 cm impacted calculus at right PUJ (yellow arrow) was seen with moderate dilatation of the pelvicalyceal system . The right kidney also showed air pockets with air-fluid level in the lower pole renal parenchyma (blue arrow) . The left kidney was bulky and enlarged. A perinephric fluid collection of 200ml with the fluid tracking superiorly up to right subdiaphragmatic space and inferiorly along the right psoas muscle (orange arrow) was noted ， corresponding to class 3b of Huang and Tseng classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. A final diagnosis of Right Emphysematous Pyelonephritis and left acute Pyelonephritis was made. Prognostic scoring and risk stratification was done based on the Krishnamoorthy et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> scoring system and the combined prognostic score in our patient was 19 out of 26 (intermediate risk). After triaging the patient under the intermediate risk category， he was started on culture-sensitive antibiotics. After optimizing glycemic and serum electrolyte levels， he underwent right percutaneous drainage of the collection， ureteroscopy and disimpaction of the stone with bilateral double J stenting. After 6 weeks， he underwent the right percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Both stents were removed 2 weeks later.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\nEmphysematous pyelonephritis is the presence of free gas within the collecting system in the absence of prior surgical intervention， gastrointestinal fistula， or urinary bladder catheterization. In 1898， Kelly and Mccullum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> reported the first case of gas-forming renal infection. Initially， EPN was described as renal emphysema and pyelonephritis. In 1962， Schultz and Klorfein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> coined the term Emphysematous pyelonephritis， as it emphasizes the relationship between infective pathology and gas formation. If gas is in the collecting systems only， then it is termed as Emphysematous pyelitis. Emphysematous pyelitis has an excellent prognosis with medical management， whereas EPN deserves special attention because of its life-threatening potential with either medical management or surgical management. EPN is a severe form of pyelonephritis occurring mostly in diabetics caused most commonly by E. coli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. In|删除段之间换行|diabetics， elevated blood and tissue glucose levels may contribute to a conducive environment for the rapid multiplication of gas-forming bacteria. Diabetic microangiopathy causes a slowing down of transport and drainage of the catabolic waste products from the kidney， resulting in stasis or accumulation of such products within the renal parenchyma. This causes the accumulation of gas within the kidney and results in further deterioration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In obstructed system， entrapment of the formed gas occurs. Infected matrix stones with obstruction make the prognosis even worse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Obstruction to the urinary tract with infection is a deadly combination. Our patient has a calculus obstruction with superadded infection. EPN deserves special attention because of its life-threatening potential. The vital period of a window of curability is too short in such patients. Although cases of EPN are reported worldwide， Asians seem to be affected more， maybe because of a higher incidence of the diabetic population. However， Ubee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> correlates the higher number to the high number of published literature from Asia. The diagnosis of EPN is often delayed because the symptoms are often vague and nonspecific. Clinical features are often indistinguishable from severe APN. The onset of symptoms can be gradual and insidious over 2 to 3 weeks or may show a rapid deterioration. Patients whose initial presentation is shock， altered sensorium， hypoalbuminemia and coagulation abnormalities carry a poor prognosis. There should be a high index of alertness to make a prompt diagnosis， especially in non-resolving pyelonephritis. Axial imaging is mandatory to detect gas in the kidney， with a CT scan being one of the most reliable tools 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Until the late 1980s， the reported rate of mortality is 40% to 50% and emergency nephrectomy was the accepted treatment. Nowadays， improvements in diagnostic methods， increased awareness amongst the treating primary care physicians and availability of standardized protocols have largely tilted the management towards minimally invasive strategies like external and internal diversion of the kidney. Further， radiological classification by Huang et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> prognostic scoring systems by Jain et al. and Prakash et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> and risk stratification by Krishnamoorthy et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> have greatly increased chances of renal salvage in most cases通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. A combination of obstruction with infection in the setting of poor glycemic control makes this condition even more lethal and warrants immediate intervention.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Though uncommon， PJP complicating low-dose methotrexate therapy can occur due to the risk of myelosuppression.\n\n【2】Here we present a case of PJP in a 57-year-old man with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) treated with low-dose methotrexate and prednisolone for 11 years. Two years prior to hospital admission， he discontinued attendance at follow-up appointments and had been taking medications without surveillance. His symptoms consisted of fever， cough and dyspnea； with wide spread alveolar opacities and micronodules on chest radiograph，hypoxia， and severe pancytopenia. A severe folate deficiency was notable. Despite slight initial improvement， patient's respiratory status progressively declined following immune reconstitution. The diagnosis was confirmed by bronchoalveolar lavage on the eleventh day after admission. The patient fully recovered undertreatment with Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).\n\n【3】This case highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment of PJP in rheumatoid arthritis patients undergoing methotrexate regimens. An adequate folic acid supplementation and regular blood count monitoring may minimize this risk. Primary prophylaxis could be effective， preventing PJP in selected cases； further investigation is needed to assess the efficacy and safety of prophylaxis regimens.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia (PJP) is a fungal infection that most commonly affects the immunocompromised and， in some cases， can be life-threatening. Its incidence in people with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection has declined substantially thanks to the widespread use of prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy. Lately， PJP has been emerging as a serious problem among non-HIV immunocompromised patients， including those under antirheumatic immunosuppressive regimens. Methotrexate (MTX) is considered the first-line agent for most patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)， given its anti-inflammatory properties. MTX has also antiproliferative and toxic effects due to the inhibition of an enzyme involved in the metabolism of folic acid， dihydrofolate reductase. Myelosuppression and pancytopenia are the most common hematological toxicity， which can be minimized with folic acid supplementation. Although rare， severe myelosuppression can occur even with low dose MTX and facilitate the potential development of opportunistic infections， such as PJP.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\nA 57-year-old man with RA presented to our emergency department with a one-week history of productive cough， sneezing， progressive dyspnea， anorexia and abdominal pain. A 6-month history of unintentional weight loss of nearly 20 kg was also mentioned. Significant prior medical history included an ischemic cerebrovascular accident in 2005 (with mild dysarthria as sequela) and RA diagnosis in 2008. He was on a long-term treatment with MTX in a weekly oral dosage ranging between 15 mg to 20 mg， along with prednisolone 5mg id. Two years earlier， he discontinued attendance at follow-up appointments and had been taking both medications without surveillance. On physical examination， the patient appeared ill and underweight，had fever (38.3°C)， tachycardia(117 beats per minute) and tachypnea (28 cycles per minute)， with saturation of 89% on air. Breath sounds were decreased on the left lung base. The abdominal exam was notable for diffuse tenderness|删除段之间换行|to palpation.\n\n【8】A chest radiograph demonstrated widespread alveolar opacities and micronodules in the left mid lung zone . Blood analysis revealed severe pancytopenia： hemoglobin level 7.7 g/dl， total white blood count 0.58×10/uL (82.8% neutrophils， 13.8% lymphocytes，1.70% monocytes and 1.70% eosinophils) and platelet count 10.000/mm. C-reactive protein level was 20.5 mg/dL. Features of both hepatocellular and cholestatic injury were present. Neutrophil hyper segmentation was visible in blood smear， attributed to megaloblastic anemia secondary to severe folate deficiency (folic acid <2 ng/mL). Screening for influenza virus confirmed influenza virus type A. Therapeutic regimen was started with oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily along with empiric antibiotic coverage with piperacillin-tazobactam， admitting bacterial co-infection. MTX was immediately discontinued； folic acid supplementation and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were added to the therapeutic regimen，concerning MTX-related pancytopenia. Blood and urine culture samples were negative. Three negative sputum acid-fast bacillus smears ruled out pulmonary tuberculosis. Further research for opportunistic and atypical microorganisms， including HIV screening， were all negative.\n\n【9】Despite positive markers for RA， remaining autoimmune study was negative. The patient slowly improved over the course of the first week admission， with important immune system recovery. Chest computed tomography revealed widespread diffuse micronodules， resembling a miliary pattern， with a centrilobular distribution. On the tenth day of hospital admission， his respiratory status suddenly declined with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure， accompanied by a hyperinflammatory reaction. Radiography of the chest showed bilateral， diffuse interstitial infiltrates . He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics， meropenem and vancomycin， concerning nosocomial pneumonia. Cultures remained negative. Enhanced lung injury and respiratory decline following immune reconstitution in the setting of an immunosuppressed patient raised suspicion of PJP. Bronchoscopy was performed and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid identified nearly 20Pneumocystis jirovecii oocysts via indirect immunofluorescence staining.\n\n【10】The patient was successfully treated for PJP. He completed a 21-day course of Trimethoprim-Sulphamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) along with corticosteroid tapering strategy， with clinical and radiological improvement . Upon discharge， 5 mg/day prednisolone dose was maintained to control his symptoms of arthritis. No evidence of lung disease was found at 3-month and one-year post-discharge appointments.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Pneumocystis jirovecii is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that can cause a fulminating potentially life-threatening interstitial pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts. Lately， the incidence of PJP among non-HIV-infected patients is increasing with widespread use of chronic immunosuppressive regimens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Among immunosuppressive therapy，longterm moderate-to-high dosage of corticosteroids (>20 mg/day of prednisolone or equivalent for longer than 1 month) is the most commonly identifiable risk factor通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.Otherimmunosuppressive drugs，suchas MTX，are also associated with increased risk of developing PJP. MTX is an antimetabolite that interferes with the metabolism of folic acid， therefore inhibiting cellular proliferation. In addition to its antiproliferative effects， MTX has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties. In RA， MTX is used in long-term， low-dose regimens， ranging 7.5 mg to 25mg weekly. However， even at low doses， bone marrow suppression can occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， with low lymphocyte counts playing an important role 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Regular monitoring of CD4 cell counts in patients receiving cumulative MTX doses exceeding 400 mg has been suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Oral folic acid supplementation is also recommended as it may prevent MTX induced myelosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Total cumulative dosage of MTX used in our patient was extremely high， reaching nearly 10 g. Despite CD4 cell counts were not measured， an important lymphocytopenia (80 cells/ uL) was present at admission， suggesting a mechanism for the development of PJP. In addition， he had not been taking folic acid supplementation for a long time. Several other factors may have played a role in the development of PJP. The concomitant use of long-term low-dose systemic corticosteroids may have contributed to the reduction of CD4+ lymphocyte count and impaired cell-mediated immune activity. The development of PJP may have also been facilitated by a pre-existing lung disease， such as MTX-associated pneumonitis or RA-interstitial lung disease.\n\n【15】This case highlights the importance of considering PJP among patients receiving low-dose MTX therapy presenting with low respiratory tract symptoms， especially those with concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids. These patients should have their blood counts closely monitored for early recognition of hematological toxicity， including CD4 cells count. Primary prophylaxis could be effective in selected cases， based on patients’ risk factors for PJP.\n\n【16】However， to date， there are no consensual recommendations. Further investigation is needed to provide definitive guidelines regarding primary prophylaxis in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies for rheumatic diseases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In breast cancer， a defect in Homologous Recombination (HR) caused by germline BRCAI and BRCA2 (gBRCA1/2) variants is used in this context.

However， the clinical significance of PALB2 in breast cancer treatment remains unknown.\n\nPlatinum-based chemotherapy has been approved for treating Advanced Breast Cancer (ABC). Although carboplatin and cisplatin are major therapeutic agents in breast cancer， strong clinical evidence of their benefits compared with anthracycline or taxane does not exist. Recently，platinum-based chemotherapy has been suggested to offer responsiveness to treatment in patients with triple|删除段之间换行|showing multiple lymph nodes and bone metastasis (b).\n\n【9】negative breast cancer with the BRCA1/2 mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Therefore， platinum is preferred for managing triple-negative breast cancer with the BRCA1/2 mutation in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.\n\n【10】Generally， the response rate after the fourth treatment is ≤ 20%； thus， some physicians recommend palliative care in these cases.We present the case of a patient with hormone receptor-positive ABC without the BRCA1/2 variant but with a germline variant in PALB2who exhibited a dramatic response to carboplatin/gemcitabine after the ninth treatment.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\nIn March 2014， a 34-year-old woman was diagnosed with invasive cancer of the right breast. She underwent a lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. Pathological findings were an invasive tumor with a size of 1.6 cm (pT1c)， a positive Node(pN1a)， Estrogen Receptor (ER)-positive status (Allred score， 8)， Progesterone Receptor (PgR)-positive status (Allred score，6)，Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) -negative status (IHC0)， Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) of 2.05， Ki-67 index of 20%， and surgical margin-positive findings (DCIS). Adjuvant tamoxifen and an LH-RH agonist were administered and radiation therapy (whole breast with a boost to the tumor bed) was performed. In September 2017， distant liver， bone， and lymph node metastases were detected via Computed Tomography (CT) and Fluoro-D-Glucose Positron Emission Computed Tomography (FDG-PET)/CT ； therefore， treatment for the ABC was initiated. Tamoxifen was changed to fulvestrant， and the patient responded to this treatment for nine months. Subsequently， letrozole/palbociclib for four months， high-dose toremifene for one month， and S-1 for six months were used until disease progression. A repeat biopsy was performed on an iliac bone with metastases to assess drug sensitivity， and the results were ER-positive， PgR-negative， HER2 1+， and FISH2.3. According to these results， anti-HER2 therapy was expected to provide a response. Capecitabine/lapatinib for four months， docetaxel for six months， trastuzumab emtansine for two months， everolimus/exemestane for four months， and trastuzumab deruxtecan for four months were used. After eight therapies， the tumor occupied more than 50% of the liver and ascites increased， and the patient was hospitalized because of deterioration of her physical state (with|删除段之间换行|lower-limb edema).A1cfDNA-basedcomprehensivee：genomic profiling assay， FoundationOne Liquid (Foundation Medicine， Inc， USA)， was performed， and carboplatin (area under the curve of 2 on days 1 and 8) and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m' on days 1 and 8) were administered at a dose of 80%. The CEA and CA15-3 tumor marker levels decreased from 282 ng/ml to 108 mg/ml and from 810 U/ml to 278 U/ml，respectively， after four cycles， and abdominal bloating and lower-limb edema reduced dramatically. Surprisingly， the CT scan revealed that the liver tumor shrank to approximately 20% of its size observed before carboplatin and gemcitabine treatment， and ascites decreased . The genomic profiling assay revealed 11genomic variants with a valiant allele frequency of 0.19% to 78.4%. A high frequency of PALB2 suggested the germline variant， and we confirmed heterozygous c.1452delT  as a likely pathogenic variant using mutation-specific sequencing VistaSeqM(LabCorp， Inc， USA). The patient’s lower-limb edema completely disappeared， and she recovered enough to drive to the hospital by herself. The patient responded to gemcitabine/carboplatin for a total of eight cycles (6 months) until the liver metastases were observed to progress on CT scans. Subsequently， we expected a response to\n\n【13】Table 1： Detected variants on FoundationOne Liquid CDx.\n\n| Gene  | Variant  | VAF(%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ESR1  | L536R  | 0.38  |\n| ESR1  | V422cel  | 0.66  |\n| ESR1  | L536H  | 0.19  |\n| ESR1  | L536P  | 0.75  |\n| ESR1  | D538G  | 35.2  |\n| ESR1  | Y537S  | 0.44  |\n| PALB2  | L484fs\\1  | 78.4  |\n| FGFR2  | HTRA1-FGFR2 noncanonical fusion  | 0.15  |\n| PTEN  | Q110\\  | 34.2  |\n| SMAD4  | T192fs\\15  | 3.4  |\n| TP53  | R280T  | 0.67  |\n\nFoundationOne Liquid CDx revealed 11 variants and VAF in six genes.

Epirubicin/cyclophosphamide was administered for two months； however， unfortunately， the patient died at our hospital.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】The PALB2 protein is encoded by the PALB2 gene located on chromosome 16p12.2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. PALB2， which binds to BRCA2， is involved in the repair of DSBs via HR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13-16\\]</u>.Mono-allelic germline variants of BRCA2 and PALB2 predispose their carriers to breast cancer， and PALB2 germline variants increase the breast cancer risk by a factor of 9.47 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Momozawa et al. reported that PALB2germline pathogenic variants were detected in 0.4%(28/7051) of breast cancer patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The gene instability associated with BRCA pathogenic variants has been used for ABC treatment. The PARP inhibitor， Olaparib， was designed to exploit synthetic lethality. PARP binds to damaged DNA at SSBs and repairs the DNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，19\\]</u>. Once the DNA repair of SSBs is inhibited by the PARP inhibitor， tumor cells convert to HR. However， BRCA pathogenic variant cells are deficient in the function of HR； therefore， cell death is induced by synthetic lethality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. As stated above， BRCA and PALB are close in the mechanism of cell stability； thus， they were expected to be targets in cancer treatment. The randomized phase III OlympiAD trial has confirmed that Olaparib significantly prolongs Progression-Free Survival (PFS) by approximatelythree months in patients with breast cancer carrying germline pathogenic BRCA variants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Tung et al. reported Olaparib sensitivity in patients with germline PLB2-variant ABC (ORR： 82%； median PFS： 13.3 months) in a phase II study通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. These studies suggest that germline BRCA and PLB2 variants contribute to similar mechanisms of sensitivity to breast cance treatment. In patients with ovarian cancer， the randomized phase III SOLO1 trial has shown clinical benefits regarding PFS in those with germline pathogenic variants. Interestingly， the patient who exhibited a response after platinum-based chemotherapy responded to Olaparib. This trial suggested that platinum sensitivity is related to sensitivity to Olaparib. Poggio et al. reported that platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly increased the pCR rate in patients with triple-negative breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. However， a subgroup analysis of patients carrying BRCA variants did not show a significant difference. The significance of germline variants in breast cancer has been revealed gradually；e.g.，relationships such as\"BRCA and PALB2”\n\n【18】and “Olaparib and platinum-based chemotherapy.\" However， the role of PALB2 pathogenic variants as biomarkers of breast cancer is not fully understood. Recently， comprehensive genomic profiling assaying has become widely used in clinical settings. However， most genomic variants identified in that assay do not impact sensitivity to approved drugs or have evidence for breast cancer treatment. The PALB2 c.1451delT variant has been identified as a likely pathogenic variant according to the ClinVar database ； however，there is no evidence of an increased drug response among its carriers.\n\n【19】Generally， it is known that drug sensitivity drops to less than20% after resistance to three kinds of chemotherapy. In addition， platinum-based chemotherapy does not have significant evidence via some clinical studies； so， the NCCN guideline is preferred only for triple-negative (hormone receptor-negative and HER2-negative) and germline BRCA1/2 mutation breast cancer. In this case， to get a significant response though hormone receptor-positive and gth regimen was very rare case and it might suggest new findings of germline PALB2 variant as a biomarker of platinum-based chemotherapy sensitivity and adds new significance regarding the performance of genomic profiling assays in ABC.\n\n【20】In addition， we anticipated a response to Olaparib because a phase II study suggested a response in a patient with ABC who had the PALB2 variant；however， our patient was unable to obtain anyclinical benefit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Most patients in the phase II study were administered one regimen of Olaparib after chemotherapy. Therefore， we assumed that it might have used Olaparib a little too late. This case also suggests that a gene profiling assay and Olaparib therapy need to be performed early enough when the tumor cells are not yet multidrug-resistant and the tumor is smaller.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】The therapeutic significance of genomic variants in cancer cellshas been revealed gradually. In breast cancer， germline BRCA pathogenic variants alone can affect clinical outcomes. However， genomic profiling assaying has been used widely in many types of cancers， several of which do not have sufficient evidence for selecting drugs. In conclusion， a dramatic response to the ninth treatment course，as in the present case， is rare； therefore，the germline PALB2 variant may be a sensitive biomarker of platinum-based chemotherapy in breast cancer. To establish the hypothesis， the accumulation of genomic data via genomic profiling assays and real-world data in response to platinum-based chemotherapy are needed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Since multiple pathologies can be found in these types of patients， they may resemble a coagulopathy or infectious etiology. It is imperative to avoid diagnostic and treatment delays to avoid morbidity and mortality by exploring serum viscosity and obtaining biopsies of any lesions that may be present when hyperviscosity syndrome is on the differential. Unfortunately， in this patient， this discovery was too late， and he continued to deteriorate. He was found to have multiorgan failure and was transferred to comfort care.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Hyperviscosity syndrome is a complication of monoclonal and polyclonal disorders associated with increased serum protein content such as plasma cells in Multiple Myeloma (MM)， and white blood cells in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia， and immunoglobulins in cryoglobulinemia. Classic hyperviscosity syndrome presents with the triad of easy bruising/bleeding， visual disturbances， and neurological deficits. The increase in viscosity results in decreased circulation and hypoperfusion which can result in devastating sequela 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. We report a case of multiorgan system failure in a patient with MM with type I cryoglobulinemia causing hyperviscosity syndrome.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】An 80-year-old male with a past medical history of multiple myeloma status post-chemotherapy， presented with pancytopenia， sepsis secondary to Methicillin-Susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia of unknown source， and multiple purpuric rashes of the lower extremities. The hospital course was complicated by worsening sepsis and acute kidney and liver failure. He was intubated due to worsening encephalopathy and hypoxia. Renal replacement therapy was initiated. Work up was negative for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and haptoglobin level was normal. Brain imagining was negative for acute changes. A transesophageal echocardiogram was negative for cardiac vegetations. Serum viscosity was elevated to 2.06 (Normal： 1.4-1.8). Serum was positive for Type I cryoglobulin. A skin biopsy showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis with intravascular deposits consistent with cryoglobulinemia. Due to the patients severe symptomatic cryoglobulinemia with multiorgan failure， Total Plasma Exchange (TPE) was initiated. Skin lesions progressed into significant excoriations and large ulcerations with persistent bacteremia. Despite multiple sessions of TPE and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy， he continued to deteriorate. The family decided to transition him to comfort care.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Hyperviscosity efficacy syndrome is a hematological and oncological emergency caused by elevated blood viscosity resulting from an increase in serum proteins， red blood cells， white blood cells， platelets， or abnormally shaped cells. This reduced flow can have dangerous consequences throughout the body including hypertension， abnormal bleeding， sepsis， visual and auditory deficits， and organ failure due to hypoperfusion and cell aggregation.\n\nHyperviscosity is a complication of disorders associated with increased serum protein|删除段之间换行|content such as in Multiple Myeloma (MM)， Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia， and cryoglobulinemia or cell deformity as seen in Sickle cell disease and spherocytosis. Hyperviscosity is symptomatic in about 10% to 30% of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia cases， however， is a rare occurrence in MM reported in only 2% to 6% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> .\n\nA small subset of MM cases are associated with cryoglobulins， in particular， type I which are made of a specific immunoglobulin. Cryoglobulinemia is a form of life-threatening vasculitis with the presence of abnormal proteins that precipitate in cold temperatures|删除段之间换行|or at room temperature in high quantities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It may manifest as skin lesions in 50% of cases  and neurologic and renal involvements in 47% and 30% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. Asymptomatic cryoglobulinemia doesnt warrant treatment， however， ir symptomatic patients，treatment with immunosuppression should be initiated promptly and be directed against the underlying disorder.\n\n【10】Th i e e pathogenesis process ooffcryoprecipitationis Iot completely understood， however， differs depending on the type of cryoglobulinemia. Type II and III cryoglobulinemia involves the formation of immune complexes between the crystallizable Fc portion ofthe polyclonal IgG and IgM (rarely IgG or IgA) rheumatoid factors. Type I， on the other hand， the monoclonal component undergoes crystallization and aggregation due to temperature and concentration changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This can lead to small blood vessel occlusion without much inflammatory response .\n\n【11】Diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia is typically made clinically with the presence of cryoglobulins in the serum. When detected， measurement of the relative volume of the precipitate to total serum volume should be recorded as the cryocrit which will correlate with symptomatic disease. However， there is a poor correlation between cryocrit and the response to treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Monitoring cryocrit during TPE might， however， help assess the response to therapy and determine the length of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. There is controversy over whether whole blood viscosity or serum viscosity should be used for definitive diagnosis， but most clinical laboratories measure the viscosity of the serum component of blood. Viscosity is measured in the unit of centipoise (cp). The normal range of serum viscosity can be from 1.4 cp to 1.8 cp， with water being 1.0 cp.\n\nIn a study with eighty-six patients with cryoglobulinemia who underwent repeated clinical evaluation during the course of their|删除段之间换行|disease， 10% had acute and severe symptoms which necessitated emergency treatment with plasmapheresisand chemotherapy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. According to the recent guideline， TPE is listed as a Category II， grade 2A recommendation for the treatment of symptomatic cryoglobulinemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Treatment plans differ between infectious causes such as HCV versus noninfectious. Due to the rarity of noninfectious cryoglobulinemia，treatmentdataislimited.Treatmentofsymptomatic hyperviscosity does warrant TPE but should always parallel therapy targeting the underlying disease. It becomes difficult to design a treatment plan due totheheterogenicnature of the disease. The NCCN guidelines for patients with MM recommend induction therapy with Bortezomib，lenalidomide， and dexamethasone (category 1) regimen with the combination of bone-targeted treatment (bisphosphonates or denosumab). Patients with severe manifestations such as RPGN or GI ischemia need urgent intervention to suppress immune complex formation which is accomplished with Immunosuppressive Therapy(IST) as well. IST is primarily based on high-dose corticosteroids， cyclophosphamide， rituximab， and plasmapheresis .\n\nIt is also imperative to educate patients on avoiding exposure to cold temperatures by wearing warm clothes in air-conditioned facilities， gloves outside， and relocating to a warmer climate during the winter months. Foot and leg care is important to prevent wound complications. Checking the feet every day， wearing shoes and socks|删除段之间换行|at all times， and trimming toenails with care should be incorporated通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】In summary， type I cryoglobulinemia associated with MM is only rarely reported. Treatment recommendations include plasmapheresis and treatment of the underlying myeloma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Prognosis will depend on the underlying disease. It is important to note that diagnostic delays can result in severe manifestations and multiple organ damage which would increase the mortality rate. Treatment approaches for severe type I cryoglobulinemia should involve plasmapheresis and include specific MM treatments to be introduced at an early stage to avoid cryoglobulinemia relapse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.

In this study， we focused on the prevalence of autoimmune diseases among Moyamoya with co-existing diseases. We attempted to investigate the epidemiological features of autoimmune diseases in Moyamoya disease patients in central China to further understand the pathogenesis of Moyamoya disease.\n\n【9】Materials and Methods\n\nA retrospective hospital discharge data was reviewed on patients who met inclusion criteria. A search of clinical database was performed for patients seen at our institution from January2017 to July 2023， with the diagnosis of Moyamoya disease based on the guidelines set by the Research Committee on MMD of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This study|删除段之间换行|also received approval from the local medical ethics committee and every participant signed the informed consent form. The prevalence of comorbidity was compared with that of the general population in China， according to national statistics.\n\n【11】Definition of autoimm une disease\n\n【12】Autoimmune disease was identified according to ICD-9and ICD-10 coding. For autoimmune thyroid disease， patients were required to both have a diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves'disease and have previously documented elevated thyroid antibody studies. Individuals with abnormal thyroid autoantibodies and no autoimmune diagnosis were not considered to have autoimmune disease. A thyroid level (TSH and free/total T4) were not verified，nor was therapeutic intervention. Autoimmune disease in first-degree relatives was obtained solely from clinical documentation review and required a biological parent with a documented autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disease of any other kind was identified as well as according to ICD-10 coding.\n\n【13】Statistical analysis\n\n【14】IBM SPSS 26.0. (Chicago，IL， USA) was used to analyze statistical data. Mean， median and Standard Deviation (SD) was used to indicate frequency. Continuous variables were compared employing Xtest or Fisher exact test among groups， and Statistical differences were identified significant with a P value <0.05.\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】Basic clinical features\n\n【17】Three hundred and twelve people were included in the study. Gender was predominantly female (65.1%，n=202). The median age at onset was 32 years (from 5 to 65 years). Incidence rates varied with age， with two peaks， at ages 5 to 10 and 35 to 50 years. The female-to-male was 1.9 to 1. 8 pairs of patients had a family history of Moyamoya disease (mother-daughter). 82.1%(256/312) of patients were diagnosed with bilateral Moyamoya disease (definite cases)， and 17.9% (56/312) of patients with lateral Moyamoya disease at diagnosis.\n\n【18】The first symptoms on admission of patients mainly include the following： TIA in 88 (28.2%)， cerebral infarction in 68 (21.8%)， headache or dizziness in 46 (14.7%)， hemorrhage in 33 (10.6%)， memory deterioration in 18 (5.8%)， cognition impairment in 19(6.1%)，and asymptomatic patients comprised 40 (12.8%) of the total number of patients. Clinical characteristics of patients were shown in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n【19】Risk factors for cerebrovascular events\n\n【20】Cerebrovascular risk factors are shown in Table删除4:<u> 2</u>. We found that14.4%(45/312) of patients were current or former smokers， 20.8%(65/312) had hypertension， 19.6%(61/312) had hyperlipidemia， and6.4%(20/312) had type 2 diabetes. The cerebrovascular risk factors were compared with the prevalence rate of Chinese population. The prevalence of hyperlipidemia in our cohort did not differ significantly compared to the general population in China. At the same time， the study did not find significant differences between hypertensive patients and smokers.\n\n【21】Autoimmune disease\n\n【22】Previous studies have suggested that an abnormal autoimmune is a potential causative factor for Moyamoya disease. In this study， we focused on the prevalence of autoimmune diseases among\n\n【23】Table 1： Characteristics and presentation of Moyamoya disease patients in population of Central China.\n\n| Clinical features and presentation of Moyamoya disease patients  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Sex  | N=312(%)  |\n| Female  | 213(68.3)  |\n| Male  | 99(31.7)  |\n| Average age at presentation  | 33.5±16.2 (years)  |\n| Race/ethnicity  |  |\n| Han  | 298(95.5)  |\n| Tujia  | 5(1.6)  |\n| Miao  | 3(0.9)  |\n| Manchu  | 2(0.6)  |\n| Other  | 4(1.3)  |\n| Type (laterality)  |  |\n| Unilateral  | 53(17.0)  |\n| Bilateral  | 259(83.0)  |\n| Presentation  |  |\n| TIA  | 88(28.2)  |\n| Intarction  | 68(21.8)  |\n| Headache or dizziness  | 46(14.7)  |\n| Hemorrhage  | 33(10.6)  |\n| Memory deterioration  | 18(5.8)  |\n| Cognitive impairment  | 19(6.1)  |\n| Asymptomatic  | 40(12.8)  |\n\n【25】ICA： Indicates Internal Carotid Artery； MCA： Middle Cerebral Artery； TIA Transient Ischemic Attack\n\n【26】Moyamoya with co-existing diseases. We found high rates of type 1diabetes mellitus (immune-mediated disease) and Graves disease in our cohort . Type 1 diabetes mellitus was found in 18 (5.8%) patients， significantly higher comparing with the Chinese general population (P<0.001， 5.8% vs. 1.3%，xtest) . The prevalence rate of Graves’disease (20/312) in Central Chinese population was significantly higher than that in Chinese general population (P<0.001，6.4% vs. 0.34%， x\"test). The prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis was not significantly different than in the Chinese general population(P=0.112， 5.5% vs. 1.5%，x’ test). Other autoimmune diseases included systemic lupus erythematosus (3 cases). Fifteen patients(13.9%) had various autoimmune diseases， significantly higher than the estimated prevalence of autoimmune diseases in the Chinese general population of 2.4% (P<0.001，13.9% vs. 2.4%， x’test).Overall， autoimmune disease was associated with Movamova disease in 68 out of 312 (21.8%) patients . In addition， a higher proportion of women suffer from autoimmune diseases (F：M ratio=213：99，2.15：1).\n\n【27】Discussion\n\nMoyamoya has been described in all races and ethnicities around the worldwide， with existing differences of race and region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-8\\]</u>.

The prevalence of MMD was significantly higher； especially type 1 diabetes and Graves’ disease. The epidemic proportion of overall autoimmune diseases in MMD was up to 21.8%， which was similar to the results of previous studies in other regions. The findings further demonstrated the close correlation between MMD and autoimmune diseases. It is worth noting that autoimmune abnormalities may be related to Moyamoya disease， which suggested abnormal autoimmune mechanism may be a potential factor of Moyamoya disease.\n\n【32】Previous studies have indicated multiple autoimmune diseases associated MMD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6，9，16\\]</u>.Moreover， several studies indicated that the disease progress course in MMD is associated with the presence of thyroid autoantibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，17，18\\]</u>. Multiple intracranial arterial stenoses and Graves' disease may occur simultaneously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，9，16\\]</u>. In this idiopathic MMD study， prevalence of autoimmune disease was roughly 21.8%， which is similar to other reported prevalence in MMD patients which ranged from 14% to 33%. Literature on autoimmune disease in pediatric-onset MMD is much sparser and mainly smaller case series. This hypothesis may be supported by several reports that other autoimmune disorders， such as systemic lupus erythematosus， type 1 diabetes， and antiphospholipid syndrome， were reported to be associated with Moyamoya syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6，9，16\\]</u>.\n\nIn this study， prevalence of total autoimmune thyroid disease(Graves’disease andthyroiditis) was significantly higher in this cohort study than in the Chinese general population. The positive correlation between the levels of free thyroxine and both homocysteine and methylmalonic acid suggested that thyrotoxicosis may induce intracranial artery vessel changes in MMD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，16-18\\]</u>. Because hyperthyroxinemia above physiological dose has been implicated in patients with ischemic stroke and lacunar infarction， this would be an important factor in the pathophysiology of Moyamoya angiopathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6，9，19\\]</u>. Therefore， we considered that the vessel changes in the present case are due to an autoimmune-mediated mechanism， including other autoimmune disorders， or are a mere coincidence， and that the symptoms occurred because of the progression of the vessel changes. Previous studies have suggested that vasculitis caused by antithyroid drugs may be related to changes in intracranial arteries. Propylthiouracil has been reported to cause vasculitis in patients with hyperthyroidism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The possibility of a mere coincidence of Graves’ disease and these vascular changes should also be considered. The cerebral hemodynamic changes|删除段之间换行|caused by thyrotoxicosis are thought to be the cause of infarction通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.In a thyrotoxic state， excessive production of thyroid hormones is thought to increase brain metabolism and oxygen consumption， leading to brain perfusion injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，19\\]</u>. Due to the reduced cerebral perfusion reserve capacity of Moyamoya disease， cerebral perfusion injury is thought to occur more frequently in this condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，9，19\\]</u>. In addition， it has been reported that induced hypercoagulability during thyrotoxicosis may influence ischemic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. These factors may explain why the patients reviewed tended to experience ischemic events rather than hemorrhagic events. The possibility of thyrotoxicosis should be considered in patients with Graves disease when cerebral ischemia symptoms increase during follow-up.\n\n【34】This study has several limitations due to the single medical center. In addition， the sensitivity and specificity of the ICD code for identifying Moyamoya and autoimmune disease are unknown. Despite these limitations， our results only represent the prevalence of autoimmune disease in Movamova disease from the population composition of central China.

The physical examination revealed a palpable mass at the right lobe of the thyroid gland without any palpable cervical lymph nodes. All the laboratory tests including the thyroid hormones were normal.\n\nThe ultrasound (US) revealed a 33 x 20 mm hypoechoic nodule on the right lobe of the thyroid gland without any cervical lymph node enlargement. There were some other nodules with a variety|删除段之间换行|of dimensions on the left lobe suggesting a multinodular goitre.\n\n【12】FNAB was performed from the dominant nodule with the guidance of US. The FNAB was efficient with enough amount of glands.\n\n【13】In the cytopathology report there was a suspicion of neuro-endocrine tumor.These findings were explained to the patient， her consent was taken and a Total Thyroidectomy (TT) was planned due to suspicious FNAB report and multinoduler goitre.\n\n【14】In the operation the nodule was found to be fixed to the adjacent trachea. During the dissection on the trachea of the right thyroidlobe， a laceration of the trachea happened. Perioperative Ear Nose Throat(ENT) consultation was done and the defect was primarily repaired by the surgical team. Both recurrent nerves were seen and preserved and TT was completed.\n\n【15】In the final histopathology report； grossly the tumor was found to be emerging from the thyroid gland. It was ill defined. On the cut section， it was red-brown in color and soft in consistency， size was 3.0x2.5x2.0 cm.\n\n【16】Histologic sections were prepared from routinely fixed paraffin-embedded tissue， cut at 3 to 4um.

The patient is still being followed up in 6 months periods and using 100 mcg./day L-thyroxin PO.\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】Although the TP accounts for the 0.1 % of all the thyroid neoplasms， this tumor must be remembered in the differential diagnosis of the thyroid cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The FNAB cannot be diagnostic in all cases preoperatively but sometimes like in our case may give an idea about the suspicion of a TP. Generally final pathology reports after the resection of the tumor will give the definitive diagnosis. For the accurate diagnosis of the pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas， both pathologists and the clinicians must communicate properly. The importance of this multidisciplinary approach has been popularized in recent studies. Also an algorithm has been designed for the diagnosis of these cases通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The paragangliomas can rarely be diagnosed by the radiologic investigations and even diagnosis is difficult after the FNAB of the nodule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. They can be easily be confused with the other thyroid malignancies.\n\nThe diagnose frequently cannot be made during the surgery with frozen sections and the differential diagnosis includes primarily the medullary thyroid cancer and the other types of thyroid cancers. Only 1 of the frozen sections performed in 22 patients made the paraganglioma diagnosis.

The Chromogranin A， NSE， Synaptophysin and S-100 will demonstrate the staining around the Sustantacular cells. The S-100 staining however is not to specific for the paragangliomas. It can be seen in the Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC) too. Thus makes the diagnosis complex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In this case， paraganglioma presented as a mass located within the thyroid gland. When present in such location， the main differential diagnosis was MTC. On histologic examination， TP and MTC may show similar microscopic features， with nesting. The co-expression of neuroendocrine markers makes the distinction far more complicated. MTC originates in the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid gland. Therefore， MTC is characterized by positive staining with Calcitonin. The positivity of epithelial markers and lack of S-100 positive sustantecular cells also facilitate the differential diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，12-14\\]</u>.\n\n【28】They have a high tendency to invade (in two out of three cases) adjacent structures like； trachea， recurrent nerves and vascular structures.

The tumor was strictly attached to the tracheal cartilages but any tracheal resection was not performed in our patient.\n\n【29】The genetic mutations are reported in about %10 of the paragangliomas. It is recommended to screen the patients for the succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB)， C(SDHC)，D (SDHD) or SDH assembly factor 2 (SDHAF2) gene mutations. Especially it is known that the SDHB mutation is important in diagnosing the malignant paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. We did not perform a genetic screening.\n\n【30】In the literature there is no reported case of metastatic or catecholamine producing thyroid paraganglioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. But still it is advised to follow up those patients for the risk of metastasis and catecholamine production 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Screening of the patient 29 months after the surgerywas performed and no metastasis or local recurrences were seen in the ultrasound and PET scan (F-18FDG). Serum and 24hours urine tests were normal for the catecholamine and degradation products.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n\n【32】TP must be consideredin differential diagnosis of the neuroendocrine tumors of the thyroid. FNAB is helpful but not always diagnostic for a neuroendocrine tumor. Generally they are local invasive to the adjacent structures. Extensive resection and close follow up is the treatment of choice because their malignancypotential is still not exactly known.

Paraneoplastic disease with central nervous system involvement is a rare complication. Immunosuppression for the paraneoplastic features and chemotherapy for the underlying malignancy are described treatments but benefits are often short-lived because of co-morbid complications and disease resistance. This report describes a case of relapsed MCL with a rapidly progressing， motor-dominant，paraneoplastic polyneuropathy treated with immunosuppression and ibrutinib， an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Ibrutinib was well tolerated and led to a partial remission comparable in duration with that achieved by more toxic chemotherapeutic regimens， which are often difficult to deliver in this context. Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are rare but recognized complications of mantle cell lymphoma which are important to diagnose because treating the underlying disease is an essential component of therapy. This report demonstrates that ibrutinib is a safe and effective therapeutic option.\n\n【2】Keywords： Ibrutinib； Mantle cell lymphoma； Centralnervous system； Paraneoplastic syndrome； Anti-ganglioside antibodies\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)， genetically characterized by the t (11；14) chromosomal translocation resulting in over-expression of cyclin D通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and deregulation of the cell cycle删除4-1:<u>1</u>. It accounts for 4-10% of NHL with a median age at diagnosis of 68 years and an approximate 2：1 propensity for older males 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. It often presents at a late stage and is generally regarded as incurable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Median overall survival varies from 2 to 12 years and depends on several factors， including patient fitness for intensive therapy and disease features， such as the presence of blastoid histology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. Extra-nodal involvement is common： patients often present with blood， bone marrow and gastrointestinal infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，7，8\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Sensory， motor and autonomic neuropathies are a recognized complication of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma through a variety of mechanisms： leptomeningeal and parenchymal infiltration of the nervous system； metabolic disturbance； infection； complications of therapy and paraneoplastic syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-12\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are probably caused by immune mechanisms directed against self-antigens normally present in the central nervous system being ectopically expressed by the tumour (onconeural antigens). By definition， PNS occur in the absence of metastasis to or infiltration of the nervous system； known indirect toxic effect； ectopic secretion of hormones or induced coagulopathies. The frequency of PNS is low， occurring in <1% of patients with solid tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. They are rare in NHL but important to diagnose because treatment of the underlying tumour is an important initial step in their management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14-16\\]</u>.\n\n【7】There have been several reports ofparaneoplastic neuropathies associated with immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against the disialosyl gangliosides， including CANOMAD syndrome (Chronic Ataxic Neuropathy， Opthalmoplegia， Monoclonal IgM protein， cold Agglutinins and Disialosyl antibodies) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17-23\\]</u>. They are usually treated with a combination of plasma exchange (PEX) and immunosuppression in the form of corticosteroids， intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or rituximab.\n\n【8】This article describes a rapidly progressing， motor-dominant polyneuropathy with IgM anti-ganglioside antibodies associated with relapsing MCL and its successful treatment with the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor， ibrutinib.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 59 year old Caucasian male with a history of MCL treated four years previously with cytarabine-based chemotherapy followed by a reduced intensity， sibling-donor allogeneic stem-cell transplant， presented to a late-effects clinic with a four week history of dizzy spells. There was no previous history of neurological disorders. Clinical examination was unremarkable. A full blood count revealed a mild lymphocytosis (5.1x109/L) with a population of blastoid lymphocytes on the blood smear. Immuno phenotyping of these cells demonstrated a MCL phenotype (CD5+； CD19+； CD79a+； FMC7+； CD20/22+； CD23-). Renal and liver biochemistry， including serum B12， folate and ferritin assays were normal. A diagnosis of relapsed MCL was made.\n\n【11】Over three weeks，progressive neurological deterioration occurred with ataxia， diplopia， symmetrical paraesthesia and weakness in the upper and lower limbs together with worsening pharyngeal dysphagia. Cranial nerve examination revealed globally reduced eye movements and a left VII lower motor neuron weakness. Fundoscopy was unremarkable. There was bilateral nystagmus and finger-nose ataxia. Power was reduced in a pyramidal distribution in the upper and lower limbs， tone was globally reduced. Reflexes and plantar responses were absent and sensation to light-touch and vibration was reduced in the limbs in a glove and stocking distribution to the level of the hips and shoulders. Cardio-respiratory examination was unremarkable and there was no clinical evidence oflymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.\n\n【12】Contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) of the head， neck， thorax， abdomen and pelvis revealed low volume， mediastinal lymphadenopathy consistent with MCL. Magnetic-resonance imaging(MRI) with contrast of the brain and spinal cord demonstrated no focal parenchymal or leptomeningeallesion.\n\n【13】Examination ofccerebrospinalfluidd(CSF) revealedscant lymphoid cells with a mature T-cell immunophenotype (CD5positive； CD19， CD10， CD23 and FMC7 negative) but no malignant clonal population was detected. CSF protein was raised at 1.03g/L(0.15-0.45g/L) and glucose was normal at 3.7mM/L. Paired CSF and serum oligoclonal bands were identical. Nerve conduction and electromyographic (EMG) studies demonstrated severe， axonal， motor and sensory loss in the distal nerve segments of the limbs and active denervation and loss of motor units， consistent with a sensorimotor axonal neuropathy.\n\n【14】Other investigation revealed normal thyroid function， normal creatinine kinase and HbAlc levels. Anti-nuclear antibodies(ANA)， anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA and cANCA)，HIV and syphilis serology were all negative. Serum immunoglobulins were unremarkable with no evidence of a monoclonal band. An extensive search for an infectious etiology was unproductive and there were no constitutional signs to support infection. Serum complement C3and C4 were within normal range. A bone marrow biopsy was not performed.\n\n【15】Serum antiganglioside antibodies were positive for GD1a， GD1b and GQ1b IgM (levels >1/1000 (normal =<1/500))； GM1， GM2， GD1a， GD1b，GQ1b IgG，IgM GMl and IgM GM2 were negative.\n\n【16】On the basis of these results， a diagnosis of relapsed MCL with a paraneoplastic， motor-dominant polyneuropathy due to anti-ganglioside，onconeural antibodies was made.\n\n【17】Results\n\n【18】Initially， the patient required intensive supportive care in bed， including physiotherapy and nutritional support via a nasogastric feeding tube. Treatment for relapsed MCL was commenced with ibrutinib (560mg q.d. given via a nasogastric tube). In addition， one pulse of intravenous methylprednisolone (100mg q.d. for three days) and one course of intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4g per kilogram per day for five days) were given. After an initial improvement in neurological function，Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus， which were undetected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at presentation， reactivated and were treated successfully with rituximab (375mg/m2once weekly for four weeks by intravenous infusion) and intravenous ganciclovir.\n\n【19】Over several weeks， a global improvement in power was observed and the patient was discharged from hospital， walking with the aid of a stick. He achieved a partial remission with the use of single agent ibrutinib (560mg q.d.)， but after 4 months， developed a rapid neurological relapse with lymphocytosis and died shortly afterwards.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】In this case， the differential diagnoses included a paraneoplastic polyneuropathy secondary to MCL； leptomeningeal iinfiltration of MCL； a late infectious complication of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation and， given the presence of anti-ganglioside antibodies， CANOMAD syndrome. CANOMAD syndrome is a rare， immune-mediated， demyelinating poly neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17-19\\]</u>. The clinical features include a chronic or sub acute neuropathy with marked sensory ataxia and are flexia， typically with relatively preserved motor function. Occulo motor and bulbar motor palsies may also be present either as fixed or relapsing-remitting features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24，25\\]</u>. Electrophysiological and nerve conduction studies demonstrate demyelinating and axonal neuropathies and immunological assays almost always detect the presence of a paraprotein together with anti-GQ1b and anti-disialosyl antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Inflammatory peripheral neuropathies， paraneoplastic neuropathies and chronic Miller-Fisher syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis as they may also feature demyelination due to an autoimmune or paraneoplastic process. Treatment responses have been reported with the use of intravenous immunoglobulin， rituximab and plasma exchange in some cases although response duration is often brief删除4-1:<u>20，27</u>.\n\n【22】Although， in this case， the positive GD1a， GD1b and GQ1b IgM assay together with ataxia and opthalmoplegia were consistent with CANOMAD syndrome， the balance of opinion was against this for several reasons. Firstly， the onset and progression were more acute than the classical， slowly progressing disorder with relapsing and remitting symptoms and a mean duration of 13 years. Secondly， a loss of motor function， not dyskinaesthesia， was the prominent clinical feature， which is not typical for CANOMAD. Finally， the lack of detectable paraprotein was also against the diagnosis.\n\nRelapsed MCL with leptomeningeal infiltration was also a possible explanation. Central nervous system infiltration has a crude incidence of approximately 1% at diagnosis and 4 to 20% overall in MCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28-32\\]</u>.Weakness， confusion， ocular disturbance andheadache are the most common presenting features and CSF cytology or flow cytometry are often but not always positive， even when specific radiographic lesions are present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29，30\\]</u>. Leptomeningeal disease(positive cytology with normal neuro-radiological imaging) is more|删除段之间换行|frequent than parenchymal disease in MCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.Although CNS MCL was suspected in this case， it was not possible to prove this from CSF analysis or neuro-radiological imaging.\n\n【24】A late complication ofallogeneic transplantation such as infection were considered unlikely in the absence of a detectable infectious agent； a lack of constitutional upset and the patient's subsequent improvement with immunosuppression.\n\n【25】The most likely diagnosis wastherefore a paraneoplastic， motor-dominantpolyneuropathy due tO anti-ganglioside， onconeural antibodies associated with relapsed MCL. Previously described treatments for PNS， including plasma-exchange and immunosuppression， have historically yielded only short-lived responses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，33\\]</u>. Furthermore， chemo-immunotherapy to treat the underlying malignancy is often difficult or inappropriate to deliver in this context because of co-existing morbidity or typically poor performance status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.\n\n【26】In this case， although multiple immunomodulatory therapies， including rituximab， were initiated， an objective improvement was first observed on initiation of ibrutinib and before rituximab therapy.\n\n【27】Ibrutinib is an orally active， irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase， an intracellular protein downstream of the B cell receptor (BCR) responsible for regulation of cell-signalling， proliferation， migration and homing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. It has been shown to have potent activity against a number of B-cell malignancies， particularly chronic lymphocytic leukaemia， Waldenstroms macroglobulinemia and MCL \\[351.Ibrutinib is veryeffective and well tolerated in relapsed/refractory MCL with an overall response rate of 68% as a single agent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. It has also been proven to penetrate the CNS at clinically effective levels using a standard therapeutic oral dose and recent studies have yielded encouraging results in the treatment of MCL with CNS relapse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37，38\\]</u>. The safety and efficacy of ibrutinib has not been previously evaluated in this context， although the suppression of onconeural antibody secretion by neoplastic B-lymphocytes is a plausible mechanism of action.\n\n【28】As this case demonstrates， ibrutinib is well tolerated， even in patients with significant co morbidities and can be administered via a feeding tube. It was therefore a rational choice of therapy in this case and led to remission duration comparable with more intensive therapies sometimes used in MCL with CNS involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】Paraneoplastic neurological disease is a rare complication of MCL and can be associated with anti-ganglioside antibodies as described in this case. Ibrutinib， in association with immunosuppressive therapy for paraneoplastic complications， is a safe and effective therapeutic option in the context of relapsed MCL with significant co-existing morbidities.\n\n【31】Disclosure\n\n【32】DT， PM， and HH have no conflicts of interest to declare.

The MR entography findings were several stenosis of the terminal ileum with up-stream dilatations and3 foreign bodies inside . Routine blood examination revealed chronic anemia and ipoalbuminemia.\n\n【15】A multidisciplinary evaluation suggested to surgically explore the patient. At laparotomy we found 4 stenosis in the distal ileus inside the Michelassi's strictureplasty (1 at the inlet， 2 in the middle and 1 at the outlet just beside the ileocecal anastomosis). Three foreign bodies were found between the stenosis. We performed 2 enterotomies to remove the bodies， which appeared to be bezoars， probably developed between the stenosis for the stasis due to the bowel obstruction . Through the same enterotomies we performed 2 strictureplasties according to Heineke-Mikulicz technique for the stenosis at the inlet and at the outlet of the stricturoplasty. The 2 stenosis in the middle were treated by a strictureplasty according to Finney technique. The Heineke-Mikulicz stricturoplasties were done by a 2 layer non-continuous suture (PDS 4/0).

The increased risk of CVD and T2D in an individual with MetS is proposed to be at least partially related to chronic low-grade inflammation that is reflected by increased serum High-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (Hs-CRP)level. We aimed to investigate the relationship between serum hs-CRP and MetS.\n\n【2】Methods： Nine hundred eighty-eight school girls (mean age 14.56±1.53 years) were recruited using random cluster sampling. Demographic information was collected by questionnaire. Biochemical and anthropometric measures were estimated by standard routine procedures. The IDF， NCEP-ATPIII， and two modified NCEP (Cook and DeFerranti) were used for metabolic syndrome diagnosis.\n\n【3】Results and Conclusion： Our findings show that hs-CRP was associated with WC， elevated serum triglyceride and low HDL in adolescent school girls； but the association with serum HDL was weak. We found no correlation between hs-CRP and blood pressure and FBG. For all definitions of MetS， the prevalence of MetS in a high-risk group of hs-CRP (>3 mg/L) was higher than other groups except when using the DeFerrant definition. Logistic regression revealed that the highest and lowest ORs (CI 95%) were in the Cook (1.410(1.22-1.63)) and DeFerranti (1.228(1.14-1.43)) definitions of MetS， respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were： 68.29% to 82.61% and 64.68% to 65.90% for serum hs-CRP using the different definitions， respectively. In ROC analysis， the AUC for different definitions varied between 0.649 to 0.788 and serumhs-CRP cutoff value for all definitions was >1.33mg/L. In conclusion， serum hs-CRP， an inflammatory marker， may be of useful in the diagnosis of MetS in girls； but not reliable.\n\n【4】Keywords： Metabolic syndrome； Pediatrics； Hs-CRP； Low-grade chronic Inflammation； Biomarker； Pro-inflammatory factors\n\n【5】Introduction\n\nCardiovascular Disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality globally. The increasing prevalence of obesity and obesity-related condition such as Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is associated with a high risk of CVD mortality and morbidity. Hypertension， life style， smoking， obesity and obesity-related disorder including hyperlipidemia， Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and MetS are identified as a risk factor for CVD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. MetS comprises a cluster of several metabolic risk factors including central obesity， dyslipidemia， elevated blood pressure， high fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance that are associated with increased susceptibility to CVD and all-cause mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-9\\]</u>. The high|删除段之间换行|risk of CVD and T2D in individuals with MetS， may be associated with a chronic low-grade state of inflammation that is reflected in an increased serum high sensitivity C Reactive Protein (Hs-CRP). Serum hs-CRP is a biomarker of low-grade inflammation. Increased serum hs-CRP is observed in individuals with MetS patients， and is also associated with CVD and T2D risk \\[10-171.\n\n【7】Examinations of several features that comprise MetS in screening and monitoring procedures， or measuring the prognosis are very problematic especially in adolescent because of pubertal and developmental changes in this period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Therefore， it may be useful， in screening and monitoring in large scale studies， a single reproducible and reliable marker is identified that can replace the assessment of each of the separate MetS criteria.\n\n【8】Based on the association of hs-CRP with MetS and insulin resistance， some investigators have suggested that serum hs-CRP could be used as a marker for the prediction of CVD and T2D and should be included as one of the diagnostic criteria for MetS通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3，19，20\\]</u>.\n\n【9】According to findings of the large-scale population cohort of the Women Health Survey (WHS)， there is a relationship between serum hs-CRP， MetS and CVD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. For the prediction of future risk of coronary heart disease and stroke， serum hs-CRP values have been classified into three categories： <1 (low risk)， 1-3 (moderate risk) and >3 mg/L (high risk) respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. We aimed to investigate the association between serum hs-CRP and definitions for the MetS adjusted for children and adolescents， and its constituent components.\n\n【10】Subjects and Methods\n\n【11】Schoolgirls \\[mean age of 14.56 ±1.53 years (ranging from 12 to 18years)，resident in the cities of Mashhad and Sabzevar，in northeastern Iran， were recruited using a random cluster sampling method， as part of a vitamin D supplementation study. The study was approved by the local institutional Ethics Committee， as well all participants gave written informed consent. Demographic information collected by using research made questionnaires.\n\n【12】After an overnight fast， blood samples were taken from all participants， for estimation of fasting blood glucose， lipid profile and high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. The high sensitivity C-reactivee protein Was measuredusingparticleenhanced turbidimetric assay (Bioscience， Germany)，and the enzymatic assay was applied to measuring the fasting blood glucose， lipid profile as manufacturer manual (Pars AzmoonTeb， Iran).\n\n【13】Waist circumference was measured at a point midway between124h rib and top of the iliac crest， at the end of normal expiration.\n\n【14】The IDF， NCEP-ATPIII， Cook's and De Ferranti's definitions were used for the diagnosis of MetS as indicated in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\nPrevalence was reported as a percentage. Normality of data was examined by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results represent median and first and third interquartile because of the abnormal distribution of data. Statistical significance was determined by the paired t-test， as well， one-way ANOVA test was used for comparison of means in groups. ROC curves were drawn for estimation ofarea under curves， and the optimal cutoff value was computed by Yandex index and Delong method applied for determining sensitivity and specificity of serum hs-CRP for MetS definitions. Pearson's test was used for computing of association between variables， also the point-biserial|删除段之间换行|correlation test was performed for estimation of the correlation between quantitative and dichotomous variables. Binary logistic regression was used for computing of odd ratios (CI 95%). All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 11.0(Chicago. IL.)/MedCalc software version 15.8 was applied for ROC analysis. P-value <0.05 was considered as significant.\n\n【16】Results\n\n【17】Table 1 showed the serum Hs-CRP values in subiects with and without MetS and each MetS components separately， and the associations of serum Hs-CRP with each component of MetS based on four different definitions of MetS adapted for children and adolescents represented in this table. In regard to subjects with WC measure that met the criterion of MetS in Cook's， NCEP-ATPIII and IDF， serum hs-CRP was significantly higher in girls with MetS(1.92(1.16-3.86)) as compared to those without MetS (0.9 (0.46-1.68)). Also， similar differences were observed in the WC based on DeFerranti's criterion (754 percentile) with 1.60 (1.00-3.17) VS.0.86(0.43-1.61) of hs-CRP in MetS and non-MetS， respectively. In participants with FBG that met the cutoff values for IDF definition， serum hs-CRP was higher than in healthy girls (1.02 (0.51-2.00) VS.0.95(0.5-1.8))but these differences were not significant(P=0.462)，in the other definitions of MetS a cutoff for FBG (≥ 110 mg/dL)， similar results were observed (hs-CRP in MetS： 1.01(0.48-1.47 vs.non-MetS：0.96 (0.50-1.83)； P=0.994). There were no significant differences between subiects that met the SBP criterion with healthy individuals， while the hs-CRP values were higher in who met the IDF(1.38(0.71-3.54) vs. 0.96 (0.50-1.83) P=0.122)， ATP III and Cook's (0.98 (0.51-2.95) vs. 0.97 (0.50-1.84) P=0.644) and DeFerranti's (1.24(0.63-3.37) vs. 0.98 (0.52-1.91)P=0.376) criteria. In DBP， two different cutoffs were investigated in the studied definitions， in spite of higher values of hs-CRP in individuals with DBP criterion for IDF 1.12 (0.49-3.02) vs. 0.96 (0.50-1.83) and other definitions 1.10 (0.58-1.78) Vs.0.95 (0.50-1.85) contributed to healthy subjects； but again， these differences were not significant (P>0.05). There are three different cutoffs for hypertriglyceridemia among the studied definitions， Hs-CRP concentration in subjects who met the criterion， was significantly higher in each of the three different cutoffs， according to IDF (≥150mg/dL)， ATPIII and Cooks (e 110 mg/dL) and DeFerrant's (e100mg/dL) criteria cutoffs， positive individuals with these cutoff， have serum hs-CRP of 2.09 (1.24-3.34)，1.47(0.75-2.67) and，1.34(0.75-2.37) mg/L， while the negative subjects showed a median serum hs-CRP of 0.92 (0.48-1.75)，0.88(0.45-1.61) and， 0.86 (0.42-1.60) mg/L， respectively. Decreased HDL criterion was also defined by three different cutoffs in used definitions， and IDF and Cook's definitions have the same cutoff (<40 mg/dL). Based on these cutoffs， positive participants have significant higher hs-CRP concentration than those who were negative. Serum hs-CRP values for subjects with HDL below cutoffs were 1.20 (0.59-2.58)，1.16(0.58-2.28)， and 1.07(0.58-1.93) as compared with participants with HDL values more than cutoffs who have Hs-CRP concentrations 0.93 (0.49-1.72)，0.91(0.47-1.75)， and 0.85(0.40-1.60) for IDF and Cook's， NCEP-ATP III and finally DeFerranti's definition， respectively. Hs-CRP median to be higher in individuals with MetS than without in all comparisons， but these differences were not significant for fasting blood glucose and systolic and diastolic blood pressures.\n\n【18】Often individual components of MetS have been associated with serum hs-CRP but this association is especially weak for HDL using the IDF and Cook definitions； r=0.095 (P=0.009)， NCEPT-ATPIII\n\n【19】Table 1： Hs-CRP values in MetS and its components based on different definitions.\n\n| Criteria  | +MetS criteria cut offs  |  | Serum hs-CRP median (IQ5-IQ，)  |  | p  | correlation test  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Criteria  | +MetS criteria cut offs  |  | MetS  | Non-MetS  | p  | correlation test  |\n| WC (cm)  | IDF， NCEP-ATPlll and Cook et al.，2003a  | \\>90h (for Cook et al) and ≥90h percentile  | 1.92(3.86-1.16)  | 0.9(1.68-0.46)  | 0.0001  | 0.244 (0.0001)  |\n| WC (cm)  | De Ferranti etal.2004  | \\>751h percentile  | 1.60(3.17-1.00)  | 0.86(1.61-0.43)  | 0.0001  | 0.246 (0.0001)  |\n| FBG (mg/dL)  | IDF  | ≥100 mg/dL  | 1.02(2.00-0.51)  | 0.95(1.8-0.5)  | 0.462  | 0.026(0.463)  |\n| FBG (mg/dL)  | NCEP-ATPIII， Cook et al. 2003 and De Ferranti et al. 2004B  | ≥110mg/dL  | 1.01(1.47-0.48)  | 0.96(1.83-0.50)  | 0.994  | 0.0001 (0.992)  |\n| SBP (mmHg)  | IDF  | ≥130mmHg  | 1.38(3.54-0.71)  | 0.96(1.83-0.50)  | 0.122  | 0.057(0.123)  |\n| SBP (mmHg)  | NCEP-ATPIII and Cook et al. 2003  | ≥90mh percentile  | 0.98(2.95-0.51)  | 0.97(1.84-0.50)  | 0.644  | 0.017(0.645)  |\n| SBP (mmHg)  | De Ferranti et al.， 2004  | \\>90h percentile  | 1.24(3.37-0.63)  | 0.98(1.91-0.52)  | 0.376  | 0.048(0.377)  |\n| DBP (mmHg)  | IDF  | ≥85 mmHg  | 1.12(3.02-0.49)  | 0.96(1.83-0.50)  | 0.467  | 0.027(0.468)  |\n| DBP (mmHg)  | NCEP-ATPII，Cook et al. 2003 and De Ferranti et al.2004Q  | ≥90mh percentile  | 1.10(1.78-0.58)  | 0.95(1.85-0.50)  | 0.531  | 0.023(0.532)  |\n| TG (mg/dL)  | IDF  | ≥150 mg/dL  | 2.09(3.34-1.24)  | 0.92(1.75-0.48)  | 0.0001  | 0.182 (0.0001)  |\n| TG (mg/dL)  | NCEP-ATPIII and Cook et al. 2003 T  | ≥110 mg/dL  | 1.47(2.67-0.75)  | 0.88(1.61-0.45)  | 0.0001  | 0.194 (0.0001)  |\n| TG (mg/dL)  | De Ferranti etal.2004  | ≥100 mg/dL  | 1.34(2.37-0.75)  | 0.86(1.60-0.42)  | 0.0001  | 0.199 (0.0001)  |\n| HDL (mg/dL)  | IDF and Cook et al. 2003 二  | <40 mg/dL  | 1.20(2.58-0.59)  | 0.93(1.72-0.49)  | 0.009  | 0.095(0.009)  |\n| HDL (mg/dL)  | NCEP-ATPII  | ≤40 mg/dL  | 1.16(2.28-0.58)  | 0.91(1.75-0.47)  | 0.019  | 0.085(0.019)  |\n| HDL (mg/dL)  | De Ferranti et al. 2004  | <50 mg/dL  | 1.07(1.93-0.58)  | 0.85(1.60-0.40)  | 0.005  | 0.102(0.005)  |\n| MetS\\\\  | IDF  | Obesity +2 or more  | 3.87(5.47-1.64)  | 0.96(1.83-0.50)  | 0.0001  | 0.142 (0.0001)\\\\  |\n| MetS\\\\  | NCEP-ATPI  | 3 or more  | 3.52(5.47-1.34)  | 0.95(1.81-0.49)  | 0.0001  | 0.149(0.0001)\\\\  |\n| MetS\\\\  | Cook et al.， 2003  | 3 or more  | 4.58(5.86-1.54)  | 0.96(1.83-0.50)  | 0.0001  | 0.138 (0.0001)\\\\  |\n| MetS\\\\  | DeFerranti et al.， 2004  | 3 or more  | 1.73(5.15-1.15)  | 0.93(1.80-0.49)  | 0.0001  | 0.156 (0.0001)\\\\  |\n\n【21】IDF： International Diabetes Federation；NCEP-ATPIII： National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel； WC： Waist Circumference；FBG： Fasting Blood Glucose； SBP： Systolic Blood Pressure； DBP： Diastolic Blood Pressure； TG： Triglyceride； HDL： High-Density Lipoprotein； MetS： METABOLIC SYNDROME\\In these two columns used criteria， and their cutoffs have been showed， some cutoffs are same in those criteria that marked by Greek letters. \\\\The point- biserial correlation test was performed for determining of association between dichotomous and quantitative variables\n\n【22】Table 2： Age-adjusted prevalence of metabolic syndrome and median serum hs-CRP values.\n\n【23】Metabolic syndrome (%)\n\n| Age (years)  | n  | IDF  | NCEP-ATPIII  | Cook's  | De Feranti's  | hs-CRP median (IQR-IQR，)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 12  | 57  | 7  | 8.8  | 8.8  | 15.8  | 0.9(2.00-0.45)  |\n| 13  | 236  | 1.3  | 2.5  | 1.3  | 5.1  | 1.09(1.93-0.49)  |\n| 14  | 232  | 0.9  | 1.7  | 0.4  | 1.7  | 0.89(1.79-0.47)  |\n| 15  | 170  | 0.6  | 1.2  | 0.6  | 3.5  | 0.83(1.6-0.4)  |\n| 16  | 147  | 0  | 2.7  | 2  | 4.1  | 1.12(1.92-0.56)  |\n| 17  | 123  | 0.8  | 2.4  | 0.8  | 4.1  | 0.96(1.84-0.59)  |\n| 18  | 16  | 6.3  | 0  | 0  | 6.3  | 1.45(6.42-0.57)  |\n| Total  | 981  | 1.2  | 2.4  | 1.4  | 4.3  | 0.97(1.85-0.5)  |\n\n【25】r=0.085 (P=0.019)， and in DeFerranti's definition r=0.102 (P=0.005).

The highest prevalence of MetS was found in the 12 years old girls|删除段之间换行|and using the DeFerranti’s definition of MetS was used to estimate highest prevalence of MetS. Except in 12 years old girls， highest values for hs-CRP concentrations 1.45 mg/L， 1.12 mg/L， and 1.09 mg/L approximately contributed to high prevalence based on DeFerranti's definition 6.3%， 4.1% and 5.1% in different age groups， respectively. In general，the lowest prevalence also related to alower median serum hs-CRP. While there was no clear relationship between prevalence and median serum hs-CR in other MetS definitions in this population.\n\n【31】Girls with MetS were in a high-risk group as defined by serum hs-CRP， apart from when using the DeFerrantis definition ， with the highest prevalence of MetS in all the definitions of MetS investigated. Often subjects with MetS are classified into a high-risk group of hs-CRP with values more than 3 mg/L. Data on the odd ratios indicate that serum hs-CRP is a risk factor for MetS in female adolescents. The highest andlowest odd ratios were found when using the Cook's or DeFerranti's definitions of MetS， respectively .\n\n【32】ROC analysis showed that serum hs-CRP had the greatest AUC using the NCEP-ATPIII definition， and the smallest for Cook et al. The highest specificity of hs-CRP as a biomarker was observed for the DeFerranti's definition (65.90%)， followed by the NCEP-ATPIII definition (65.53%). However， hs-CRP showed82.61% sensitivity as a marker for NCEP-ATPIII， while DeFerranti's definition has the lowest sensitivity of hs-CRP(68.29%).\n\n【33】In general， hs-CRP showed the highest sensitivity (82.61%) and second highest specificity (65.53%) for NCEP-ATPIII definition. The threshold value for serum hs-CRP value for all studied definitions was similar for all of definitions of MetS， and was approximately a value of 1.33 mg/L.\n\n【34】The subjects classified based on some MetS components who met its cutoffs and participants with three or four components integrated into one group because it was often the case that for any definition only one subject meet four criteria together， also no one met all five criteria. Results presented in Table 6 show that with an increasing number of components of MetS， the median serum hs-CRPincreased for all the studied criteria except in IDF definition. In the latter definition， in contrast with median values for hs-CRP，most frequent value in 3 or more and two components group was 5.47 mg/L and0.20 mg/L， respectively； but due to different subject numbers in each group， median value in group with two component showed higher amount than 3 or more group.\n\n【35】Discussion\n\n【36】In this study， we aimed to investigate the potential use of serum hs-CRP as a biomarker for pediatric MetS in schoolgirls. MetS was defined using four different criteria： The IDF， NCEP， Cook’s and DeFerrantis definitions. In general， the prevalence of MetS based on studied definitions was verylow and ranged from 1.2% to 4.3% for IDF and DeFerrani's definition， respectively. According to our findings， the highest prevalence was observed in 12 years old and then in 18-year age group. Based on often used definitions of MetS， the 14 years age group showed the lowest prevalence of MetS in this population. Kelishadi et al. reviewed the prevalence of MetS among Iranian children and adolescents；they are reported the prevalence ofpediatric MetS ranged between 1% to 22% based on different definitions， such as NCEP-ATPIII： 3% to 16%， IDF： 0% to 8% and， DeFerranti's： 0%to 22%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.

Therefore， in the present study， we measured the association of each definition and their components with hs-CRP values. A significant association was found between serum hs-CRP and WC， TG and， HDL； but this association with HDL was weak. Similar to the present study， many studies showed an association between highhs-CRPandMetS 3，11，13，16，28-30\\].

This suggests that a high serum hs-CRP in MetS might be relatedto chronic systemic inflammation. In some studies， there is relationship between lipid profile abnormalities and hs-CRP values 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，11，13，17，28，29，31，34\\]</u>， relation between hs-CRP and lipid profile disorders might be proposed that this condition affected normal function of liver and high hs-CRP levels lead to liver dysfunction， there are evidence for that adolescent with NAFLD have high-level hs-CRP in comparison of no NAFLD ones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， also Oda et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u> showed a correlation between hs-CRP levels and ALT.\n\n【44】We did observe no statistically significant association between hs-CRP and FBG and BPs in any of the studied definitions， the relationship between hs-CRP and BP was not significant. Somestudies have reported a significant association between a high serum hs-CRP and systolic BP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，11，29\\]</u>， diastolic BP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，34\\]</u>； also， some studies like our study did not observe any correlation between hs-CRP and BP通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，27，31\\]</u>. However， Abdullah et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u> did find serum hs-CRP was associated with BPs only in obese individuals with MetS. They found no significant correlation between hs-CRP and BP in overweight and normal individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. This complicated relationship may be attributed to sampling size，gender， and ethnicity and may need more investigation.\n\n【45】We found no significant association between FBG and serum hs-CRP in our study. Similar findings reported by Oliveira et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> which that may be related to increasing of hs-CRP influenced by obesity before the disturbance of glucose metabolism.\n\n【46】Many studies have shown that serum hs-CRP is related to the number of MetS components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，17，27，29，30\\]</u>. This suggests MetS components clustering may be accompanied by an increasing pro-inflammatorystatus that is closely related to adiposetissue dysfunction. Also， these findings point to a higher the risk of cardiovascular being a consequence of a higher number of components of MetS.\n\n【47】ROC analysis was performed for computing sensitivity and specificity of serum hs-CRP for pediatric MetS definition. We found sensitivity and specificity， 68.29% to 82.61% and 64.68% to 65.90%for serum hs-CRP for the different definitions of MetS， respectively. AUC for different definitions varied 0.649 to 0.788 and cutoff value for all studied definitions have been determined more than 1.33 mg/L hs-CRP. As similar to these findings， Oda and Kawai reported that AUC of hs-CRP was 0.74 and sensitivity 67% and specificity 72% in Japanese women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. In another report， the cutoff value for serum hs-CRP was 1.04 mg/L with sensitivity and specificity， 58% and92%，respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Also， Han et al. resulted that AUC of hs-CRP for prediction of MetS development was 0.684 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This similarity in different ethnic groups with MetS might be suggested hs-CRP as a potential inflammatory marker for MetS which that reproducible， easy access results； but low values for specificity make it unreliable.\n\n【48】Conclusion\n\n【49】MetS is recognized as a cluster of risk factors including obesity， lipid profile abnormalities， glucose metabolism disorders， and hypertension. MetS is also characterized by a chronic low-grade inflammation condition. Current definitions of MetS lack a component that measures inflammatory status. Serum hs-CRP has been suggested as a sensitive marker that is predictive of MetS as well as the development of cardiovascular problems. The present study investigated the relationship of hs-CRP and MetS in pediatrics. In conclusion， we found an association between hs-CRP and pediatric MetS and some of its components， by certain definitions. We also show that hs-CRP values can predict MetS in pediatrics and suggest measurements of hs-CRP as a risk factor for MetS in large scale screening due to easy access and cost-effective measures， but more studies are required to clarify the clinical application of hs-CRP， particularly in boys， and in girls who are defined by menarche status.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

She was referred to tertiary centre where she was diagnosed having ovarian ectopic after MRI and surgical intervention.\n\n【3】Discussion： This is a rare case of ovarian ectopic as it presents at advanced gestational age. From our literature review， noted only 12 cases have been reported from a period of 1948 till删除4:<u> 2020</u>. Our patient also didn't have any risk factors for OP. The role of ultrasound technology especially with the presence of 3D image has increased sensitivity in detecting POP. Transvaginal ultrasound which provides more accurate diagnosis in detecting ectopic pregnancy， still reported as most operator dependent with only 2.53% detection rate as most of final diagnosis made intraoperatively. MRI provides excellent tissue contrast over the implantation sites besides to strategize the operation by looking at the involvement ofsurrounding organs and vessels in order to minimize the intraoperative complications. With advanced gestation age like our patient，totalunilateral salphingo-ophorectomy is a method of choice as wide wedge resection of ovary will lose its function in a future.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Ovarian pregnancy has still rarely been diagnosed in this modern era. Its diagnosis mainly through surgical intervention despite the developing of transvaginal ultrasound and MRI. Surgical intervention remains the treatment of choice for most of the cases.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\nAn ectopic pregnancy is defined as fertilized oocyte implants outside the endometrial cavity. In 2016， MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies： Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries) collaboration has reported almost 5% of maternal death are directly related to ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Even the awareness of ectopic pregnancy is increasing among the women； the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy is showing an increasing in trend worldwide especially in developing countries due to the late presentation to seek for the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Ectopic pregnancy mostly occurs in fallopian tubes while 1% to 2% of ectopic pregnancy are non-tubal and occur in ovary， cervix， interstitium， omentum and caesarean scars 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.

The incidence of ovarian ectopic pregnancy has shown an increment along with the evolution oftransvaginalultrasound，histologic examination and magnetic|删除段之间换行|resonance in this current era 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-24\\]</u>. Women who susceptible to get ovarian ectopic pregnancy are those with previous history of pelvic inflammatory disease， usage of intrauterine contraceptive device， polycystic ovarian syndrome， endometriosis， assisted reproductive treatment， previous adnexal surgeries and history of infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However，risk factors of ovarian ectopic are still poorly studied. More studies and data are needed to assist in understanding and rapidly diagnosing ovarian ectopic so that prognosis will be improved. Although ovarian ectopicpregnancy is a rare occurrence， it often ends spontaneously in the first trimester. However， there are few reports of advanced gestational age ovarian ectopic up to 34 weeks gestation due to limited resources of diagnostic tools or low resources country通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. It also becomes life-threatening condition when it ruptures causing massive intraabdominal bleeding that led to hypovolemic shock and cardiorespiratory arrest. Here we report a rare case of 18weeks ovarian pregnancy with alive fetus in the low resource center of Sandakan， Malaysia.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\nA 24 years old young lady came to emergency department of Hospital Duchess of Kent， Sabah with chief complaint of lower abdominal pain for the past 1 month. She was currently at her third pregnancy with previous 2 successful full term normal vertex delivery uneventfully. Previous 2 deliveries were with previous husband. She was separated last year and remarry with a new local guy. She was well and healthy all the while until November 2020 when she had mild lower abdominal discomfort. Thepain occurred intermittently but st ill tolerable that made her manages herself expectantly without seeking any medical attention. She didn’t aware ofpregnancy changes too. The pain was increasing in trend after a month that brought her to meet General Practitioner. She was tested positive for pregnancy and early trimester scan was done. Uterine fibroid with intrauterine pregnancy were detected. Due to increasing abdominal pain as possible due to degenerated fibroid， she was referred to emergency department of our hospital for further assessed by obstetrician. She immediately came to hospital with pain score of 10/10. Her vitals were normal. She was not tachycardic. She denied any per vaginal bleeding， urinary symptoms， bowel symptoms， anemic symptoms， shoulder tip pain， nausea or vomiting， or even passed out any product of conception. She has no previous medical illness or surgery done to her. Allpregnancies were|删除段之间换行|uneventful. She also has no allergy history. She just remarries with a new local guy in September删除4:<u> 2020</u>. Her spouse was the first marriage with her. Both were social smoker but denied other high risk or social behaviors. She is a housewife while her husband works as a welder. Her menses was normal. She attained menarche at the age of 13and since then she was having normal regular menses. She did not practice any contraception method with previous husband. She also never does any Pap smear test post-delivery. Her last childbirth was8 years ago. All pregnancies were spontaneously conceived. She is generally normal built lady. Her weight was 55， while height was 160that made her BMI 21.4. She was alert and fully conscious. Her blood pressure recorded as 117/70， pulse rate 82 and body temperature36.7C. Due to intense pain on arrival to ED， patient was given trial of paracetamol 1 g and subsequently pain score reduced to 1/10. She was looking well， with normal lung and heart auscultation. She was attempted abdominal scan by emergency physician and same result found as uterine fibroid in pregnancy， possible degenerated and subsequently was referred to Obstetrics and Gynecology team. She was brought to special gynecology assessment room where she was seen by obstetrician on call. Her abdominal examination noted lower abdominal mass palpable 18 weeks size， possibly gravid uterus by the evidence of Linea Nigra and striae gravidarum. However fetal movement unable to appreciate. Fetal poles also unable to palpate yet. No abdominal tenderness palpable. Uterus mobile site to site，no shifting dullness percussion noted. Symphysis fundalheight was about18 cm， correspond to clinical examination too. Ultrasound abdomen done subsequently， noted presence of singleton fetus underneath uterus which is located anteriorly. Empty uterus noted with thin endometrial lining. Fetus just behind the uterus， while placental mass adhered to the back ofuterine wall. Fetalheart activity and movements were presence. Fetal parameters correspond to 15 weeks size with normal structures. No free fluid seen， nor adnexal mass. Left ovary looks normal while right ovary unable to visualize. Then， perineal examination done. Her vulval and vaginal appeared normal. Cervix axial， tubular and cervical opening appeared close. Pouch of Douglas was free， no bogginess felt， no adnexal mass palpable too. No vaginal discharge or bleeding noted. Case was then discussed with consultant on call， and further discussed with fetomaternal specialist from tertiary center， which situated about 350 km from Sandakan city. Her case subsequently accepted and was planned for immediate transfer|删除段之间换行|t\n\n【9】BABUIWOMENLOHLDIENHO\n\nto tertiary center after done 2 test Geneexpert PCR test for both patient and husband. She was planned to admit in Hospital Wanita and Kanak-Kanak Likas (tertiary center) for MRI examination， rescanning by fetomaternal specialist and counseling for further management after fully evaluation. Patient and husband counseled by O&G team Hospital Duchess of Kent thoroughly expected possible management and outcome also explain with empathy. Patient and husband accepted the case and put life as main priority. She was sen via helicopter to tertiary center and MRI proceeded on the next day. She was then counseled for exploratory laparotomy； KIV proceed due to the large size of the conceptus. Her operation was led by fetomaternal specialist and gyneoncologist specialist. Intraoperatively revealed an intact， non-dilated right fallopian tube adjacent to a large mass encompassed by the right ovary. This ovarian mass connected to the uterus via ovarian ligament.Right ureter was patent and mildly|删除段之间换行|dilated. An unruptured ~15 week's sized gestation was identified in the right ovary. Unilateral right salphingo-oophorectomy was performed in usual manner with concurrent removal of the ectopic pregnancy. Sample sent to histopathology for further evaluation. Postoperatively patient recovered well and discharged after postoperative day删除4:<u> 3</u>. Gross histopathological examination revealed a piece ofplacental tissue (160grams) measuring 110 mmx80 mmx40mm with adjoining umbilical cord 65 mmlong， 5 mm diameter. Serial sections of the placenta show a tan， brown area measuring 25 mm x 20 mm x20 mm. There is an ovarian tissue with pale brown cut surface (60 mm x 30 mm× 10mm) adhered to one edge of the placental tissue. No obvious tubular structure is seen. Microscopically， there is a disrupted fallopian tube with luminal collection of viable and degenerated chorionic villi， trophoblasts and fetal membrane admixed with fibrin and blood clots. There is also presence of ovarian tissue with chorionic villi and trophoblasts embedded the outer surface (capsule). Cystic follicles， corpus luteum and corpora albicantes are seen within the ovarian stroma. The umbilical cord is unremarkable. No molar changes seen.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Our case is an extremely rare case of ovarian pregnancy which occurred in advanced stage of gestation. From our literature review， there were only 12 cases have been reported from a period of 1948till 2020 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Often， these are due to missed early antenatal check-up，unplanned pregnancy and low socioeconomic factor. Our patient presented with vague clinical symptoms. She just remarried to a local guy prior to the event and did not seek any medical attention due to financial constraint. This case agrees with the finding that reported nearly 74% of women unaware of ovarian pregnancy occurrence due to vague clinical presentation， died conceptus and spontaneous involution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【13】History\n\nThe classicalclinical1：symptoms of OP? are amenorrhea， abdominal pain， and vaginal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. However， our patient only developed acute abdominal pain with stable vital signs and absence of hemoperitoneum’s sign. As it was reported that only 28% of cases been correctly diagnosed preoperatively， this patient also been misdiagnosed by primary care and emergency department 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Most of the POP will come with intraabdominal bleeding with circulatory collapse that endanger women'slife as a complication of most ectopic|删除段之间换行|pregnancy. This is due to numerous numbers of blood vessels supply the ovaries， even directly branch off from aorta compared to fallopian tube 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Our patient also didn't have any risk factors for ovarian ectopic pregnancy. She was having spontaneous conception， not obese nor she had any history of fertility treatment， IVF treatment and embryo transfer which most of researchers believed among the strongest likelihood risk factor of having OP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，17\\]</u>. This finding agrees with the study by Shah， around 39.5% to 50% of women with ovarian ectopic pregnancy had none of these risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Usage of Intrauterine Contraception Device (IUCD) or Intrauterine Device(IUD) of 6 months up to 5 years has risk of ovarian ectopic pregnancy in 1 in 5 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>， however our patient was never been in any of the devices. IUD contributed to reduction ofpick function of fallopian tube， retrograde movement of fertilized eggs and implantation in the ovary as a result ofprostaglandin secretion which inhibit the peristalsis and normal function of fallopian tube 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. However， Lehfeldt et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> stated that IUD might have little protective effect against OP as it reduced intrauterine implantation and tubal implantation by99.5% and 95%，respectively. The true relationship between IUD and OP remains debatable and requires further investigation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The Assisted Reproductive Therapy (ART) has become more popular as there are increase of awareness among couples towards fertility treatment and availability of the services. ART also responsible for the occurrence of OP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The usage of ovulation induction agents was believed able to increase production of steroid and over stimulate the ovaries due to the change of the estradiol/progesterone ratio. This will further stimulate uterine smooth muscle and tubal peristalsis which cause the backflow of embryo and implantation can occur in the ovary通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22-24\\]</u>. Some researchers reported that usage of tissue forceps and the high volume and pressure of culture medium injected into the uterus may also contribute to the uterine contractility system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25，26\\]</u>. PID and abdominal surgeries also closely related to the occurrence of OP. This was due to the change of inherent uterine structure which led to ovarian inflammation. Ovulation barriers and fertilized eggs implanted in the ovary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Investigation\n\nThe role of ultrasound technology especially with the presence of 3D image has increased the sensitivity of detecting OP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Transvaginal ultrasoundprovides more accurate diagnosis in detecting ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29-31\\]</u>. However， the detection of OP using transvaginal ultrasound is still low at the rate of 2.53% as it is still operator dependent. Hence， most of final diagnosis is still made intraoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In our center， lack of resources and newly graduated clinician with inexperience gynecology imaging further reduced the sensitivity in detecting ovarian pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. Luckily this patient presented as unruptured OP as ruptured OP even difficult to make a diagnosis as mixed clinical picture of sonographic evidence of abdominal mass and blood clots 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Our poor lady initially been diagnosed as uterine fibroid in pregnancy as the clinical scan showed anterior intramural fibroid that mimic uterine structure with fetus which believed normally growth inside uterus， below the fibroid. BHCG in OP showed higher than TP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Goksedef even stated that ruptured OP cases even showed higher BHCG level compared to unruptured one 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Combined screening test of BHCG and TVS in diagnosing ectopic pregnancy showed high sensitivity and specificity with 96% and 97% respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. However， for this patient， we did not perform BHCG test as we were confident sure that she was having abdominal pregnancy and BHCG test would not give any further benefit as the management still the same which was delivering|删除段之间换行|the conceptus. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has served as latest and modern diagnostic tool in detecting ectopic pregnancies especially 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36-41\\]</u>， when TVS imaging is insufficient or equivocal as Choi et al. reported only 18% accuracy for preoperative diagnosis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>. MRI provides excellent tissue contrast over the implantation sites allowing clinician to strategize the operation by looking at the involvement of surrounding organs and vessels in order to minimize the intraoperative complications. Alternatively， other method of diagnostic tools that can be considered is culdocentesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>. This is valuable when the physician is in doubt whether to proceed with diagnostic laparoscopy or laparotomy in patient who presented with fluid accumulation intra peritoneum with stable vital signs and atypical clinical symptoms. As overall， in diagnosing ectopic pregnancy， high index of suspicion is always needed to prevent from further risk of massive bleeding that can risk mothers life if misdiagnose or late diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>. Jia et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u> reported that most of OP presented with hemorrhagic anemia (25%) and shock (10%).64%of the cases occurred over the right ovary compared to the left one(35%). No study found the exact mechanism， but possible location of sigmoid which covers the left ovary， may partly reduce the chance of embryo implantation of the left ovary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45，46\\]</u>. Traditionally， POP has been established following Spigielberg criteria in the last 139years ago which mainly based on gross examination of adnexa since microscopical examination has not been well established during that time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[47，48\\]</u>. There are four components to look for； ipsilateral tube must be intact and separate from the ovary， the embryo sac must be located in the ovary，the ovary and embryo sac should be connected to the uterus bythe ovarian ligament and the sac wall must be associated with the ovarian tissue. Recent reports mostly agreed that most of POP failed to meet all the 4 criteria's 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>. Wang et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[50\\]</u> suggested that classic Spiegelberg criteria should be updated by replacing“embryonic sac”criterion with “the identification of any evidence of product of conception such as chorionic villus， isolated trophoblast， implantation site and embryonic sac with or without fetal tissue within the affected ovary， while ipsilateral tube is intact or with no evidence of pregnancy. We also could not identify any embryonic sac within the adnexa through the examination of our patient； she is instead presented with intact fallopian tube and evidence of product of conception over the ovarian capsule. This case is classified as Secondary OP (SOP)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>. POP is defined as fertilized ovum located within the ovarian follicle， resulting the pregnancy within the ovarian cortex， while SOP occurred when the fertilization ovum is implanted over the ovarian capsule. In theory POP causing low BHCG level due to poor implantation site and encapsulation by ovarian stroma通用删除6(英):<u>\\[51\\]</u>. However， some researchers disagreed with that classification as no reliable method able to differentiate either primary or secondary ovarian pregnancy when most of the cases presented with ruptured follicular structures upon pathologic examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[51\\]</u>. However， the recurrence in SOP is rare and fertility is mostly preserved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[52\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Treatment\n\nWith advanced gestation age like our patient， total unilateral salphingo-ophorectomy is a method of choice. Having said that， if it was detected during early trimester， the role of wide wedge resection of ovary might cause reduce the blood flow to the ovary and lose its function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53\\]</u>. Those patients with non-ruptured OP， option can be given either conservative or prompt laparotomy. Risks and benefits for both options need to be fully discussed with patient and husband. Conservative treatment with injection of methotreaxate or hyperosmolar glucose， have not yet become the mainstay of treatment|删除段之间换行|though they have been proved successful in several reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[54，55\\]</u>. Even with persistently high BHCG in gestational trophoblastic disease， the role of methotreaxate and etoposide still contemplated通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56\\]</u>. This make the clinical practice of using medical treatment is rare删除4-1:<u>57，58</u>.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】Ovarian pregnancy has remained diagnostic andclinical challenging in this modern era especially when it is presented during advanced gestation age as rarity of the cases and vague clinical symptoms. Clinicians should think of ovarian ectopic in advanced gestational age of ectopic pregnancy as anatomical suitability of ovary that favors the fetus survival. Surgical intervention and histopathological examination remains the reliable diagnostic tool despite the evolution oftransvaginalultrasound and MRI. Spiegelberg criteria should be removed in diagnosing ovarian ectopic as most of the cases， they did not follow the criteria listed. Surgical intervention either wedge or total salphingo-ophorectomy are the treatment of choice in managing patient with advanced gestational age of ovarian ectopic.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Globally， about 35 million individuals were living with HIV in 2013. Of these， 24.7 million were in sub-Saharan Africa and 4.8 million in Asia and the Pacific 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In 2013， about 16 million individuals living with HIV globally were women aged 15 years and older， and 3.2 million were children under 15 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. More than 90% of HIV-positive pregnant women reside in sub-Saharan Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In 2013， 1.5 million HIV-infected women gave birth globally and there were 240，000 new pediatric infections， amounting to one new infection|删除段之间换行|every two minutes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. HIV is thus the leading cause of death in women of reproductive age globally； it is responsible for one-quarter of deaths during pregnancy and in the postpartum period in sub-Saharan Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【11】The two top causes of death in women of reproductive age globally are HIV and AIDS (19%) and complications related to childbearing (15%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest maternal mortality ratio， reporting levels of 596 deaths per 100，000 live births通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Further， half of the global maternal deaths occur in the sub-Saharan region. There seems to be a need to suggest strategies that are evidence-based to integrate family planning services with HIV treatment among women who are living with HIV. This may prevent treatable complications among them and their children， which lead to public health concerns in terms of high preventable childbearing complications and morbidity due to HIV/AIDS. The findings of this study informed the development of strategies to integrate family planning services with HIV services in Oromia Region， Ethiopia， and provided evidence-based input for policymakers and health planners.\n\n【12】Statement of the problems\n\n【13】There were beneficial synergies in terms of increased ‘Sexually Transmitted Infection' (STI) prevention， including syphilis screening and treatment， and early childhood immunization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Another peer-reviewed study illustrated how best to integrate other interventions， such as postpartum contraception or tuberculosis screening and treatment， into services that are already providing some parts of integrated HIV care for pregnant and postpartum women， which is almost non-existent删除4:<u> 6</u>.\n\n【14】Dual protection is the prevention of two unplanned and undesirable outcomes- unintended pregnancy and HIV infection-and may be achieved through the use of contraception in long-term， mutual， monogamous relationships. Alternatively， it includes the use of a condom， plus another non-barrier contraceptive method， or the use of a condom alone (including during pregnancy)， abstinence， or avoidance of all types of penetrative sex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. One of the most important advantages to “integrating family planning with HIV services’ is the potential contribution of contraception to prevent unintended HIV-positive births， which has been well established through extensive research 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-10\\]</u>. Integrating family planning with HIV treatment has presented evidence on HIV-positive women’s desire to prevent unwanted pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. Notable research findings showed evidence that preventing unwanted pregnancies to HIV-positive women reduce infant HIV infections， thus the policy for integration is sound 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\nLike all women， women living with and at risk of acquiring HIV have the right to determine the number and timing of their pregnancies and safely achieve their reproductive intentions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. A systematic review evidenced from Africa revealed that providing concerted information and support on family planning utilization and ready-to-access contraceptive methods seemed most effective in increasing the use of family planning， while the effects on unplanned pregnancywere difficult to measure. However，no studies assessed the effects of family planning on unintended pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. This review indicated that the results are far from definitive， yet they do highlight the need for strengthened efforts to integrate family planning counseling and access to services for HIV prevention， and for greater consistency of effort over time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Programs that have succeeded in promoting condom use and providing HIV prevention and treatment services in this region have largely missed the opportunity to address|删除段之间换行|the contraceptive needs of the key populations they serve. Therefore， the research statement for this study is “What are status of Risky sexual practice， unintended pregnancy， contraceptive utilization， and its determinants among HIV-infected women for women of reproductive age living with HIV attending healthcare facilities in Oromia Region， Ethiopia?”\n\n【16】Methods and Materials\n\n【17】Research setting and design\n\nThis study was conducted in the Oromia Region surroundings of Finfinne Oromia， Ethiopia. Currently， the health system of the zone consists of two hospitals under construction， and 27 health centers with 98% potential health service coverage. There were different governmental and non-governmental organizations working on HIV/AIDS in the zone. There were 13 health centers which have been providing ART and family planning services in the zone， of which five were randomly selected as the study setting. The total number of people living with HIV enrolled at ART clinics in the zone was9，421， of which 2，380 were women of reproductive age， and of these，1，557 were from five randomly selected health centers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The target population was HIV-positive women of reproductive age who had attended ART follow-up services for at least six months from randomly selected healthcare facilities in Oromia Region， Ethiopia. The accessible sample was 1，557 eligible women of reproductive age living with HIV attending ART clinics in public health centers|删除段之间换行|A Health facility based cross-sectional study design was conducted with quantitative data collection approach was used to collect data from women living with HIV attending ART clinics.\n\n【19】Sample size determination\n\n【20】The sample size was determined through a single population proportion formula by using a case study found in integrated sites in Ethiopia， where 40% of women were family planning users (P) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. By considering the design effect of 2， with correction formula since the total population was less than 10，000 通用删除7(英):<u>(2，380)</u> and with a 5% non-response rate considered， the final sample size was 670 women living with HIV.\n\n【21】Sampling procedure\n\n【22】All hospitals and health centers found in the Special Zone of Oromia Region that provide ART services were identified and randomly selected by computer-generated methods to be included in the study. A list of all women living with HIV from each facility，aged between 18 and 49 years of age， was randomly created. Study sites were prepared and entered into SPSS version 23 by using their pre-ART registration numbers from the Health Management Information System (HMIS) database. A simple random sampling technique by computer-generated samples was utilized at each health centre to select 670 study respondents. The number of study respondents was allocated proportionally for the five health centers， based on their total number of ART clients.\n\n【23】Data collection\n\nThe questionnaire used for data collection was initially prepared in English， and translated to Afaan Oromo， and back to English for language experts to confirm its consistency. Finally， the corrected Afaan Oromo version was used to collect the data from women living with HIV attending ART clinics. The questions included in the questionnaire were adapted and prepared by reviewing different related literature and variables identified to be measured. Training|删除段之间换行|was given for data collectors and supervisors by the primary researcher for two days. Data collectors cross-checked the pre-ART card numbers of women living with HIV who came to the ART clinic with sampled card numbers daily. Five trained data collectors collected data from women of reproductive age. The completed questionnaires were collected and checked daily for consistency and completeness by supervisors and the primary researcher. Data were collected using a pre-tested structured Afaan Oromo version of the questionnaire. A pre-test of the questionnaire was done on 5% of the women living with HIV at Ambo health centre， to identify any ambiguity， to confirm consistency in the questionnaire， to determine acceptability， and to make necessary corrections one week before the actual data collection process. The respondents were guided through a questionnaire and chart abstraction conducted at their health facility by trained data collectors.\n\n【25】Data management and analysis\n\n【26】The returned questionnaires were checked for completeness， cleaned manually， coded and entered into EPI INFO 7.1.6version and then transferred to SPSS version 23 for further analysis. Frequencies， percentages， mean and Standard Deviation (SD) was used to summaries descriptive statistics of the data and text. Moreover， tables and graphs will be used for data presentation. Bivariate analysis was used primarily to check which variables have an individual association with the dependent variable. Variables which were found to have an association with the dependent variables were then entered into multiple logistic regressions to control the possible effect of confounders. Finally， the variables which have significant association were identified on the basis of AOR， with a 95% CI and p-value to fit into the final regression model.\n\n【27】Ethical consideration\n\n【28】The rights of the institution were protected by obtained ethical clearance (Ref. No HSHDC/710/2017) from the Research and Ethics Committee of the Department of Health Studies at the UNISA. Thereafter， a letter of permission to conduct this research was also obtained from the ORHB who requested support for the researcher from each study site to facilitate the data collection process (Ref. No BEFO/HBT64/18/2569). Informed consent from each study participant was obtained after the nature of the study was fully explained in their local languages as it was attached in the questionnaire. The respondents' right to refuse or withdraw from the study at any stage was respected. Information collected from respondents was kept confidential， and the collected information was stored in a locked space， in a file without the name of the study respondent (anonymously)， but codes were assigned for each respondent and have not been disclosed to others except the principal investigators. Scientific integrity was ensured by avoiding plagiarism， being honest in reporting on the findings， and accurately citing all consulted sources.\n\n【29】Result\n\n【30】The complete response rate of this study was 654/670(97.6%). There were 654 respondents whose ages ranged between 18 and 49years. The mean age of the respondents was 31.86 years with a SD of±6.0 years. Most of the respondents in the sample were in the age group26 to 35 (n=374，57%)， and only 96 (14.7%) were in the age group 18to 25. Of the 14.7%，4(0.6%) were younger than 20 years.\n\n【31】In terms ofreligious affiliation， 474 (72.5%) respondents belonged to the orthodox denomination， 7 (1.1%) were Catholic， while 131\n\n【32】Table 1： Proportion of women by marital status in Oromia Region， Ethiopia，\n\n| Table 1： Proportion of women by marital status in Oromia Region， Ethiopia，删除4:<u> 2018</u>.  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Marital Status  | Frequency(%)  |\n| Marriec  | 528 (80.7)  |\n| Cohabit/living together\\  | 51(7.8)  |\n| Divorced/separated  | 46(7.0)  |\n| Widowed  | 22 (3.4)  |\n| Single  | 7(1.1)  |\n| Total  | 654通用删除7(英):<u>(100)</u>  |\n\n| 20.80%30.00% 品 25.00% 0.6016.30%16.709 11.20%520.00%15.00% 0%10.00% 5.00%5.00% 0.50% 0.00% No formal orimary education education secondary Tertlaryeducation educatipn 20.60% 16.70% 5.00% 0.50%11.20%光 2.40%  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【35】(20%) were Protestants and 42 (6.4%) were Muslims.\n\n【36】The majority (n=409， 62.5%) of the respondents had at least attended school from primary level to college/university level， and the least represented were 19 (2.9%) who had attained tertiary level education in the form of attending a college or university.\n\n【37】As presented in Figure 1， 528(88.5%) respondents were married，51(7.1%) were cohabiting/living together with their partners， while 7(1.1%) were single. The other women were divorced or separated and widowed. The marital status of respondents is presented in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n【38】With regard to the residential area， the majority of the respondents(n=518，79.2%)， resided in urban areas， and 136 (20.8%) lived in the rural area. The socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents as summarised in Table l are not different from the socioeconomic profile of Ethiopia. For example， in the general population of the same region， Christian denominations dominate and represent 65%of the population， and the largest ethnic group is Oromo， followed by Amhara which represent 64% of the population (CSA 2016：33). The results are also similar in terms ofthe proportion of women who are currently married or living together with a partner (65%) in the general population (CSA 2016：34).\n\n| Risky sexual practice， condom utilization， and unintended pregnancy  | Category of responses  | Frequency (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Have partner (n=654)  | Yes  | 641 (98.0)  |\n| Have partner (n=654)  | No  | 13(2.0)  |\n| Had sex in the last 6 months (n=654)  | Yes  | 608(94.9)  |\n| Had sex in the last 6 months (n=654)  | No  | 33(5.1)  |\n| Number of sexual partners had in the last 6 months (n=641)  | One  | 608 (94.9)  |\n| Number of sexual partners had in the last 6 months (n=641)  | Two and above  | 33(5.1)  |\n| Condom use in the last six months (n=630)  | Yes  | 451(71.6)  |\n| Condom use in the last six months (n=630)  | No  | 179(28.4)  |\n| Frequency of condom use during sexual intercourse  | Always  | 279(61.9)  |\n| Frequency of condom use during sexual intercourse  | Almost always  | 66(14.6)  |\n| Frequency of condom use during sexual intercourse  | No/inconsistent condom use  | 106(23.5)  |\n| Reason for not using a condom (n=179)  | felt some discomfort or reduced sexual pleasure  | 70(39.1)  |\n| Reason for not using a condom (n=179)  | Partner objection  | 68(38.0)  |\n| Reason for not using a condom (n=179)  | Desire to conceive  | 41(22.9)  |\n| Partner HIV-positive  | Yes  | 481(73.5)  |\n| Partner HIV-positive  | No  | 105(16.1)  |\n| Partner HIV-positive  | Unknown  | 68(10.4)  |\n| Changed sexual partners since HlV diagnosis  | Yes  | 174(26.6)  |\n| Changed sexual partners since HlV diagnosis  | No  | 480(73.4)  |\n| Last pregnancy wanted/timed  | Yes  | 514  |\n| Last pregnancy wanted/timed  | No  | 140  |\n| Have children in the future/fertility desire  | Yes  | 324  |\n| Have children in the future/fertility desire  | No  | 330  |\n\n【40】Risky sexual practice， condom utilization， and unintended preghancy\n\n【41】The findings on risky sexual practice， condom utilization， and unintended pregnancy among women of reproductive ageliving with HIV are presented in Table删除4:<u> 2</u>.\n\n【42】Table 2 illustrates that of a total of 654 respondents， almost all of them (n=641， 98.0%) had a sexual partner. Of these， 33 (5.1%) had two or more sexual partners in the last six months and 174 (26.6%) had changed sexual partners since their HIV diagnosis.\n\n【43】The result also indicated that 608 (94.9%) respondents were sexually active during the last six months； however， only 279(61.9%) always used a condom； 105 (16.1%) were discordant in HIV serostatus， and 68 (10.4%) did not know their sexual partners'HIV serostatus. The proportion of condom utilization in the last six months was reported by 451 (71.6%) respondents， although 106(23.5%) were inconsistent.\n\n【44】The findings revealed that the major reasons for not using a condom were that the respondents felt some discomfort or sexual pleasure was reduced； their partner obiected to the use of a condom， and some had the desire to conceive a baby；70 (39.1%)，68 (38%)，and41(22.9%)，respectively.\n\n【45】These results identified that 140 (21.4%) respondents’ previous pregnancy was unwanted/unplanned， and 324 (49.5%) had fertility desire Table删除4:<u> 2</u>.\n\n【46】HlV therapy and disclosure of HlV status\n\n【47】The mean years since HIV diagnosis were 5.64 with a ± Std.\n\n【48】deviation of 2.777 and all the respondents had started ART， of which36.9% were greater than or equal to 6 years， with a mean of 4.90±Std. deviations of 2.577 in years since they started ART.\n\n【49】According to client cards， study respondents’ ART drug adherence level indicated that the majority (n=576， 88.1%) had good and 38 (5.8%) had poor adherence towards ART drugs in the study area.

Figure 1 shows that more than half(n=374， 57.2%) of the respondents had good knowledge of modern family planning methods. The proportion of good knowledge regarding the eleven measurement variables of modern family planning methods among women of reproductive age living with HIV ranged from 53.5% to 60.9%， with 95% CI.\n\n【58】The results in Figure 2 should be viewed within the context of education characteristics of the respondents and their knowledge and awareness of modern family planning methods. For instance， as the educational status of the women increased， their knowledge towards family planning methods increased.\n\nFamily planning and dual method utilization of women of|删除段之间换行|reproductive age living with HIV\n\n【60】Table 4 shows that the proportion of current family planning utilization was 548 (83.8%) with 95% CI， which ranged from 81.2%to 86.8% among women living with HIV. The prevalence of dual contraceptive utilization was 425 (73.8%) with 95% CI of 70 to 77.3%， of which 343 (80.7%) and 306(72%) were consistent and sustained use of the dual method among women living with HIV attending ART clinics.\n\n【61】The major reason reported for the dual method was dual protection (unwanted pregnancy/STI/HIV) which accounted for386 (90.8%) respondents， followed by advice given by healthcare providers during follow up (n=20， 4.7%).\n\n【62】This study revealed that the majority of women of reproductive age living with HIV had discussed dual method use with healthcare providers and their sexual partner； 543 (83.0%) and 427(65.3%) respectively.\n\n【63】Factors associated with current family planning utilization\n\n【64】Table 5 shows the logistic regression modeling that was undertaken to examine the net effects of a set of explanatory variables\n\n| Family planning utilizations  | Responses  | Frequency (%)  | 95%(CI)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Current family planning utilization  | Yes  | 548(83.8)  | 81.2-86.8  |\n| Current family planning utilization  | No  | 106(16.2)  | 13.2-18.8  |\n| Use contraceptive methods in addition to Condom (dual contraceptive use)  | Yes  | 425(73.8)  | 70.0-77.3  |\n| Use contraceptive methods in addition to Condom (dual contraceptive use)  | No  | 151(26.2)  | 22.7-30.0  |\n| Consistently use the dual methods (N=425)  | Yes  | 343(80.7)  | 76.7-84.2  |\n| Consistently use the dual methods (N=425)  | No  | 82(19.3)  | 15.8-23.3  |\n| Sustain use of dual methods (N=425)  | Yes  | 306(72.0)  | 67.5-76.5  |\n| Sustain use of dual methods (N=425)  | No  | 119(28.0)  | 23.5-32.5  |\n| Reason for dual contraceptive use/use contraceptive methods in addition to condom  | Dual protection (unwanted pregnancy/ STI/HIV)  | 386(90.8)  |  |\n| Reason for dual contraceptive use/use contraceptive methods in addition to condom  | with new strain to protect a negative partner  | 13(3.1)  |  |\n| Reason for dual contraceptive use/use contraceptive methods in addition to condom  | Advice by health workers  | 20(4.7)  |  |\n| Reason for dual contraceptive use/use contraceptive methods in addition to condom  | Fear of re-infection  | 6(1.4)  |  |\n| Discussed with a partner about dual contraceptive utilization  | Yes  | 427(65.3)  |  |\n| Discussed with a partner about dual contraceptive utilization  | No  | 220(33.6)  |  |\n| Discussed with a partner about dual contraceptive utilization  | Have no partner  | 7(1.1)  |  |\n| Discussed with healthcare providers about dual contraceptive utilization  | Yes  | 543 (83.0)  |  |\n| Discussed with healthcare providers about dual contraceptive utilization  | No  | 111(17.0)  |  |\n\n【66】Table 5： Factors associated with dual contraceptive methods used at multivariable logistic regression (AOR， 95%Cl) in Oromia， Ethiopia删除4:<u> 2018</u>.\n\n| Factors associated with dual contraceptive utilization  |  | Dual methods use  |  | P-value  | AOR (95% CI})  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Factors associated with dual contraceptive utilization  |  | Yes  | No  | P-value  | AOR (95% CI})  |\n| Family planning counseled  | Yes  | 281(48.8)  | 45(7.8)  | 0.024  | 2.18(1.109-4.27)\\  |\n| Family planning counseled  | No  | 144(25.0)  | 106(18.4)  | 1：00  |  |\n| Discussec with heal thcare  | Yes  | 400(69.4)  | 100(17.4)  | 0.006  | 3.57(1.45-8.83)\\\\\\  |\n| Discussec with heal thcare  | No  | 25(4.3)  | 51(8.9)  | 1：00  |  |\n| Received family planning counseling on the efficacy of each method and side effects  | Yes  | 382(66.3)  | 83(14.4)  | 0  | 3.81(1.83-7.92)\\\\\\  |\n| Received family planning counseling on the efficacy of each method and side effects  | No  | 43(7.5)  | 68(11.8)  | 1：00  |  |\n| last pregnancy wanted/timed  | Yes  | 365(63.4)  | 92(16.0)  | 1：00  |  |\n| last pregnancy wanted/timed  | No  | 60(10.4)  | 59(10.2)  | 0.001  | 3.36(1.65-6.86)\\\\\\  |\n| ART providers knowledgeable and comfortable for providingintegrated family planning/HlV services  | Yes  | 366 (63.5)  | 109(18.9)  | 0.013  | 2.898(1.26-6.68)\\\\  |\n| ART providers knowledgeable and comfortable for providingintegrated family planning/HlV services  | No  | 59(10.2)  | 42(7.3)  | 1：00  |  |\n| Disclose HIV status to family  | Yes  | 366 (63.3)  | 89(15.5)  | 0  | 3.57(1.79-7.11)\\\\\\  |\n| Disclose HIV status to family  | No  | 59(10.8)  | 62(10.8)  | 1：00  |  |\n\nKeynote： \\\\\\p<0.001；\\\\p<0.01； \\p<0.05；Cl： Confidence Interval； AOR： Adjusted Odds Ratia|删除段之间换行|over the outcome variables and the Odds Ratios (OR) were adjusted for all other variables with 95% CIs. In this analysis， the outcome variables， current family planning utilizations， were dichotomized with “1\" being utilized and “0”not being utilized.\n\n【69】Two different models were fitted to investigate the factors predicting current family planning utilization. In testing the fitness of the logistic model， if the HL goodness-of-fit test statistic is greater than0.05， the model is considered as a well-fitting model， implying that the estimates of the model fit the data at an acceptable level. Accordingly， the HL test for the following two models showed chi-square p-values>0.05， which proved the goodness-of-fit of the applied models for this study at p=0.84 for the current family planning utilizations model.\n\nTable 5 provides evidence based on the stated criteria that the factors that were identified through binary logistic regression were age， marital status， family monthly income， residence， discussion|删除段之间换行|on dual method use with healthcare provider and with partner， knowledge family planning methods， number of sexual partners， previous pregnancy， future fertility desire， and partner's HIV status， respectively. These identified variables were entered into multiple logistic regression analyses.\n\n【71】Table 5 depicts that the respondents who had discussed family planning with healthcare providers during follow up were 2.9 times more likely to utilize family planning services as compared to those who had not. Women who had one or a single partner were at 2.7times higher odds of family planning utilization as compared to those who had two or more sexual partners.Moreover， women living with HIV whose last pregnancy was not intended were 2.6 times more likely to utilize family planning as compared to those who had intended their pregnancy.\n\nThe results further showthat women who had a sexualpartner with|删除段之间换行|the same serostatus (concordant and discordant) were 4.8 times and4.4 times more likely to utilize family planning services as compared to unknown serostatus partners. Those women of reproductive age who had disclosed their HIV result to their family were at 1.7 times higher odds of family planning utilization as compared to those women who did not disclose their serostatus.\n\n【73】This study identified factors which increased the likelihood of modern contraception utilization as including： Discussion with healthcare providers regarding family planning； knowledge about modern family planning， the number of sexual partners； previous unplanned pregnancy； partner’s HIV status； and disclosure status of HIV to their family. A partner’s HIV status and disclosure status of HIV to their family meant higher odds of family planning utilization among reproductive-aged women living with HIV in Oromia Region， Ethiopia.\n\n【74】Factors associated with dual contraceptive utilization\n\n【75】Table55 presents potential factors associated withdual contraceptive utilization from both binary and multiple logistic regressions. Logistic regression modeling was undertaken to examine the net effects of a set of explanatory variables over the outcome variables， and the ORs were adjusted for all other variables with95% CIs. In this analysis， the outcome variables， dual contraceptive utilizations were dichotomized with “1”being utilizing and“0”being not utilizing dual contraceptive methods. Two different models were fitted to investigate the factors predicting dual contraceptive utilization. Accordingly， the HL test for the following two models showed chi-square p-values >0.05， which proved the goodness-of-fit of the applied models for this study at p=0.74 for dual contraceptive methods use.\n\n【76】As presented in table， women who had attended family planning counseling during follow up were 2.18 times more likely to utilize dual contraceptive methods as compared to those who had not attended family planning counseling.\n\n【77】The reproductive-aged women who had discussions about family planning with their healthcare providers during follow up were also3.6 times more likely to utilize dual method services. Women who had received family planning counseling on the efficacy of each method， side effects and the mixed methods available to them were3.8 times more likely to have higher odds of dual method utilization as compared to women who had not received family planning counseling during follow-up.\n\n【78】Women of reproductive age who had a history of their last pregnancy being unwanted/unplanned were 3.36times more likely to use dual methods as compared to a wanted/planned pregnancy. Women who had received services from knowledgeable and comfortable ART providers of integrated family planning/HIV services had 2.9 times higher odds of dual method utilization as compared to those who were seen by unknowledgeable and uncomfortable ART providers.\n\nThose women of reproductive age who had disclosed their HIV status to their family had 3.57 times higher odds of dual method utilization as compared to those who had not disclosed their HIV status. This study identified factors that increased the likelihood of dualcontraception among reproductive-aged women living with HIV in Oromia Region， Ethiopia. These were found to be women who had discussed family planning with their healthcare provider and received family planning counseling about the efficacy of each method， the|删除段之间换行|side effects and the mixed method available； women who received services from knowledgeable and comfortable ART providers for providing integrated family planning/HIV services； women who had experienced a previous unplanned pregnancy； a partner’s HIV status and discloser of their HIV status to their family resulted in higher odds of dual contraception utilization.\n\n【80】Discussion\n\n【81】With regard to the residential area， the majority ofthe respondents(n=518，79.2%)， resided in urban areas， and 136 (20.8%) lived in the rural area. The socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents were not different from the socioeconomic profile ofEthiopia.Forexample， in the general population ofthe same region， Christian denominations dominate and represent 65% of the population， and the largest ethnic group is Oromo， followed by Amhara which represent 64% of the population (CSA 2016：33). The results are also similar in terms of the proportion of women who are currently married or living together with a partner (65%) in the general population (CSA 2016：34).\n\n【82】Unintended preghancy： familyplanningg2and dual contraceptive utilization\n\n【83】This study identified that 21.4% of last pregnancies were unintended， which is consistent with the findings of a study conducted by Heffronet et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The latter revealed that 21.2% of women were found to be pregnant during follow up； the pregnancy incidence rates were 16.3 (95% CI 14.9-17.7) per 100 person-years. A study done in Mumbai， India， found that 16.6% of women had unintended pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In contrast， a DHS conducted in 21low- and middle-income countries revealed that the unmet need for family planning， a pregnancy risk， family planning methods， and use of postpartum family planning remain high at 61%， while pregnancy risks can peak at 6 to 11 months after childbirth. The same study claims that women often rely on short-term methods only (51%to 96%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Another study conducted on HIV-infected clients in Lusaka found that 49% reported that the pregnancy was unplanned通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. There are thus still gaps in the provision of care and continued limited availability of long-acting contraception for those who need it. This observation could be explained by the fact that， as this study shows，strengtheningcounseling on dual contraceptive method use for effective protection are crucial among these populations. Moreover， the issue of unintended pregnancies would be particularly important in terms of its contribution to new pediatric HIV infections. It is thus vital that there be reconsideration on dual method use for effective protection of unintended pregnancies among this population.\n\n【84】The current study indicated that 94.9% ofwomen living with HIV were sexually active and 71.6% had used condoms， of which 61.9%always used condoms and 23.5% used condoms inconsistently. These findings were supported by a study conducted in Thailand which revealed that 82.3% of women were sexually active and 69.8% had used condoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. This observation could be explained by the fact that， as this study shows， some sexually active reproductive-aged groups still ignore the modes of HIV infection.\n\nThe proportion of current family planning utilization was 83.8%at 95% CI which ranged from 81.2% to 86.8% among women living with HIV. These findings were lower than what was reported in the previous study done in Thailand， which mentions that 96.3% of respondents had used a contraceptive method 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Also， a study in Cambodia reflected that 68.5% of respondents used contraceptive methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>， and South Ethiopia revealed that 77.4% used at least|删除段之间换行|one form of family planning method 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. These indicate the need for family planning among women living with HIV in family planning/HIV service settings. There is a need for increased comprehensive care in order to meet the women living with HIV's diverse need for integrated family planning/HIV services under one roof.\n\n【86】The prevalence of dual contraceptive utilization was 73.8% with95% CI of 70% to 77.3%， of which 80.7% were consistent， and 72%were sustained users of the dual method in Oromia Region， Ethiopia. This prevalence was high compared to previous studies conducted among respondents with similar characteristics. For instance， in Mumbai， India， it was reported that 69% of respondents wished to use dual contraceptive methods for effective protection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In Thailand，29.6% used dual contraceptive methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Different countries had the following prevalence： In Cambodia， 17.5% employed a dual contraceptive method 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>； South-East Nigeria reported that 27.2%had practiced dual method use， of which 26.8% used consistently in the preconception period but the majority (73.2%) sometimes used in an inconsistent way 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>； and a prospective study by 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> revealed 23.5% dual contraceptive prevalence and consistent use. This discrepancy may be due to the fact that 83.0% of recent study respondents had discussed dual method utilization with healthcare providers， and 65.3% with their sexual partner. Another possible contribution for this difference may due to service provision systems as evidenced from service providers and focal persons reporting that all health facilities offered sexual reproductive health services within HIV services with the same provider and offered on the same day， which accounts for 100% of respondents.\n\n【87】Determinants of contraceptive utilization among HIV infected women\n\n【88】This study identified factors that increased the likelihood of the use of modern contraceptives as women who had discussed family planning with healthcare providers； knowledgeability on modern family planning number of sexual partners； unintended last pregnancy； sexual partner HIV status； and discloser status to their families. These findings are in line with some previous studies'findings which identified the determinants of family planning utilization as obtaining family planning information from health facilities； awareness on MTCT； having a son； partner knowledge of HIV status； use of a contraceptive method prior to diagnosis of HIV； married or cohabiting couples； religion； age； wealth； education and having a child 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23，26，27\\]</u>.\n\nThis study identified factors that increased the likelihood of dual contraceptive use were women who had discussed family planning with healthcare providers； received family planning counseling on the efficacy of each method， side effects and the method mix available； had gotten services from knowledgeable and comfortable ART providers on integrated family planning/HIV services； had an unplanned previous pregnancy； had knowledge of their partner's HIV status； and discloser status of HIV to their family. These findings concur with some previous studies'which revealed determinants of dual contraceptive use as being female； receiving care； being aware of HIV status； being comfortable with asking a partner to use a condom； communication with a healthcare provider about family planning； household wealth； and HIV-positive women.

These findings demonstrate the importance ofintegrating reproductive health services into routine HIV care.

The identified determinants of modern family planning utilization were a discussion with healthcare providers in terms of family plannings knowledge about modern family planning； number of sexual partners； previous unplanned pregnancy； partner’s HIV status； and disclosure status of HIV to their family. These determinants signified higher odds of family planning utilization among women of reproductive age living with HIV in Oromia Region，Ethiopia.\n\n【92】The prevalence of dual contraceptive utilization was 73.8%， of which 80.7% were consistent and 72% were sustained users of the dual method in Oromia Region， Ethiopia. The identified factors associated with dual contraception method utilizations were discussion with healthcare providers regarding family planning； unplanned previous pregnancy partner’s HIV status； discloser status of HIV to their family； family planning counseling efficacy， and services from trained ART providers， respectively.\n\n【93】The current family planning utilization among women of reproductive age living with HIV was 548 (83.8%). The following were identified as determinants of current family planning among HIV-infected women in the area of study： Open discussion on modern family planning utilization with healthcare providers； being knowledgeable about modern family planning； number of sexual partners； previous unplanned pregnancy； partner’s HIV status； and disclosure status of HIV to their family. The last two factors led to higher odds of family planning utilization among women of reproductive age living with HIV in Oromia Region.\n\n【94】The study further established that contraception utilization was influenced by the fact that 608 (94.9%) respondents were sexually active during the last six months. Disclosure of HIV status added to the list whereby 589 (91.4%) respondents had disclosed their HIV serostatus to a regular sexual partner and 499 (76.3%) had disclosed to family.\n\n【95】Recommendation\n\n【96】Integrated family planning/HIV services contribute to the national family planning programs to provide full access to a variety of contraceptive methods so that couples and individuals can obtain the method that best suits their needs. The main contribution of the study to the level of health policy is as follows：\n\n【97】Increases consistent and sustainable dual contraceptive users among women of reproductive age living with HIV in Oromia Region， Ethiopia.\n\n【98】Provide quality counseling to improve the knowledge of reproductive-aged and empowered women by service providers on the integrated family planning/HIV services.\n\n【99】Healthcareprovideerrss shouldbeLtrained， equipped， and encouraged to take ownership of the implementation of the reproductive-aged women-centered integrated family planning/HIV strategic plan.\n\nStrengthening implementation of integration of family|删除段之间换行|planning and HIV services should lead to an increase in the utilization of family planning， dual contraceptive methods， need for family planning being met， prevent repeated unwanted pregnancy， and offer HIV services. This will ultimately improve the quality oflife of reproductive-aged women， the community， and families at large.\n\n【101】Facilitate capacitybuildingtraining forhealth professionals， health managers， and women living with HIV and peer educators， including mother-to-mother support groups， so that all key actors are equipped with the necessary skills in sexual reproductive health services， family planning， and HIV.\n\n【102】Innovate and scale-up best practices for the integration of maternal health service utilization with HIV program interventions.\n\n【103】Establish a policy framework for institutional implementation， monitoring and sectorial coordination aimed at promoting and integrating sexual reproductive health services， family planning， and HIV focused on reproductive-aged people living with HIV. The framework can be tailor-made across sectors with the set goals of improving treatment outcomes and quality of life for people living with HIV， especial women of reproductive age living with HIV.\n\n【104】Declarations\n\n【105】Ethics approval and consent to participate\n\n【106】The researcher submitted a letter seeking ethical approval and permission to conduct the study from the University of South Africa， and obtained ethical clearance (Ref.

Congenital malformation varies from patient to patient and may affect the skeletal system as well as organ systems. With an incidence of 1 to 5 per million， a highly variable phenotypic presentation with clinical manifestations makes difficult for diagnosis in some cases and Chromosomal Breakage Study induced by MMC (Mitomycin-C)/DEB(Diepoxybutane) provide a unique cellular marker for diagnosis.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： In this case report， a 4 year old Asian male child presented with tachypnea， progressive pallor， intermittent fever and non productive cough. He was found to be short stature， underweight for his age and had microcephaly.

He was born of 9 months of intrauterine life and delivered normally. After birth， the developmental milestones are delayed. Antenatally， mother had no specific complaints and was uneventful. He is the only child of his parents. Physical examination revealed patient had short stature as Height for Age (H/A) was below 3d percentile or 2 Standard Deviations. His Weight for Age (W/A) and Head Circumference was also below 3d percentile. He also had a triangular head， flat thenar eminence on the right hand with absent thumb on the same .\n\n【8】Further abdominal USG revealed absence of right kidney. Abdomen also showed outward projection of umbilicus which was not a herniation. Generalized hyperpigmentation with cafe au lait spots was present . Patient also had developmental delays along with learning disabilities. Peripheral smear revealed pancytopenia with anisocytosis. CBC revealed hemoglobin of 4 gm/dL. The platelet count was 20，000/uL which gradually improved on receiving PRBC and PC transfusions. ANC was decreased. Serum iron studies， B12 and Folic Acid levels were normal. Bone marrow was inconclusive due to hypoplasticity of the marrow. Echocardiography showed the presence of PDA . The blood and urine culture was sterile with normal thyroid profile. LFT and RFT were well within normal range. Patient also had very low oxygen saturation with a high respiratory rate. He was started on inhalation Oxygen.\n\nSystemic examination of the respiratory system revealed crepitations in bilateral lung fields and diffuse rhonchi. X-Ray investigations of the chest showed bilateral infiltrates suggestive of|删除段之间换行|pneumonia for which the patient was started on IV antibiotics which were soon stopped. Oxygen inhalation was gradually tapered off as respiratory distress improved. X-Ray of right arm showed absent radius bone along with bowing of ulna as well as Clinodactyly of the fingers . Absence of the right thumb is also evident. The left arm was normal. Karyotyping found normal male (46；XY) Cytogenic findings of Chromosomal Breakage Study with MMC and DEB which are DNA cross-linking agents confirmed the diagnosis of FA along with ruling out other differentials like Macrophage Activation Syndrome .

After anti-infective and anti-inflammatory treatment， the symptom of fever did not improve. However， the patient's temperature returned to normal after intravenous fluids were discontinued.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Our case illustrates an unusual ELP presenting with drug fever that makes differential diagnosis more complicated. Clinicians should be aware of ELP pneumonia， which may manifest as infectious pneumonia.\n\n【4】Keywords： Lipoid pneumonia； Drug fever； Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】C\n\n【7】Exogenous Lipoid Pneumonia (ELP) is a rare lung condition because of the inflammatory reaction caused by the presence of foreign fatty substances in the alveoli， its imaging findings are easily misdiagnosed as interstitial pneumonia or lung cancer. Diagnosis confirmation necessitates special staining of the Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) or lung biopsies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Drug fever is particularly problematic whenever it occurs among patients with non-infection， and drug fever can result in overutilization of anti-infectives and other agents trying to treat non-existing infections， possibly resulting in an increase in the risk of complications. By comparison and summary， Baron“et al\". found that all individuals with acute ELP had fever for several days to weeks \"while all the patients with chronic ELP had no fever\". However， this study did not describe in detail the patients fever type and peak body temperature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The clinical manifestations of ELP vary， patients mainly presenting chronic cough， and a small number of patients will have chest pain，hemoptysis， weight loss， intermittent fever and so on 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The diversity observed with cases of drug fever makes it difficult to form general conclusions. No study has shown a pathogenetic correlation between ELP and drug-induced fever， the complicated with drug fever in present case remind us that fever in ELP patients may not be associated with ELP.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\nA 76-year-old never smoking female， was admitted with fever and slight cough for 3 weeks. Fever symptoms occurred on December 06h， 2020 with a thermal peak of 39.5…C. Cough slightly with white foamy phlegm. Chest CT on December 09t， 2020 indicated diffuse inflammation in both lungs. One week after anti-infection treatment with cefoperazone/sulbactam and levofloxacin， reexamination on chest CT showed no improvement in the lung lesions. Then treatment with fluconazole and meropenem for 10 days， the patient's fever did not ease. Her past medical history consisted of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and cerebral infarction for many years. On December 25h， 2020， the subiect was transferred to our hospital for further treatment. Her WBC (White Blood Cell) count was 6.07 ×10° cells/L，N% 84.7%， C-reactive protein was 120mg/L. Procalcitonin was 0.08 ng/ml. Body temperature was 38.2C. To rule out infectious fever，|删除段之间换行|on December 28h， 2020， high throughput sequencing of the blood samples was detected， and test results showed that 36 sequences of Epstein-Barr virus and 4 sequences ofcytomegalovirus.On December29h，2020， blood samples were negative for aspergillus antigen test and cryptococcus gel qualitative test. Chest computed tomography scan on December 304， 2020，which shows bilateral consolidation in the lower lobes . Ultrasonic bronchoscope examination was performed on December 304， 2020， reveals that the wall of the air tube was mildly edematous， without of pus or necrosis . Cell classification results of BALF showed that neutrophils were 50%， lymphocytes 20%， histological cells 10%， columnar epithelial cells20%， and tumor cells were not found. Then the patient continued to be treated with antibiotics for an extra week， nevertheless the patient's fever persisted.\n\nOn January 06\"， 2021， pathological results of dorsal segment of the lower lobes reported that lipid-filled vacuoles associated with lipid-laden macrophages in alveolar septum and alveolar lumen. On further questioning the patient was hospitalized for|删除段之间换行|intestinal obstruction 1 month before admission， she received a total amount of 500 ml paraffin oil， and aspiration occurred for 3 times. Therefore， the diagnosis of ELP was made. Then， from January 06，2021， the patients were given methylprednisolone 60 mg/day for 6days. From January 12h， 2021， prednisone dose was reduced to 40mg/day. The puzzle was that the patient still had fever symptoms after anti-infective and anti-inflammatory treatment After excluding other factors， the possibility of drug fever was considered. Intravenous medication was stopped on January 084， 2021， and oral medication was retained. The patient's body temperature returned to normal on January 104，删除4:<u> 2021</u>. On January 15h， 2021， the patient had stable vital signs， without fever symptoms， and was discharged with prednisone 30 mg/day oral administration. The patient feels well and without adverse or unanticipated events during prednisone oral administration. The reexamination of chest CT on January 29h，2021indicated that the lesion in the lung was improved .\n\n【11】Discussion\n\nELP is an uncommon type of pneumonitis， resulting from|删除段之间换行|exogenous lipids of mineral， vegetal， or animal origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， which reach the alveoli by inhalation of volatile hydrocarbons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， or by aspiration of oil-based substances. Most ELP cases originate from mineral oil aspiration present in laxatives and oily nose drops 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The typical clinical manifestation of ELP constitutes a chronic cough manifesting with or without dyspnea along with the presence of diffuse interstitials infiltrates on imaging assessment of chest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. While， the patient in this case presented with persistent fever as the main clinical feature.\n\n【13】The clinical manifestations of ELP depend on the type， dosage，and frequency of lipids inhaled. Acute heavy inhalation can lead to fever， cough and dyspnea while chronic long-term inhalation may not show symptoms or only mild cough， expectoration， weight loss and other non-specific symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Hemoptysis is uncommon， with only one reported case in English language literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The symptoms of this patient in present report are insidious onset of cough， as well as fever， without dyspnea， similar to infectious pneumonia. We initially considered infectious fever according to the patient's lung lesions， so we gave adequate anti-infective therapy. However， chest CT reexamination 1 week after anti-infective treatment indicated that the patient's pulmonary lesions had not improved and fever was still present. After the patient's lung lesions were pathologically confirmed to be ELP， we adjusted the treatment plan and added methylprednisolone， but the patient's body temperature was still not well controlled. After excluding other factors， we considered that the patient might have a drug-induced fever. Due to the poor physical condition of the patient and the long duration of fever， there was not enough time to stop intravenous drugs successively to observe the changes in the patient's body temperature， so we chose to stop all intravenous drugs of the patient. The patient had no fever after discontinuation of intravenous drugs. Although we do not know exactly what medication caused the patient's fever， the patient's body temperature returned to normal after the intravenous medication was discontinued， so the diagnosis of drug-induced fever in this patient should be confirmed.\n\n【14】Physical exam findings of EL Pare those ofinterstitial lung disease. The lungs can be clear or have fine rales. As seen in our patient， we could hear distinct rales in the lower lobes of both lungs， which was consistent with the radiographic findings ofthe patient.\n\n【15】Due to its association with aspiration， the CT scan of ELP is usually patchy ground glass with thickening of intralobular septa and consolidation in both lower lungs along the bronchial vascular bundle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In addition， it can also be shown as isolated nodules with lobes and burrs， or mass shadow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， and these lesions may have high uptake during PET-CT and are difficult to distinguish from lung cancer.\n\nELP diagnosis is often a challenge because the symptoms， signs， along with the radiographic results are all a bit nonspecific. Although aspiration is the most common cause of ELP， patients may not be aware of inhaling irritating drugs because repeated small amounts of the fatty substance might not cause a significant cough-stimulating reflex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Notably， not all ELP cases originate from aspiration； some cases result from inhalation and nasal drop. Case reports have demonstrated that ELP can develop among vaper. Chronicinhalation of e-cigarette which contain of vegetable glycerin caused the patient to manifest with insidious onset cough， night sweats， progressive SV dyspnea on exertion along with fever， and was in respiratory failure on admission to hospital 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. While， the clinical use of mineral oils is even more widespread. Thus， the history of exposure to exogenous|删除段之间换行|lipids substances is a remarkable clue to the diagnosis of ELP. Histopathological examination is the gold standard for the diagnosis of ELP. Microscopically， foamy lymphocytes in the alveolar space can be seen. Floating oily foamy substance and fat globules are found in BALF， which are also of high diagnostic value for this disease.\n\n【17】It is evident in our case that the patient's diagnosis was delayed for several reasons. First of all， the patient was an elderly woman with fever， so the pulmonary lesions were primitively considered infectious disease.Secondly， there is a lack of detailed inquiry on the specific treatment of intestinal obstruction， causing the omission of a history of chemical irritants inhalation. In addition， the patient had no respiratory symptoms other than a cough， nonspecific clinical features. What's more， this patient had a clear history of cerebral infarction and GERD. A multicenter review revealed an incidence of80% ELP caused by aspiration in patients with intestinal obstruction and chronic constipation accompanied by GERD while using liquid paraffin and Vaseline as a laxative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This reminds us that patients with a history of chemical irritants aspiration， especially those with GERD or cerebral infarction， should be highly suspicious of ELP.\n\n【18】To date， ELP standardized treatment regimens have not been established. Recommendations for treating ELP are on the basis of clinical experience and not long-term observational studies. Because ELP is often associated with aspiration， prevention is important. Avoiding ongoing exposure， as well as providing supportive care constitutes the main stay of treatment. Antibiotic therapy alone is usually ineffective. Systemic corticosteroid treatment has been utilized successfully in some cases to dampen inflammatory response通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>. Nonetheless， corticosteroids might not be applied routinely on account of the severe side effects， and could be utilized if the lung injury is severe and ongoing. It has been reported that corticosteroid therapy on kerosene aspiration was ineffective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In this case our patient responded well to corticosteroids and CT assessments were improved after a month of treatment with corticosteroids. Bronchoscopic Alveolar Lavage (BAL) has treatment implications in some cases. Numerous case reports documented the effectiveness of treatment lung lavage for lipoid pneumonia， which washed away lipids directly， as well as improved lung opacities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15-17\\]</u>. However， in patients with respiratory failure or severe complications， BAL cannot be performed. Localized lobectomy may also be considered if medical treatment fails. In present case， two BAL were performed on the patient， but the results were not satisfactory.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】In conclusion， we report an exogenous lipoid pneumonia case associated with liquefied petrolatum that was complicated with drug fever. To the best of our knowledge， it is the first case which report that ELP complicated by drug fever. The clinical manifestations of ELP vary greatly， ranging from asymptomatic to severe life-threatening. As can be seen from this patient， patients with ELP still need to be alert to the possibility of complicated with other diseases when they have fever symptoms.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Father was known to have a heart murmur as a child that had resolvedspontaneously.TTherewasnosignificant family history of heart disease. Maternalserologyduring pregrancy and antenatal scans were normal On examination， the child was pink， warm and well perfused with saturations of 98% on air. Heart sounds I+II were normal with a harsh ejection systolic murmur (grade 3/6)，loudest at the left sternal edge but heard throughout the precordium. Femoral pulses were palpable bilaterally with normal character. Respiratory examination was unremarkable with no signs of increased work of breathing. No respiratory distress， sweating or colour change was observed during bottle-feeding. Abdomen was soft， non-tender， no organomegaly， and bowel sounds present. As per unit protocol， the baby was observed overnight on the postnatal ward and reassessed the following morning. Failure of the murmur to resolve over a 24 hour period led to further assessments， in line with hospital guidelines， to identify the aetiology. Pre and post-ductal saturations (98% and 96% respectively) and pre and post-ductal blood pressure (78/52 mm and 97/46 mm respectively) were checked and were normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was also done and reported as normal.\n\n删除1:<u>Copyright @ 2016 Idowu O.

Although this would have been the recommended action， a clinical decision was made to undertake an echocardiogram in view of the character and grade of murmur， which suggested the possibility of a pathologic murmur secondary to a congenital heart defect.\n\n【9】The echocardiogram revealed normal sitils， normal atrioventricular and ventriculo- arterial connections. Atrial septum and ventricular septum were intact and arterial duct was not patent. No left ventricular outflow obstruction was noted. However， turbulence and acceleration of flow at the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) was detected， suggesting narrowing of the RVOT. The RVOT Doppler was 3.4m/sec leading to a diagnosis of moderate pulmonary stenosis.\n\n【10】Although the echocardiographic diagnosis by itself did not prompt an early review in view of the age of the child， an earlier follow up of two weeks was arranged.\n\nAt followup， the patient remained clinically well and asymptomatic. Saturations were 97% on air and cardiac and systemic examinationwas as before. However， repeat echocardiogram revealed that the narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract had|删除段之间换行|increased significantly with a RVOT Doppler of more than 4m/sec. Moreover， the right ventricular out flow tract was noted to be narrow and elongated with an abnormal squashed appearance . The accelerated change in the degree of stenosis combined with the unusual appearance of the RVOT，led to the patient being referred to a tertiary paediatric cardiology centre for urgent assessment.\n\n【12】Investigations\n\n【13】At the tertiary centre a repeat echocardiogram confirmed the suspicious findings and furtherurgent radiological investigations were arranged. Chest X-ray showed a prominent superior mediastinum. The CT scan revealed a single， discrete mass lesion lying in the anterior mediastinum measuring 17x20x27mm. The mass was seen to be compressing the RVOT and sub-valvar pulmonary trunk . Differential diagnosis for the mass was a thymic cyst or teratoma(although no intralesional fat or calcification was visible). MRI scan was requested for further information however， the origin of the mass was inconclusive. Neither imagining could determine whether the mass was intra or extra-cardiac in origin .\n\n【14】Treatment\n\nIn1light of theaccelerated d growthhof the mass and failure to determineits originnandprimary source， surgical exploration and excision of the tumour Was decided with patch repair of the rightventricular outflow tract|删除段之间换行|The procedure involved creating a median sternotomy in order to gain access and visualization. A subtotal thymectomy was then performed. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established between the ascending aorta and bicaval cannulation. Upon establishment， the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested with cold crystalloid cardioplegia administered via the aortic root. The RVOT was identified and the tumour completely excised using sharp dissection and diathermy. Consequently， a large defect remained in the RVOT， immediately beneath the pulmonary valve. This was repaired using a patch of bovine pericardium. Finally， the heart was de-aired and the cross clamp removed with a vent on the aortic root. The heart was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass， following rewarming， in sinus rhythm. No inotropic support was required.\n\n【16】Findings from the procedure revealed that the thymus was normal in appearance and the mass clearly arose from within the myocardium of the RVOT with the left arterial descending artery to the left and a marginal branch of the right coronary artery to the right of the mass. The tumour was noted to have a bosselated surface， to be well demarcated and closely adherent to the myocardium at the edges with no true plane between them. Histology report revealed that the mass was a cardiac fibroma.\n\n【17】Outcome and follow-up\n\n【18】Surgery was successful and on post-op review the child was fit and well. On examination he was pink and well perfused. Saturations of 98% and heart sounds I+II present with no added sounds. Echocardiogram showed good biventricular function with laminar flow in the right ventricular outflow tract. No compression was detected and there was no evidence suggestive of cardiac tumour or pericardial effusion.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Primary cardiac tumours within the paediatric community are rare， with a prevalence of 0.0017 to 0.02%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. They are particularly uncommon in infancy with a handful of case reports describing them. Most of the tumours are benign with rhabdomyomas， fibromas and teratomas accounting for the majority of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Due to the rarity and variability in presentation of cardiac tumours， they pose a clinical challenge to diagnose. Heart murmurs on the other hand are verycommon in children and infants (including neonates) and are often innocent or secondary to congenital heart disease. It is not usual for a diagnosis of cardiac tumour to be considered by the clinician who on auscultation discovers that a child has a heart murmur.\n\n【22】Presentation depends on the size and location of the mass rather than the histologic type as they have a tendency to produce obstruction of the inflow or outflow tracts or induce arrhythmias通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-5\\]</u>. Cyanosis， breathlessness and ventricular arrhythmias have all been described as presenting features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The symptoms and signs created by the cardiac tumour can also be used to clinically speculate whether it is arising from the right or left hand side ofthe heart. Right-sided cardiac tumours are likely to present with associated syncope， cyanosis， vena-cava shunt syndrome， pulmonary embolisms and/or pericardial effusions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. On the other hand， left sided tumours are likely to result in embolisation causing transient ischaemic attacks， seizures， and/or peripheral vascular and/or cerebral vascular accidents \\[21.\n\n【23】with the above mentioned symptoms as it often leads to a thorough assessment including cardiac imaging. It is a much greater challenge in the asymptomatic child where the clinical condition is unlikely to trigger prompt cardiac imaging. Worryingly， sudden death is recognized as a presenting feature suggesting that children with cardiac tumours may have no clinical clues before presenting with Lrecc catastrophic collapse. Certainly fibromas have been recognized to present with significant cardiac compromise including sudden death. A very similar， but symptomatic case (with cyanosis and progressive dyspnoea)， has been described involving an 8-month old infant with RVOT obstruction secondary to a large cardiac fibroma (5x4.5cm)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【24】In our case， although the baby was asymptomatic，the pathologic nature of the murmur and the age at presentation prompted an early echocardiographic assessment and early diagnosis.\n\n【25】Echocardiogram， CT and MRI scans are first line in providing diagnosticCinformationforevaluation of cardiactumours. Echocardiogram allows for a dynamic， structural view of the heart aiding in identifying any masses alongside evaluating the mobility of the tumour. In addition， it allows one to view the effect that the tumour is having upon the surrounding structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. MRI is generally a better imaging modality than CT although both are of value. Diagnosing the type of tumour can be more reliably made with a MRI scan as the T1 and T2 weighted sequences can give clues about the microenvironment within the tumour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5，8-10\\]</u>. PET scan， coronary angiogram and transvenous biopsy are also useful diagnostic tests depending on the clinical context 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Histological diagnosis however， remains the gold standard for determining the type of tumour.\n\n【26】Fibromas are the second most common cardiac tumours in infancy but rank first in surgical series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. They often arise within the ventricular muscle， most commonly the ventricular septum although can also arise from within the free walls of the ventricles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Unlike rhabdomyomas， they do not spontaneously resolve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. They can cause obstruction to blood flow， valvular dysfunction， arrhythmias， syncope and/or sudden death in 10-30% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13-15\\]</u>. Of arrhythmias associated with cardiac fibromas， ventriculartachycardia accounts for50%删除4:<u> 13</u>. Although for many cardiac tumours， especially rhabdomyomas， watchful waiting is an acceptable management option， surgery， if needed， is usually safe and definitive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. However， watchful waiting is not applicable to fibromas which are not known to undergo spontaneous regression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In fact， in the case of cardiac fibromas， surgery should be offered early because of their tendency to grow fast and cause severe haemodynamic complications. Ideally complete surgical resection with chamber reconstruction using pericardial patch should be done and this was achieved in our case. However， excellent midterm results have been achieved even with partial resection and hybrid procedures using BT shunt or bidirectional cavopulmonary connection to offload the right ventricle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，17，18\\]</u>. In cases with persistent arrhythmias in the setting of a non- resectable tumour，ICD implantation may be needed. Rarely the only treatment option possible may be cardiac transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，19\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Learning Points\n\n【28】1\\. Although rare， cardiac tumours should be considered in the differential diagnosis of paediatric cases presenting with unexplained murmurs， heart failure or arrhythmia.\n\n【29】2\\. Once a diagnosis of a cardiac tumour is suspected prompt and thorough assessment using a variety of cardiac imaging modalities including echocardiography， CT and MRI scanning should be arranged in a tertiary cardiac centre. This is important as some of the cardiac tumours can grow rapidly with significant development of cardiac compromise and even sudden death.\n\n【30】3\\. Cardiac tumours have the potential to cause serious cardiac compromise and death but if diagnosed in a timely manner and managed appropriately with surgical intervention the prognosis is good in most cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Speculum examination revealed a huge polyp occupying the cervix and extending further downwards. On operation， it turned out to be an endometrial polyp arising from the fundus. Histologically the polyp showed classical features of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma； confirmed immunochemically.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Rhabdomyosarcoma of uterus is an unusual sarcomatous tumor in gynecologic practice； and when seen it is associated as a component of carcinosarcoma； considered now as a classical example of epithelial mesenchymal transition tumor in human.\n\n【4】Oncogenesis\n\n【5】As a distinct tumor， this is recognized long back in 1968 by Enter line and Horn 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Later was analyzed in detail a large survey of 112 cases by Enzinger and Shiraki 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The oldest patient in their series was 58 years. Parham and Barr 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> succinctly defined it as cellular sarcomatous neoplasm； containing a monomorphous population of primitive cells and showing skeletal muscle differentiation.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】The main complaints of this 70 year old lady was foul smelling vaginal discharge for few months and post menopausal bleeding for a month. Speculum revealed a fungating mass protruding into the cervix and vagina. Subsequently a total abdominal hysterectomy with BSO was done. A large polypoidal mass (5 cmx5 cmx4 cm)； fleshy in nature was arising from fundus and occupying the entire uterus and cervix. There were two other smaller polyps， were friable， necrotic and partly gangrenous at its tip. Microscopically it was moderately cellular； separated by thick fibrovascular septa. Pseudo alveolar spaces were seen throughout this neoplasm， constituting more than 50% of the tumor showing features consistent with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) . The non cohesive cells contained in these spaces are mostly nondescript. Classical rhabdomyoblasts with round morphology and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm were noticed in their midst， strap and racquet shaped cells being rare. Bulbous cells were arranged at the periphery sticking to the walls of septa. In addition， in few sections a spindle shaped sarcomatous growth； with fasciculated pattern co-existed with the above but not mixing with predominantly primitive cells featuring leiomyosarcoma (LMS). This collison tumor showed multiple foci of coagulative necrosis with a mitotic rate of 10 per 10 high power field. The abrupt transition between ARMS and low grade LMS was surprisingly distinct and morphologically heterogenous . Immunochemistry was done to confirm the nature of the neoplastic cells； proving thereby the histogenesis of this tumor conclusively. The tumor cells were strongly positive for skeletal muscle markers like cytoplasmic desmin， muscle specific actin and nuclear positivity for myogenin D. Cytokeratin was positive for benign endometrial glands； distributed singly amidst malignant cells .\n\n【8】Discussion\n\nEndometrial polyps at this age are unusual； most often are due to Malignant Mixed Mullerian Tumor (MMMT) or rarely due to adenocarcinoma arising from EIN in endometrial polyp. The rarity of this tumor is well illustrated in the IRS study dealing with ARMS； in which only eight|删除段之间换行|such cases were of genitourinary system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The histological hallmark of this neoplasm of pseudo-alveolar spaces amidst solidly arranged tumor cells； after downgrading its extent from 75% to 50%helped to diagnose this condition better and realistically. Another histological feature like detecting many forms of rhabdomyoblasts amidst nondescript cells arranged solidly as well as in pseudo alveolar spaces helped to diagnose this condition accurately and rule out other possibilities like small cell synovial sarcoma， malignant lymphoma， small blue cell tumors and solid carcinomas of epithelial origin.\n\n【10】After the advent of immunochemistry， the diagnosis can be firmly established by employing myogenic transcription factors； myogenin and Myo-D1. They are transcriptional regulatory proteins expressed early in muscle differentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> and display a nuclear staining pattern. In a recent review of 956 cases， myogenin and MyoD1 showed a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 90% and 95% respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Myogenin is considered technically superior to other markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Though Ober long ago recognized malignant mesenchymal tumors of uterus as homologous or hetero logous or mixed， the number of case reported as mixed is still rare； particularly collison tumor as described in this patient.\n\n【12】Reported cases of ARMS involving uterus are rare and when compared with the case under discussion differed markedly in presentation. Fukanya 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported a case of ARMS of uterine corpus in a 70 year old woman with the tumor replacing the wall of the body of uterus by multiple friable nodules. She developed extensive metastases and died 12 months after surgery. The second such case通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> was in a 21yr old lady； unique for uterine inversion secondary to ARMS. The last such case was seen in a 44 year old African woman通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>； presenting with widespread disseminated tumor and involving all abdominal viscera. It is clear the case details recorded in our patient differed vastly from other reported cases and appears unique. We feel from our experience myogenin immunochemistry in future will help to discover many more cases and to plan for effective therapy in such patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "032537ba-4d02-4c50-b530-ae3f9d609014", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background\n\n【1】Epidural hematomas are manifested by symptoms that may be indistinguishable from herniated disc. Symptomatic epidural hematomas are frequent in spinal operations. However， in clinical practice， cases have been identified following regional anesthesia in various types of surgeries. Asymptomatic， epidural hematoma may occur in 33% to 100% of patients undergoing lumbar decompression surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. The incidence rate of symptomatic postoperative epidural hematoma is 0.1% to 0.24%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. A meta-analysis of epidural hematomas showed that the most common cause was idiopathic， followed by using anticoagulant drugs and thirdly spinal procedures in combination with the use of anticoagulants. It represents a medical emergency because the neurological consequences include bowel and bladder dysfunction， saddle anesthesia， sciatica， motor weakness of the lower extremities and sexual dysfunction， which are also seen in cauda equina syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The occurrence of spinal epidural hematoma is exceedingly rare and was first described as a clinical diagnosis by Jackson in 1869 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The diagnosis is made with magnetic resonance imaging with a sensitivity of more than 90%. Regional anesthesia is the most used procedure during the resolution of pregnancy either by abdominal or vaginal delivery. A review of the literature found no reports of the usefulness of ultrasound as an accessible， fast，low-cost， and bedside tool for the diagnosis of epidural hematoma， as a complication of obstetric regional anesthesia. The objective of this article is to report the diagnostic utility of ultrasound for the identification of epidural hematoma and epidural edema in two women with neurological symptoms in the immediate puerperium. Obtaining images like magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n【2】Case 1\n\n【3】A 32-year-old female， 35 weeks pregnant， history of 3 pregnancies， 3 cesarean sections， no chronic disease. Scheduled for cesarean section and obstetric hysterectomy secondary to placental accretism， through regional anesthesia with epidural approach， sterile cleft field is placed， infiltration of skin and subcutaneous cellular tissue， we proceed to the placement of regional anesthesia technical Mixed BPD at L2-L3 level， Tuohy 17， loss of Pitkin + resistance， at the first traumatic attempt， locating peridural space. Whitacre No. 25 needle is introduced， obtaining clear CSF， when starting dose administration， the patient reported pain and paresthesia in both extremities， so the procedure was restarted. Once the epidural space was located， Whitacre needle was introduced，and clear cerebrospinal fluid was obtained. Anesthetic dose was administered with hyperbaric bupivacaine 6.5 mg+ sufentanil 5 mcg， morphine 100 mcg and dexmedetomidine 5mcg without complications. Whitacre needle was removed and a peridural catheter was placed in cephalic direction， permeable without blood or cerebrospinal fluid return，latency 30\"， extension T6\n\nBromage IV. During the surgical procedure she presented obstetric hemorrhage of 3，200 mL and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for hemodynamic monitoring and organic support. Laboratory tests in the first 12 h of stay with blood biometry leukocytes 7，900 cells/m’， hemoglobin 8.1 g/dL， hematocrit 23.7%， platelets 142，000 cells/mm， Tp删除4:<u> 10</u>. 8 sec， TPTa 22.3 sec； INR 1.03， sodium 138 mmol/L， potassium 3.5 mmol/L， chlorine 102 mmol/L， calcium 7.4 mg/dL， magnesium 1.9 mg/dL， creatinine 0.5 mg/dL， urea 19 mg/dL. The clinical picture begins 12 h after the surgical procedure with sudden pain in the right lower extremity， intensity 9/10， with limitation of mobility， paresis， and paresthesia at the level of the dermatomal dermatomes T12， L1， L2. Muscle weakness on extension and flexion34 in comparison with the left pelvic limb. Ultrasound was performed with general electric Logiq E9 equipment， with a 10 mhz linear transducer； the patient was placed in the left lateral cubitus position and insonation was performed with tracking to 3 interventebral spaces above the puncture site and 3 below. This technique allows the identification of the following structures： Skin， muscle mass， bone structures， intervertebral spaces， and epidural space. During insonation deformation and amplitude of the epidural space of 4cm x 1.3 cm is visualized and anechoic image is observed from T12to L2 subjective of epidural hematoma . The patient is hemodynamically stable for the following hours and requires management with analgesic and gabapentin 300 mg every 12 h. In order to corroborate the diagnosis was requested nuclear magnetic resonance which reports； at the height of L1 and in the interior of the spinal cord a nodular image of 2 cm long hyperintense in the T2|删除段之间换行|fixed at 12 cm， latency of 5 min is given， obtaining motor and sensitive blockuntil T4， surgicalprocedure begins，laboratorytests in the first 12h of stay with blood biometry leukocytes 10，600 cells/m’， hemoglobin9 gr/dL， hematocrit删除4:<u> 29</u>. 8%， platelets 195，000 cells/mm， Tp 10.9 sec， TPTa 24.2 sec； INR 1.04，sodium 137 mmol/L，potassium 3.8 mmol/L， chlorine 109 mmol/L， calcium 9.1 mg/dL， magnesium 2.0 mg/dL， creatinine 0.4 mg/dL， urea 27 mg/dL. After regional anesthesia was Pperformed during the surgical event， he presented a hemorrhage of1300 mL and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for monitoring and organic support， During her stay she presented paresis and paresthesia of the right pelvic limb， pain in the right pelvic limb 8/10， ipsilateral osteotendinous reflexes abolished， sensitivity preserved； Ultrasound was performed with general electric Logiq E9 equipment， with a 10 mhz linear transducer， the patient was placed in left lateral cubitus position and insonation was performed with tracing to 3intervertebral spaces above the puncture site and 3 below， identifying images suggestive of epidural hematoma of approximately 7 cm ×2cm in rostro caudal direction， L1-L2 . Lumbar MRI was performed， which showed epiduralhematoma in early subacute stage of 7.4 cm x0.7 cm ×1.4 cm in rostro caudal， ventral dorsal and lateral direction respectively， extending from T12 to L2. Dorsal L1-L2 disc annulus bulging dorsal to right medial non-contacting. Tangential fissure of annular fibers.Non-contacting dorsal L5-S1 disc protrusion with tangential fissure ofexternal annular fibers . Due to the neurological deficit， surgical intervention was necessary and drainage of 200 mL of hematic content was performed through laminectomy of L1-L2. The patient was discharged after 8 days of hospital stay with resolution of symptoms.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\nNeuraxial techniques are used to provide analgesia during labor通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u> and anesthesia for operative delivery. In a meta-analysis it was noted that in publications after 1990 there is an estimated incidence of epidural hematoma 1 in 168，000 obstetric anesthesia， persistent neurologic injury occurs in 1 in 257，000 and transient neurologic injury 1 in 5，537. In our center these two cases occurred out of 2，502obstetric anesthetic procedures. (79.9 cases per 100，000 live births). In these cases， acute and severe lumbar pain， radiating to the right lower extremity and paresthesias were the first signs reported by the patients. This clinical picture is like other cases published by Alessandro Svelato 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> in a 44-year-old woman following caesarean|删除段之间换行|section where epidural hematoma requiring laminectomy was also found. A delay in diagnostic imaging can lead to devastating results， as neurological symptoms and low back pain can be erroneously attributed to epidural infusion of drugs or a prolonged effect of the local anesthetic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【7】The presence of spinal cord compression is an indication for surgery. In the case of transient motor deficit with MRI evidence of epidural hematoma， as in our case， decompression laminectomy within the first 12 h offers the best surgical outcome 通用删除7(英):<u>(3， 15，16)</u>. However， the literature reports cases of good evolution also in the case of surgery performed after 24 h from the onset of symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. To avoid chronic complications surgery is an option to improve the results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Ultrasound is a tool that has allowed diagnostic imaging in different clinical scenarios because it can be used in a feasible way， due to its low cost， without major intervention， at the patients bedside and with immediate results. These cases reflect how using ultrasound of the lumbar spine it is possible to evaluate the epidural space， intervertebral space， bone， and muscle structures as well as the presence of edema and epidural hematoma. This is the first article that explores the usefulness of this diagnostic tool in pregnancy and puerperium.\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】Ultrasound examination of the puncture site area in regional anesthesia in women， with symptoms and/or neurological deficits allows the identification of edema and epidural hematomas that help to reduce neurological complications as well as subsequent transient sequel during pregnancy and puerperium.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We present a case of a flare of proctitis due to primary herpes simplex 2 infection. We then outline the most common causes of proctitis， particularly infectious proctitis， highlighting the importance of obtaining a detailed sexual history in all patients with a flare of inflammatory bowel disease. Finally， we discuss the considerations and challenges of balancing immunomodulation and antiviral therapy in a viral flare of inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 24-year-old man presented with four days of intermittent fevers>38C and frequent bloody diarrhoea. This was on a background of a five-year diagnosis of Ulcerative Colitis (UC) with known moderate rectosigmoid involvement， initially treated with oral and Per Rectal (PR) mesalazine， which he had subsequently self-ceased.\n\n【4】A month prior to presentation， he developed PR bleeding and mucous stools. Outpatient colonoscopy revealed mildly active chronic proctitis. He was treated with a course of prednisolone and recommenced mesalazine. After initial partial improvement his symptoms worsened.\n\n【5】Blood tests demonstrated elevated C-Reactive Peptide (CRP) (peak of 82.2 mg/L) and abnormal liver enzymes (bilirubin 9， ALT 123， AST 63， GGT 125， ALP 63) but normal leukocyte count. Abdominal X-ray was unremarkable. Blood， urine and faecal cultures were negative. Flexible sigmoidoscopy detected severe Mayo 3 colitis in the distal 5 cm of the rectum only， with a dusky appearance and deep ulceration with mucopurulent exudate nottypical ofUC . Subsequent computed tomography scan excluded perforation and ischaemia.\n\n【6】He was empirically treated with intravenous ceftriaxone， metronidazole and hydrocortisone. Azathioprine was commenced after several days. Whilst his temperatures defervesced and CRP improved，he had ongoing symptoms， prompting consideration of alternative diagnoses. Subsequent questioning revealed an episode of unprotected receptive anal sex with a male a fortnight prior to the flare. Testing for sexual transmitted infections returned positive results for Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV2) both on polymerase chain reaction testing of the biopsy and on serology (IgM and IgG positive). HIV testing was negative. Valaciclovir was commenced on day 7 and the patient’s condition improved. Salvage therapy with infliximab was started four days later due to persistent rectal pain and PR bleeding.

Thus a diagnosis of flare of UC due to primary HSV2 infection was made.

A 23-year-old Japanese woman (gravida 1，para 0) was referred to our hospital at 19 weeks and 0 days gestation with the fetus having severe shortening of the long bones. According to ultrasonographic examination， thanatophoric dysplasia type 1 or ACG2 was suspected. Therefore， we performed three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) which showed the lack of ossification of the fetal vertebral bodies clearly. We diagnosed ACG2， and the parents decided on termination of the pregnancy. Here we report a case of ACG2 that was clearly identified with 3D-CT in the early second trimester.\n\n【2】Keywords： Achondrogenesis； Prenatal diagnosis； Three-dimensional computed tomography\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Achondrogenesis type 2 (ACG2) is a lethal disorder that presents with a large skull， very small and short limbs， and a lack of mineralization of most vertebral bodies. The pelvis has small iliac wings with absent ischia， pubic bones， and sacral elements. The extremities show severe rhizomelia and mesomelia with relative sparing of the hands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It occurs in approximately1 in 20，000 births and is caused by a dominant mutation in the type 2 collagen gene (COL2A1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. However， it is difficult to diagnose it exactly， because there are more than 150 different classification in skeletal dysplasia disease， of which many are extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Recent studies have suggested that three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) is more accurate than ultrasound for prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The morphology of the spine and pelvic bones is often inconspicuous on ultrasound， and an accurate diagnosis can be difficult using only ultrasound. On the other hand， 3D-CT can more precisely evaluate the skull， ribs， pelvic bones， vertebrae， and bone mineralization regardless of fetal position or amniotic fluid volume. Here we report a case of ACG2 that was clearly identified on 3D-CT in the early second trimester.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\nA 23-year-old Japanese woman (gravida 1， para 0) was referred to our hospital at 19 weeks and 0 days gestation with the fetus having severe shortening of the long bones. She had no history of drug or alcohol abuse and no relevant family history. Additionally， she had no complication and any history of infection in the first of pregnancy. She had no screening of fetus by ultrasound scan from 11 weeks to 13 weeks. In 14 weeks gestation， her fetus was scanned only for measuring biparietal diameter. In 18 weeks gestation， severe shortening of the limbs was detected for the first time. In our hospital at 19 weeks gestation， ultrasonographic examination for the fetus revealed severe shortening of the limbs (-5.3 S.D.)， a narrow thorax， nuchal translucency， and no cloverleaf skull deformity. When pressing the skull of the fetus with the ultrasound probe， the skull was not deformed.No heart defects or other obvious structural abnormalities were identified|删除段之间换行|Based on these findings， thanatophoric dysplasia type 1 (TD1) or ACG2 was suspected. Therefore， we performed 3D-CT at 19 weeks of gestation. CT was performed with a multi-detector row CT unit (Aquillion ONE； Toshiba Medical Systems， Tokyo， Japan) with 3D adaptive iterative|删除段之间换行|dose reconstruction (AIDR3D). The data acquisition parameters were64X 0.5-mm detector collimation， a 0.5s rotation time， and exposure factors of 120 kV and 75 mAs. These figures clearly revealed a lack of ossification of the fetal vertebral bodies . This characteristic confirmed the prenatal diagnosis of ACG2. The parents decided on termination of the pregnancy. We dilated the cervix by osmotic dilators， inserted gemeprost， and then delivered the fetus， weighing 282 g·\n\n【8】Radiological evaluation of the fetus after the delivery showed findings consistent with ACG2 . It showed metaphyseal flaring and cupping of long bones， absence of talus and calcaneal ossification were observed more clearly than 3DCT. In addition， the molecular analysis of DNA obtained from placenta demonstrated mutation for a c.3427G>A transition (P.G1143S) in exon 40-54 of the COL2A1 gene.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Our case demonstrates that， even in the early second trimester， ACG2 is characterized by a lack of vertebral body ossification. Moreover， 3D-CT contributed to a precise diagnosis of ACG2. Ossification occurs at a relatively early human gestational age： the clavicle and mandible are ossified by 8 weeks； the appendicular skeleton， ileum and scapula by 12 weeks； and the metacarpals and metatarsals by 12-16 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Secondary (epiphyseal) ossification centers can be seen by radiographs by 20 weeks gestation. Since bone is echodense by ultrasound， the fetal bone is relatively well visualized by two-dimensional ultrasound in the second trimester of pregnancy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. However， the morphology of the spine and pelvic bones is often inconspicuous on ultrasound. In previous studies， 33-88% of ACG2cases were correctly diagnosed by ultrasonography in the prenatal period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\nIn this case， it was difficult to distinguish ACG2 from TD1. Both disorders are characterized by severe shortening of the limbs and a narrow thorax， but with ACG there is a lack of vertebral body ossification. However， the spine could not be clearly visualized in our case because the fetus was in the spine position. Accurate prenatal diagnosis allows physicians to provide appropriate counseling to families about perinatal lethality， consideration for focused molecular analysis， prediction of neonatal complications， recurrence risk， and maternal management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In addition a timely specific prenatal diagnosis is important because of termination laws. In Japan， the|删除段之间换行|decision to terminate a pregnancy must be made by 22 weeks gestation. To allow time for patient counseling， we recommend making a diagnosis by 20 weeks of gestation.\n\n【12】Ultrasound examination is useful because it is minimally invasive and easy； however， the resolution depends on the fetus position and amniotic fluid volume. On the other hand，3D-CT is able to provide a precise diagnosis even if there is almost no amniotic fluid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Recent studies have suggested that 3D-CT is more accurate than ultrasound for prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【13】This case showed a precise prenatal diagnosis of ACG2 by using3D-CT in the early second trimester. On the other hand，ACG2 was diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound at 12 weeks by Soothill in1993 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The authors showed that the fetus had severe generalized subcutaneous edema and short limbs by ultrasound scanning. In addition， radiological evaluation of the fetus after termination showed marked limb shortening with flaring and cupping of the metaphyseal ends of the long bones and ribs but no rib fractures. Immunocytochemistry showed the presence of type 1 collagen. They diagnosed ACG2 by those findings. However， the fetus in that case clearly had ossification of the fetal vertebral bodies； therefore， that casemightnot conform to the current ACG2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Including molecular analysis， we considered the possibility of osteogenesis imperfecta. Except for the above-mentioned case report， our report is the first report of a precise prenatal diagnosis of ACG2 in the early second trimester.\n\n【14】This is the first report of a precise prenatal diagnosis of ACG2using 3D-CT in the early second trimester. This case suggests that3D-CT can provide additional and more accurate information to diagnose fetal ACG2.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This study investigated the clinical features and outcomes of APE in patients with COVID-19.\n\n【2】Methods： Of 50 patients enrolled from a COVID-19 registry database， 5 patients presented with APE (APE group) and 45 did not (Non-APE \\[NAPE\\] group).\n\n【3】Results： Most clinical presentations and in-hospital courses were different between the groups. The APE group was older (P=0.001) and had higher prevalence of underlying diabetes (P=0.005)， hypertension (P=0.005)， coronary artery disease (P=0.001)， stroke/transient ischemic attack(P=0.001) and chronic renal failure (P=0.002). The APE group had significantly higher prevalence of sputum (P=0.002)， higher body temperature (P=0.004) and shock (P=0.002). The APE group had significantly higher prevalence of ST depression (P=0.023) and T-wave inversion (P=0.045). The APE group had significantly higher levels of high sensitivity-C Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)(P=0.007)， Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) (P=0.001) and procalciton in (P=0.001). The APE group had significantly higher prevalence of bilateral involvement (P=0.002) and multi-lobal involvement (P=0.001) of Ground Glass Opacities (GGO).

We approached 50 consecutive patients>18 years of age who were admitted to our hospital， a 509-bed referral center， for confirmed COVID-19 infection between 15 January and31s April，删除4:<u> 2020</u>. Real-Time Reverse-Transcription-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (RT-PCR) assay has been used for diagnosis of COVID-19. Fifty patients were divided into two subgroups according the presentation of APE at admission： Five (10%) patients presented with APE group and 45 did not (NAPE group). In the APE group， shock occurred in one patient at admission， and death in one during index hospitalization.\n\n【12】The medical records of patients with confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed， including demographicinformation， clinical manifestations， radiographic and laboratory and ECG findings. In all patients， ECGs， radiographic and laboratory studies were performed on the first hospital day.\n\n【13】APE was defined as the presence of a radiographic report ofPpulmonary alveolar/interstitialcongestion at initial chest roentgenogram and/or Computed Tomogram (CT) with at least two of the following physical signs： Pulmonary rales， elevated central venous pressure， and a third heart sound 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The gold standards for the diagnoses of APE determined by two cardiologists who independently reviewed all medical records. Shock was defined as a systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg f or ≥ 30 min that was not responsive to fluid administration alone，accompanied byevidence of tissue hypo-perfusion in the setting of clinically adequate or elevated LV filling pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a serum glucose level>126 mg/dl， a history of diabetes mellitus， or current use of anti-diabetic medications. Hypertension was defined as repeated measurements of a systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg， or previous anti-hypertensive medication treatment. Current smoking was defined as having smoked cigarettes<1 year before admission.\n\n【14】The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Seongnam Citizens Medical Center. The recommendations of the revised version of the Declaration of Helsinki were met.\n\n【15】Radiographic data\n\nChest roentgenograms and/or CTs were read initially by two radiologists who were masked with respect to the status of the patient’s illness. Three second radiologists reviewed the radiographic findings to determine the clinical significance of the findings. All patients underwent baseline-digital anteroposterior chest roentgenograms at full inspiration using a mobile chest radiograph machine (GM85， Samsung Healthcare； DRX-Revolution Mobile X-ray System， Seoul， Korea) and CT using a multi-detector CT scanner with128 channels. Two attending radiologists (with 30 and 40 years|删除段之间换行|of experience in chest imaging， respectively) reviewed the chest radiographs and CT images by consensus on a picture archiving and communication system (PACS， GE Healthcare). The readers assessed the presence， location， and density of parenchymal abnormalities on chest radiographs and the CT images， and graded the abnormalities using the following 4 patterns： 1) normal； 2) focal Ground Glass Opacities (GGO) involving no more than one segment or onelobe；3) multifocal GGO； and 4) diffuse GGO. After the initial assessment of the chest radiographs， we checked whether the abnormalities on chest radiographs corresponded to abnormalities on chest CT images.\n\n【17】CT protocol： All CT examinations were performed using a multi-detector CT scanner with 128 channels (Somatom Definition edge， Siemens Healthineers，Erlangen， Germany). The detailed parameters for CT acquisition were as follows： Tube voltage， 100 kVp； tube current， low-dose (reference mAs， 30) with automatic exposure control； slice thickness， 1.0 mm； reconstruction interval， 3.0 mm； and a sharp reconstruction kernel. CT images were obtained with the patient in the supine position at full inspiration and without contrast medium.\n\n【18】ECG\n\n【19】ECGs were read initially by two cardiologists who were masked with respect to the status of the patient’s illness. Two second cardiologists reviewed the ECGs to determine the clinical significance ofthe findings.\n\n【20】Laboratory data including procalcitonin\n\n【21】Blood samples were obtained from the antecubital vein into tubes containing lithium heparin， and then centrifuged. The blood samples were stored at -70°C until further analysis. Procalcitonin levels were measured using cobas e801 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics) and an Elecsys BRAHMS PCT kit (Roche Dignostics). The laboratory technicians were blinded to the patient identities and characteristics.\n\n【22】Statistical analysis\n\n【23】Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Pc+24.0 Software. Data for continuous variables are expressed as the mean ± SD. A Student's t-test was used to compare continuous variables， and a chi-square test was used to compare the categorical variables. Age， body temperature， systolic blood pressure， diastolic blood pressure， heart rate， respiratory rate， corrected QT interval， white blood count， hemoglobin， high sensitivity-C Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)， Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)， sodium， potassium， Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)， Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)， Creatinine， Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK)， Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)， procalcitonin levels， and hospital stay are given in terms of the median and Inter Quartile Range (IQR)， and the Mann-Whitney non-parametric U test was used to analyze differences in these parameters between the two groups because of wide standard deviation. Differences were considered statistically significant when p-values were <0.05.\n\n【24】Results\n\n【25】Clinical characteristics\n\n【26】The clinical characteristics and initial presentations of the APE and NAPE groups are compared in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. There were no significant differences in gender， body surface area， and the prevalence of current smoker status and underlying liver cirrhosis， bronchial asthma and malignancy between the two groups.

Second， the APE group may have higher in-hospital mortality than the NAPE group. Third， A meticulous diagnostic and therapeutic approach should be considered for elderly patients with COVID-19 having diabetes， hypertension， coronary artery disease， chronic renal failure， stroke， and ST depression and T-wave inversion， bilateral and/or multi-lobal involvement of GGO and high levels of ESR， hs-CRP and procalcitonin at the time of admission.\n\n【47】Overall， the clinical features of COVID-19 were similar to published studies in other areas of the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4，10-13\\]</u>.

Although data of gender preponderance in patient with COVID-19 show equal numbers of cases between men and women so far， there seem to be sex differences in mortality and vulnerability to the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-13\\]</u>. Emerging evidence suggests that more men than women are dying， potentially due to sex-based immunological or gendered differences， such as patterns and prevalence of smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-13\\]</u>. However， current data of gender preponderance are incomplete， cautioning against early assumptions because data from China suggest that more than90% of health-care workers in Hubei province are women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-13\\]</u>.\n\n【51】Similar to previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-13\\]</u>， our data showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was febrile sensation， followed by myalgia， cough and sore throat. The most prevalent co morbidities were hypertension and diabetes， followed by coronary artery disease.\n\n【52】A notable finding was that the APE group had a significantly higher prevalence of underlying diseases than the NAPE group. The possible explanation of this preponderance in the APE group is that underlying diseases such as older age， presence of diabetes， hypertension， coronary artery disease， chronic renal failure， stroke/transient ischemic attack， may affect immune competence of patients with COVID-19. The previous findings showing older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14-16\\]</u>，in addition to the results of our study， points to a role for the underlying diseases in producing or exacerbating severe symptoms and signs.\n\n【53】In our study，the APE group had significantly higher procalcitonin levels than the NAPE group. The levels of procalcitonin level can be markedly elevated during the acute phase in most septic conditions通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17-19\\]</u> as well as acute heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20-22\\]</u>，and higher procalcitonin levels in patients with COVID-19 concomitant with APE might reflect the greater extent of affected and/or injured myocardium compared with those without APE. Our data have not demonstrated that elevated procalcitonin levels were independent predictors of APE in contrast with recent studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20-22\\]</u>. This discrepancy with our data may be due to differences in scale of study population and heterogeneity in the condition between sepsis/inflammation and acute heart failure with pulmonary edema.\n\n【54】In the present study， the APE group had significantly higher CRP and ESR levels than the NAPE group. In COVID-19， the infiltration of the myocardium by inflammatory cells such as activated macrophages， may be considered to be a mechanism of myocardial injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23，24\\]</u>. Consistent with our data， recent studies reported that elevated ESR and CRP levels were found in patients with COVID-19\n\n【55】通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25，26\\]</u>. We supposed that higher ESR， hs-CRP， and procalcitonin levels might predict APE occurrence and could be used as a biomarker for predicting clinical course during index hospitalization in such patients.\n\n【56】Presently， the APE group had significantly higher prevalence of cardiac injury markers on ECG， such as ST segment depression and T wave inversion， than the NAPE group. The hypothesis is that the extent of the affected/injured myocardium couldbe smaller in patients with the NAPE group compared with APE group. These findings may indicate that the APE group had a greater extent of affected/injured myocardium and that in addition to these ECG markers， cardiac markers like brain natriuretic peptide， CK-MB and troponin-I may reflect this extent of affected myocardium.\n\n【57】In our study， the APE group had significantly higher prevalence of bilateral and/or diffuse GGO involvement than the NAPE group. These findings may indicate that greater extent oflung parenchymal inflammation and/or injury in the APE group had affected a greater extent of myocardium.\n\n【58】Recent studies reported that coronaviruses with single-stranded RNA， about 120 nanometers in diameter， enter host cells by harnessing the action of the angiotensin converting enzyme， ACE-2， which is expressed in the membranes of many cells in the body， including lung alveolar epithelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27-29\\]</u>. Reducing the activity of ACE-2 in cell membranes could theoretically reduce the ability of coronaviruses to penetrate cells. ACE-1 inhibitors， currently used to treat hypertension and heart failure， do not inhibit ACE-2 \\[27-291. In experimental animals， ACE-1 inhibitors and ARBs both increase the activity of cardiac ACE-2 because the presence of an increased amount of angiotensin I， due to inhibition of ACE-1， might tend to up regulate ACE-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. To our knowledge， studies that show an effect of ACE inhibitors or ARBs on ACE-2 expression or activity in lung are lacking. In addition， effects of rennin-angiotensin system inhibition on the COVID-19 are highly controversial. Interestingly， in our study， the APE group had a significantly higher proportion of patients who have used ACEI/ARB to treat hypertension before admission than the NAPE group. These findings are in concordance with the aforementioned reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27-30\\]</u>.However， we do not know whether the supposed benefits of ACE-1 inhibitors or ARBs duringan episode ofinfection with coronaviruses outweigh the potentialharms. It seems likely that it would be unwise to use either conventional ACE-1 inhibitors or ARBs to treat COVID-19 and patients who are already taking ACE-1 inhibitors or ARBs have generally been advised to continue taking their medicines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29，31\\]</u>.\n\n.our study， older age， presence of diabetes， hypertension，|删除段之间换行|coronary artery disease， chronic renal failure， stroke/transient ischemic attack and ST depression and T-wave inversion on ECG， bilateral and/or diffuse GGO involvement and higher levels of ESR， hs-CRP and procalcitonin at the time of admission may affect the development of APE in patients with COVID-19. Despite the inherent limitation of a retrospective analysis， our study suggests that risk stratification using these factors may allow physicians to identify patients with COVID-19 at high risk for APE for initial diagnosis and management.\n\n【60】Presently， the overall mortality was relatively lower than in previous studies (3.4% worldwide， 4.9% in Wuhan， 3.1% in Hubei province) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32，33\\]</u>. This discrepancy with our data may be due to differences in scale of study population and strength of meticulous diagnostic and therapeutic approach of COVID-19 under territorial health departments and state.\n\n【61】Study Limitations\n\n【62】There are some limitations that should be considered in our study. First， this is a retrospective analysis. The use of a retrospective medical record review may have contributed to information bias even though data of all patients from admission to discharge are standardized because COVID-19 has been strictly controlled under territorial health departments and state. Second， because the small number of case patients may not represent the full COVID-19 clinical spectrum， our study may have been underpowered to compare the differences between the two groups and these comparisons should be interpreted with caution. However， this is one of the largest studies in Republic of Korea to date to compare clinical characteristics， laboratory， radiographic and echo cardio graphic findings between the subgroups in detail published. Third， we did not perform systemic investigations of all patients， such as echocardiogram， cardiac enzyme such as troponin-T or I，brain natriuretic peptide levels， or pathology because ofhigh cost and high risk of contagion. Finally， we could not investigate asymptomatic cardiac involvement in adult patients with COVID-19 because of a retrospective design.\n\n【63】Conclusion\n\n【64】Our study demonstrated that the APE group had higher in-hospital mortality than the NAPE group. A meticulous diagnostic and therapeutic approach should be considered for elderly patients with COVID-19 having diabetes， hypertension， coronary artery disease， chronic renal failure， stroke/transient ischemic attack and ST depression and T-wave inversion on ECG，bilateral and/or diffuse GGO involvement on chest roentgenograms and higher levels of ESR， hs-CRP and procalcitonin at the time ofadmission.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

As imaging modalities improve， accessory spleens are frequently detected as an incidental finding on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonanc imaging (MRI) which may mimic a neoplasm. We report a case of intrapancreatic accessory spleen simulating a neuroendocrine neoplasm and a case of accessory spleen presenting as a submucosal mass suggestive of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Finally， we discuss the common differential diagnosis， radiologic features， and possible management of accessory spleens.\n\n【2】Keywords： Splenic tissue； Neoplasm； Neuroendocrine tumor\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】An accessory spleen is an congenital foci of normal splenic tissue separate from the main body of the spleen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This entity is relatively common. According to autopsy studies， accessory spleens occur in about 10-30% of the population and in 16% of patients undergoing contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. Accessory splenic tissue have been identified in areas along the splenic vessels， the tail of the pancreas， in the wall of the jejunum， within intestinal mesentery， the greater omentum， the pelvis， and the scrotum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However， the splenic hilum is the most common location for accessory spleens.\n\n【5】Accessory spleens are usually asymptomatic and clinically insignificant， but in some situations they simulate tumors. Currently， there are no definitive clinical or radiologic criteria for the differentiation of ectopic splenic tissue from malignancy. Definitive diagnosis is primarily attained from surgical resection. In this report， we analyze two cases of surgically treated accessory spleens which radiologically mimicked a neoplasm.\n\n【6】Case 1\n\nA 77 year old gentleman with a recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with underlying hepatitis C disease was referred to H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center after surgical resection of his malignancy for further treatment recommendations. His past medical history was significant for prostate cancer treated with radiation seed implants and multiple previous surgeries secondary to a motor vehicle accident and electric bicycle accident. A routine follow-up CT of the chest and abdomen identified a 2.0 cm mildly hyper vascular solid nodule in the tail of his pancreas. Clinically， the imaging findings were highly suggestive of a neuroendocrine tumor. The patient underwent an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the lesion which demonstrated a hypoechoic mass in the tail ofthe pancreas corresponding to the CT findings. Unfortunately，the FNA specimen comprised of only scattered lymphocytes， degenerated cells， and debris. Surgical resection of the indeterminate lesion was recommended. The patient received a distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy. Grossly， sections of the pancreas revealed a 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.1 cm accessory spleen. The remaining pancreatic tissue and spleen was unremarkable. Histologic sections demonstrated an intra pancreatic accessory spleen  and focal pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN1b). The intra pancreatic accessory spleen is composed of red pulp， made up of numerous vascular sinuses， and white pulp， consisting of lymphoid follicles and cells ofthe reticuloendothelial system. There was no evidence of malignancy. The patient's postoperative course was complicated by bilateral pulmonary embolisms and a persistent fluid collection near his incision site. A month|删除段之间换行|pancreatic parenchyma (Hematoxylin and Eosin staining，4X).\n\n【8】after surgery the fluid collection at the operative site resolved and he remained stable on his Coumadin regimen.\n\n【9】Case 2\n\n【10】A 49 year-old gentleman with a remote history of multiple injuries secondary to a motor vehicle accident including a ruptured spleen presented to his primary care physician complaining of atypical substernal chest pain. A CT angiogram of his coronary vessels and a nuclear stress test was unremarkable. He received a chest CT as part of the work-up for his chest pain which identified an incidental soft tissue lesion between the left diaphragm and the stomach measuring 2.6 cm in greatest dimension. There was no lymphadenopathy or effusions seen. An esphagogastroduodneoscopy was performed which identified a submucosal lesion in the fundus of the stomach corresponding to the CT findings. There were no infiltrative characteristics， hyervascularity， or surface ulceration seen. Unfortunately， the fundic mucosal biopsy revealed only mild chronic gastritis. At this point， a EUS with FNA of the lesion was recommended. The EUS procedure identified a hypoechoic mass arising from the muscular wall of the stomach. The FNA specimen demonstrated a few spindle cells and capillaries in a background of abundant lymphocytes. A portion of the specimen was sent for flow cytometry studies that revealed a mixed population of polyclonal B lymphocytes and reactive T lymphocytes. In regards to the gastric mass， clinicians suspected a possible gastrointestinal stromal tumor(GIST). However， after two attempts to biopsy the mass resulted in no definite diagnosis， surgical resection was recommended. The patient underwent a partial gastrectomy with a portion of his left diaphragm excised. Gross evaluation ofthe resection specimen revealed an ovoid， well-defined encapsulated nodule， measuring 1.3 cm in greatest dimension， between the diaphragmatic tissue and gastric wall. Cut surfaces of the nodule were soft， red-brown. Microscopically the nodule was composed of lymphoid follicles and splenic pulp . The gastric mucosa showed chronic gastritis with reactive changes. There was no evidence of malignancy. The findings were compatible with an accessory spleen. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\nIntrapancreatic accessory spleen has been documented and described in numerous previous case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-19\\]</u>. On the other hand， accessory spleen masquerading as a gastric submucosal tumor has been rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20-22\\]</u>. We report a case of intrapancreatic accessory spleen and a case of an accessory spleen involving the stomach. Since their origin is congential， they are primarily found in|删除段之间换行|areas within the embryologic dorsal mesentery of the stomach and pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23，24\\]</u>. They are usually asymptomatic as in our cases， but symptoms may arise and have clinical significance in certain situations which include torsion， spontaneous rupture， hemorrhage or causes hematologic disorders such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Due to advanced imaging techniques， accessory spleens are often detected incidentally. On sonography， intrapancreatic accessory spleens are well-defined and round or ovoid with a mildly echogenic and homogenous texture identical to that of the main spleen， surrounded by a high-amplitude interface and showing enhancement behind the lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，25，26\\]</u>. On color or power Doppler sonography images， blood supply to intra pancreatic accessory spleens from splenic artery or vein can be seen in some patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (US) of intrapancreatic accessory spleens using Levovist， an ultrasound contrast agent containing air micro bubbles， show in homogenous enhancement related to the different flow rate through the cords of the red and white pulp in the arterial phase. In the portal venous phase， intra pancreatic accessory spleens become homogenous. Lastly， during the “hepatosplenic”phase the micro bubbles become trapped within the splenic parenchyma showing prolonged enhancement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. In comparison to surrounding pancreatic parenchyma， the intra pancreatic accessory spleen appears to show greater echo enhancement.\n\n【14】There are several characteristic features associated with intra pancreatic accessory spleens on CT and MRI imaging. On CT imaging they are well-defined，round homogenous masses usually smaller than2 cm in diameter \\[71. However， in rare instances accessory splenic tissue may appear hypodense in comparison with surrounding pancreatic tissue and the main spleen because enhancement can be retarded byliver cirrhosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Pancreatic tumors share similar signal characteristics with that of the spleen on MRI imaging modalities making it difficult to differentiate an intra pancreatic accessory spleen from a pancreatic tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Interestingly， octreotide scintigraphy used to show the expression of somatostatin receptors in neuroendocrine neoplasms demonstrates somatostatin receptor expression in splenic tissue also 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. However， super paramagnetic iron oxides (SPIO)-enhanced MRI technique demonstrate similar degree of signal drop in intra pancreatic accessory spleens as compared to native spleen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Similar to technetium-99m heat-damaged red blood cells (HDRBC) scintigraphy in which injected HDRBCs are trapped by splenic tissue， SPIO-enhanced MRI requires the administration ofSPIO particles intravenously to be phagocytosed by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system in the spleen \\[281.\n\n【15】Although technetium-99m HDRBC scintigraphy is highly specific for detecting splenic tissue， the visualization of minute functioning splenic tissue is difficult. Furthermore， MRI imaging offers superior spatial resolution compared to scintigraphy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The imaging findings in the cases presented in this report were not characteristic of accessory splenic tissue. The patient with the intra pancreatic accessory spleen had CT imaging findings demonstrating mild hypervascularity which can be associated with pancreatic endocrine tumors. In the evaluation of intra pancreatic masses with hypervascularity the differential would include pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors as well as lymphomas， hypervascular metastases， solid pseudopapillarytiimnors and pancreatic adenocarcinomas.However， benign entities should not be disregarded like intra pancreatic accessory spleen or even lymphoepithelial cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，13\\]</u>. The patient with the gastric submucosal mass had CT imaging findings suggestive of a GIST. Differential diagnosis for submuocosal gastric masses may include leiomyoma， schwannoma， fibromatosis， inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor， neuroendocrine tumor，leiomyosarcoma， and more. But an accessory spleen should be included in the differential. Therefore， a clear-cut distinction between accessory splenic tissue and a neoplasm/malignancy is extremely important when considering the possible differential but， is hard to attain with current technology.\n\n【17】EUS-guided FNA may provide a reliable diagnosis， thus avoiding unnecessary surgery. Schreiner et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u> reported the first series of intra pancreatic accessory spleen diagnosed by EUS-guided FNA. The cytologic features were nonspecific and included predominantly small lymphocytes with a subset of histiocytes， eosinophils， and plasma cells. Thin-walled blood vessels may also be seen，representing splenic sinuses. Interestingly， endothelial cells lining splenic sinuses are CD8 positive whereas systemic endothelial cells and hemangioma are negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. There is the potential to diagnose accessory splenic tissue without resulting in surgery. Unfortunately， cytologic specimens may be suboptimal or insufficient as seen in our cases. Surgery in certain situations may be the best method for diagnosis and provide peace of mind to patients， in that； they are able to know definitively that their mass is benign.\n\n【18】In conclusion， modern imaging modalities will likely lead to an increase number of accessory spleens being discovered which will pose a diagnostic challenge. When an asymptomatic mass is detected involving the embryologic region of which ectopic splenic tissue may arise， an accessory spleen should be within the differential as well as a neoplasm/malignancy. Non-invasive diagnostic techniques are required including imaging with possible biopsy (either FNA or core needle biopsy). Hopefully， the diagnosis of an accessory spleen may be obtained and obviate unnecessary surgery decreasing overall patient morbidity. However， when a tissue diagnosis cannot be obtained from a biopsy， imaging findings are not conclusive， and the clinical suspicion for a neoplasm is high surgical resection is warranted.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However， a glutamatergic effect of fluoroquinolones cannot be excluded and deserves further study.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 95-year-old white woman was admitted for severe asthenia and shortness of breath. She had a clinical history of hypertension and chronic constipation. Blood laboratory data revealed severe anaemia associated with iron deficiency， which was treated with blood transfusion and administration of iron i.v. Since potassium serum levels were below the lower normal limit (2.8mmol/L)， oral therapy with a K-sparing diuretic was instituted (canrenone 50mg qd). Haemato-chemical indexes of liver and renal function were within normal ranges； in particular， eGFR was82 mL/min/1.73m²(CKD-EPI formula). After suspected occult intestinal bleeding， endoscopic examinations revealed colon diverticulosis， particularly severe in the distal tract. After the above treatments， haemoglobin rose to 11.5mg/dL， potassium to 3.5 mmol/L， and respiratory symptoms disappeared.\n\n【7】On the last day of hospitalisation， the patient developed cystitis， so that oral treatment with levofloxacin 500mg qd was started in hospital and continued at home. Other drugs prescribed at discharge were： esomeprazole 20mg qd (8 a.m.)， rifaximin 400mg bd (8 a.m. /4 p.m. for 7 days)， canrenone 50 mg qd (2 p.m.)， furosemide 25mg qd (8 a.m.)， allopurinol 300mg qd (8 a.m.)， amlodipine 10mg qd(8 a.m.)， doxazosin 1mg qd (8 a.m.) and triazolam 0.25mg qd (10p.m.).\n\nTwo days after discharge， the patient had two episodes of loss of consciousness， followed by tonic contraction of the limbs lasting a few minutes， with residual，transient mental confusion. A CT scan at the hospital emergency room excluded acute ischaemic or hemorrhagic events. The patient refused an EEG. A third seizure occurred at night and was treated with i.v. diazepam. A further brain CT excluded new acute events. As levofloxacin was suspected of playing a causal role in the seizures， it was withdrawn. Therapy with phenytoin was instituted (100mg i.v. tid) but three days later had to be stopped due to onset of muscular dyskinesia， and was replaced by levetiracetam (500mg bd). One week after the last epileptic episode， cerebral magnetic resonance (MR) demonstrated moderate cerebral atrophy， diffuse hypodensity of white matter， and bilateral alterations in the medial prefrontal cortex， compatible with cytotoxic oedema . No significant cerebral vessel stenosis were shown by angio-MR； nor did EEG show abnormal electrical activity. The patient was discharged on levetiracetam (500mg bd) and re-evaluated 37 days later. On follow-up， she remained seizure-free and MR showed complete regression of the morphological alterations|删除段之间换行|previously appearing in the medial prefrontal cortex .\n\n【9】To ourknowledge， this finding has neverbeen reported before and needs to be briefly discussed. The changes seen in MR may have been the consequence of the repeated epileptic attacks. Transient focal CT and MR changes have been reported to occur after generalized tonico-clonic seizures or status epilepticus， and attributed to local increases in vascular perfusion and permeability and to massive release of cytotoxic mediators， such as glutamate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However， the direct causal role of levofloxacin cannot be excluded. Fluoroquinolones are known to produce excitatory CNS effects， which may result in adverse psychiatric and neurologic reactions. Within this class of drugs， levofloxacin has demonstrated a low epileptogenic potential 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In addition， a literature review published in 2009 reported only six cases of seizures associated with levofloxacin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and only three more have been published since then 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>.Old age is a recognised risk factor for fluoroquinolone-induced seizures. Our patient was very old 通用删除7(英):<u>(95)</u>， but apparently she did not have any other predisposing conditions， such as electrolyte imbalance， renal dysfunction， interacting drugs (e.g.， NSAIDs， theophylline) or pre-existing seizure disorders.\n\nMechanisms proposed to explain fluoroquinolone neurotoxicity include antagonism at the inhibitory GABAA receptor and synergism at the excitatory NMDA receptor. The \"GABA hypothesis” is weakened by the evidence that fluoroquinolones have low affinity for GABAA receptors. In particular， it has been estimated that levofloxacin at concentrations expected in the human brain after therapeutic doses occupies 1.1% of GABAA receptors， so that can hardly exert clinically significant inhibition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Instead，enhancement of the excitatory glutamate effect produced by fluoroquinolones in rat hippocampus slices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> occurred at concentrations (0.5-1 uM) compatible with levofloxacin-free concentrations expected in the human brain (0.065 uM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In addition， quinolones reduced the threshold for seizures by electroshock induced in a murine model and their proconvulsive activity was completely blocked by an NMDA receptor antagonist (MK-801) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. With this background， it seems|删除段之间换行|reasonable to suggest that fluoroquinolones can induce neurotoxicity mainly through a glutamatergic effect. If this is so， the MR cytotoxic alterations seen in our patient after repeated seizures may have been due to a combination of excessive neuronal discharge and the direct glutamatergic effect of levofloxacin. Further studies are needed to clarify the relative contribution of the two mechanisms.\n\n【11】Results\n\n【12】Acute cerebrovascular events were excluded.

Thirty-seven days later， such alterations had disappeared.\n\n【13】Conclusions\n\n【14】Cytotoxic oedema may have been produced by massive glutamate release during epileptic episodes.

Although the survival rate for EDT is generally low， there exist guidelines containing specific indications for its use in a subset of patients with penetrating traumatic injuries.

A focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) was positive for intra-abdominal free fluid. The patient was found to be persistently hypotensive despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and massive transfusion. An EDT was preformed for suspected intra-abdominal exsanguination and the patient was transferred to the operating room where he was treated for an extensive inferior vena cava laceration. After a complicated intensive care unit course， the patient ultimately survived with full preservation of neurologic function.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The use of EDT is associated with a low rate of survival in penetrating abdominal trauma but its appropriate and timely use by emergency physicians can be lifesaving\n\n【5】Keywords： Emergency department thoracotomy； Inferior vena cava injury； Penetrating trauma\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Penetrating trauma is a relatively infrequent presentation to the Emergency Department(ED) and those patients presenting with penetrating injuries requiring resuscitative emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) are evenless common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) Committee on Trauma recommends that EDT be utilized for patients with penetrating cardiac， thoracic or abdominal injuries who experience traumatic arrest or unresponsive hypotension. This， however， must include observed or objectively measured signs of life upon arrival in the ED or short transport times 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Despite current guidelines， a recent retrospective analysis completed at a Canadian level 1 trauma centre revealed that approximately one half of EDTs were completed for inappropriate indications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【8】While variations exist， the overall survival rates for EDT performed for penetrating and blunt trauma are 11% and 1.6%， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

On arrival， the patient was responsive but lethargic， diaphoretic and had bowelevisceration from the wound site . His initial blood pressure (BP) was 74/47with a heart rate of 93 and an oxygen saturation of 93% on a 100%non-rebreather mask with a respiratoryrate of 24. The patient's airway was secured with endotracheal intubation. A focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) was positive for intra-peritoneal fluid within Morrison’s Pouch. The sub-xiphoid cardiac， spleno-renal and suprapubic view were negative for pericardial fluid and intra-peritoneal fluid， respectively. After the initiation of our massive transfusion protocol and receiving the first unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) via a level 1 rapid infuser， the patient’s BP was 67/42. The patient was noted to be exceptionally challenging to bag ventilate COS and， subsequently， bilateral tube thoracostomies were undertaken with no spontaneous return of blood. The patient had received 4units of pRBCs and had a blood pressure of 40/31 with a pulse of 50when the attending emergency physician decided to perform an ED thoracotomy for suspected intra-abdominal exsanguination. A left antero-lateral thoracic incision followed by a vertical pericardiotomy revealed no active bleeding within the left hemi-thorax or blood within the pericardium. A naso-gastric tube was inserted and the thoracic aorta was identified and then cross-clamped which resulted in an immediate improvement of the patient's hemodynamic status； his BP was 100/69 with a pulse of 62. The patient was transported immediately to the operating room (OR) where the massive transfusion protocol was continued. He received a total of 26 units of pRBCs， 25 units of platelets， 21 units of fresh frozen plasma and20 units of cryoprecipitate. The patient was surgically treated for an extensive inferior vena cava laceration and lacerations of the gastric pylorus， liver and gallbladder. The patient was defibrillated with intrathoracic paddles twice for cardiac arrest intraoperatively. After surgical stabilization the patient was transferred to the ICU with a packed and open abdomen on norepinephrine， vasopressin and epinephrine intravenous drips and having received tranexamic acid. In the subsequent weeks， the patient returned to the OR on multiple occasions for attempted abdominal closure and was successfully weaned from vasopressors. After a two-month course in the intensive care unit， complicated by an external high-output duodenal fistula and IVC thrombosis， the patient was eventually weaned from mechanical ventilation after further surgical treatment of his intra-abdominal injuries. He was successfully discharged from the ICU to a regional hospital closer to the city of his residence for continued rehabilitation with no neurological impairment.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Traumatic injuries to the IVC are notoriously lethal. Whether caused by blunt or penetrating mechanisms， approximately 50% of patients withIVCwounds diebefore reaching the hospital 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In terms ofpenetrating trauma， gunshot wounds (GSW) produce a much more destructive pattern of IVC avulsion in contrast to the typical linear lacerations inflicted by stab wounds. As with our patient， the majority of penetrating trauma causing IVC injury is accompanied by injury to other abdominal organs， major vessels， or both 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It is due to the additional injury of surrounding structures that would otherwise contain the low-pressure IVC hemorrhage that allows caval injuries to cause major hemorrhage and exsanguination. Also， the pattern of injury determines the extent that the IVC may self-tamponade； a phenomenon more likely to occur with oblique GSWand linear stab wounds 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. While it is common for patients with IVC injury and initial hemodynamic compromise to improve with intravenous fluid resuscitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> failure to respond to attempts at volume repletion indicates continued active bleeding and exsanguination.\n\n【13】Our case-report demonstrates the utility and effectiveness ofEDT in penetrating abdominal trauma with suspected intra-abdominal exsanguination. The rationale of EDT in penetrating abdominal trauma is to ensure adequate cerebrovascular and cardiovascular perfusion while decreasing distal hemorrhage by cross-clamping the thoracic aorta. This principle applies to exsanguination due to both venous and arterial sources of hemorrhage. A meta-analysis by Rhee et al. demonstrated a survival rate of 7.4% after EDT preformed for penetrating abdominal trauma with intra-abdominal exsanguinations通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The authors find this survival rate significant enough to consider performing EDT in similar conditions. Our case also highlights the role that the emergency physician plays in the initial treatment of a time sensitive injury with an exceedingly low survival rate before the involvement of a designated surgical trauma service. However， the procedure should only be considered in a centre with adequate and established trauma surgery services.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Penetrating abdominal injuries with persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation is suggestive of ongoing intra-abdominal hemorrhage. We presented the case of a 28-year-old man with a penetrating abdominal injury and suspected intra-abdominal exsanguination secondary to an inferior vena cava laceration in whom an EDT proved pivotal to his survival. Although a rare procedure in the emergency department， it is essential that emergency physicians become familiar with the ACS recommended indications for EDT as well as its utility is suspected intra-abdominal exsanguination due to penetrating abdominal trauma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The comorbidities are treated in one stage or in stages， and the swelling of the lower limbs of patients with deep vein thrombosis is significantly relieved after surgery. There has been no recurrence in the patients of great saphenous varicose veins.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Iliac vein stent implantation has extremely high clinical application value for venous system diseases caused by iliac vein compression syndrome， with high technical achievement rate and satisfactory improvement of postoperative symptoms.\n\n【5】Keywords： Varicose veins； Deep vein thrombosis； May-Thurner syndrome； Lower extremity edema\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Iliac vein stenosis and occlusion， also known as Cockett's syndrome or May-Turner syndrome， can lead to long-term swelling of the lower limbs， secondary varicose veins in the lower limbs， pigmentation and ulcer formation in the ankle area. The ulcer can be difficult to heal and seriously affects the patient's quality of life. A large amount of labor and time is lost each year due to this condition. Treating iliac vein stenosis and occlusion can save the lost social and economic losses， reduce patient suffering， shorten hospitalization time， and reduce medical insurance costs. This article analyzes and summarizes the clinical data of 27 patients with iliac vein compression syndrome who were treated with iliac vein stent implantation in our department in the past two years.\n\n【8】Clinical and imaging data were collected from 27 patients who were admitted to the department of vascular surgery of our hospital， and were diagnosed with lower extremity varicose veins or deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities and its sequelae. Among the 27 patients， there were12 males (44.4%) and 15 females (55.6%)， with an age range of 48 to 76 years and a median age of 57 years. All the patients underwent the implantation of the Wallstent woven iliac vein stent(Boston Scientific， USA). Among the 16 patients with combined lower extremity varicose veins，13 underwent secondary surgery for varicose vein stripping. Among the 2 patients with deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities， both underwent primary Angiojet thrombus aspiration.\n\nSurgical methods： All patients underwent lower extremity deep vein angiography first， using the Siemens Artis ZEE ceiling flat-panel vascular angiography system from Germany. The patient was placed in a supine position on an examination table， and a puncture needle with a sheath was placed on the dorsum of the foot. A tourniquet was tied around the ankle to block the blood flow of the superficial veins. If the dorsum of the foot was too swollen to place the puncture needle， the shallow vein in the calf was punctured instead， and the blood flow of the superficial vein was blocked above the puncture point. The puncture needle was connected to a high-pressure injector(2 mL/s flow rate， 100 kPa pressure， total volume of 100 mL) to perform deep vein angiography in|删除段之间换行|the direction of the blood flow， and the condition of the iliac vein was observed under fluoroscopy. Non-ionic iodine contrast agents(Omnipaque or Visipaque) were used for angiography. If abnormal conditions were found in the iliac vein during angiography， the femoral vein was punctured to perform iliac vein balloon dilation and stent implantation.\n\n【10】For patients with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities，primary Anjiojet thrombus aspiration may be performed， and if compression of the iliac vein is found after aspiration， iliac vein balloon dilation and stent implantation may be performed simultaneously. For patients with lower extremity varicose veins， secondary surgery for high ligation and stripping of the great saphenous vein may be performed.\n\n【11】Result\n\n【12】Among the patients in this group， 11 cases (40.7%) were found to have iliac vein compression syndrome combined with deep vein thrombosis or its sequelae， and 16 cases (59.3%) had iliac vein compression syndrome combined with great saphenous vein varicose veins. All of them successfully underwent iliac vein stent placement and were treated for any associated complications concurrently or in phased approaches. Three stents were implanted in 2 cases， 2 stents were implanted in 6 cases， and 1 stent was implanted in 19 cases. Except for patients who underwent simultaneous thrombus aspiration surgery， the surgeries for all patients were completed within 2 h， and hospital stays did not exceed 1 week. Swelling in the lower extremities of patients with deep vein thrombosis was significantly reduced 1 to2 days after surgery. Among the patients with great saphenous vein varicose veins， there were 2 cases of CEAP grade 3 (varicose veins)， 7cases of grade 4 (with pigmentation)， 2 cases of grade 5 (with healed ulcers)， and 2 cases of grade 6 (with active ulcers). Postoperative follow-up at the outpatient clinic has shown no recurrence of varicose veins， improved pigmentation， and all ulcers healed. All patients clinical symptoms improved significantly， and treatment costs were low. No serious postoperative complications or deaths occurred in this group of patients .\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Iliac vein disease mainly refers to stenosis and occlusive diseases of the iliac vein. It can cause high pressure in the lower extremity veins， which can lead to lower extremity swelling， deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities， secondary varicose veins of the lower extremities， pigmentation and ulceration in the ankle area. Ulcers can be long-standing and difficult to heal， commonly known as \"chronic leg ulcers\"， severely affecting the patient's quality of life and work ability. Kim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> reported on the progress sequence of clinical iliac vein compression： Stage 1： Asymptomatic iliac vein compression； stage 2： Formation of venous stasis； stage 3： Formation of deep venous thrombosis of the left iliac vein.\n\n【15】In the past， insufficient understanding of iliac vein disease made it difficult to treat it from the root. Since the clinical application oflower extremity deep venous contrast angiography， it has been found that a considerable number of patients with lower extremity venous system diseases have underlying iliac vein system diseases.\n\nWe performed lower extremity deep venous angiography on patients with venous system diseases upon admission to further clarify the etiology. We then performed corresponding treatments based on the fundamental cause， including minimally invasive iliac vein stent|删除段之间换行|implantation， and achieved satisfactory therapeutic effects. Berger et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> reported the first endovascular placement of an iliac vein stent to treat May-Thurner syndrome in 1995. In our study，no recurrence of venous varices was observed in patients with great saphenous vein varices after two outpatient follow-ups， suggesting that the patients venous hypertension had been relieved， fundamentally solving the cause of lower extremity varicose veins. Ma Jianjun et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> believed that patients with iliac vein compression syndrome had significant improvement in limb swelling， superficial vein varices， and elevated skin temperature of the lower legs compared to the control group after interventional treatment. They also showed significant improvement in pain， mental and physical ability compared to the control group. Lu Yongming et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> reported on 59 cases of non-thrombotic iliac vein compression with venous reflux. Only stent implantation was performed without superficial venous surgery. Although reflux and superficial vein varices still existed， there was a significant improvement in lower extremity swelling and pain symptoms， and all eight ulcers healed in more than two years. All of the above suggest that interventional treatment for iliac vein compression syndrome has positive significance.\n\n【17】We found that the proportion of iliac vein compression was also highamongpatients with deep vein thrombosisofthelowerextremities and sequelae after deep vein thrombosis. In our study， after thrombus extraction， we simultaneously performed iliac vein balloon dilation and stent implantation in patients with combined lower extremity deep vein thrombosis to not only relieve the thrombus load but also solve the disease from the etiology， achieving satisfactory therapeutic effects. Most of the lower limb swelling in patients subsided within1 to 2 days， and no recurrence of lower limb thrombosis was observed during outpatient follow-up visits， indicating good results. This approach protected the deep venous valves and prevented the occurrence of sequelae after lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. Lou Wensheng et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> believed that iliac vein compression is a high-risk group for deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities， which can be induced by surgery， pregnancy， or long-term bed rest， and its manifestations during angiography include：删除4:<u> 1</u>. Widening of the diameter of the compressed left common iliac vein；删除4:<u> 2</u>. Filling defect or septum formation in the compressed segment；删除4:<u> 3</u>. Occlusion of the common iliac vein；删除4:<u> 4</u>. Formation of collateral circulation；删除4:<u> 5</u>. Delayed venous emptying of the affected limb. We found that iliac and external iliac veins had obvious pressure marks during angiography， and even visible pulsation of the veins， which we considered to be a direct sign of iliac vein compression.\n\nIn our study， iliac vein stent implantation was successfully performed in 27 patients， using the Boston Scientific Wallstent woven stent. Our experience was that there was a significant shortening phenomenon when the stent was released， and the longer the stent length， the more obvious the shortening phenomenon. Thus， during stent release， attention should be paid to this phenomenon，|删除段之间换行|and an early starting point for stent release and pre-determined predetermined distances should be established.

Nowadays he is still under the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia without recurrence of temporal granulocytic sarcoma.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Granulocytic sarcoma involving temporal bones is rare. Its diagnosis depends on immunohistochemistry. Systemic chemotherapy is the first therapeutic choice. Surgical application should be limited to biopsy and symptomatic relief.\n\n【4】Keywords： Granulocytic sarcoma； Temporal bone； Conductive hearing loss\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Granulocytic sarcoma (GS) is a localized extramedullary tumor composed of immature myeloid cells. It's an uncommon disease and often described in association with acute myeloid leukemia(AML). In head and neck， it usually involves the skull， gingiva， orbit， facial skinand even paranasal sinus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. Though rare， GS can affect temporal bone and produce symptoms which areeasily confused with other diseases. Here we report a case of GS in bilateraltemporal bones.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】In November 2006， a 36-year-old Chinese man， with a history of AML (subtype M3) which was in remission，presented to our hospital for otalgia and hearing loss in bilateral ears for a month's duration. Previously in December 2000， he was diagnosed as AML (M3) and received chemotherapy； in January 2001 he achieved complete remission， after that he remained in continuous complete remission for 5 years. He denied the history of facial palsy， hearing loss or vertigo.\n\n【9】On admission， otoscopy showed his left external acoustic meatus was completely blocked by a soft-tissue mass. His right external acoustic meatus was stenotic because of swelling of its posterior and anterior portions， only a small part of the right tympanic membrane could beseen，which seemed normal. No pathological enlargement of lymph nodes or organomegaly was noticed. Laboratory studies including complete blood counts and serum biochemistry showed normal values. CT scan of both temporal bones revealed both external acoustic meatus， especially the left， were filled with masses. No bony lesions were found . The CT scan was also suggestive of right mastoiditis. Pure-tone audiogram revealed conductive hearing loss in bilateral ears with air-bone gaps about 35 to 45 dB in the right and30 to 55 dB in the left .\n\nBecause of the patient’s history of AML， he was first sent to another hospital to review his leukemia. In that admission， his bone marrow aspirate didn’t show any relapse of AML. Though GS couldn't be excluded， other diseases， such as sarcoma， were considered preferentially. Few days later， the patient was submitted to surgery in our hospital. Aneoplasm ectomy of the left external acoustic meatus was performed though a retroauricular approach. During the surgery， a tumor Waseen originating from the walls of external acoustic meatus， involving part of the tympanic membrane. The tympanic cavity was normal and the ossicular chain was intact. The mass and the tympanic membrane were removed， the ear canal was widened and the temporalis fascia|删除段之间换行|was harvested to rebuild the tympanic membrane. The specimen was performed HE and immunohistochemistry staining. In HE staining， the lesion was consistent showing pleomorphic cells having blastic and hyperchromatic nucleus with large cytoplasm. In immunohistochemistry， it was positive for myeloperoxidase， LCA， lysozyme， CD43， and CD117 ， but negative for CD20 and CD7.These results lead to the conclusive diagnosis of GS.\n\n【11】Because of the diagnosis of GS， the patient immediately received a systemic chemotherapy. But due to his poor compliance， only one course of the treatment was finished. One month after the operation， the patient got a complete recovery from his left ear symptoms， and pure-tone audiogram showed a significant increase of air conductive hearing . However， the symptoms of his right ear hardly changed and the otalgia became even severe. In December 2007， the patient received operation of his right ear in our hospital. A lesion similar with the left was seen in the canal； the lesion was completely removed and diagnosed as GS by pathology. After surgery， systemic chemotherapy began. Three months later， the patient recovered from right otalgia， however the hearing hardly improved. Nowadays， the patient is still under the treatment of AML， and clinical examination or CT scans haven’t detected any signs of temporal GS recurrence.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\nGS， also termed myeloid sarcoma or “chloroma\"， is a rare disease. GS has a close relationship with AML. As reported before， about 2-8% of patients with AML develop GS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It may present at any time of the course of AML 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Though all subtypes of AML could develop GS， the French-American-British (FAB) subtypes M2， M4， M5 are|删除段之间换行|most frequently observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Certain chromosome abnormalities are associated with a higher incidence of GS， particularly t (8； 21)， and less frequently inv 通用删除7(英):<u>(16)</u> 通用删除11(英):<u>(p13；q22)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. GS can also arise in patients with other types of myelo proliferative disorders， such aschronic myelogenous leukemia blastic transformation and myelodysplastic syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-11\\]</u>.\n\n【14】GS in temporal bone is quite rare. Chapman and Johnson described the first one in 1980 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Temporal GS is most commonly found in patients below the age 30， and its incidence has no deviation in gender or side. GS could span the whole temporal bone， but mastoid is most often involved. Presenting symptoms of temporal GS include facial palsy， otalgia， tinnitus and conductive hearing loss. To our knowledge， GS usually affects unilateral temporal bone； the case presented here is the first one with bilateral temporal GS.\n\nRecognition of GS is important for timely treatment. As long as a patient present for neoplasm with a history of AML， GS should be considered. Some investigations can provide clues for diagnosis. On CT scans，GS mayappear as a well-defined enhancing mass sometimes with osteolytic destruction. On MRI， GS may be homogeneously hyper intense on fat saturated T2-weighted images， hypo intense on T1-weighted images and moderate enhancing after intravenous gadolinium contrast administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.However， it's impossible to confirm GS from imaging findings alone. Making a conclusion often needs biopsy for histological diagnosis|删除段之间换行|The differential diagnosis of temporal GS comprises external canal cholesteatoma， temporal lymphoma and temporal sarcoma. Temporal GS can be easily parted from external canal cholesteatoma for its lack of keratinized debris. However， it’s difficult to distinguish GS from lymphoma and sarcoma by routine investigations. At that condition， immunohistochemical analysis should be performed. The most sensitive markers for GS include CD3， CD43 and myeloperoxidase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， others such as CD20， LCA and lysozyme can also be used. In addition， the tumor should be negative for B and T cell markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\nThe optimal treatment of GS is not clear since there is not enough data and large prospective studies in the literature. Nowadays GS is mostly suggested to treat by systemic chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Other therapeutic choices include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and targeted therapy. Surgery alone is not recommended for the high incidence of AML and extramedullary|删除段之间换行|relapse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In this case， we used surgery combining systemic chemotherapy to treat our patient. In our opinion， Because of the anatomic complexity of temporal bone， biopsy in it most frequently needs a surgical approach. Surgery should also be reserved for patients having conductive hearing loss or facial palsy， for its rapid effect of symptomatic relief. To our patient， the surgery not only contributed to biopsy， but also successfully improved his left hearing.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】GS involving bilateral temporal bones is extremely rare. It should be considered for patients present for neoplasm with a history ofacute myeloid leukemia. Conclusive diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma needs immunohistochemical analysis. Systemic chemotherapy is the first therapeutic choice. Surgical application should be limited to biopsy and symptomatic relief.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

A rapid and effective management to open the lungs is important to prevent reintubation. We reported an extremely preterm infant with massive post-extubated atelectasis of bilaterallungs， and he was successfully treated by using the simple technique of direct tracheobroncheal suction (DTBS) to quickly open his lungs.\n\n【2】A 7-day-old preterm infant with a birth weight of 732 g got massive atelectatic lungs at 24 hours after extubation.DTBS was performed by directly inserting a 6.0 Fr. suction tube into his trachea via the assist of laryngoscope. The infant’s head was turned to one side while passing the suction tube into the bronchus of the opposite side. This suction procedure was repeated until nothing could be suctioned out，and DTBS was repeated every 8 hours in the following 24 hours after extubation. Nasal prong continuous positive airway pressure was kept， and the heart rates and oxygen saturation were continuously monitored during DTBS. Sticky secretions were observed at the laryngeal site and suctioned out from the tracheobronchial airways. The follow-up chest x-ray film revealed opened lungs 24 hours later. Therefore， DTBS is effective and safe to relief obstructed airways and reopen the lungs of the reported extremely premature infant.\n\n【3】Keywords： Post-extubation atelectasis； Direct tracheobronchial suction\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Post-extubation atelectasis is a common pulmonary disorder that lengthens the hospitalization time of neonates in intensive care units who have received long-term， high-setting of mechanical ventilator， resulting in increased morbidity among these infants. The incidence of post-extubation atelectasis has been reported in 16.7 to 50% of intubated neonates， especially in those premature infants group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.\n\n【6】The current conventional prevention strategies and management of post-extubation atelectasis including mucolytic medication， chest physiotherapy， but poor response and re-intubation rate in neonates， especially in premature infants are still high which has been reported ranged from18 to 34% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-7\\]</u>. Some reports have been documented and suggested the use of bronchoscope to check and relieve that intractable atelectasis. However， technical limitation and instrument limitation of bronchoscope may made difficulties in many institutes to perform those invasive techniques，especially performed in neonates or premature infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. A simple technique of direct tracheobronchial suction (DTBS) had been reported for relieving post-extubated atelectatic lungs in premature infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\nDTBS could achieve direct clearance of trachea and bronchus by multiple insertions， natural curvature of suction tube tip and head positioning without the need of re-intubation. The effective airway secretion removal could predict good results of resolving the massive atelectasis and preventing the possibility of re-intubation. There are some immediate findings such as respiratory distress improved with increased audible air entry on the affected lung； decreased chest retractions； significant fall in respiratory rate and heart rate； arterial blood gases analysis showed|删除段之间换行|significant improvement of pH， partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxygenation ratio and partial or nearly complete resolution of the atelectasis by chest radiograph check-up. Besides， the aspirated secretion in suction tube could also send for laboratory study if needed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Here， we present an extremely pretrem infant who suffered from massive lung atelectasis after extubation and got significant improvement 24 hours after being performed with DTBS.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】The case is a male infant delivered at gestational age of 28weeks by cesarean section from a 33-year-old woman due to severe preeclampsia. His birth weight was 732 gm， and the Apgar scores were 3， 6 and 8 at 1， 5， and 10 min after delivery. After birth， he got severe respiratory distress with subcostal retraction and cyanosis， so oral endotracheal tube was inserted and he was ventilated with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. The chest x-ray film revealed grade III respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) . The pulmonary conditions got improved gradually， and the chest x-ray film showed a good improvement. Extubation was done on the 7th day of life. Nasal prong continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) was applied immediately after extubation. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) (rate=20 breaths/min， peak inspiratory pressure=18 cmH，O， positive end expiratory pressure =6 cm H，O，and FiO，=0.3) were applied. Under these settings， these was no significant hypercapnia or hypoxia observed during the first 12 hours after extubation. However， relative fluctuation and occasional dropping of the oxygen saturation to lower than 90% started to be observed at night. The FiO， needed to be increased to 0.4 for maintaining oxygen saturation higher than 90%. Mild tachypnea and subcostal retraction of the infant were also observed. The blood gas also showed compensatory respiratory acidosis with a tendency of increasing PaCO. Chest x-ray film was rechecked at approximately 24 hours after extubation， and it showed white-out appearance with decreased lung volume at bilateral lung fields. Massive post-extubation atelectasis was considered .\n\nBy the use of a laryngoscope， the oral cavity and larynx were checked firstly. Much sticky secretion was observed and removed by using cotton swabs . Then， DTBS was performed under the continuous support of NCPAP. Three minutes before the procedure， the FiO， was increased 20% higher than before for pre-oxygenation. While performing DTBS， we inserted a 6.0 Fr. suction tube into his trachea directly via the assist of laryngoscope. The infant’s head was put on neutral position while inserted the tube into the vocal cord. While reaching the vocal cord， the infant’s head was turned|删除段之间换行|to right side firstly and the suction tube was passed deeper into left bronchus until a resistance was felt. Then，the suction tube was slowly withdrawn out with a suction pressure of 80 mmHg. This suction procedure would be repeated again until nothing could be suctioned out. After that， we suctioned the right bronchus with head turned to the left side until the airway is clear. Between each two suctions， we kept the mouth closed and waited for the oxygenation turning back to be higher than 95%. During the procedures， transient oxygen desaturation and brief bradycardia were observed occasionally， and they returned back quickly. Topical epinephrine was applied over larynx after whole procedure for laryngeal swelling. The DTBS was performed again in an interval of 8 hours.\n\n【12】The follow-up chest x-ray film revealed opened lungs 24 hours later . After that， DTBS was performed twice a day for two more days. His respiratory condition got improved and the settings of NIPPV were able to be weaned gradually.\n\n【13】When the patient was 28 days old， the baby still required NCPAP with NIPPV. At postmenstral age of 36 weeks， he still required the support of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen to maintain a nasal continuous positive airway pressure with 3 cmH，O PEEP and oxygen (FiO，= 0.25)， so he was diagnosed as moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) of prematurity. With a good care， neither NCPAP nor oxygen was required 3 weeks later， and he was discharged at postmenstral age of 40 weeks with body weight reaching 2100g. The patient was under regular out-patient follow-up with generally well-being.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\nAtelectasis is known as the loss oflung volume due to the collapse|删除段之间换行|of lung tissue， and the most type in adult and children is obstructive type. The critical illness neonates， especially premature infant in intensive care unit usually require intubation with mechanical ventilation support and frequent secretion suction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. There are some researches had documented the recent ventilator strategy with high frequency oscillatory ventilator compared with conventional ventilation in premature infants， and better successful extubation rate had reported with premature infants who use high frequency oscillatory ventilator and the age at siccessful extubation was also significantly lower compared with those who use conventional ventilator \\[8-111. But， there are still many risk factors played important role in atelectasis process causing alveolar collapse， such as neonates are sensitive to the obstructing effects of accumulating airway secretions， most likely because of small airway size and a less effective cough secondary to muscle weakness； endotracheal tubes complicate this problem by impairing mucocillary clearance， inhibiting an effective cough， causing airway mucosa damage and granulation tissue formation； neonates have a decreased number of pores of Kohn which limits collateral ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. The high incidence of post-extubation atelectasis has been reported in 16.7to 50% of intubated neonates， especially in those premature infants group， result from above risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Due to the above risk factors and the most cause of airway secretions， the goals of prevention and management of post-extubation atelectasis is remove airway secretion as soon as possible to keep patent airway and avoid subsequent pulmonary dysfunction. Traditionally， the treatment strategies for post-extubation atelectasis of intubated neonates were mucolytic medication and intensive chest physiotherapy. However， tiny neonates and premature infants often could not stand for fierce percussion movement， and would sometimes lead to brain damage or bleeding tendency. Generally， if the massive post-extubation atelectasis could not be resolved by chest physiotherapy， re-intubation was necessary for following respiratory support and secretion clearance and got temporary improvement. But， the subsequent trauma processes caused by endotracheal tubes and suction tubes would lead to further more atelectasis episode after extubation and add up to a vicious cycle of pulmonary destruction which affected pulmonary development of fragile neonates and premature infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>\n\nBronchoscopy with or without endotracheal tube is a useful technique to achieve diagnosis and treatment for atelectasis. However，premature infants may not stand for the procedure under general anesthesia， and their airway may too small to receive a standard pediatric bronchoscope. Therefore， direct tracheobronchial suiction seen to be the better choice to achieve direct tracheobronchial clearance without the need of re-intubation and the use of bronchoscope. Under the bedside monitors for basic vital sign and saturation， and with a laryngoscope and a suction tube， we could precisely perform direct clearance of trachea and bronchus by multiple insertions， natural curvature of suction tube tip and head positioning. The effective airway secretion removal could predict good results of resolving the massive atelectasis and preventing the possibility of re-intubation. There are some immediate findings such as respiratory distress improved with increased audible air entry on the affected lung； decreased chest retractions； significant fall in respiratory rate and heart rate； arterial blood gases analysis showed significant improvement of pH， partial pressure of carbon dioxide|删除段之间换行|and oxygenation ratio and partial or nearly complete resolution of the atelectasis by chest radiograph check-up. Besides， the aspirated secretion in suction tube could also send for laboratory study if needed.\n\n【18】After the procedure， the premature infants must be intensive monitor for any acute complication such as hypoxia， pneumothorax， pulmonarybleeding. Because even flexible suction tubewhichdiameter is smaller than bronchoscope could also damage airway mucosa and moreover perforations. Besides， intensive chest physiotherapy is still recommended even receive direct tracheobronchial suction for better airway clearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【19】In conclusion， extremely premature infants have high risk to develop atelectasis after extubation. DTBS is a simple， effective and less invasive procedure to resolve post-extubation atelectasis and prevent re-intubation in tiny infants. Therefore， DTBS may be tried on premature infants with post-extubation atelectasis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Nevertheless， IVT use is limited not only by its short therapeutic window， but also by the numerous contraindications. Having a platelet count of less than 100，000/uL is considered an absolute contraindication for IVT， according to trial selection criteria and expert opinions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. As unsuspected thrombocytopenia is rare， the 2013 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines recommend clinicians not to wait for the platelet count results before administering intravenous alteplase to AIS patients unless there is a suspected bleeding thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The rate of unsuspected platelet count <100，000/uL of patients at stroke presentation was reported to be 0.3% by prior studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. However， there are two issues. First，the two prior studies were conducted in the U.S population， which may differ in clinical characteristics from populations of other countries. For instance， people residing in Southwestern part of China such as Chengdu， have an average platelet count below 100，000/pL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Second， the two studies both excluded patients with a history of thrombocytopenia. In fact， very few of such patients are reported in the English literature. Whether a platelet count of 100，000/uL is a justified threshold for withholding IVT remains unclear. So， we report the case of an AIS patient with thrombocytopenia who received IVT，hoping to provide some advice for the management of such patients.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\nA 57-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension presented with left-sided weakness and transient loss of vision in the right eye for the past three hours. The patient denied any neck pain or trauma. Vital signs were notable for a blood pressure of 163/88 mmHg and a heart rate of58 bpm. Neurological examination revealed left-sided central facial palsy， left hypoglossal nerve palsy， left limb weakness， and left Babinski sign with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS) score of 4. Head Computed Tomography (CT) showed no evidence of acute stroke. The|删除段之间换行|Double lumen was showed at the right internal carotid artery  and atheromatous plaque at the left internal carotid artery . (A) Transverse section of T2 turbo spin echo sequences.

After IVT， the symptom of left-side facial palsy and hemiplegia disappeared with an improvement of NIHSS score to 0， but a partial right-side Horner’s syndrome with right mitosis and right ptosis was observed. To clarify the cause and artery stenosis， the patient had brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and cerebral Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) at 24 hr after symptom onset. MRI showed AIS in the head of the right anterior limb of the internal capsule . DSA disclosed mild stenosis and dissecting aneurysm in the initial position of the right Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) . The dissecting aneurysm was confirmed by cervical Magnetic Resonance Angiography(MRA) . 24 hr after IVT， anti-platelet therapy was strengthened with 100 mg of aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel per day for 3 months. Subsequently， stenting of the right ICA was performed to avoid recurrence of cerebral infarction. The Horner's\n\n【5】syndrome disappeared， and the blood flow of right ICA normalized after the stenting . The patient had later resumed work without neurological deficits after being discharged. Three months later the platelet count had increased to 88，000/uL and anti-platelet therapy was changed to aspirin 100 mg daily for lifelong.\n\n【6】Discussion and Conclusion\n\nPrior studies reported the rate of having unsuspected platelet count of less than 100，000/uL at stroke presentation to be only 0.3%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. However， both of these studies were conducted in the U.S population and excluded known thrombocytopenia patients. Another Chinese study showed that having a platelet count of below 100，000/uL was common in Southwestern part of China， such as Chengdu 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The mechanism leading to normalization of platelet count after stroke in our patient with thrombocytopenia was unclear. It is possible that thrombocytopenia was acutely caused by stroke. More detailed investigation is needed on the incidence of thrombocytopenia in|删除段之间换行|Chinese stroke patients.\n\n【8】Platelet count is associated with the risk of bleeding. Generally， those with platelet counts between 30，000 and 50，000/uL may note easy bruising， whereas platelet counts above 50，000/uL are usually discovered incidentally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Considering the risk of bleeding complications， thrombocytopenic patients are usually excluded from IVT and hence there is very limited data regarding the safety of IVT in thrombocytopenic stroke patients. Whether a platelet count of 100，000/uL is a justified threshold for withholding IVT remains unclear. We often encounter cases with uncertainty regarding management， for which high-quality data are not available. For these cases， clinical decisions must be made on an individual basis. Based on the scanty literature available on this subject， we would recommend thrombolytic therapy for an ischemic stroke patient with a platelet count of between 50，000/uL and 100，000/pL，provided there is no evidence of a bleeding diathesis.\n\n【9】Grants Details\n\n【10】i) Clinical Vascular Grant In Chinese Physician 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2017-CCA-VG-029)</u>； ii) Independent Fundation of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu Medical College 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. CYFY2017DL06)</u>； iii) National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81870940)</u>； iv) Sichuan Science and Technology Program (No.2018JY0026)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Substance-induced psychosis， also known as drug-induced psychotic disorder， is any psychotic episode that is related to the abuse of an intoxicant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. There remains a paucity of evidence of the cases of isoniazid-related psychiatric illnesses. We report a similar case of suspected isoniazid-induced psychosis.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 31-year-old male educated up to high school， shopkeeper by profession， belonging to middle socio-economic strata in urban area with no prior psychiatric history was brought by his wife to the psychiatry outpatient department with the complains of incoherent speech， garbled sentences， paranoid ideation regarding his family (plotting against him and conspiring to steal his belongings)， auditory hallucinations and shouting at people who were not around since the last 2 days. These symptoms were associated with intermittent insomnia and a desire to stay in isolation and darkness.\n\n【9】The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is one of the commonly used scales to establish about the possible presence and severity of various psychiatric symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The BPRS (Brief Psychiatric Rating Score) was 47 in this patient as evaluated by the psychiatrist on 5h day.\n\n【10】The symptoms started about 4 weeks after he was put on isoniazid 300 mg/day， rifampicin 600mg/day， ethambutol 800 mg/day and pyrazinamide 1500 mg/day， for pulmonary tuberculosis and pyridoxine (vitamin B6)20 mg/day for prophylaxis against neuropathy by the prescribing physician. There was no history of recent ingestion of any psychoactive substances. He had a family history of social anxiety disorder and bulimia nervosa.\n\n【11】The physical examination was unremarkable and the vital signs were stable and testing including a complete blood count， chest X-rayand urine toxicology screening. A thyroid function test initially showed a marginally low Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) with normal triiodothyronine and thyroxine. A computed tomography scan of the head showed no abnormality. Due to absence of any other imminent cause of this behavior an initial diagnosis of drug induced psychosis due to isoniazid was taken into consideration.\n\nThereafter， all the anti-tubercular therapy was stopped by the prescribing physician. Although， he responded minimally after the isoniazid was stopped， the paranoid ideation persisted. The patient was put on tablet olanzapine 10 mg/day， tablet lorazepam 2 mg/day. Rifampicin， pyrazinamide and ethambutol were subsequently reintroduced， one by one to monitor a possible relapse of|删除段之间换行|symptoms. Isoniazid was not reintroduced as it was the most likely offending drug taken into consideration for the symptoms and was subsequently replaced with levofloxacin 750 mg/day by the treating physician to complete the anti-tubercular treatment regimen as per the guidelines. Subsequently， the patient became asymptomatic after taking olanzapine for a period of 15 days.\n\n【13】He stopped taking olanzapine 7 weeks after his visit to the treating physician， but agreed for a follow up in the clinic. He remained asymptomatic in the subsequent follow-up visits to the hospital.\n\n【14】The causality assessment of the adverse drug reaction came out to be possible for this case using the Naranjo Causality Assessment Scale通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The case was reported to the ADR monitoring center under the Pharmacovigilance Program of India (PvPI).\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Tuberculosis remains a major health problem in India. The incidence and prevalence of the disease has decreased compared to the previous decades， still it accounts for maximum DALYs lost among the various communicable diseases. Some of the factors that maycontributeto an increase in the number of TB cases include HIV infection； social problems such as poverty， homelessness and drug abuse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In this case the patient was diagnosed as a case of pulmonary tuberculosis and initially treated with a regimen of four first line drugs isoniazid， rifampicin， pyrazinamide and ethambutol. The BPRS is a rating scale which is used by clinicians and researchers to measure psychiatric symptoms such as depression， anxiety， hallucinations and unusual behavior. The scales first published in 1962 is one most widely used scales to measure psychotic symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. An expanded version of the test was created in 1993 by Ventura et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The presence and severity of various psychiatric symptoms are rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (not present) to 7 (extremely severe). The total possible scores vary from 0 to 126 with higher scores indicating more severe psychopathology通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The association of administration of anti-tubercular therapy and the onset of psychotic symptoms in the absence of any previous psychiatric history provided a strong support for a diagnosis of drug-induced psychosis. Isoniazid is implicated in many cases of psychosis， hence it was first considered to be responsible for the psychotic episode.\n\n【20】Besides psychosis， isoniazid has been implicated in a number of other neuropsychiatric conditions including paranoia， obsessive-compulsive disorder， depression andmania， others including peripheral neuropathy， sleep disturbances， headache and blurring of vision have been seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【21】In this case the onset of the psychotic symptoms that developed4 weeks after initiation of the anti-tubercular therapy and partial resolution was seen after 7 days of isoniazid discontinuation and completely resolved 15 days after treatment with olanzapine. The symptoms onset and resolution were in contrast to a case of drug induced psychosis with a previously unremarkable personal and familial psychiatric history that presented with psychotic symptoms within 12 days of initiation and resolved completely within 2 days of discontinuation of therapy. The patient remained asymptomatic without medication at a 1-year follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\nIn another case ofisoniazid-associated psychosis the person had a|删除段之间换行|previously positive psychiatric history. A change in the mental status of this patient was observed within a week of initiation of isoniazid therapy. Psychotic symptoms continued for 5 days after isoniazid was stopped， eventually the patient was completely asymptomatic within a week 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【23】The drug induced psychotic symptoms usually range from a few days to 2 months after treatment onset with isoniazid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Although the exact cause remains obscure， there are a few suggested mechanisms for isoniazid-associated psychosis.\n\n【25】These mechanisms implicate an over- or underproduction of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin， dopamine and norepinephrine.\n\n【26】One of the mechanism involves isoniazid acting as a Monoamine-Oxidase Inhibitor(MAO-I)， thus preventing the degradation of catecholamine's， serotonin and ultimately leading to raised concentration of these neurotransmitters at the synapse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Another mechanism suggests thatpyridoxine deficiencyultimately leading to a reduction in the concentration of the neurotransmitters. Isoniazid combines with pyridoxal (a form of vitamin B6) to form a complex that inhibits the action of pyridoxal kinase. The action of pyridoxal kinase is to convert pyridoxal to pyridoxal phosphate， which is an important coenzyme in the metabolism of amino acids， including tyrosine and tryptophan (precursors of catecholamines). The result is a decrease in the metabolism of amino acids to dopamine， norepinephrine， and serotonin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Patients with pyridoxine deficiency excrete a number of metabolites of tryptophan in the urine (e.g.， Xanthurenic acid)， after a loading dose of tryptophan is given.

Hepatic involvement is one of the most common extra-pulmonary diseases and was described as11.5% in cohort studied in ACCESS study. In such cases early diagnosis is the key to early installment of specific therapy. This may not only improve the prognosis but may also salvage the possible system failure. Routine radiological investigation is generally sufficient to make a diagnosis， however， rare case presentations may require further evaluation to assess extent of extra-pulmonary disease involvement. FDG PET/CT demonstrates high grade glucose avidity in active granulomatous lesions and hence can be used for this purpose. Additionally， it also enables determination of treatment response. In this case report we describe a relapse case of pulmonary sarcoidosis， diagnosed to have liver and spleen involvement on FDG PET/CT scan which was confirmed on histopathology.\n\n【2】Keywords： 18F FDG PET/CT； Sarcoidosis； Extrapulmonary； Hepatic； Granulomatous disease\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. Extra-pulmonary sarcoidosis is known to occur and may involve multiple organs， such as skin， bone marrow， liver， spleen， muscles， etc. Hepatic sarcoidosis alone involves about half the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. FDG PET/CT demonstrates high grade glucose avidity in active granulomatous lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and hence can be used for diagnosis of extra-pulmonary extent of disease as well as treatment response. In this case report we describe a relapse case of pulmonary sarcoidosis， demonstrating liver and spleen involvement on FDG PET/CT scan which was confirmed on histopathology. Case Report： A 51year old postmenopausal lady presented with fever， weight loss， decreased appetite and generalized weakness since a month. She had past history of sarcoidosis for which she was treated with steroids. Her recent Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) values were high. Contrast enhanced CT scan(chest， abdomen and pelvis) was suggestive of discrete sub-centimeter mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes ， mild interstitial fibrosis in both lungs  and mild hepatosplenomegaly with fatty infiltration .\n\n【5】FDG PET-CT whole body scan  demonstrated moderate increased metabolic activity in mediastinal lymph nodes . There was heterogeneous increased tracer uptake in entire liver and spleen parenchyma with high grade FDG avidity . In clinical context of raised ACE， findings were concerning for granulomatous disease involvement and liver biopsy was suggested. Histopathology revealed distortion of normal lobular and cord pattern of liver cells， swollen hepatocytes with marked macro vesicular steatosis， composed of epitheloid histiocytes， neutrophils， few eosinophils and occasional multinucleate giant cells. Fibrin deposition was also evident within granulomas ； findings suggestive of multiple non-caseating hepatic micro-granulomas.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Extra-pulmonary sarcoidosis is not uncommon， although it is almost always found with concomitant thoracic involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Frequently extra-pulmonary manifestations of the disease are the major cause of morbidity. Treatment often requires consideration of alternative immunosuppressive agents and specific consideration towards the organ system involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Liver and spleen are the most frequently involved viscera， with presence of non-caseating granulomata noted in 40% to 70% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Patients with liver disease may be asymptomatic or may progress to chronic cholestases and portal hypertension. In few cases， this may lead to hepatic failure. When hepatic failure ensues， it is difficult to revert the changes and the patient may require transplant. Hence， complete systemic evaluation for extra-pulmonary organ involvement is imperative. Multiple imaging modalities are used， especially CT scan， for non-invasive diagnosis.\n\n【9】However， in most studies (and so in present case study)， the liver is homogeneous in appearance and hypo-attenuating nodules are rarely seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\nFDG PET scans， on the other hand， shows high sensitivity in localizing granulomatous pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The uptake mechanism depends on number of glucose transporters expressed on cell surface. In case of infection/inflammation， activated inflammatory cells have increased expression of glucose transporters. Also， the affinity of these transporter for deoxyglucose increases by various circulating cytokines and growth factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. This determines localization of FDG in infective sites. There are other areas demonstrating increase FDG uptake in setting of infection/ inflammation， such as bone marrow， spleen and thymus (in children and adolescents). These areas are integral part of immune system and are involved in production of inflammatory substances， antibodies and immunoglobulins. FDG uptakes in these areas are usually low grade and diffuse as compared to focalized uptake in area of infection. In case of Sarcoidosis， FDG PET scan helps in determining pulmonary and extra-pulmonary extent of disease andtype of therapy to be instituted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The degree of|删除段之间换行|FDG uptake also correlates with disease activity and could be used for treatment monitoring and response purposes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In above presented case， pattern of high glucose metabolism in liver and spleen on FDG PET scan in light of raised serum ACE levels largely favored hepatic sarcoidosis. Such pattern recognition may benefit the clinicians to establish a better treatment protocol at an early stage.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】Involvement of extra-pulmonary sites in cases of Sarcoidosis often requires aggressive treatment approach. Since this has an influence on prognosis， FDG PET/CT scan can serve as a single step valuable tool in Sarcoidosis evaluation.\n\n【13】Teaching Point\n\n【14】Increased glucose metabolism in liver and spleen， on FDG PET scan， have varied differential diagnosis including diffuse liver disease like cirrhosis， granulomatous disease， metastases and primary malignancy such as lymphoma. Understanding the pattern of uptake maylead to narrow the diagnosis and could be further confirmed on specific laboratory and histopathologic investigation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Therefore， the aim of the present case report is to present the effect of eccentric- concentric training combined with isometric contraction and simple lumbo-pelvic control exercises on pain and disability in a patient experiencing CPT.\n\n【17】Case Presentation\n\n【18】History\n\n【19】The subject was a 20-year-old female volleyball player with a four- month history of anterior knee pain， in her right knee. She was diagnosed by a specialist (orthopaedic) as having CPT. She has played volleyball for about six years. The site of pain was over the inferior pole of the patella without spreading down and she complained of pain after her training only. The pain subsided within one or two hours after her training. She did not complain of pain after prolonged sitting or while walking downstairs. She did not have any problems with the other joints. She did not complain of other symptoms such as stiffness， swelling， locking， crepitus or giving away. She took no drugs at the time of assessment； she had no history of trauma in the knee before， only two ankle sprains in the same leg. She had followed a physiotherapy rehabilitation program following the ankle sprains. She had no prior physiotherapy treatment for the problem in her knee. She did not have a history of diabetes， epilepsy or cancer and none in her family did. She did not have any operation or illness in the past.\n\n【20】Examination findings\n\n【21】Although the condition was diagnosed by a specialist， the physiotherapist D. S. assessed her knee to rule out other conditions and confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【22】No pain was mentioned during gait and posture. Body deformity， colour changes， muscle wasting or swelling were not noted. In palpation， signs of inflammatory activity like heat， swelling and synovial thickening were not found.\n\n【23】On physical examination， the movements of the low back， hip and ankle were pain free， with full range of motion and full power. All ligamentous stress tests were normal， meniscal stress tests were normal， muscle strength tests were normal and no capsular pattern was found. Isotonic resisted extension reproduced mild pain on the inferior pole of the patella； what is more， after ten fast squats (decline test) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， she experienced a mild pain. The squats were carried out， because the researcher wanted to reproduce the pain. Knee extension by gliding the patella medially was negative， without reproducing the pain； furthermore the position of the patella was normal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. These two latter procedures ruled out the patellofemoral joint dysfunction. Tenderness with palpation over the inferior pole of the patella was found， confirming the diagnosis.\n\n【24】Procedure\n\n【25】The patient followed a supervised exercise programmerconsisting of， isometric C quadriceps exercise， slow progressive eccentric-concentric training of quadriceps and simple lumbo-pelvic control exercises. Firstly， the patient performed the Spanish squat as an isometric quadriceps exercise. The Spanish squat is a double leg squat to be performed at an angle of approximately 70-90° of knee flexion with the assistance of a rigid strap fixating the lower legs. The patient performed 3 sets of five repetitions of Spanish squat with 1-min rest interval between each set. Each repetition was painless and lasted45 seconds. Later， the patient carried out the eccentric-concentric training. As eccentric - concentric training， the participant carried out three sets of 15 repetitions of unilateral squat on a 25° decline board with 1-min rest interval between each set. The squat was performed at a slow speed at every treatment session. The patient counted to 6during the squat. As the subject moved from the standing to the squat position， the quadriceps muscle and patellar tendon by inference were loaded eccentrically； followed by concentricloading， as the injured leg was used to get back to the start position. At the beginning the load consisted of the body weight and the participant was standing with all her body weight on the injured leg. The subject was told to go ahead with the exercise even if she experienced mild pain. However， she was told to stop the exercise if the pain became disabling. When the squat was pain-free the load was increased by holding hand weights. Finally， the patient performed two simple lumbo-pelvic control exercises such as single leg bridging in supine and four-point prone bridging exercises. The patient performed 3 sets of five repetitions of each of the above lumbo-pelvic control exercises with 1-min rest interval between each set. Each repetition was painless and lasted 45seconds. Static stretching exercises of quadriceps and hamstrings were performed as described by Stasinopoulos and his colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> before and after the eccentric training. Each stretch lasted 30 seconds and there was a one minute rest between each stretch.\n\n【26】Supervised exercise programme was given five times a week for 6weeks and was individualized on the basis ofthe patient’s description of pain experienced during the procedure. The patient was instructed to use her knee during the course of the study but to avoid activities that irritated pain such as jumping， hopping and running 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，9，11\\]</u>. She was also told to refrain from taking anti-inflammatory drugs throughout the course ofthe study. Patient compliance was monitored using a treatment diary.\n\nCommunication and interaction (verbal and non-verbal) between the therapist and patient was kept to a minimum， and behaviours sometimes used bytherapists to facilitate positive treatmentoutcomes were purposefully avoided. For example， patients were given no|删除段之间换行|indication of the potentially beneficial effects of the treatments or any feedback on their performance in the pre-application and post-application measurements 13|.\n\n【28】Pain and function were measured in the present study. The patient was evaluated at the baseline (week 0)， at the end of treatment(week 6) and at 1 month (week 10) after the end of treatment.\n\n【29】The VISA-P questionnaire was used to monitor the pain and function of patients. The instrument is a simple questionnaire， consisted of eight questions that takes less than five minutes to complete and once patients are familiar with it they will be able to complete most of it themselves. It is a valid and reliable outcome measure for patients with patellar tendinopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Results\n\n【31】VISA-P score was 42 at the initial evaluation. At the end of the treatment (week 6)， there was a rise in VISA - P score of 39 units. At week 10， the VISA - P score was 86 .\n\n【32】Discussion\n\n【33】The present study examined the effect of isometric quadriceps exercise， slowprogressiveeccentric-concentrictrainingof quadriceps and simple lumbo-pelvic control exercises in a patient experiencing CPT and its findings have demonstrated significant improvements in terms of pain and disability. The results obtained from this case report are novel； as to date， similar studies have not been conducted.\n\n【34】Alfredson et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> first proposed the eccentric training of the injured tendon. It is the most commonly used conservative approach in the treatment of tendinopathy. Malliaras and his colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> concluded that clinicians should consider eccentric-concentric loading alongside or instead of eccentric loading in Achilles and patellar tendinopathy. A Heavy Slow Resistance (HSR) program is recommended in the management of lower limb tendinopathy16，17\\]. The HSR program was produced equivalent pain and function improvement(VISA) than the Alfredson eccentric program， but significantly better patient satisfaction at six month follow-up.In the Achilles tendon， eccentric and HSR have recently been shown to yield similar clinical outcomes (VISA and patient satisfaction) at 1year follow up. Based on the above findings， the HSR program can be recommended as an alternative to the Alfredson eccentric program lower limb tendinopathy rehabilitation.\n\n【35】Recently， isometric exercises have been recommended to reduce and manage tendon pain increasing the strength at the angle of contraction without producing inflammatory signs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，10\\]</u>. Five repetitions of 45-second isometric mid-range quadriceps exercise at 70% of maximal voluntary contraction have been shown to reduce patellar tendon pain for 45 minutes post exercise and this was also associated with a reduction in motor cortex inhibition of the quadriceps that was associated with patellar tendinopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The dosage of isometric contractions in the present was based on clinical experience 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，10，11\\]</u> and their effect on pain in patients with CPT requires further study. The ‘Spanish squat was used as isometric contraction in the present study and is useful when there is limited or no access to gym equipment as in the present situation. Therefore， it was hypothesized that the simultaneous use of these two kinds of contractions (isotonic and isometric) will further enhance the analgesic effect of contractions in the treatment of CPT，increasing the lower limb function.\n\n【36】A component lacking from evidence-based programs is adequate consideration of the kinetic chain. Poor lumbopelvic control has the potential to alter load distribution on the lower limb kinetic chain and increase the risk of lower limb tendinopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，18\\]</u>. It is our belief that the improvement of lumbo-pelvic control can be achieved by performing simple exercises such as single leg bridging in supine and four point prone bridging exercises. Future research is needed to confirm this suggestion.\n\n【37】In addition， hip extensors weakness has been associated with patellar tendinopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Exercises to strengthen these muscle groups should be considered in exercise protocols and patellar tendinopathy. However， hip extensors were not strengthened in the present case trial because the strength of hip muscles in the assessment was normal. Functional activities such as jumping， cutting and sprinting should also be included in lower limb tendinopoathy rehabilitation programs among athletes， but have so far not been included in popular programs in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. These activities were included in the present study. The athlete carried out these activities in the court under the supervision of the gymnast.\n\n【38】The load of exercises was increased according to the patients symptoms otherwise the results are poor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Furthermore，eccentric exercises were performed at a low speed in every treatment session because this allows tissue healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Ice was not recommended at the end of the treatment because research has shown that ice as a supplement to an eccentric exercise programme offers no benefit to patients with tendinopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Finally， the avoidance of painful activities is crucial for tendon healing， because training during the treatment period increases patients' symptoms and delays tendon healing通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【39】Eccentric exercises appear to reduce the pain and improve function. The mechanism by which eccentric training achieves these outcomes remains uncertain， as there is a lack of good quality evidence relating to physiological effects. The clinical improvement of the HSR group was accompanied by increased collagen turnover. It is unknown if the isometric contractions can reverse the pathology of the tendinopathy and in this case the pathology of CPT.\n\n【40】Although a home exercise programme can be performed any time during the day without requiring supervision from a therapist， our clinical experience has shown that patients fail to comply with the regimen of home exercise programmes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Although many ways can be recommended to improve the compliance of patients with the home exercise programme such as phone calls， exercise monitors and better self-management education， it is believed that this problem can be solved by the supervised exercise programmes performed in a clinical setting under the supervision of a therapist. It is believed because our experience has shown that many patients stopped the home exercise programme without giving an explanation， whereas patients completed the supervised programme. One possible reason why they continue the supervised exercise programme could be the cost. In the supervised exercise programme， the patients visit the therapist more times than the home exercise programme， and this is more expensive. A future study will combine the both types of exercise programmes in order to maximize the compliance of the patients.\n\nEven though the positive effects of such an exercise programme in CPT have been reported in the present report， its study design limits the generalization of these findings. Future well-designed|删除段之间换行|clinical trials are needed to confirm the positive results of this case study establishing the effectiveness of such an exerciseprogram in the management of CPT. In addition， structural changes in the tendons related to the treatment interventions and the long-term effects (6months or more after the end of treatment) of these treatments are needed to investigate. Further research is needed to establish the possible mechanism of action of this treatment approach，and the cost effectiveness of such treatment， because reduced cost is an important issue for the recommendation of any given treatment.\n\n【42】Conclusions\n\n【43】The exercise programme， consisting of isometric quadriceps exercise， slow progressive eccentric - concentric training of quadriceps and simple lumbo-pelvic control exercises， had reduced the pain and improved the function in a patient with CPT at the end of the treatment and at one month follow-up. Further well-designed trials are needed to confirm the results of the present case report.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

A case of viable interstitial ectopic pregnancy treated with intramuscular methotrexate is presented and used to critically discuss its management in the light of the presented evidence and we concluded by highlighting some practical points in reporting， diagnosing and managing interstitial ectopic pregnancy.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Many authors in the published literature use the terms “cornual”and “interstitial”pregnancy interchangeably for pregnancies implanted laterally in the uterus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Others reserved the term cornual pregnancy to describe pregnancy in one horn of a bicornuate uterus or a septate uterus or in a rudimentary horn of a unicornuate uterus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. These terms are also frequently confused with the term angular pregnancy， in which the pregnancy is also implanted laterally in the uterus but the implantation is medial to utero-tubal junction and the round ligament of the uterus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Some authors consider the term angular pregnancy is obsolete as it simply refers to a normal intrauterine pregnancy that happens to be located laterally within the uterine cavity and be carried to term 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. While other considers this type of pregnancy to either develop directly over the tubal opening or more probably， in the interstitial portion of the tube immediately external to that opening and then grows into the adjacent uterine cavity， thus considering angular pregnancy as a continuation of an interstitial pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. Angular pregnancy can progress to second trimester or even to term but is associated with high rates of spontaneous abortion， uterine rupture， and placenta accreta， with rupture occurring in as many as 23.5% of all angular pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Definitions and Anatomy\n\n【5】Anatomically， the interstitial part of the fallopian tube (the intramural portion) is 0.7 mm wide and approximately 1 cm-2 cm long with a slightly tortuous course within the muscular wall of the uterus extending obliquely upward and outward from the uterine cavity. Therefore， an interstitial ectopic pregnancy is defined as pregnancy implanted in the interstitial portion of the fallopian tube that is within the muscular wall of the uterus， lateral to the round ligament of the uterus删除4:<u> 1，2，10</u>.\n\n【6】Incidence\n\n【7】The incidence of interstitial pregnancy varies between 2 to 4% of all ectopic implantations and one in every 2500-5000 live births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，11-14\\]</u>. The interchangeable use of the terms cornual， angular and interstitial pregnancy in literatures may have created problems in the reported incidence of interstitial ectopic pregnancy. The frequency of interstitial ectopic pregnancy is increasing steadily with the increasing use of assisted reproductive technologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，15\\]</u>. The predisposing factors for interstitial ectopic pregnancies include： pelvic inflammatory disease， previous ipsilateral or bilateral salpingectomy， previous ectopic and pelvic surgery， tumours， uterine anomalies and in vitro fertilization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Delayed diagnosis of interstitial pregnancy is the main factor contributing to the high maternal mortality rate in comparison to that for tubal ectopic pregnancies； the mortality rate for tubal ectopic pregnancy was reported to be 0.14%， whilst that for interstitial pregnancy was reported to be nearly 15 times higher， at 2%-2.5%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Presentation\n\n【10】Interstitial ectopic pregnancy can present with the classic symptoms of ectopic pregnancy namely， amenorrhoea， vaginal bleeding， and abdominal pain， but the last two symptoms may not arise in some un-ruptured interstitial ectopic pregnancies which could remain asymptomatic for several weeks because the interstitial portion of the tube can expand more than other tubal segments before it ruptures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【11】In a retrospective review of 109 cases of interstitial ectopic pregnancy 54.5% of patients presented with abdominal pain， 22.7%with vaginal spotting and 20.5% were asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Because interstitial ectopic pregnancy is located in the upper lateral area of the uterus where there is extensive uterine-ovarian vessels anastomosis it results in catastrophic haemorrhage when ruptured 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. This explains the higher mortality rate of this type of ectopic pregnancy and highlights the need for early diagnosis.\n\n【13】Diagnosis\n\n【14】Interstitial ectopic pregnancy remains one of the most difficult gestations to diagnose. Eccentrically located intrauterine gestational sac can be misinterpreted as interstitial pregnancy on ultrasound evaluation. Even when interstitial pregnancy is suspected on ultrasound scan (US)， laparoscopic findings may be negative in early stages and present a diagnostic dilemma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，20\\]</u>.\n\n【15】US identification of the interstitial portions of the two tubes is very helpful to exclude the diagnosis of unicornuate uterus and is essential for making the diagnosis of interstitial pregnancy. By examining the fundal aspect of the uterus in a transverse section， the interstitial tubes can be identified as thin hyper echoic lines extending from the lateral aspect of the uterine cavity through the myometrium towards the uterine serosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. They can be seen routinely in women with intrauterine pregnancies <7 weeks' gestation. In women with extra-uterine pregnancies， the uterine position and size are usually not affected by the growth of pregnancy and therefore it is possible to identify the interstitial segments of the tube as late as the second trimester of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\nUS findings consistent with interstitial gestation include an eccentrically located gestational sac at the superior fundal level of the uterus at least 1 cm from the lateral edge of the uterine cavity surrounded by asymmetrical thin (<5 mm) myometrial tissue with a distinct and separate empty uterine cavity， and the “interstitial line sign\"， an echogenic line that extends into the upper regions of the uterine horn and borders the margin of the intramural|删除段之间换行|gestational sac， representing either interstitial portion of the tube or endometrium， which depends on the age and size of the gestation通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，22\\]</u>. The interstitial line sign  have 80% sensitivity and98% specificity for the diagnosis of interstitial ectopic pregnancy. However these criteria are reproducible only in the first trimester and the diagnosis become more difficult and equivocal when the gestation enlarges in the second trimester 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3，23\\]</u>.\n\nAn editorial suggested adaptation of two ultrasound findings for diagnosing interstitial ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>： 1) visualization of the|删除段之间换行|interstitial line adjoining the gestational sac and the lateral aspect of the uterine cavity； and 2) the continuation of myometrial mantle around the ectopic sac .\n\n【18】A recent review of 11 cases of interstitial pregnancies found that the presence of a cornual mass in the absence of any evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy is the most significant finding with a sensitivity of 80%. However， they acknowledged that sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between interstitial pregnancy and a tubal ectopic pregnancy on two dimensional ultrasound scan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Three-dimensional ultrasonography (3D scan) was shown to be an important diagnostic tool as it may depict precise location of the interstitial gestational sac differentiating it from eccentrically located intrauterine gestational sac as compared to other imaging modalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The use of colour flow Doppler in combination with scan may reveal the presence of a vascular ring， which proved an intense peripheral vascularization around the interstitial gestation通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can also be used in non-urgent cases and for evaluation of cases in which ultrasound scans have been inconclusive. The main advantage of MRI as compared with ultrasound is the ability to visualize the whole uterus， and thus identify the exact site of implantation. The gestational sac is located eccentrically in the uterine fundus and is surrounded by asymmetric thin myometrium. Distinction between an angular pregnancy and an interstitial pregnancy can sometimes be difficult. However， in early interstitial pregnancy the presence of an intact junctional zone between the uterine cavity and the lesion (the gestation) is suggestive of an interstitial location  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，23\\]</u>. In second trimester the|删除段之间换行|visualization of the decidua adjacent to the eccentrically located gestational sac is highly suggestive of interstitial pregnancy and help to eliminate the diagnosis of angular pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. MRI features of advanced interstitial ectopic pregnancy include eccentric location of the gestational sac， covered by asymmetric thin myometrium on the uterine fundus， and clear visualization of the decidua adjacent to it通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. MRI may also show myometrial defect and hemoperitoneum which are signs of uterine rupture.\n\n【21】Differential diagnosis\n\n【22】Diagnosis can be delayed due to the difficulty of distinguishing an interstitial pregnancy from other laterally implanted pregnancies including an eccentricaly located intrauterine gestational sac . In early pregnancy，3D scan can be utilized to help identifying the precise location of the gestational sac 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Differential diagnosis with an angular pregnancy is acritical aspect. While an interstitial pregnancy is implanted in the uterine portion of the tube， angular pregnancy is an intrauterine pregnancy located near the utero-tubal junction. Anatomically， these two ectopic pregnancies cause a different uterine distortion： Usually the angular pregnancy leads to a bulge medial to the round ligament， and the interstitial one determines a lateral bulge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Clinically， given the intrauterine location of angular pregnancies as described above and the enveloping myometrium， these patients are likely to present with symptoms later than patients with other types of ectopic pregnancies. On US examination the myometrium is thicker in angular pregnancies and has at least 5 mm or more of myometrium surrounds all sides of the sac while in interstitial pregnancies it is thinner <5 mm and present only in the supero-lateral portion of the sac 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，17\\]</u>.\n\n【24】At MRI， angular pregnancy appears as gestational sac implanted in the lateral angle of the uterus and can be confused with normal pregnancies. This gestational sac will be completely surrounded by uterine myometrium， although focal thinning is sometimes seen. High signal intensity in the uterine wall itself can represent intramural haemorrhage. It is also important to look for placental invasion of the myometrium because placenta accreta is frequently seen in these patients. Given the propensity for rupture， it is also importantto look for myometrial discontinuity and hemoperitoneum whenever angular pregnancy is suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Treatment\n\n【26】Medical management with methotrexate has been used as\n\n【27】Table 1： The diagnastic criteria of different types of laterally implanted pregnancies

A strict inclusion criteria(early gestation， diameter <4 cm， serum beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) of <10，000 IU/l， no evidence of rupture) was suggested and treatment was shown to be success in cases that satisfy these criteria and in women who are able to be monitored for a quite long time after treatment and treated further if required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\nWhen the interstitial pregnancy is correctly identified at an early stage， and is un-ruptured， medical management can be attempted， with the potential advantage ofavoidingsurgery and with an increased likelihood of preserving fertility. Systemic injection of methotrexate(MTX) is the most extensively studied medical regimen. This drug has been administered either a single dose or in a multiple-dose|删除段之间换行|fashion with reasonable success and also administered in a localized fashion， with both US and laparoscopic guidance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. The systemic route of administration offers advantages over local injection of the ectopic gestation in that it is less invasive and not operator dependent. Follow-up may need to be prolonged after medical treatment of interstitial pregnancy as the initial hCG values tend to be higher than those encountered with tubal ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Other medical treatments showing some success include potassium chloride and prostaglandins， both injected directly into the gestational sac during ultrasonographic visualization.\n\nMedical treatment of ectopic pregnancy has a failure rate of up to 35% and rupture of the ectopic pregnancy is also possible during|删除段之间换行|methotrexate treatment even in the face of decreasing hCG values通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25-27\\]</u>. Surgery is indicated when patient refuse， failed or unsuitable for medical treatment， in the presence of significant symptoms， in ruptured cases or in large interstitial ectopic with the presence of a heartbeat 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【32】In the past， laparotomy with either hysterectomy or cornual resection was advocated. Recently， options such as laparoscopic cornuostomy (incision of the cornual region)， or cornuectomy(resection of the cornual region of the uterus and the suturing of the incision site) have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，19\\]</u>. The current trend is to use conservative surgical alternatives to cornual resection in an attempt to increase future fertility and decrease the risk ofuterine rupture during a subsequent pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. These conservative surgical treatments successfully used combination of hysteroscopic， laparoscopic and ultrasound guided transcervical evacuation of interstitial ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28，29\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Intraoperative bleeding remains a major problem for laparoscopic management of interstitial ectopic pregnancies， because of the rich supply of blood vessels at the location of the interstitial ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Various haemostatic techniques have been attemptedfor the control of bleeding. These have included intracorporeal and extracorporeal suturing， endoloop or encircling suture before evacuation of conception， electrosurgey in addition to diluted vasopressin injection， fibrin glue， a harmonic scalpel and uterine artery embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，30- 34\\]</u>. Successful laparoscopic management of interstitial ectopic pregnancies using the automatic stapler to simultaneously excise and stitch the uterine cornua has also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>.\n\n【35】One of the key challenges after laparoscopic surgery is the persistent trophoblastic activity even after cornual resection which may be due to increased myometrial invasion in some interstitial ectopic pregnancies.This hasbeen treatedsuccessfully with methotrexate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，19\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Prognosis\n\n【37】The mortality rate for interstitial pregnancy was reported to be 15 times more than the mortality rate of tubal ectopic； this was attributed to delayed diagnosis of interstitial pregnancy but may also be due to confusion with angular and cornual pregnancies which tend to rupture at a later stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，17，23\\]</u>.\n\n【38】Persistently high serum Beta hCG afterlaparoscopic management has been treated with methotrexate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>.

The drawback to cornual resection and suturing is the use of a full-thickness uterine wall incision (as in hysterotomy)and when electrosurgery is used；the depth of a thermal damage is difficult to be assessed. This has prompt many surgeons to recommend elective caesarean delivery in subsequent pregnancies to decrease the risk of uterine rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，37\\]</u>. However， successful vaginal delivery have also been reported after both cornual resection Wwith suturing of the uterine defect and laparoscopic cornuostomy in which the uterine wall was left open for secondary healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31，38，39\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Case Presentation\n\nA 37 years old women， G8P6+1 presented after 6 weeks of amenorrhea to the ultrasound department. US showed 10 mm gestational sac containing viable fetal pole with a crown rump length(CRL) of 3.4 mm corresponding to 6 weeks gestation. The gestational sac was seen at the right cornual aspect of the uterus and a diagnosis of right sided viable cornual ectopic was reported . She was admitted for further assessment. She was asymptomatic with normal stable vital signs， her hemoglobin was 13.2 mg/dl and her hCG level was 8735 mIU/ml. In view of viable cornualpregnancy and high hCG levels the patient was counselled re surgical treatment as the first option but she declined that option. Medical treatment with intramuscular methotrexate was discussed and she opted for that. She agreed to stay in hospital during medical treatment and have surgery only if developed pain， her vital signs deteriorate and her hemoglobin dropped. She was kept at hospital. According to unit protocol she was given 90 mg Intramuscular (IM) methotrexate and remained stable with no pain in the hospital until day 4 after methotrexate injection. Her serum hCG increased to 13469 miU/ml. She remained asymptomatic with normal vital signs and no change to herhaemoglobin levels till day删除4:<u> 7</u>. Her hCG on day 7 dropped to 10137mIU/ml. A repeat US showed re-demonstration of right sided cornual pregnancy with CRL equivalent to 7 weeks gestation but no fetal heart beat was detected with the presence of Sub chorionic hematoma measuring 1.0 cm x 0.3 cm and reduced peripheral vascularity on colour flow Doppler . In view of the good response to IM methotrexate with a drop of >15% in hCG level and the US findings|删除段之间换行|it was agreed to discharged her for outpatient monitoring and follow up. She was warned and advised to report immediately to the hospital if she developed any pain. She had 6 outpatient visits for serial hCG levels which continue to drop till it become < 5 mIU/ml on day 47after methotrexate injection. She was discharged from follow up.\n\n【42】Discussion\n\n【43】The case presented was successfully managed with systemic methotrexate. This case report and other have confirmed the successful use of methotrexate in treating early interstitial ectopic pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2，24，25\\]</u>. The presence of fetal heart beats in this case confirmed that medical treatment can be used successfully in early viable interstitial ectopic pregnancy even in the presence of detectable fetal heart beats with serum beta hCG of over 8000 mIU/ml. This is in contrast to other papers suggesting that the presence of fetal heart beat is a contraindication to medical management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In the case presented US did not report any of the sonographic diagnostic criteria described in the literatures above for diagnosing interstitial ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3，6，23\\]</u>. There was no use of the available 3D US to confirm diagnosis and the term Cornual instead of interstitial ectopic was used. However， the use of colour flow Doppler during follow up and demonstration of reduced flow and vascularity around the gestational sac was helpful to encourage continuation with medical management. The case reported declined surgical treatment and agreed to stay inpatient after the medical treatment until it was felt safe to discharge her for outpatient monitoring. She had 6 weekly visits over 47 days after the IM methotrexate until she was discharged from follow up. This prolonged follow up requires patient motivation and may not be suitable to all women.\n\n【44】Conclusion\n\n【45】The term cornual pregnancy should not be used to descript interstitial ectopic pregnancy inliteratures.Researchersand editors should adhere to this so the true incidence and the different management modality outcomes for interstitial ectopic pregnancy can be accurately reported.\n\n【46】Sonographers should be encouraged to look for the described the sonographic diagnostic criteria and document these in their report to increase clinician\\`s confidence with the diagnosis especially in asymptomatic patients with viable pregnancy and high serum beta hCG levels. If3 D scan is available this should also be used as it may increases the diagnostic accuracy.\n\n【47】Women suitable for medical management of interstitial ectopic pregnancy should be informed that medical management with systemic methotrexate for early viable interstitial ectopic pregnancy can be successful but post treatment follow up can be prolonged and they need to agree to that before offering the treatment.\n\n【48】The available literature do not provides agreed guidance regarding future pregnancy risks and optimum mode of delivery following treatment of interstitial ectopic pregnancy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This case report aims to provide clinical experience and diagnostic challenges of one ofthe rarest benign diaphragmatic tumors -leiomyoma.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nA 48-year-old patient received left laparoscopic oophorectomy due to serosal proliferative tumor in gynecological department. This procedure was followed by right laparoscopic oophorectomy， omentectomy and biopsies with negative histological findings. In postoperative period patient started complaining with abdominal distress. Ultrasound was performed， which revealed 8.3cm x 14 cm solid mass in liver S6/7 segment Figure删除4:<u> 1</u>. Abdominal MRI was recommended for differential diagnosis during follow-up period. Following tumor markers - alpha fetoprotein， carcinoembryogenic antigen and Ca 19.9 were in normal range. Abdominal MRI revealed 95mm x 120 mm x96 mm solid mass in liver S7/8 segment and right sub diaphragmatic space with cystic degeneration Figure删除4:<u> 2</u>. Multidisciplinary team， including multiple surgeons， radiologist， thoracic surgeons， and oncologists， reviewed clinical case and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images prior to hospitalization and surgery and consensus was made that tumor was not of liver but diaphragmatic origin. Patient was prepared for surgery. Right subcostal incision was made. Following intraoperative examination confirmed that tumor was originating from right diaphragm and pressing on to liver S7/8 segment. The tumor was mobilized by blunt dissection from liver surface followed by mobilization of right liver lobe. Right diaphragm was exposed. The base of the tumor together with surrounding diaphragm was resected using ultrasound knife. The defect in diaphragm was repaired with continuous prolene suture Figure删除4:<u> 3</u>. Postoperative period was uneventful. Patient was discharged at eighth post-operative day.

Most common place of origin of leiomyomas is uterus followed by gastrointestinal tract. Clinicopathological presentation usually depends on place of origin and is often occult， resulting in clinical manifestation when tumor grows to extreme sizes. Primary diaphragmatic leiomyoma is extremely rare， to our knowledge only one published case report exists 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. One of the common pitfalls in interpretation of diaphragmatic tumors is related to anatomical|删除段之间换行|position. Tumors of right diaphragm can often be mistaken with liver lesions， especially if diaphragmatic cysts are considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Most common radiological method for differential diagnosis is abdominal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. In our case， MRI was used to specify origin of lesion， however only during multidisciplinary team meeting correct diagnosis was achieved. Thus， emphasizing the necessity of multiple evaluations of imaging. In the era of minimally invasive surgery， there are several diaphragmatic resection techniques to consider. Depending on the tumor involvement and differentiation，partial or complete resection of diaphragm may be needed， following simple suture closure or prosthetic mesh reconstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Open or minimally invasive approach can be considered. The main aspect to consider choosing surgical approach is tumor size， integrity， cystic vs. solid， and most important - the radicality of resection， because surgical resection is the only curative option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Minimally invasive approach is usually better suited for patients with small lesions， whereas with big tumors may require extensive liver mobilization or retroperitoneal dissection通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. Since benign tumors usually do not involve large area of diaphragm resulting in smaller resection defect， simple closure with interrupted or continuous suture is sufficient， as was done in our case， where diaphragmatic involvement was around 2 cm in diameter and was closed with unobservable continuous suture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Several case reports have reported that the higher expression of Ki67 is associated with malignancy potential in benign diaphragmatic tumors， whereas in our case， Ki67 expression was positive in 1% of tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. Recurrence rate and survival rate varies greatlyand depends on tumor histological type， especially malignant ones， and can range from 54%to 89% in long term survival|15，16.\n\n【9】In conclusion， diaphragmatic tumors pose a diagnostic， clinical and surgical challenge due to their latent clinical presentation and anatomical localization， since the resection is the only curative way.

Although the impact of pregnancy on SLE activity has been debated in the literature， majority of studies have noted increased SLE activity during pregnancy， causing peri-partum complications like pre-eclampsia， pre-term labour and stillbirth. Our case is a 31-year-old woman who suffered pre-eclampsia during her pregnancy， presenting one month post-partum with hemolytic anemia， decompensated cardiomyopathy with serositis and acute renal impairment. She was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus with lupus nephritis and started on immunosuppressive therapy with hydroxychloroquine， corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil. This case highlights the importance of understanding the heterogeneous nature of SLE presentation with multiple organ involvement and the impact on SLE activity on pregnancy and its outcomes.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs. Its predominance in women， especially of child bearing age is characteristic for the disease. It is extremely heterogeneous with a wide range of clinical and serological manifestations and marked disease course in different individuals.\n\n【4】Although SLE can present commonly with constitutional symptoms like fatigue， weight loss and arthralgia， 25% to 50% patients can have serious organ involvement with lupus nephritis， pleural disease and myopericarditis. Additionally， SLE activity is associated with poor pregnancy and peri-partum outcomes with high risk of pre-eclampsia，pregnancyloss，pre-term birth， stillbirth and low birth weight.\n\n【5】SLE is characterized by anemia， hypocomplementemia and raised Anti-Nuclear Antibody(ANA) and double stranded DNA antibody (dsDNA)， the latter being diagnostic.\n\n【6】Today we present a challenging case of a 31-year-old presenting one month post-partum with anemia， cardiomyopathy with a pericardial effusion， pleural effusions， arthralgia and acute renal failure.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】We present a 31-year-old Caucasian female (G1P1)who delivered twins through normal vaginal delivery 6 weeks prior to presenting to hospital with SLE. At 34 weeks， she was diagnosed as having pre-eclampsia with evidence of proteinuria， hypertension and deranged liver function tests. As a result， she underwent chemical induction and delivered twins via normal vaginal delivery without complications.She was hypertensive at>140/80 mmHg in the peri-partum period and was discharged with labetalol. Her past medical history included Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) with previous steroid use and was currently in remission. She was in a family of four， with a history of SLE in both her brother and mother. Two weeks after childbirth， she developed fatigue， shortness of breath on exertion and bilateral leg swelling and was diagnosed as having pleural effusions on chest X-ray. She received frusemide for this and her labetalol was changed to nifedipine. She was also found to have iron deficiency and anemia with hemoglobin of 68 g/L and was given an iron infusion. Other than mild vaginal bleeding post-delivery， she denied any other sources of bleeding. Two weeks following this， she developed arthralgia in the small joints of the hands and a macular， blanching rash over her feet， knees， chest wall and hands but sparing the face. She presented to a public hospital for further assessmentand management ofher anemia and fluid overload.On clinical\n\n【9】Table 1： Classes of Lupus Nephritis according to Renal Biopsy.\n\n| Class  | Type of abnormality  | Management  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Minimal mesangial Lupus Nephritis  | Monitoring  |\n|  | Mesangial proliferate Lupus Nephritis  | Generally， a RAAS inhibitor but can consider immunosuppressive therapy for proteinuria >1 g/24hours  |\n|  | Focal Lupus Nephritis (involving <50% glomeruli)  | Induction and Maintenance therapy with steroids and MMF/Cyclophosphamide  |\n|  | IA： active lesions  | Induction and Maintenance therapy with steroids and MMF/Cyclophosphamide  |\n|  | NA/C： active and chroniclesions  | Induction and Maintenance therapy with steroids and MMF/Cyclophosphamide  |\n|  | IC： chronic lesions  | Induction and Maintenance therapy with steroids and MMF/Cyclophosphamide  |\n| V  | Diffuse Lupus Nephritis (involving>50% glomeruli)  | Induction and Maintenance therapy with steroids and MMF/Cyclophosphamide  |\n| V  | IV A： active lesions  | Induction and Maintenance therapy with steroids and MMF/Cyclophosphamide  |\n| V  | V A/C： active and chroniclesions  | Induction and Maintenance therapy with steroids and MMF/Cyclophosphamide  |\n| V  | IV C： chronic lesions  | Induction and Maintenance therapy with steroids and MMF/Cyclophosphamide  |\n| V  | Membranous Lupus Nephritis  | Consider steroids for proteinuria >3 g/24 hours  |\n| V  | Advanced sclerosing Lupus Nephritis  | Preparation of Renal replacement therapy  |\n\n【11】assessment， she had evidence of conjunctival pallor and a macular blanching rash over chest， hands and feet. She also had small joint synovitis with swelling and tenderness at proximal interphalangeal joints and pitting edema of the feet.\n\n【12】Her vital observations were stable throughout the admission with blood pressures of 120 mmHg to 130 mmHg systolic and70 mmHg to 90 mmHg diastolic. She had a normocytic anemia of Hb 71 g/L， with a blood film consisting of mild anisocytosis with moderate normochromic normocytic anemia with occasional tear drop and rare fragmented red cells. Her hemolysis screen revealed a positive coombs test， a low haptoglobin and high reticulocytes consistent with a haemolytic anemia. Cross-matching studies also found that multiple positive antibodies making it difficult to find compatible blood for transfusion. She also had acute kidney injury with a creatinine of 160 umol/L， hyperkalemia with potassium of6 mmol/L， metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate of 16 mmol/L and a 24-h urinary protein excretion of 0.64 g. Her kidney ultrasound revealed normal size kidneys without obstruction. Her urinalysis revealed 15 million/L erythrocytes without any cellular casts. Additionally， she also had evidence of serositis. This was in the form of bi-basal (left>right) pleural effusions  and a moderate pericardial effusion with moderately-severe reduction in LV function on an Echocardiogram (Echo). She had a serum troponin68 ng/L (<14 ng/L) and a BNP was 3500 pmol/L (<15.3 pmol/L) and her Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm. Her family history of SLE， pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and her current presentation with arthralgia， serositis， haemolytic anaemia and acute renal impairment， prompted an autoimmune screen. Her ANA was homogenously positive with a>2560 titre with reduced C3and C4 of 0.33 g/L and 0.03 g/L， respectively. She also had a high dsDNA level of 4485 IU/ml confirming the diagnosis of SLE. Due to the presence of severe hemolytic anemia with multiple antibodies precluding a blood transfusion and shortness of breath making it difficult for the patient to lie supine， a renal biopsy was abandoned and she was empirically started on treatment. She was given three pulses of intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg followed by prednisolone 50 mg and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily. She was also started on Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) 1 g twice daily as immunosuppression for Lupus Nephritis. Two units of packed red cells were given for her anaemia once she was able to be cross-matched， while her cardiomyopathy was managed with Bisoprolol\n\n【13】Table 2： Autoimmune， haemolytic and thrombophilia panel showing evidence of SLE and haemolytic anaemia.\n\n| Autoimmune screen  | Patient Value  | Normal Value  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ANA  | Positive.

The rest of her inpatient stay was unremarkable but showed an improvement in her renal function from a peak creatinine of 185 umol/L to 93 umol/L.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multi-system autoimmune disease with a heterogeneous presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. It occurs up to 10times 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> more commonly in women， particularly women of child bearing age. It can present with a wide range of symptoms and signs include a rash， arthritis， serositis， nephritis and neuropsychological disturbance with psychosis and seizures. Constitutional symptoms like fatigue and fever seems to be the most common during presentation， rates being 50% to 90% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Arthritis and arthralgia are also common， occurring in up to 90% of patients with a characteristic polyarticular， symmetrical distribution without erosion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.

Renal involvement in the most apparent and can occur in up to 40% of SLE patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The presentation and extent of disease is highly variable， ranging from asymptomatic haematuria/proteinuria to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The pathogenesis is said to be due to deposition of immune complexes involving dsDNA antibodies on various sites in the kidney， namely the mesangium and the subendothelial region通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.Normally， patients present with a raised creatinine， proteinuria and evidence of urinary sediment with cellular casts alongside elevation of dsDNA levels and hypocomplementemia. A kidney biopsy is indicated in most patients with lupus nephritis to establish a diagnosis but patients with <500 mg/day of proteinuria and bland urinary sediment may not require a kidney biopsy. After biopsy，lupus nephritis is divided into categories according to histopathological grading .\n\n【21】Pulmonary involvement is also common in SLE， occurring in up to 90% of patients on autopsy删除4-1:<u>8</u>. It manifests as pleurisy and exudative pleural effusions with a high LDH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Cardiac disease in SLE patients can involve many areas of the heart， notably pericarditis+/- effusion being the most common in up to 25% of the patients通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Other cardiac manifestations include myocarditis and coronary artery disease. Gastrointestinal involvement occurs in up to 40%patients and can result in oesophagitis， pseudo-obstruction，hepatitis， pancreatitis and mesenteric ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Hematological manifestations are common in SLE and span from anemia， thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. The causes of anemia in SLE patients could be multifactorial with anemia of chronic disease due to chronic inflammation being the most common. Other causes include iron deficiency， aplastic anemia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia has a prevalence of about10% in SLE patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u> and is associated with other significant organ dysfunction including renal， cardiac and pleural disease . This type of anemia presents with increased reticulocyte count， raised LDH， raised indirect bilirubin， low haptoglobin and a positive coombs test. Interestingly， a phenomenon called Evans syndrome exists where there is occurrence of two or more hematological immune cytopenias， with ITP and AIHA combination being the most common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. In addition， in 50% of these patients， this could be a manifestation of SLE and present before the onset of SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-13\\]</u>. A study on 26 patients in 2006 looking at treatment of severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia in SLE patients found that corticosteroids were the best first line of treatment for the anemia通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Neuropsychiatric manifestations can not only be frequent in up to90% patients with SLE but can be on a wide spectrum from peripheral neuropathies， psychosis， seizures to cognitive dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The relationship between and pregnancy and SLE is interesting and has been thoroughly reviewed in literature. The effect of SLE on fertility is debatable. Although some studies have suggested a reduction in fertility amongst SLE patients due to age， less ovarian reserve with cyclophosphamide， disease activity and concurrent antiphospholipid syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16-18\\]</u>， others have not observed differences in fertility due to good disease control prior to conception and less use of cyclophosphamide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16-19\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Another concept debated in the literature is SLE activity in pregnancy. Whilst some studies found no significant increase in SLE activity between matched pregnant and non-pregnant SLE patients19， majority of the studies found high SLE activity in pregnant patients. These studies collectively demonstrated a 2-3-\n\n【25】fold increase in SLE activity during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，16-19\\]</u>， most being mild-moderate disease activity. The pathophysiology of this could be due to T cell activity. A healthy pregnancy leads to a shift from TH1 to TH2 mediated immune response， enabling the mothers'immune tolerance to the fetus. SLE is considered a TH2 mediated disease， therefore may worsen during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Risk factors for this seem to be active disease before conception and multiple flares in the years prior to conception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is observed that SLE flares can occur anytime during pregnancy and importantly， several months after delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. However， literature on SLE and negative pregnancy outcomes has been consistent. SLE has been associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia， pregnancy loss， pre-term labour， stillbirth and low birth weight. Pre-eclampsia rates range from 13% to 35%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> in SLE patients compared to general population with risk factors being first pregnancy， nulliparity， renal disease， low complement levels， hypertension and dsSDNA positivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Patients with lupus nephritis have the highest risk with some studies showing rates up to 66%. Pregnancy loss and stillbirth are also higher in SLE， with a rate of up to 20% with risk factors being SLE activity and antiphospholipid syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Preterm birth is notably increased in SLE with rates up to 30% with risk factors being hypertension， SLE activity and higher prednisolone doses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Finally， low birth weights less than 10h percentile are also found in 10% oflive-births in women with SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，21\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Whilst the diagnosis of SLE was not obvious during our patients'episode of pre-eclampsia， presence of pre-eclampsia is a significant marker ofher subacutepresentation ofSLE. Althoughpregnancy is not contra-indicated in SLE patients， careful counseling and monitoring of patient through conception， pregnancy and post-partum period is important. Should our patient become pregnant again， remission of SLE activity 6 months prior to conception and careful co-ordination of the high-risk pregnancy with a multidisciplinary team approach is key 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Theconnectionbetween antiphospholipid d syndromeand SLE is also important. About 40% SLE patients have positive antiphospholipid antibodies although development of secondary antiphospholipid syndrome in SLE is slightly less common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by arterial and venous thrombosis and multiple pregnancy complications including pre-eclampsia， fetal death and placental insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. The specific management of SLE largely depends on the predominant organ system that is involved but a large evidence base has suggested that all patients should be on hydroxychloroquine unless contraindicated通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24-26\\]</u>. A large systematic review revealed that hydroxychloroquine has multiple benefits including reducing flares， protecting in against organ damage， reducing thrombosis and increasing longterm survival通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Other studies have also revealed less skin and integument damage with the use ofhydroxychloroquine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24-26\\]</u>.\n\nLupus nephritis treatment depends usually on the features found at renal biopsy  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27，28\\]</u>. Generally， aggressive immunosuppressive treatment is reserved for classes III and IV with activelesions. Although the effects of treatment on all-cause mortality was difficult to elicit， KDIGO guidelines for lupus nephritis suggested that induction therapy should consist of corticosteroids and another agent. Whilst cyclophosphamide and MMF both lead to similar rates of disease remission and reduction of time to doubling of creatinine， MMFhadlower riskofovarian failure. Therefore，MMFis thepreferred treatment in women of child bearing age， like in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. For maintenance therapy， evidence shows MMF being superior compared|删除段之间换行|to other agents like azathioprine which increases rates of renal relapse and leucopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. After appropriate treatment， patients usually go into remission. Rarely， some patients do not require further treatment after the initial presentation but most lead a relapsing and remitting disease course. The prognosis of SLE varies significantly between individuals and depends on various factors with poor prognostic factors being the presence of renal disease， co-existing hypertension， male sex， black race and presence of antiphospholipid syndrome. Although the overall survival has improved in the last decade owing to increased disease recognition and prompt treatment， SLE still has higher mortality rates up to 5 times more than the general population通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. In summary， the presentation of SLE in the post-partum period is important to note in a young patient with strong family history of autoimmune disease. It is also important to understand that SLE presents heterogeneously with multiple organ involvement with varying severity. Therefore， prompt diagnosis with thorough clinical assessment， laboratory autoimmune panel testing and management of organ disease with an appropriate level of immunosuppression is crucial， to improve the overall prognosis. Finally， it is important to understand the close interaction between pregnancy and SLE with its multiple negative effects on both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The overall management of an individual with SLE should be carried out in a multidisciplinary team involving physicians of different specialties， nursing and allied health staff and psychologists.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The authors report the case of a 70-year-old man admitted to the emergency department for behavioral changes， gait imbalance， dysmetria and fever， macular lesions on the chest and limbs and small penile ulcers. Blood analysis showed pancytopenia， peripheral blood smears with atypical lymphocytes and presence of HIV antigens in the absence of serum antibodies. The serum HIV-1 viral load was over 10000000 copies/ml， which confirmed primary HIV infection. CSF analysis showed elevated protein concentration (67.2 mg/dl) and viral load of 15，990 copies/ml， leading to the diagnosis of HIV encephalitis.

Two days before admission， he started presenting changes in behavior， showing blurred speech， gait imbalance， dysmetria and generalized weakness， and finally with prostration， which led him to the Emergency Department(ED). On examination he was lethargic， with imperceptible speech， febrile (Tau 38.1℃) and presented a macular rash on the trunk and upper limbs， as well as small penile ulcers with white ground and flushed edges. Blood analysis  showed pancytopenia， elevated lactic dehydrogenase and ferritin and peripheral blood smears revealed atypical lymphocytes， some with hyperbasophilic cytoplasm and some in apoptosis. The remaining study， including urine dipstick， chest radiography and cranial tomography were normal. A lumbar puncture was performed revealing a clear cerebrospinal fluid， with elevated protein content (67 mg/dl) and normal cell count.

We report a rare case of chorioadenoma detrusens， presenting as massive hemoperitoneum in a nulliparous woman， in which， a challenging decision of conserving the uterus was taken in low resource settings. Operative findings showed hemoperitoneum of 1000 cc， an enlarged uterus with a rent on fundus with torrential bleeding through it and grape-like vesicles popping from it. Two more thin uterine blebs representing thinned out myometrium， were seen on the anterior and right lateral surface of uterus on the verge of rupture.

Invasive mole， also known as chorioadenoma detrusens， is one such entity which involves trophoblastic tissues， penetrating deep into the myometrium， and at times， involving peritoneum， adjacent parametrium or vaginal vault. They are locally invasive but generally lack tendency to develop wide spread metastasis. Classic presentation of invasive mole is history of amenorrhea， bleeding per vaginum and pain abdomen. However， it may present as massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage， following uterine perforation. We report a rare case of chorioadenoma detrusens， presenting as massive hemoperitoneum in a nulliparous woman， in which， a challenging decision of conserving the uterus was taken in low resource settings.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 25-years-old nulliparous female was referred from a small public hospital to the casualty department of a tertiary care hospital， as a case of ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The patient had history of dilatation and curettage done four months back in view of missed abortion at eight weeks gestation， in a private hospital. No histopathology had been sent. Patient remained asymptomatic for one month and developed bleeding per vaginum thereafter. She assumed it as menstruation， though pattern of bleeding was different from normal. After five days of bleeding， she developed acute pain in abdomen for which she consulted the public hospital. There， her ultrasound showed normal size uterus with endometrial thickness of 12 mm. Bilateral ovaries were normal，however， increased vascularity in bilateral adnexa and mild amount of heterogenous collection in pouch of Douglas was noted. The BhCG levels came out to be 2，97，198 IU. With these reports， patient was referred to our hospital.\n\nOn admission， patient was conscious but had signs of hypovolumic shock (blood pressure of80/60 mmHg， pulse rate of 130 bpm to 140 bpm). She had severe pallor. Abdominal examination revealed a distended and tense abdomen with tenderness in lower abdomen. Vaginal examination showed minimal bleeding， closed external OS and fullness in fornices. Uterine size and bilateral adnexa could not be assessed due to tense abdomen. Paracentesis showed non-clotting blood. Patient was taken for laparotomy immediately.Operative findings showed hemoperitoneum of 1000cc， uterus enlarged to 10-12 weeks size with a rent of 2 cm ×1 cm on fundus with torrential bleeding through it and grape-like vesicles popping from it. Two more thin uterine blebs (2 cm x1 and 4 cm|删除段之间换行|x4 cm)， bluish in color， representing thinned out myometrium， were seen on the anterior and right lateral surface of uterus on the verge of rupture . Bilateral fallopian tubes were normal but bilateral ovaries enlarged with theca-lutein cysts. A clinical diagnosis of invasive mole or choriocarcinoma was made. Keeping in mind， the nulliparous status of patient， uterine conservation seemed to be important. However， risk of rupture of the blebs was a prime concern. Moreover， there was a possibility of inability to achieve hemostasis. The patient's husband was explained about the gravity of situation and requirement of relaparotomy if she bleeds again. Hemostatic sutures were applied on the rent and bleeding was controlled. The protruding grapelike tissues was sent for histopathologic examination. Intraperitoneal drain was inserted due to risk of subsequent rupture of the blebs leading to hemoperitoneum. As ultrasound revealed no mass in uterine cavity， no evacuation was attempted.\n\n【8】Patient remained stable in postoperative period with her stitches and drain removed on 84 postoperative day. Her histopathology showed hyperplastic trophoblasts， generalized cystic degeneration of chorionic villi and presence of molar villi within myometrium. Her BhCG had fallen to 56，781 IU/ml by 8th post operative day. No metastasis found in her chest X-ray and USG whole abdomen. Oncology consultation was done. After reviewing all reports and prognostic scoring (=7) patient was put on multiple agent chemotherapy (EMACO) on outpatient basis by oncology department； patient discharged with proper contraceptive and follow up advice. She received eight cycles of EMACO. Weekly BhCG follow up was done and it was found to be 1.5 IU/ml after 20 weeks follow LP.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\nInvasive moles comprise of 15% cases of gestational trophoblastic|删除段之间换行|neoplasia. They almost exclusively originate from partial or complete mole. Indicative signs of disease are persistent unexplained metrorrhagia or abnormal ultrasound appearance (large size uterus for gestational age and theca-lutein cyst >6 ml)， non-normalization of serum βhCG at 6 months after evacuation of hydatiform mole or massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. These are definitely diagnosed on the basis of myometrial invasion on histology.\n\n【11】Management of invasive mole basically depends on two factors-prognostic scoring of GTN and parity of patient. Low risk GTN includes both non-metastatic and metastatic GTN with prognostic score <7. In patients with stage one disease， the selection oftreatment primarily depends on whether patient desires to retain fertility. If patient does not want to preserve fertility hysterectomy with adjuvant single agent chemotherapy is performed as primary treatment. But in patients wanting to preserve fertility， management solely rests on chemotherapy.\n\n【12】Mitani et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> proposed partial resection of uterus for young women if invasive mole presents with hemoperitoneum. Five women have been reportedly treated this way and four of them delivered healthy babies with cesarean section. Local uterine resection together with bilateral internal iliac artery ligation to combine hemostasis with preservation of fertility has been reported by Goldstein et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Atala et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> reported a case of chorioadenoma detrusens with uterine rupture where trophoblastic tissue invaded broad ligament and right ureter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Hysterectomy followed by chemotherapy was done although it could not save the patient. In our case， the nulliparous status of patient along with point source of bleeding which could be easily controlled by hemostatic sutures deferred us from hysterectomy. Nonetheless there was further risk of uterine perforation through those thinned out blebs but we undertook that risk and left an intraperitoneal drain to watch for any further episode of hemoperitoneum. Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE) is an alternative and has been reported by Shen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> to successfully control internal hemorrhage caused by invasive trophoblastic disease. But UAE was not an option for us， as the facility is not available in our setting. If available， preoperative or immediate postoperative UAE could have been an option in our patient， as it would have alleviated the risk of further hemorrhage to an extent. In patients with stage one disease who desire to retain fertility chemotherapy is preferred option with excellent remission rates. Though a case has been reported by Sunesh et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> where local uterine wedge resection following uterine evacuation without any chemotherapy cured the patient.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】nulliparous patient and hysterectomy should only be opted as last resort. Conservative approach should be considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In the 70% of cases， these tumors constitute benign unilateral lesions of the female breast. Less common are the malignant phyllodes， characterized by stromal pleomorphism and over growth， frequent mitosis and infiltrative borders. PTs， rarely， occur in pregnancy. Here， we present a case of 37 years old women with a giant malignant PT in her left breast， with a maximum diameter of about 24 cm， the largest reported in literature. It grew over 7months， during pregnancy.

They represent less than 1% of primary breast neoplasms. PTs usually present as breast lump and they are diagnosed in all age groups with a median age of presentation of 45years. Rarely are diagnosed during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. These tumors are often clinically benign and are characterized by a rapid growth， with an increased intra canicular growth pattern with leaf-like projections. Malignant PTs are rare and exhibit an enhanced stromal pleomorphism and over growth， frequent mitosis and in filtrative borders. Currently， biopsy is the too lused for diagnosing phyllodes tumors. The treatment is surgery， by wide local excision with sufficient margin of normal breast tissue or mast ectomy.\n\n【4】Here，we presented a case of a 37 years old women with a large breast left mass of about 24 cm diameter. The mass was surgically removed by wide local excision and the histological examination demonstrated the presence of a biphasic fibro epithelial neoplasm. The stromal component exhibited an enhanced intra canalicular pattern and leaf like projections， accompanied by hyper cellularity and moderate nuclear atypia. Stromal over growth was observed. The epithelial component also showed alterations， consisting of marked adenosis are as， accompanied sometimes in lactation like epithelial changes. Furthermore， areas of malignant degeneration were detected. All together these changes were consistent with a giant malignant phyllodes tumor.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nA 37 years old Italian women presented in our hospital， in the first three month period of pregnancy， with a smalllump on the left breast above the nipple， measuring about 1.2 cm. Her only significant past medical history was adenoids. She referred to have a miscarriage eat 36 years old， and to be under hormonal therapy. She never smoked. She had thrombophilia and she was under anticoagulant medication. Shewas an allergic individual to antibiotics，belonging tothe cephalosporin and penicillin class. Shehad not familyhistory of breast or ovarian cancer. Ultra sound examination demonstrated an odular formation on the left breast contained liquid， consistent with a suspicious BI-RADSU4 tumor， according to the BI-RADS classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. Successive examination，by core-needle biopsy， revealed a biphasic fibro epithelial neoplasm. The epithelial components hawed areas|删除段之间换行|of slight iperplasia， while the stromal one presented spindle cells with moderate hyper cellularity， leaf-like projections， without atypia and mitosis， suggesting a doubtful benign phyllodes tumor. After she gave birth， she came back to our hospital. She was breast feeding. At that time， physical examination showed a massively enlarged left breast mass， measuring about 24 cm in maximum diameter . She stated that it was not painful. In particular， mammography revealed that the left mammary gland body was entirely replaced from a poly lobed nodular growth. The patient right breast and the rest of clinical examination were normal. Examination by ultrasound breast with repere revealed a large heterogeneous solid mass with internal vascularity， replacing all normal left breast tissue. No suspicious findings in the left lymph node as well asin the right breast and in the right axilla were detected.\n\nFurther examination with a chest and abdomen ultra sound was performed， which showed no evidence of metastatic lesion. Thepatient under went to a wide local excision with sufficient surgical margin resection . The resected tumor specimen measured 24x16x4 cm . Histological examination demonstrated a fibro epithelial architecture with an exaggerated intra canalicular patternwithleaf-like fronds ， accompanied by stromal hyper cellularity ， and moderate nuclear atypia . Alterations of the epithelial component were demonstrated， consisting of marked adenosis areas， accompanied sometimes in lactation-like epithelial changes. Stromal overgrowth (defined as the presence of stroma without epithelium in at least one low-power field as observed with a x 4 microscope objective) was observed. Amitotic|删除段之间换行|activity of 11/10high-power fields (HPFs) was measured in an area of stromal hyper cellularity. The tumors howed well defined borders. The histological examination was consistent with a giant phyllodes tumor，showing area of malignant degeneration.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】PTs of the breast are rare fibro epithelial neoplasms， which can occur in all age groups， but predominantly occur in middle aged women， with the average of 45 year old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. On clinically examination， these tumors usually present as painless mass with an average size of 4-5 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>.

However， it is still difficult， not only， accurate and reproducible grading classification of these tumors but also the discrimination between benign phyllodes tumors and cellular fibro adenoma as well as between the malignant phyllodes tumors and primary breasts arcomaor spindle cell meta plastic carcinoma in all this spectrum of the PTs. This is due to overlapping microscopic features among these tumors. In addition to add more complexity to the PTs diagnosis and categorization is their intra tumoral heterogeneity.

Affected patients must undergo device removal； however， the optimal timing of new pacemaker reimplantation after infected pacemaker removal is still under debate. Some patients require reimplantation as soon as possible； however， the safety of same-day reimplantation is controversial.\n\n【2】Objective： We sought to evaluate the safety and outcomes of same-day reimplantation in patients diagnosed with pacemaker device infection after lead extraction.\n\n【3】Methods： We recruited patients who underwent same-day pacemaker reimplantation at our center after complete lead extraction due to infection between May 2014 and December删除4:<u> 2018</u>.\n\n【4】Results： A total of 24 patients (median age， 72 years； range， 3 to 92 years) underwent same-day reimplantation after successful pacemaker extraction. All patients demonstrated isolated pocket infection and were pacemaker-dependent. The average follow-up period was 59.7 ±16.5 months. Two patients died 3 years after the procedure due to sudden non-cardiac death. None of the patients developed reinfection.\n\n【5】Conclusion： In this study， same-day reimplantation of a new pacemaker was safe and feasible in patients with isolated pocket infection after extraction of the infected pacemaker.\n\n【6】Keywords： Pacemaker； Isolated pocket infection； Reimplantation；Device-related complications\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】With progressive population aging and the expanding indications for Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic Devices (CIEDs)， the use of pacemakers has increased exponentially over recent decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. With this increase， there has also been substantial growth in the number of CIED complications， especially infectious complications. Antibiotic treatment and complete extraction of the infected CIED are the two dominant methods to control infectious complications通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. However， these interventions are not easy to perform， and the optimal timing for CIED reimplantation after infected CIED removal is still uncertain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Current management strategies have mainly been examined in the context of a population age group distributed between 18 to 75years old. As such， there is limited evidence on the optimal management strategies in octogenarians and children， due to the high incidence of cardiovascular diseases and medical comorbidities in these groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this study， we aimed to describe our experience in the treatment of isolated pocket infection by pacemaker removal with same-day reimplantation of a new pacemaker.\n\n【9】Materials and Methods\n\nPeking University People’s Hospital (PUPH) is thelargest tertiary center for CIED management in China. All patients who underwent lead extraction and reimplantation of a new pacemaker on the same day as leads removal for infection between May 2014 and December 2018 at PUPH were included. Patients who did not un dergo devicereimplantation or did not survive tohospital discharge were excluded from the study. Among all included patients， we compared those who underwent device reimplantation within 48 h of lead extraction with those who received device reimplantation|删除段之间换行|more than 72 h after lead extraction. Demographic data were collected， including age， sex， and medical history， indications for CIED implantation， clinical status， and cardiac rhythm. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Peking University， and all patients provided written informed consent.\n\n【11】The definition and classification of CIED infection were based on the 2010 scientific statement from the American Heart Association on CIED infections and their management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Isolated pocket infection was diagnosed if signs of inflammation were confined to the generator pocket， including local erythema， warmth， fluctuance， tenderness， or hardware protrusion through the skin， with negative blood cultures. Systemic infection was classified as an increase in the white blood cell count and/or a positive blood culture and/or visible vegetation during cardiovascular ultrasound examination. In fact， this study only included patients with isolated pocket infection.\n\n【12】Before the procedure， all patients were treated with intravenous antibiotics from admission to discharge once blood cultures were obtained. Intravenous antibiotics were administered throughout the extraction and reimplantation procedure. After discharge， patients received a 10-day course of oral antibiotics.\n\n【13】Transvenous lead extraction was conducted in the hybrid operating room. All patients underwent lead extraction and new device implantation by an experienced electrophysiologist， with a cardiac surgeon as a back-up. Radial artery sheaths were placed for hemodynamic monitoring， and a temporary pacing catheter was advanced from the femoral vein into the right ventricular apex for pacing support during the procedure. Removal by simple traction was first attempted， and if unsuccessful， more advanced tools were deployed. These tools included locking stylets， mechanical dilator sheaths (Evolution； Cook Medical)， and laser sheaths (Spectranetics). A combination of all of the above or surgical device removal was implemented based on the lead dwell time， the number of leads， and the surgeon's preference. Complete extraction was defined as removal of the entire lead， while partial extraction was defined as removal of most of the lead components， except for the electrode tip and <4 cm of the wire or insulation.\n\n【14】The indication for reimplantation was thoroughly reevaluated before the procedure. The contralateral pectoral was the first choice of placement for the replacement device. Alternatively， the iliac vein or epicardium was considered. After complete lead extraction， the reimplantation region was prepared in a sterile fashion. With the temporary pacing catheter still in place in the femoral vein， the new pacemaker device was implanted.\n\n【15】Post-implantation device interrogation was performed before hospital discharge to identify stable and satisfactory lead parameters. All patients were subsequently followed up by regular care visits at our center. Routine follow-up with device interrogation was arranged at 2 weeks， 3 months， 6 months， and 12 months， and every 6 months thereafter. For patients living in remote areas， survival and functional status information were obtained by telephone.\n\n【16】Results\n\n【17】Patients' baseline characteristics\n\n【18】Between May 2014 and December 2018， a total of 693 patients were referred to the PUPH for infected pacemaker lead extraction. Twenty-four of these patients (17 males； age range， 3 to 92 years) underwent contralateral implantation on the same day as lead\n\n【19】Table 1： Baseline characteristics.\n\n| Patients  | N=24  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Age (yrs)， median (range)  | 72通用删除7(英):<u>(3-92)</u>  |\n| Gender，Male  | 17(71%)  |\n| Comorbid conditions  |  |\n| Coronary artery disease  | 6(25%)  |\n| Heart failure  | 3(12.5%)  |\n| Diabetes mellitus  | 8(33.3%)  |\n| Chronic kidney dysfunction  | 6(25%)  |\n| Congenital heart disease  | 2(8.3%)  |\n| Anticoagulation  | 4(16.7%)  |\n| Stroke  | 3(12.5%)  |\n| Parkinson's disease  | 1(4%)  |\n| LV ejection fraction (%， mean±SD)  | 59.5±12.3  |\n| Antibiotic prior to extraction  |  |\n| Cefmetazole  | 22  |\n| Levofloxacin  | 2  |\n\n【21】Table 2： Original pacemakers implant and lead extraction data.\n\n| Indication  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Heart block  | 17  |\n| Sinus node dysfunction  | 6  |\n| Atrial fibrillation with long RR interval  | 1  |\n| Last procedure before lead extraction  |  |\n| Contralateral implantation  | 9  |\n| Due to malfunction  | 3  |\n| Due to intection  | 6  |\n| Ipsilateral Lead revision/insertion  | 4  |\n| Generator replacement  | 8  |\n| Mean time fram first implantation (yrs， mean ±SD)  | 6.2±5.5(0.5-18)  |\n| Combine RV lead perforation  | 1  |\n| Number of treated leads  | 58  |\n| Extraction taals (leads number)  |  |\n| Locking style  | 12  |\n| Laser combined snare  | 9  |\n| Snare  | 20  |\n| Evolution  | 4  |\n| Simple traction  | 11  |\n| Open chest  | 2  |\n\n【23】extraction， and as such， these patients met the inclusion criteria for the present study. The clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients are shown in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. The population age distribution varied greatly. For example， the population included a 3-year-old child， three elderly patients (>85 years of age)， and two patients who were unable to function independently due to central nervous system diseases.\n\n【24】Original pacemaker implantation data are shown in Table删除4:<u> 2</u>. The reason for extraction was isolated pocket infection in all patients. However， before being transferred to PUPH， most patients (21/24\\[87.5%\\]) underwent at least two device-related procedures， including eight patients who underwent at least one generator replacement\n\n【25】Table 3： Procedural characteristics and outcomes.\n\n| Reimplantation site  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Contralateral site  | 22  |\n| Abdomen  | 1  |\n| Epicardium  | 1  |\n| Long-term outcomes  |  |\n| Fallow-up duratian(manths， mean ± SD)  | 59.7±16.5  |\n| Intection recurrence  | 0  |\n| Death  | 2  |\n| Sudden non-cardiac deaths  | 2  |\n\n【27】for battery depletion， four patients who required ipsilateral lead revision or new lead insertion， and nine patients who had a bilateral implantation history and in the original side with the resident leads. Considering the complexity ofthe patients with bilateral implantation， detailed clinical data are shown in Table删除4:<u> 3</u>. One patient combined right ventricular lead asymptomatic perforation， which was founded by accident before lead extraction.\n\n【28】Lead extraction\n\n【29】Fifty-eight leads were extracted from 24 patients (mean， 2.3 leads/patient， range， 1-5 leads/patient). The mean implantation time for the oldest dwelled leads was 6.2 ± 5.5 years (range， 6 months to 18years). Eleven leads were removed with simple traction， twenty leads required the use of a snare， and nine leads required a snare combined with a laser sheath. The patient with combined right ventricular lead perforation underwent open chest lead extraction. All leads were completely and successfully removed， with no severe procedure-related complications.\n\n【30】Pacemaker reimplantation\n\nThe reasons for same-day pacemaker reimplantation were complex and unusual. All patients were pacemaker-dependent. Six patients were scheduled for same-day reimplantation due to their vulnerable physical fitness， including one three-year-old child， three elderly patients (>85 years of age)，and two patients who were unable|删除段之间换行|to function independently due to diseases of the central nervous system. Two patients could not undergo temporary ventricular lead implantation due to subclavian vein occlusion at the infected site. Thus， we decided to implant a new pacemaker system on the same day. Two patients had obvious pacemaker syndrome， which manifested as an acute decrease in cardiac output and blood pressure during single right ventricular pacing.\n\n【32】Nine patients had a bilateral implantation history. Three of them were scheduled to undergo removal of the original infected leads， but the contralateral leads were accidentally dislocated during transvenous leadextraction. Interim decisions were madeto reimplant the leads on the uninfected dislocated side. The patient with bilateral pocket infection was scheduled for abdominal implantation ofa VVI pacemaker .\n\n【33】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【34】At short-term follow-up， no intraoperative deaths occurred in the study population. Three VVI pacemakers and 21 DDD pacemakers were reimplanted. The pacing threshold， sensing， and impedance parameters were acceptable in all implanted leads during the procedure， postoperatively， and before discharge. There were no acute complications related to device reimplantation.\n\n【35】At long-term follow-up， all patients were followed up at the electrophysiology outpatient clinic at PUPH. The mean follow-up time was 59.7 ±16.5 months (median， 58.5 months； range， 34to 88 months). Two patients who were >85 years old with several comorbidities died 3 years after the initial surgery due to sudden non-cardiac death. There were no instances of new pacemaker infection， including no lead-related infections and no local infections of the new contralateral pocket.\n\n【36】Discussion\n\n【37】The main finding of this study was that same-day reimplantation of a new CIED is safe and feasible in patients with isolated pocket infection after extraction of an infected pacemaker. During a mean follow-up of 59.7 ± 16.5 months， which to our knowledge is the longest follow-up period to date， none of the 24 patients who were\n\n【38】Table 4： The detail information of patients had bilateral implantation history.\n\n| Palieni  | Sex  | Age  | PMH  | Indicalionfor PM  | Original implantalion SI1e  | Original im plan1alion lime  | Abandoned leadsnumber  | Heasan torbilaileral implantaiion  | Coniralaleralimplantalion1ime  | IIrnfeclionsile  | Infeclion lime  | Exlracledleadsnumber  | TLE 10：0lS  | Complicalionsduring TLE  | Reimplantalionsile  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | F  | 77  | HBP.CHD， DMRA renalarterystenosis  | SSS  | left  | 13yeas  | 2  | RVleaddislocation  | 8 years  | right  | i years attercontralateralimplantation  | 4  | lasersheatheombinee  | Transienthypotension  | et  |\n| 2  | M  | 86  | DM HF  | AVB  | left  | 11yeas  | D  | intection attergeneratorreplacement  | 2 years  | both sites  | 1.8 years attercontralateralimplantation  | 2  | locking style  | none  | abdomen  |\n| 3  | M  | 68  | HBP  | SSS  | right  | 14yeas  | 3  | intection attergeneratorreplaoement  | 5 yBars  | right  | 4.8 years atter contralateralimplantation  | 5  | laser sheathcombinedSnR  | contralateral diskcated  | lett  |\n| 4  | M  | 71  | NONE  | SSS  | left  | 12yeas  | 1  | maltunction  | 3 years  | right  | 2.8 years attercontralateralimplantation  | 3  |  | none  | left  |\n| 5  | M  | 74  | HBP.OSASH  | AVB  | right  | 1years  | Move the pulsegenerator to thelelt chest andoonnect the originalelectrode to thesubcutaneoLIStuinnel  | intection  | rmonths  | left  | 1 month attergontralateralimplantation  | 2  | simple trct  | none  | right  |\n| 6  | M  | 76  | kidneystone  | SSS  | left  | 16yeas  | 2  | intection  | syears  | nght  | 1.6 years attercontralateralreplacement  | 4  | S9尼  | none  | lett  |\n| 7  | M  | 73  | DM  | AVB  | right  | 18yeas  | 2  | maltunction  | 11 years  | both sites  | 1Dyeas attercontralateralimpla.nta.tion  | 4  | open chest  | none  | epicardium  |\n| 8  | M  | 46  |  | AVB  | lett  | i years  | 2  | intection  | 2years  | lett  |  | 4  | evolution  | contralateraldislcated  | right  |\n| 9  | F  | 65  |  | AVB  | left  | 1Dyeas  | 2  | maltunction  | 4 years  | left  |  | 4  |  | gontralateral dislcated  | right  |\n\n【40】diagnosed with isolated pocket infection experienced recurrence.\n\n【41】The rate of CIED infection is increasing in parallel with population aging， as is the number of CIED implantation procedures. Pacemaker replacement and aging are strong factors predisposing to pacemaker infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In the present study， the overall rate of a second procedure was up to 28%， and a quarter of patients were aged>80 years.\n\n【42】Antibiotic therapy and complete extraction of the infected CIED system constitute the current treatments for CIED infection management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Despite standardized protocols for CIED infection being established since 2010 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， improper treatments are still used in parts of China. This may be due to a lack of recognition of infection and inadequate preparation for complete extraction. Six patients underwent removal ofonly the infected pulse generator， not the entire system， before a new device was implanted on the contralateral side. During CIED removal on the infected side in patients with bilateral CIEDs， the contralateralleads were dislocated in three patients. Thus， such inappropriate treatments could not solve the infection on the original side and very likely contaminated the healthy contralateral side， increasing the complexity of surgery and economic loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【43】In principle， patients with infected CIEDs are treated using two separate procedures， one for lead extraction and one for reimplantation. Current guidelinesrecommena that CTED reimplantation in patients with positive blood cultures should be delaved for 72 h to allow blood cultures to return to negative. In patients with isolated pocket infection， however， guidelines do not address the optimal reimplantation time owing to the paucity of literature exploring the timing of CIED replacement and reinfection risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In addition， even though the use of an active fixation lead connected to an external pulse generator has proven safe in pacemaker-dependent patients after transvenous lead extraction， these temporary leads require maintenance and are associated with infection recurrence \\[8，91.\n\n【44】Recent studies have shown that there is no significant correlation between the timing of reimplantation and survival in patients with isolated pocket infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，10\\]</u>. In a prospective study of 434 patients who underwent complete system removal due to CIED infection， 23patients underwent same-day reimplantation， and the reinfection rate was as low as in the delayed reimplantation group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Another study by Mountantonakis et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> included 15 patients who underwent reimplantation of a new device on the contralateral side on the same day as lead extraction for isolated pocket infection. There was no infection of the new system at a mean follow-up of 39.6months. In a study by Spanish scholars， a new system was implanted on the contralateral side in the same procedure in 152 patients and in a second procedure in 57 patients， with no difference in relapse after1 year of follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\nAt our center， the strategies for pacemaker reimplantation and lead extraction are carefully discussed on a case-by-case basis by an experienced CIED management team， including， as a minimum， an electrophysiologist and a cardiothoracic surgeon. Certain factors are considered， including the extent of infection， degree of pacing dependency，presence of bilateral subclavian vein occlusion， physical fitness to sustain a second procedure (octogenarians， children， patients who cannot take care of themselves for other reasons)， and VVI syndrome. The factors that determine the final decision are not always isolated. In fact， for cases of simple local pocket infection， the proportion of patients who underwent same-day reimplantation was|删除段之间换行|3.5%(24 of 693) at our center.\n\n【46】Leadless pacemakers have become an excellent alternative to traditional CIEDs in these challenging cases， such as in patients with recurrent device infection， occlusion of the subclavian venous access， or bilateral implants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>. Some centers attempt simultaneous reimplantation of a new leadless pacemaker and lead extraction. For example， in a study by El-Chami et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， 40 patients (37.1%) underwent leadless pacemaker implantation during the same procedure as device removal， with no recurrent device-related infections after a mean follow-up period of 8.5 months. Zhang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> also performed leadless pacemaker reimplantation immediately after removal of an infected pacing system in eight patients with pocket infection. Kypta et al. demonstrated the feasibility of Micra y n implantation just before conventional pacemaker lead extraction during the same procedure in two patients. Both of these studies indicate that it is safe and feasible to implant leadless pacemakers without delay in patients with isolated pocket infection after transvenous lead extraction. However， more research is required to support this conclusion. Our approach to same-day traditional pacemaker implantation might provide an empirical basis to support this strategy.\n\n【47】Study Limitations\n\n【48】This study has some limitations that should be noted. First， it was a small single-center retrospective study with a degree of selection bias. Second， the small sample size of our study meant that a multivariate analysis was unsuitable.\n\n【49】Conclusion\n\n【50】In this study， same-day reimplantation of a new pacemaker during lead extraction for isolated pocket infection was feasible and was not associated with long-term adverse outcomes. To ensure the safety of same-day reimplantation， it is necessary to ensure that there is no bacteremia during transvenous lead extraction， which should be confirmed in future prospective studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "dc6a8d2f-7eff-4a7b-b6fa-e2421f850bde", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication that affects some children a few weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The similarities of MIS-C with Kawasaki Disease (KD) and Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) suggest that the syndrome represents a spectrum of diseases. MIS-C， which is initiated by an overactive immune response in children， puts pressure on the heart， as inflamed blood vessels become incapable of carrying adequate blood， hence producing cardiac complications. Here we describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 23 patients who were admitted to our unit and diagnosed with MIS-C. The outcome was favorable for all patients after receiving treatment with a combination of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG)， aspirin， and， for some patients， a corticosteroid. Only one patient required intensive-unit care. The average hospital stay was 7 days， and no mortality occurred. For some patients， MIS-C's unopposed inflammatory state progresses rapidly to multiorgan failure. Cardiovascular complications consisting of shock， myocarditis， decreased cardiac function， and coronary artery dilatation was noted in 43% of the patients in our study. The goal of our study is to identify clinical features and laboratory results， if any， associated with severe clinical outcomes of MIS-C. Such information would help in the decision to initiate targeted immunotherapy quickly.\n\n【2】Keywords： Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)； Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome (PIMS)； Hyperinflammatory shock； Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome2 (SARS-CoV-2)； Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19)； Children； Pediatric\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Shortly after the World Health Organization (WHO) classified COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020 reports begun to emerge a post-infection syndrome with multisystem involvement with circulatory shock and systemic inflammation in children aged 0 to 19 years. A health alert from the United States described the condition， instituted mandatory reporting of cases， and the Center of Disease Control (CDC) created a case definition on May 13h，2020通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This syndrome， which has similarities with Kawasaki Disease (KD)， the most frequent vasculitis in children， and Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS)， was formally named Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). By mid-January 2022， 6，431 children in the United States have been diagnosed with MIS-C， and 55 children have died from it 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\nEarly on， it was suspected that MIS-C is associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). One evidence is that 98% of MIS-C patients reported in the CDC website had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2， and the remaining 2% of patients had contact with someone with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Reports continue to emerge of children with MIS-C among communities with high rates of COVID-19， with the peak of MIS-C usually lagging the peak of COVID-19 wave by a few weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. The lag suggests that the development of the KD-like disease is likely the result of a post-viral immunological reaction. Per the WHO， a confirmed case of MIS-C TTO凸PC is defined as follows： An individual aged 21 years or less， presenting with fever，laboratory evidence of inflammation， and evidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalization， with multisystem(more than 2) organ involvement (cardiac， renal， respiratory， hematological， gastrointestinal， dermatological， or neurological)； and no alternative plausible diagnoses； and positive test result for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain|删除段之间换行|Reaction (RT-PCR)， serology， or antigen test； or COVID-19 exposure within the 4 weeks before the onset of symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Many children with MIS-C meet the criteria for complete or incomplete KD. An exaggerated systemic inflammatory response(cytokine storm) leading to vascular endothelial damage and1e immune-mediated tissue damage is observed in both MIS-C and KD. Epidemiologically， however， there are important differences between MIS-C and KD. While classic KD has a higher incidence among children of Asian descent， data from the United States shows that MIS-C was diagnosed more in Black and Latino children than other ethnic groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. While the average age of patients suffering from KD is 2 years old， and 75% are under 5 years old， only 24%of children diagnosed with MIS-C were in that age group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Most children diagnosed with MIS-C are children and adolescents who were previously healthy and had a median age of 10 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Methods\n\n【8】We describe a retrospective study of 23 cases that were diagnosed with MIS-C from November 264， 2020， to January 11h，删除4:<u> 2022</u>. The study was performed in the Pneumo-allergology and pediatric Infectiology Department at the Children’s Hospital in Rabat. The inclusion criteria were set in accordance with the MIS-C criteria definition published by the WHO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Data analysis was performed on anonymized clinical data.\n\n【9】All children who meet diagnostic criteria for MIS-C are managed in the inpatient setting. At admission， the patients were considered as suspected cases of COVID-19 and were managed according to the recommendations of the countrys Ministry of Health. All patients undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of presentation， and infection control precautions are used pending the results of initial testing. SARS-CoV-2 infection tests were based on RT PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs， as well as serological tests to detect the presence of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 (IgM and IgG in the blood/serum ofthe patients). When the first RT-PCR test for a patient returns a negative result， we perform a second test for confirmation. A positive serological test (IgM or IgG， or both) associated with a negative RT-PCR test was considered consistent with a previous or current infection.\n\n【10】COVID-19 waves in Morocco\n\n【11】The first COVID-19 case in Morocco was reported on March 2nd删除4-1:<u>，2020</u>. The epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases in the country recorded three waves at different time intervals： the first wave from April 2nd\n\n【12】Table 1： Presenting symptoms (comparison with published reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>).\n\n【13】to 8h， 2020， was followed by a second， larger wave between April 184and April 26h， 2020， coinciding with the large clusters registered in industrial， commercial， penitentiary and family settings. The third wave， which was less pronounced， occurred between April 28th and May 2nd删除4-1:<u>，2020</u>. The positivity rate among children was initialy high； at 20.8% in March 2020， it slightly exceeded the rate for the rest of the population， but it dropped to 6.5% in May of the same year. For comparison， when the total number of cases in Italy reached 58，000in March 2020， only 597 cases (1%) were children aged 18 years or less. During the first wave， a single death was recorded in a 17-month-old infant admitted with a severe picture of respiratory distress， a history of delayed weight (7 kg at 17 months) and renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Among children aged 14 years or less， 57.3% of cases were asymptomatic， 39%had mild symptoms， and they were moderate for 3% of the patients. About 0.6% of cases had severe symptoms.\n\n【14】The patients described in this study presented to our hospital， which is one of the major referral public university hospital centers. Our findings support already published observations of the post-COVID-19 inflammatory syndrome in 5 children from a different region in Morocco 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】Patient age demographics\n\n【17】The 23 patients in our study were predominantly male (19 males and 4 females) and were 7.5 years old in average. While published report indicate that only 24% of children diagnosed with MIS-C are less than 5 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， the proportion of patients in our study in that age group is 48%. In particular， 3 of the four female patients in our study are under 5 years old. None of the patients had a significant medical history， or prior pathological conditions.\n\n【18】SARS-CoV-2 test results\n\n【19】Results from RT-PCR tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs were negative for all patients. For each patient in our study， we performed RT-PCR tests twice， and both results were negative. Only one patient had a confirmed COVID-19 infection 4-week before presentation. SARS CoV-2 IgM and IgG were both positive for 3 patients (13%). IgM serology was negative and IgG serology positive for 19 patients (83%)， indicating previous infections. For one patient， IgM was positive and IgG serology negative. Contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in 11 cases (3 to 5 weeks prior to the consultation).\n\n| Symptom  | Reported in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>  | % Cases in our study  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Persistent fevers  | 100  | 100  |\n| Gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain， vomiting， diarrhea)  | 60 to 100  | 71  |\n| Rash  | 45 to 76  | 53  |\n| Conjunctivitis  | 30 to 81  | 76  |\n| Mucous membrane involvement  | 27 to 76  | 100  |\n| Neurocognitive symptoms (headache，lethargy， confusion， seizures)  | 29 to 58  | 18  |\n| Respiratory symptoms (tachypnea， labored breathing)  | 21 to 65  | 29  |\n| Sore throat  | 10 to 16  | 71  |\n| Myalgias  | 8 to 17  | 6  |\n| Swollen hands/feet  | 9 to 16  | 12  |\n| Lymphadenopathy  | 6 to 16  | 47  |\n|  |  |  |\n\n【21】Table 2： Laboratory results (comparison with published reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>).\n\n| Laboratory Finding  | Units  | Normal Range  |  | Study Results  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Laboratory Finding  | Units  | Min  | Max  | Median  | Min  | Max  |\n| Hemoglobin level  | g/dl  | 13  | 16.5  | 11  | 8.7  | 14  |\n| Platelet count  | 10%L  | 150  | 400  | 208  | 102  | 776  |\n| Leukocyte count  | 10%L  | 4  | 10  | 11.2  | 3.8  | 20.6  |\n| Neutrophil count  | 10%L  | 1.5  | 7  | 9.3  | 2.4  | 16.4  |\n| Lymphocyte count  | 10%L  | 1  | 4  | 1.5  | 0.61  | 5.8  |\n| Eosinophil's count  | 10%L  | 0.1  | 0.4  | 0.5  | 门  | 0.61  |\n| C-reactive protein level  | mg/L  |  | 5  | 180  | 97  | 364  |\n| Erythrocyte sedimentation rate  | mm/h  |  | 10  | 64  | 17  | 125  |\n| Serum ferritin  | ng/ml  | 21  | 274  | 450  | 90  | 2500  |\n| Sodium level  | mmo/L  | 136  | 145  | 129  | 119  | 138  |\n| Urea level  | g/L  | 0.15  | 0.55  | 0.2  | 0.18  | 1.09  |\n| Creatinine level  | mg/L  | 5.7  | 12.5  | 5  | 3  | 19.7  |\n| Alanine aminotransterase level  | U/L  |  | 55  | 26  | 19  | 57  |\n| Aspartate aminotransterase level  | U/L  | 5  | 34  | 30  | 13  | 148  |\n| Triglyceride's level  | g/L  | 0.3  | 1.3  | 5  | 0.75  | 5.93  |\n| D-dimer  | ug/mL  |  | 0.5  | 26  | 0.7  | 43.7  |\n| Fibrinogen  | g/L  | 2  | 4  | 30  | 3.6  | 12  |\n\n【23】Table 3： Patients with severe manifestations.\n\n| Patient  | Sex  | Age (Months)  | KD  | MAS  | Severity  | Kobayashi score  | Corticosteroids  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | M  | 56  | Complete  |  | 5  | 1  |  |\n| 8  | M  | 108  | Incomplete  |  | 5  | 3  |  |\n| 19  | M  | 50  | Incomplete  |  | 5  | 2  |  |\n| 17  | M  | 96  | Incomplete  | Yes  | 2，3，4  | 6  | Yes  |\n| 22  | M  | 168  | Incomplete  |  | 2.3.4  | 4  |  |\n| 12  | M  | 56  | Incomplete  | Yes  | 2，3，4，5  | 4  | Yes  |\n| 21  | M  | 192  | Incomplete  | Yes  | 2，3，4，5  | 7  | Yes  |\n| 7  | M  | 180  | Incomplete  | Yes  | 2，4，5  | 6  | Yes  |\n| 14  | M  | 188  | Incomplete  | Yes  | 2，4，5  | 6  | Yes  |\n| 16  | M  | 28  | Complete  |  | 2.5  | 4  |  |\n\n【25】Severity codes： 1： Admitted to ICU； 2： Decreased cardiac function； 3： Shock； 4： Myocarditis； 5： Coronary artery abnormality； 6： Death\n\n【26】Presenting symptoms\n\n【27】The patients presented to our hospital 9 days in average after onset of symptoms. They all had prolonged fever (5 to 18 days， with an average of 9 days). All patients had been given antipyretics for fever control before their presentation to our unit， but none of them responded to the treatment. Nineteen 通用删除7(英):<u>(19)</u> patients had been given antibiotics， but none of them responded to the treatment.

The results were normal for 1 patient， mesenteric adenolymphitis for 1 patient and peritoneal and pelvic effusion for 1 patient.\n\nAs shown in Table 2， the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) are elevated for all patients， indicating a marked inflammatory state. Microcytic hypochromic anemia was present in only 2 patients (9%). Leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils was noted in 4 patients (17%). Lymphopenia was found in 11 patients (48%). Thrombocytosis was observed in 3 patients (13%) and Thrombocytopenia in other 3patients (13%). Hyper eosinopenia was identified for 5 patients (22%). Hyponatremia was found in 11 patients (48%). Hypertriglyceridemia was noted for 8 patients (35%). Hepatic cytolysis with Aspartate Aminotransferase (ASAT) was identified in 3 patients (13%). There were 3 cases (13%) of renal failure. Macrophage activation syndrome|删除段之间换行|was noted in 4 cases (17%). Cytobacteriological examination of the urine revealed aseptic leukocyturia in 6 patients (28%). D-dimer was elevated for all patients. Hyperferritinemia was observed for 11patients (48%).\n\n【45】Blood culture test was performed in 14 patients (61%) and was negative for all ofthem. Lumbar puncture was performed in 4 patients and was also negative for all of them.\n\n【46】Severe manifestations\n\n【47】Ten patients (43%) presented with severe manifestations， which included state of shock， decreased cardiac function， myocarditis， and coronary artery abnormality . Table 3 shows the combination of features for each patient who showed a severe manifestation， and the type of severe manifestation. We note that patients who required corticosteroids have a high Kobayashi score(and thus are insensitive to IVIG) and had MAS manifestations.\n\n【48】As shown in Table 4， slightly more than half the male patients in our study had severe manifestations. None of the female patients had such manifestations. Only one third of patients with complete KD exhibited severe manifestations， but half the male patients with incomplete KD had severe manifestations. Two thirds of the patients with MAS also had severe manifestations.\n\n【49】Discussion\n\n【50】Patientsin 011rstudypredominantlyhad feveerrwith gastrointestinal (79%)， cardiovascular (50%)， and mucocutaneous(71%) manifestations， which is consistent with other reports about MIS-C通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12-14\\]</u>. Respiratory manifestations other than cough were observed in 30% of our patients. All but one patient had highly elevated levels of C-Reactive Protein (CRP)， suggesting that a hyperinflammatory state.\n\n【51】In the addition to the epidemiological differences between KD and MIS-C discussed earlier， MIS-C patients meeting KD diagnostic criteria have lower white blood cell count and lower platelet levels， but greater levels of CRP and ferritin compared with classic cases of KD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. MIS-C cases exhibit greater prevalence of multisystem involvement， notably cardiac abnormalities such as myocarditis and shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. These differences were confirmed for the patients in our study.\n\n【52】One of the most severe complications of KD is coronary artery aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Possible mechanisms of myocardial involvement are speculative and include direct viral invasion of myocyte and systemic inflammatory response triggering myocyte injury， which can be compounded by myocardial ischemia secondary to hypotension \\[11. Without adequate treatment， 20% of untreated children can develop a Coronary Artery (CA) aneurysm which poses a significant risk of thrombosis and myocardial infarction later in life. Large aneurysms can rupture and lead to death. The incidence of Coronary Artery(CA) abnormalities in our patients was 23%， slightly outside the range reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， highlighting the importance of routine echocardiography in all children with MIS C， regardless of apparent sub-phenotype.\n\nManagement of MIS-C has evolved over the course of the pandemic， and the American College of Rheumatology has published recently， the guidelines for the treatment of MIS-C， recommending using immunoglobulins and/or high dose corticosteroids as a first-line treatment. Since all patients meet criteria for incomplete or complete Kawasaki Disease (KD)， standard therapies for KD were|删除段之间换行|administered， including Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG)，and aspirin， and glucocorticoids in the event of Macrophage Activation Syndrome(MAS)and in the event ofcardiac involvement(myocarditis and significant aneurysm). Glucocorticoids are used in this event of MAS or cytokine release syndrome (CRS； also called cytokine storm) because it may not respond to IVIG therapy. The dosing for IVIG is 2g/kg， administered in a single infusion over 8 h to 12 h. Acetylsalicylic acid was administered in anti-inflammatory doses (80 mg/kg/day to100 mg/kg/day) upon admission of the patients and was maintained until thermal defervescence with regression of the biological inflammatory syndrome， then continued in anti-aggregating doses (3mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Glucocorticoid therapy is administered as intravenous methylprednisolone in bolus for 1 to 3days at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day was administered. In case of persistence of fever 36 h after the end of the IVIG infusion， a second dose of immunoglobulins was given. The treatment response was defined as a resolution of clinical signs and inflammatory markers. This approach is consistent with published guidance from American medical bodies pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2\\[81.\n\n【54】All patients in our study were administered IVIG， aspirin， and， tor some patients， methylprednisolone per recommendations based on Kobayashi score： IVIG at 2 g/kg， and aspirin at 50 mg/kg to 80 mg/kg per day (Kobayashi score <5) for 5 days or aspirin at 30 mg/kg per day plus methylprednisolone at 2 mg/kg per day for 5 days (Kobayashi score 25)， followed by a tapering of methylprednisolone over 2 weeks通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Aspirin was maintained until 48 h after defervescence， and then continued at an anti platelet dose of 3 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg per day for8 weeks. Response to treatment was defined as the normalization of vital signs， CRP， and blood tests， and the resolution of symptoms and signs.\n\n【55】Patients with persistent or recurrent fevers， persistently elevated or rising inflammatory markers， and/or worsening clinical status are considered to have an inadequate response. Assessment of the patient's response to initial therapy is typically made over 1 to3 days； however， it may be reasonable to wait a longer duration in patients without severe manifestations. Adjunctive therapies include interleukin 1 inhibitors (e.g.， anakinra， canakinumab)， interleukin 6inhibitors (e.g.， tocilizumab)， high-dose (pulse) glucocorticoids， and convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients\n\n【56】Conclusion\n\n【57】Our study shows that the similarities of MIS-C with Kawasaki Disease (KD) and Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) suggest that MIS-Crepresents aspectrum of diseases.

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus with envelope belongs to the genus of B-coronavirus. It is the seventh kind of human coronavirus infections， closely related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)，characterized by lower respiratory infection. In the past 20 years， more than 10，000 cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection have been reported in the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV，SARS-CoV-2 has stronger infectivity. As of September2021， more than 200 million confirmed cases and more than 4 million deaths have been reported in the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Considering there are many infections of COVID-19 are asymptomatic， the total number of infections may larger 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As we known， pregnant women are a vulnerable population who were more susceptible to viral infections.SARS-CoV orMERS-CoV infection during pregnancy could lead severe complications such as maternal death， stillbirth， spontaneous miscarriage， and so on. It has been reported that the mortality rate of SARS-CoV infection in pregnant women was|删除段之间换行|25% (10% of the general population)， while the mortality rate of pregnant women infected with MERS-CoV was as high as 37%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2，5-7\\]</u>. Therefore， a SARS-CoV-2 screening method for pregnant women is required， especially to differentiate the asymptomatic from health pregnant women. The main mode of SARS-CoV-2 spread from person-to-person is through respiratory droplets， close contact and high concentration aerosol transmission. Vertical transmission is also reported occasionally. Some studies showed that a low proportion of newborns delivered from pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were infected with SARS-CoV-2， but most of them had no evidence of placental infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. A Sweden team reported a confirmed intrauterine vertical SARS-CoV-2 case with high viral load in placenta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Therefore， the possibility of intrauterine transmission in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ignored. Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) based on cell-free DNA(cfDNA) which is present in maternal plasma has been introduced in routine pregnant examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Pregnant women in Changsha， Hunan could get free NIPT， benefitting from the financial support provided by the government's preferential policies. In this study， we present an approach of noninvasive prenatal testing of SARS-CoV-2(NIPT-SARS-CoV-2) to achieve the screening of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women during routine prenatal examination.\n\n【8】Materials and Methods\n\n【9】Study design\n\n【10】This study was approvedbythe Ethics Committee ofthe Changsha Hospital for Maternal and Child Health Care， Hunan， China. A total of 50 pregnant women were recruited from Changsha Hospital for Maternal and Child Health Care between July and September 2020for this study， in which 40 were NIPT negative and 10 were NIPT positive. The SARS-CoV-2RNA sample used in this study was from COVID-19 patients visited in the First Hospital of Changsha，Hunan， China. Written consent was obtained from all participants. An optimized NIPT was designed to detect fetal aneuploidy and SARS-CoV-2 at the same time.\n\n【11】Plasma separating and processing\n\n【12】First， peripheral blood of pregnant women was centrifuged at1，600 g for 10 min at 4-C. Second， the supernatant was transferred to 2.0 ml EP tubes， centrifuged again at 16，000 g for 10 min at 4C. Finally， the plasma was transferred to fresh tubes and immediately stored in -80-C， with 0.6 ml each tube. The separated plasma was divided equally into two parts， one was for extracting cfDNA， and the other was for extracting SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The plasma cfDNA was extracted by QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen， Germany). The plasma RNA was extracted by QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen， Germany)， and then was reverse transcripted to cDNA immediately by Fapon RNA-sep cDNA Synthesis Kit (Feipeng， China).\n\n【13】Library constructing and sequencing\n\nThe cfDNA and SARS-CoV-2 cDNA were mixed in equal proportion and were used as the input DNA to make the NIPT library. Three groups of libraries were set up， including negative group， trisomy positive group， and simulated SARS-CoV-2 group. The negative group library was prepared by cfDNA and SARS-CoV-2cDNA from NIPT negative pregnant women. The trisomy positive group library was prepared by cfDNA and SARS-CoV-2cDNA from NIPT positive pregnant women. The simulated SARS-CoV-2 group library was prepared by cfDNA from NIPT negative pregnant women|删除段之间换行|and SARS-CoV-2 cDNA from COVID-19 patients. Three different SARS-CoV-2 concentration gradients were set up in the simulated SARS-CoV-2 group， including 1，400 copies/ml， 14，000 copies/ml， and 140，000 copies/ml. Through end repairing， adding adapter， and PCR amplification to prepare the NIPT library， after quality control， the products were sequenced on the Ion Proton platform (Life Technologies，USA).\n\n【15】Data analysis\n\n【16】The Quality Control (QC) analysis was used to filtered the low-quality reads from raw sequencing data. The clean data were mapped to human genome 19 (hg19). The BAM files obtained were sorted and the PCR repeat reads were filtered. NIPT analysis software (Darui Biotechnology Co.， Ltd.， Guangzhou， China) was used to preform GC-bias correcting and Z-score calculating to determine the risk of fetal chromosome aneuploidy. When the Z-score >3 or <-3 of any chromosome showed that the fetal with high risk of fetal chromosome aneuploidy. At the same time， the clean data were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC\\045512.2)， and the low-quality reads (mapped length less than 60) were filtered. Then through calculating the number of mapped SARS-CoV-2 reads to determine whether there was SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【17】Statistical analysis\n\n【18】Paired t-test was used to compare the amount of data that generated by different methods， and Pearson correlation coefficient was used for data correlation analysis. All statistical analysis were performed using R3.5.1.\n\n【19】Result\n\n【20】Detection of fetal chromosome aneuploidy\n\n【21】NIPT analysis and SARS-CoV-2 analysis were performed for all samples. Negative NIPT result was confirmed in all cases in the negative group and simulated SARS-CoV-2 group， while positive NIPT result was confirmed in all cases in the trisomy positive group， including 4 cases for trisomy 21， 4 cases for trisomy 18， 1 case for trisomy 13， and 1 case for trisomy 21 combined with trisomy 13.20 clinical routine NIPT samples from Changsha Hospital for Maternal and Child Health Care were selected randomly to evaluate the sequencing data of the new technology of NIPT-SARS-CoV-2. The results demonstrated that there was no significant difference of total sequencing data in the two technologies， which indicated the new NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 could accurately analyze fetal chromosome aneuploidy without increasing the sequencing data.\n\n【22】Detection of SARS-CoV-2\n\nSARS-CoV-2reads were detected in all cases in simulated SARS-CoV-2 group， with average 35 reads in 1400 copies group (range4-64)， average 337 reads in 14，000 copies group (range 252-464)， and average 2，759 reads in 140，000 copies group (range 2392-3220). None SARS-CoV-2 reads were detected in the negative group and trisomy positive group. Combined the NIPT result indicated that the new NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 could detect SARS-CoV-2 in the three concentration gradients without affecting the fetal chromosome aneuploidy analysis. The fewest number of SARS-CoV-2 reads only 4 in 1，400 copies group， suggesting that this method could accurately detect SARS-CoV-2 with a viral load of 1，400 copies/ml. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 reads in 1 million total reads was calculated to analysis the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 reads proportion and detected viral reads. The correlation coefficient|删除段之间换行|between the two up to 0.977， suggesting that the new NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 has potential for quantitative or semi-quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19， asymptomatic infections have beenreported in manystudies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-13\\]</u>.Asymptomatic infections mean who have no clinical symptoms and abnormalities in images but with positive detection of SARS-CoV-2. A study focuses on asymptomatic ratio showed that the incidence of asymptomatic was estimated to be 30.8% among 565 Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Asymptomatic infection is also existed in pregnant women. Another study investigated 675 pregnant women for delivery in three New York City hospitals found that 10.4% were positive for SARS-CoV-2and up to 78.6% of them were asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Some studies indicated that the viral load in asymptomatic infections is similar to COVID-19 patients， and the infectivity between the two has no significant difference， which signified asymptomatic infections may accelerate the spread of COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15-18\\]</u>. But it has great challenge to identify and control asymptomatic infections due to no obvious clinical manifestations with them. Screening high-risk populations is a possible effective measure to find asymptomatic. The new method NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 reported in this study can accurately analyze fetal chromosome aneuploidy and SARS-CoV-2 without increasing the sequencing data， and the virus load could low to 1，400 copies/ml.So that through this method SARS-CoV-2 can be detected for all pregnant women when they carry out the routine prenatal testing. In addition， detecting viral nucleic acid by peripheral blood can avoid the drawbacks of collecting nasopharyngeal swabs collection， such as the discomfort and psychological pressure to pregnant women， the exposure of healthcare staff. In this way， pregnant women with asymptomatic infection can be early recognized and controlled， which will be conducive to get the optimal management and treatment for them. The collection of upper respiratory specimens， especially nasopharyngeal swabs， has been widely used to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19. However， in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs， some researches show that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid can also be detected in other sites including sputum， feces， blood and other types of samples 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，20\\]</u>. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid can be detected in the blood of COVID-19 patients 2~3 days after onset， and there is even report shown that the same one COVID-19 patient with positive SARS-CoV-2 detection in blood samples， but no SARS-CoV-2 is detected in throat swabs， which suggesting that it is feasible and necessary to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by blood samples. Once virus infection occurs， although it takes a period of time to form toxemia or show obvious clinical symptoms， the nucleic acid fragments of virus degraded in the process of metabolism will enter the peripheral blood at an early stage. Therefore， the new technology NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 has the advantage of screening pregnant women carrying the virus in the early stage of infection. The diagnosis of COVID-19 mainly depends on clinical manifestations， epidemic history， CT imaging screening and etiology detection， among which etiology detection is the most accurate diagnosis scheme 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Etiology detection includes viral nucleic acid detection， antibody and antigen detection， and the viral gene detection by quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) is a priority test recommended by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. RT-qPCR can detect viral nucleic acids efficiently and rapidly， with high sensitivity and high specificity. But this method only can detect some specific viral gene regions， such|删除段之间换行|as Open reading frame 1 ab (ORFlab)， Nucleocapsid protein (N) and Envelope (E)， which may cause false negative due to the virus variant. Unlike RT-qPCR， the NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 can detect whole genome of the virus with low-depth sequencing， which can identify virus variants and trace the cryptic origins of the virus in theory. A recently study reported an intrauterine infection case of COVID-19， the puerperal and the newborn were infected with the same virus，but a variant of the virus occurred in the newborn a few days later 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The researchers thought it might be caused by the contact with the external environment after birth， and the virus mutated surprisingly fast， which also suggested the importance of virus gene sequencing. In conclusion， the technology of NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 reported in this study can achieve the purpose of NIPT detection and SARS-CoV-2detection for pregnant women in the progress of routine prenatal testing by drawing only one tube of peripheral blood. In this way， SARS-CoV-2 screening can be performed for pregnant women， so that asymptomatic infections can be early recognized and controlled， which ensure the optimal management and treatment for pregnant women and newborns. In addition， it has the potential for monitoring virus variant and tracking virus transmission， which will be helpful for control the spread of this serious epidemic.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It was first reported in 1921 by Geber 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 22-years old， nulliparous Caucasian female was referred to Gynaecology outpatient clinic by her dermatologist with a history of recurrent cyclical rash. She gave a history of pustular rash all over the body， more on the arms with different stages of healing indicating fresh and new rashes. Rashes usually flared up at the time of her periods and settled in between periods for last 2 years. She also felt generally unwell with nausea and hot flushes just before her periods. On examination， she had non-follicular papular and pustular rash all over her arms，legs and back . Patient felt this had affected her confidence as she cannot wear any dress without sleeves due to scarring from the rashes.\n\n【7】She was initially diagnosed with pityriasis lichenoids chronica by her dermatologist based on the clinical appearance and biopsy. However， treatment with oral Tetracycline and topical steroids lacked efficacy in complete clearance of the rash and subsequent biopsy did not show features of pityriasis lichenoides and immunofluorescence was negative. The diagnosis of autoimmune progesterone dermatitis was confirmed when she had very significant localised urticarial reactions to intradermal progesterone Injection.\n\n【8】She attained menarche at the age of 13 andhad normal regular periods with cycle of 30 days. She had used tablet Microgynon in the past for couple of years and stopped 2 years ago as her partner has vasectomised. She had long term history of eczema since age of 3 years and had taken regular antihistamines.\n\nAfter long discussion with the patient about conservative treatment options such as oral contraceptives (Microgynon was well tolerated in the past) and GnRH analogues (Injection Zoladex，|删除段之间换行|3.6mg monthly) to allow suppression of ovulation. Patient agreed for Zoladex injection with Tibolone (2.5mg daily) as add back therapy for 6 months and then start Tab Microgynon， an oral contraceptive pill. She was reviewed after 3 months and 5 months following Zoladex injection which showed significant improvement in her skin lesions with no new flare ups.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis (AIPD) is an auto-allergic(autoimmune) reaction to endogenous progesterone during luteal phase of menstrual cycle， with less than 100 cases reported in literature通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The first reported case of urticarial rashes related to periods was described by Geber in 1921通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and the challenges in the diagnosis and management of the condition were discussed in early literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Shelley et el in 1964 described a cyclical dermatitis flare with a pruritic vesicular eruption in a 27-vear old woman related to premenstrual progesterone exposure.

The age of onset is variable， with the youngest reported case occurring at menarche 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> but the initial manifestation of the disease may be as late as 48 years ofage. The exact pathogenesis of autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，5\\]</u>. It is hypothesized that some women could have developed sensitization to previous use of exogenous progesterone resulting to an immune reaction with subsequent exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Others have explained that it may be possible that some woman can only tolerate low level of progesterone and hence develop an inflammatory reaction in response to increased progesterone that peaks at the luteal phase of the period. Another theory for progesterone sensitization is due to cross- reaction of various hormones especially in patients who never had exogenous progesterone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5\\]</u>.\n\nAIPD is a diagnosis of exclusion. So， we must first exclude other chronic dermatological conditions that can also have a peri-menstrual flare such as acne vulgaris， dermatitis herpetiformis， erythema multiforme， lichen planus， lupus erythematosus and psoriasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，6\\]</u>.

The hallmarks for diagnosis of AIPD are premenstrual flare， appearance of rash with intramuscular progesterone， and prevention of rash with inhibition of ovulation(Warin， 2001) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Our patient was confirmed with diagnosis when she had very significant localised urticarial reactions to intradermal progesterone.\n\n【13】Definite treatment of AIPD is suppression of ovulation by inhibition of the secretion of endogenous progesterone during luteal phase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3-9\\]</u>.

The disease mostly affects middle-aged men and women in their late pregnancy. We report a case of a 45-year-old woman diagnosed with transient osteoporosis of the hip (TOH)， without any commonly reported risk factors such as pregnancy， chronic diseases， or traumatic events. Administration of a single infusion of a last generation of bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid)， along with limited weight bearing and daily exercises， resulted in a complete clinical recovery within 3 months. Neither anti-inflammatory medication nor physiotherapy was needed. We conclude that intravenous bisphosphonates may be effective in TOH and potentially useful in the rare occurrence of this condition in non-pregnant women.\n\n【2】Keywords： Biphosphonates； Transient osteoporosis of the hip\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Transient osteoporosis of the hip (TOH) is a rare idiopathic disorder characterized by acute onset of hip pain leading to walking impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Initial characterization of the disease dates back to 1959， first observed in pregnant women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. While the disease is more common in middle-aged men， in women TOH has been mostly commonly diagnosed during thelast trimester of pregnancy or immediately following delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The most common location is the hip joint， although occasional cases have also been described in the knee， the ankle or the foot bones. Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) currently represents the most sensitive test for the initial diagnosis and for monitoring the evolution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，4\\]</u>. The disease is generally self-limited， with complete disappearance of symptoms occurring typically within 6-18 months after onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. The etiology of the disease is currently largely unknown， but hypotheses suggest a potential role of pelvic nerve compression during late pregnancy or neuro-inflammatory mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>.\n\nA middle aged (45-years-old) non-pregnant female patient complained of gradually increasing mild to very severe pain in the left inguinal area over a period of 3 weeks， which led to nearly complete walking disability at her first consultation. No particular injury or other event preceded the development of her symptoms. An articular ultrasound and a hip radiography were normal，as were extensive blood tests. In particular， no inflammation， no auto-antibodies and no abnormality in phospho-calcic metabolism were found. A MRI scan was performed because of the severity of her symptoms， which revealed increased signal intensity on T2 and STIR weighted images， and a decreased intensity on T1 weighted images. The diffuse bone marrow oedema pattern signal in the absence of osteonecrosis or fractures was strongly suggestive of transient osteoporosis of the hip . A single iv infusion of zoledronic acid (5 mg) was administered， associated with weight discharge of her left lower limb and daily exercises to prevent muscle wasting. Neither non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs， nor physiotherapy were required during follow-up. Relatively rapid clinical recovery was observed， with a complete disappearance of the hip pain at three months and a complete resuming of her usual physical activities. At six months， the patient fully recovered the normal range of motion of the left hip. In agreement with the clinical examination， a control MRI confirmed the disappearance of any pathological signs in the left hip . The patient|删除段之间换行|remained symptom-free at a 12 months’ follow-up visit， with a normal control MRI .\n\n【6】Discussion TOH in non-pregnant women\n\n【7】TOH is a self-limiting disease with usually a complete recovery after 6-18 months， according to the available literature. Although the overall prognosis is good in vast majority of the cases， it has a considerable impact on patient’s quality oflife during the in itial phase due to functional disability and fear of fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，8，9\\]</u>. The majority of TOH cases have been described in healthy middle-aged (40-70y.o.) men. The remaining case reports (approximately one-third of the cases) are reported in pregnant women， in their third trimester of pregnancy or immediately after delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，6，10\\]</u>. Only two cases of TOH in non-pregnant women have been described in the literature， to the best of our knowledge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. Here we report an additional case of TOH diagnosis in a 45-year old non-pregnant woman， supporting the observation that while this disease is undoubtedly associated with late pregnancy and postpartum in women， it is not limited to pregnancies. It is thus important to consider the possibility of incident TOH in non-pregnant women， when confronted with acute hip symptoms，even though the incidence of TOH appears to be low in non-pregnant women. The differential diagnosis of TOH are the early stages of a vascular necrosis of the hip (AVN)， which is also characterized by bone marrow edema， and primary and metastatic malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，13\\]</u>， which are however usually associated with other concomitant symptoms and distinct risk factors.\n\nThe etiology of TOH development remains unclear so far. Neuro-inflammatory mechanisms along with type IV hyperlipidemia have been postulated to play a role 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In the case of late pregnancy and|删除段之间换行|postpartum， the disease might be related to the compression of the obturator and pelvic nerves and vessels. Parathyroid hormone-related protein has also been proposed to play a role in TOH development during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. With respect to TOH in non-pregnant women， further elucidation of possible diseases mechanisms， unrelated to pregnancy， are warranted.\n\n【9】Successful treatment with singleinjection bisphosphonates as compared to repetitive injections\n\n【10】Proposed management of TOH comprises weight discharge， non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and calcitonin. During the last decade intravenous bisphosphonate treatment have been applied and suggested to be successful in a number of reports (通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> and references therein). Authors have proposed multiple injections of 300mg of clodronate during 10 days， along with calcium and vitamin D supplements， followed by second course of 5 injections of clodronate， with considerable clinical improvement within two months. Dr. Seok and colleagues report one suiccessful use of intravenous zoledronate通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Hereby we report rapid improvement of symptoms (pain relief and ability to walk) and complete recovery within three months following single intravenous infusion of zoledronate (5 mg)， without requiring other analgesic therapies or NSAIDs.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】A treatment with a single-dose of the iv bisphosphonates(zoledronate) appeared to be effective in reducing the time to recovery in this unusual case of TOH in a non-pregnant female， in association with conservative measures.

He was labeled as a case of“chronic sinusitis”despite he had no nasal symptoms and advised treatment accordingly. He remained symptomatic and presented to general physician， who， after examining him， advised a CT SCAN chest . With that CT scan， he presented in Pulmonology OPD. On examination he had audible stridor with no other significant findings. CT scan， that he was carrying， showed mass at level of upper trachea with marked luminal narrowing. He was admitted and scheduled for bronchoscopy that showed \"multi-lobulated mass in the upper segment of trachea\"， that revealed\"Adenoid cystic carcinoma of trachea\" on histopathology . Thoracic surgeon was consulted and advised to get CT scan neck and chest with reconstruction images that was done  and was referred for surgery. Resection of involved segment was done and rest was reconstructed. He remained on surgical floor for 5 days and discharged with advised to get radiotherapy.\n\n【5】He visited our OPD， breathing comfortably without any stridor. He was under radiotherapy currently and resumed his duties.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Adenoid Cystic/adenoid cystic carcinoma or cylindroma of the trachea is a relatively rare occurrence. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is second to squamous cell carcinoma among tracheal malignant neoplasms， and has a nature of long clinical course and less malignant potential. ACC of trachea is reported. In 5 decade without any gender predilection； bur， interestingly， our patient was in his thirties at the time of diagnosis； and smoking has nothing to do with incidence of ACC通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Surprisingly， many patients with ACC of trachea remained on anti-asthma treatment for long time same as in presenting case and had frequent visits to emergency department due to poorly controlled symptoms.\n\nCommonest site for metastasis of ACC is pulmonary system but even after metastasis it remained asymptomatic for long time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. To detect loco-regional involvement， extension and either resectable or not， CT-scan is a favorite tool. Bronchoscopy has its own importance， as it allows tissue sampling for proper diagnosis and to assess local features/extension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Surgery with or without radiotherapy is the available treatment options. Primary resection of tumor through surgery followed by end to end anastomosis is the best treatment. ACCs are incompletely resected usually due to narrow tissue plans. The complete resection rates ranged from 42% to 57%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. For cases， who remained unresectable due to its local invasion， and when surgical clearance is not satisfactory radiotherapy is recommended. ACC of trachea recur locally is common and occurs at an average of 51 months after|删除段之间换行|the primary treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The overall survival rate is 52% to 91% (5years) and 29% to 76% (10 years) respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Similar case was also reported by our team previously in a young lady without any risk factors， who had favorable outcome like this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a rare confounder to diagnosis andtreatment of diseases that usually presents with wheezing， and most common is bronchial asthma. Proper clinical history， clinical examination and investigations guide to early diagnosis and prompt treatment for ACC of trachea. CT scan neck and chest with reconstruction images and bronchoscopic local examination is the key to diagnosis.

VOS2 is that induced by saline-based fluids and has no such clear marker.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】The TURP syndrome is well known in urology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. It complicates 1.5% glycine absorption during the TURP procedure. It presents as vascular shock previously reported as hyponatraemic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. However， it is commonly mistaken for haemorrhagic or septicaemic shock and is treated with volume expansion causing lethal outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The first two case reports reported here represent this practice.\n\n【7】Recently， however， the role of VOS in the patho-etiology of the TURP syndrome has been recognized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. It clearly demonstrates that further volume expansion is absolutely contra-indicated in the treatment of the TURP syndrome， for which Hypertonic Sodium Therapy (HST) is the correct life-saving treatment. The remaining two cases reported here represent this practice.\n\n【8】Case 1\n\nAt the end of a 2 hours TURP procedure on a fit 78 years old man suffered severe hypotension shock and cardiac arrest on the operating table. He was resuscitated with 4 units of blood， one litre of Haemaccel， one litre of Hartmann and 200 ml of sodium Bicarbonate after which his serum sodium concentration was 124 mmol/L. He remained shocked， in coma， respiratory distressed requiring Dopamine infusion and assisted ventilation. He was thought to remain hypovolaemic and volume expansion policy aiming at elevating his Central Venous Pressure (CVP) continued； further infusion of 5 units of blood and 10 litres of colloids and crystalloids were given in 24 hours and failed to elevate his pressures. Although fluid restriction and peritoneal dialysis were started|删除段之间换行|on the 5h post operative day he became progressively oedematous wit bilateral plural effusions. Progressive cerebral， renal， cardiac， respiratory and gastro-intestinal failures led to his death on the 21h post operative day. He had sterile cultures of urine and blood. Post mortem examination was not done.\n\n【10】Case 2\n\n【11】Three hours after TURP with resection of 127 grams of tissue on a previously fit 74 year old man under spinal anaesthetic， he became unconscious， shocked and suffered respiratory arrest. His blood pressure dropped to 79/40 mm hg， pulse to 36 beats per minute and CVP to -1 cm saline. His serum sodium concentration dropped to 103 mmol/L. He was given 6 units of blood and 3 litres of colloids and crystalloids after which his serum sodium was raised to 123 mmol/L. He was intubated，ventilated and received supportive measures on ICU. He underwent further infusions of 21 units of blood， 3 litres of colloids and 4 litres of crystalloids but his pressures remain persistentlylow. Fourteen hours later severe catheter bleeding required open packing of the prostatic cavity. Gastric and wound capillary bleeding occurred despite normal coagulation screen and repeated platelet infusions. It became clear he was fluid overloaded. Although fluid restriction and peritoneal dialysis were started on the 2nd day progressive cerebral， cardiovascular， respiratory， renal and hepato-biliary failure occurred and culminated in his death on the 6h postoperative day. His serum sodium and osmolality prior to death were 130 and 321 respectively. Increased cardiac enzymes activity suggested myocardial infarction \\[Creatinine kinase 16 (<8U/L)， Hydroxybuterate dehydrogenase 557 (<120U/L) and Aspartate Transferase (<40 U/L).\n\n【12】Post-mortem examination showed enlarged congested and oedematous lung，liver， heart and kidneys. All tissues were laden with water， 1，500 ml of blood stained fluid was found in the plural spaces and 3litres in the peritoneal cavity. The myocardium was oedematous but there was neither infarction nor coronary artery disease.\n\n【13】Case 3\n\n【14】Six hours after endoscopic bladder tumour resection on 67year old fit man， he became comatosed and hypotensive (BP70/50 mm hg). He was thought to be in hypovolaemic shock and was transfused with 5 units of blood and 3 litres of colloids and crystalloids. His blood pressure remained below 90 mm hg and CVP at-5 cm saline. He developed generalized convulsive fit， 12 hour later a neurological assessment confirmed coma with fixed dilated pupils and quadriplegia. He was thought to have suffered cerebro-vascular accident. At this time bladder perforation was diagnosed and his serum sodium dropped to 110 mmol/L. He underwent a rapid infusion of 500 ml 5% NeCl， followed by laparotomy and over sewing of bladder perforation. Three litres of fluid was drained from his peritoneal cavity. Postoperatively he passed 4.5 litres of urine and recovered fully from coma and quadriplegia. He was discharged home on the 14h postoperative day.\n\n【15】Case 4\n\nDuring TURP on a fit 74 year old man， his BP raise temporarily from 129/89 mm hg to 160/100 mm hg. He later became hypotensive and developed brochospasm and pulmonary crepitations. Frusimide， atropine and aminophylline were given. The patient had undergone an infusion of 2 units of blood， one litre of Haemaccel and one litre|删除段之间换行|of Hartmann. On recovery from the anaesthetics， he suffered a generalised convulsive fit and went into coma. Pulmonary oedema， bronchospasm and cardiac dysrythmia re-occurred. He remained socked， hypothermic， comatosed and annuric. His BP was 80/50mm hg CVP ranging between -9 cm and -4 cm saline； giving an impression of hypovolaemic shock. However， a volume of 5.5 litres of the irrigating fluid 1.5% Glycine was calculated missing from the returned fluid； remaining inside the patient’s body. His immediate postoperative serum sodium concentration was 101 mmol/L and serum osmolality was 270 mOsm/L. The osmolality further dropped to 217 mOsm/L after 4 hours. Volumetric overload shock was realised and a fluid restriction policy was adopted in spite of the low BP and CVP. He was given a rapid infusion of 1.8% sodium chloride and 400ml of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate， given in 200 ml increments and each was followed by estimation of serum electrolytes and osmolality. Over the next 24 hours he lost 5.1 litres of urine and 1.7 litres of gastric aspirate leading to his full recovery. He was discharged home on the6h postoperative day.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Here we report 4 cases of the TURP syndrome of which two died and two survived. The two who died are representative of most previous reports on the TURP syndrome. Their conditions were mistaken for one of the recognised shocks such as haemorrhagic or septicaemic shock and were treated with further volume expansion. Such practice should be made obsolete.\n\n【19】The remaining two case reports are representative of the modern school of practice. In this school volume expansion is absolutely contraindicated. The role of VOS in the patho-etiology of the TURP syndrome has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>.\n\n【20】It advances Hypertonic Sodium Therapy (HST) of 5% sodium chloride or 8.4% sodium bicarbonate as the treatment of choice which is life saving.\n\n【21】The advantage of recognising VOS is not only saving the lives of the TURP syndrome identified as VOS1 patients but also paves the way for recognising the condition induced by sodium-based fluids identified as VOS2. The latter has no clear serum marker such as hyponatraemia seen in VOS1 and is more difficult to identify. VOS2presents with the Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).\n\n【22】删除6:<u>1\\.

Short bowel syndrome can result in the inability to maintain nutrition， hydration， electrolytes， and micronutrients. Significant micronutrient deficiencies can occur，which can exacerbate without regular monitoring and repletion. Malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies in short bowel syndrome are well documented yet published case studies are lacking. We describe a woman in her 50s with a history of Crohn’s disease， complicated by multiple surgeries that resulted in short bowel syndrome. She presented with abdominal pain， poor oral intake and tolerance， weight loss， nausea， vomiting， dehydration， and excessive ileostomy output with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of micronutrient deficiencies. She was found to have the following deficiencies： thiamine， pyridoxine， 25-hydroxyvitamin D， and borderline deficiencies in copper and zinc， which were all aggressively repleted. Her output continued to be high， necessitating the use of octreotide. At her six-month follow-up visit， her ileostomy output had stabilized， and all monitored micronutrient levels were within reference range； 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was within reference range at eighteen months. This case highlights the need for management of ileostomy output and active micronutrient surveillance and repletion in patients with short bowel syndrome and high oultput.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) is characterized by less than 200 cm of small bowel remaining in the body and affects approximately 10，000 to 20，000 people in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. SBS commonly occurs when the small intestine is surgically resected due to Crohn’s Disease (CD)， irradiation， malignancy， or superior mesenteric arterythrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. SBS can result in the inability to maintain nutrition， hydration， electrolytes， and micronutrients. Malnutrition due to malabsorption of macronutrients and micronutrients can become a predominant clinical picture， in addition to loss of bowel motility， transit time， and gastroduodenal emptying. Patients at greatest nutritional risk are those with a duodenostomy or jejunoileal anastomosis with less than 35 cm of residual small intestine， jejunocolic or ileocolic anastomosis with less than 60 cm of residual small intestine， or an end jejunostomy with less than 115 cm of residual small intestine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. SBS can result in the malabsorption of protein， carbohydrate， electrolytes and micronutrients indluding fat-soluble vitamins， iron， folate， cyanocobalamin， selenium， zinc， and copper 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2，4，5\\]</u>.

At admission， her folate and cyanocobalamin levels were within normallimits； zinc and copper levels were borderline deficient . We also obtained thiamine(plasma)，pyridoxine， 25-hydroxyvitamin D，and ceruloplasmin levels at admission due to suspected micronutrient deficiency. On hospital day 2， her total ileostomy output increased from 900 mL to 1，625 mL. The patient was initiated on Parenteral Nutrition (PN) that provided 29.1 kcal/kg/day，1.5g/kg/dayprotein， 4.71g/kg/day glucose based on an adjusted body weight of 58.4 kg. Her PN formulation contained standard MVI and trace elements plus twice per week 500mL 20% lipid emulsion. On hospital day 4， while awaiting thiamine and pyridoxine results， she was initiated empirically on thiamine100 mg/day for five doses. Her ileostomy output continued to be greater than 1，000 mL per day through hospital day 7； her PN was modified to include higher doses of the following micronutrients for3 days： Selenium 150 mg， zinc sulfate 20 mg， thiamine 100 mg， and pyridoxine 50 mg.\n\n【9】On hospital day 10， the volume of PN was increased from 2L to 3L， glucose was decreased from 275 g to 230 g， and protein was increased from 88 g to 120 g， and 20% lipids were increased from twice to thrice per week.

Octreotide was also initiated at 300 mcg due to continued increased ileostomy output； on hospital day 11， her ileostomy output transiently improved. On hospital days 14 and 15， octreotide was further increased from 300 mcg to 450 mcg and finally to 600mcg due to no appreciable change in ileostomy output. With some stabilization in ileostomy output by hospital day 17， she was anticipating discharge， but suddenly had minimal output with fevers， nausea， multiple episodes of vomiting， abdominal tenderness and pain， lactic acid of 1.3， leukocytosis with an increase in white blood cells from 10.8 to 16.5， and distended bowel with localized peritonitis in the periumbilical area.

On hospital day 18， she was taken to the operating room for presumed small bowel obstruction， exploratory laparotomy， lysis of adhesions， and small bowel resection that resulted in 13 cm remaining bowel. Her pathology report revealed chronic， active inflammation， hemorrhage， and serositis， and was negative for dysplasia or granulomas. She was continued on PN and later given a trial of sips of fluid.

Multiple pharmaceutical regimens given to her failed， including octreotide dosed up to 600 mcg/day. She was likely to be micronutrient deficient because of 60 cm remaining of functional bowel. Significant deficiencies in thiamine， pyridoxine， and 25-hydroxyvitamin D， as well as borderline deficiencies of copper and zinc， were found. The micronutrients found to be deficient were aggressively replaced. At six-month follow-up， thiamine， pyridoxine， copper， and zinc levels were within reference range； 25-hydroxyvitamin D was in reference range when checked at eighteen months.\n\n【21】Micronutrient dosages for parenteral nutrition maintenance have been well-researched with concise recommendations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>； however published data on repletion recommendations for SBS-associated micronutrient deficiencies is very limited . Our repletion doses were based on published data in SBS as well as general non-SBS repletion recommendations.\n\nIn addition， there are limited consensus guidelines of monitoring frequency for micronutrient deficiency or toxicity levels in SBS； however， the recommendations for home PN are more prolific. Based on a 2006 review of 42 centers in Europe providing home PN， it was found that stable patients were monitored every 1 to 6 months with52% of centers reporting monitoring intervals of 2 to 3 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. During monitoring visits， 19% of centers analyzed trace elements and14% evaluated vitamins A， E， D， B-12， and folic acid. The remaining centers (67%) monitored micronutrient status but not at every visit-or only in case of concern. Overall， there was an agreement by the centers that “monitoring of trace elements and vitamin status should only be carried out more rarely or when clinical symptoms indicated that patients had a deficiency.\" The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) has also stated that all patients on home PN should have micronutrient status evaluated at six-month|删除段之间换行|intervals (Grade C) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The ESPEN released guidelines on chronic intestinal failure in adults with the following recommendations：\n\n【23】Evaluate signs， symptoms， and biochemical indexes of vitamin and trace element deficiency or toxicity regularly at clinical review. (Evidence： Very low； Strength of recommendation： Weak)\n\n【24】凸 Monitor and adjust vitamin and trace element does in PN as needed (Evidence： Very low； Strength of recommendation： Weak)；\n\n【25】Measure baseline serum vitamin concentrations at onset of PN then at least once per year (Evidence： Very low； Strength of recommendation： Strong)；\n\n【26】Measure baseline serum trace element concentrations at onset of PN then at least once per year (Evidence： Very low； Strength of recommendation： Weak) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Additionally， Australasian Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition suggests monitoring for magnesium and iron of home PN patients at each visit， and other trace elements and vitamins every 6to 12 months删除4:<u> 15</u>.\n\n【28】In summary， our patient with a history of severe uncontrolled CD was found to have significant SBS-associated micronutrient deficiencies including critically low values. Patients with SBS have a large degree of variability in levels， types of resections， and disease severity. Because of these distinct variables， individualized care is necessary to determine frequency and follow-up of screening for micronutrient deficiencies. This case demonstrates the importance of active micronutrient monitoring with aggressive replacement treatment in patients with SBS and excessively high ileostomy output.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

FunctionalpNETs are known to secrete insulin， gastrin， glucagon， vasoactive intestinal peptide or somatostatin. A small number of case reports have also identified pNETs secreting ACTH in patients who presented with clinical features of Cushing’s syndrome. We report the case of a patient treated for a known pNET believed to be non-functioning， who went on to develop features ofectopic ACTH syndrome(EAS).\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 59-year-old man with type 2 diabetes was diagnosed with a pNET following investigation for unintentional weight loss. The patient was then admitted to hospital for a subtotal pancreatectomy and splenectomy in addition to medical treatment with the Somatostatin analogue“Lanreotide\".He had a complicated post-operative course and remained in hospital for an extended period due to recurrent infections， reduced mobility， confusion and hallucinations of unknown cause. During this time his blood pressure and blood glucose were persistently difficult to control.\n\n【8】Six months after surgery the patient was referred to hospital due to a routine blood test which had found neutrophilia with a White Cell Count (WBCs) of over 46.0 ×10/L. He complained of persistent fatigue and reduced mobility but had no other symptoms. A bone marrow biopsy indicated reactive changes but showed no evidence of a primary hematological diagnosis. He was also found to be hyperglycemic， hypokalemic with a plasma potassium of 3.1 mmol/L and his liver function was deranged with ALP 153 IU/L and ALT 233 IU/L. A recurrence of the pNET with evidence of lymphatic spread was found on CT.\n\n【9】Two months later the patient was readmitted with shortness of breath， cough and leg weakness. His mobility had significantly deteriorated， and he now required a wheel chair to mobilize. He was confused and complaining of hallucinations.\n\n【10】Table 1： The patient's blood results.\n\n| Laboratory  | Results  | Reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Haemoglobin  | 136 g/L  | 130-180 g/L  |\n| Platelets  | 337x109L  | 150-400x10%L  |\n| White cells  | 19.0x109L  | 4-11x10°L  |\n| Neutrophils  | 17.64x10  | 2.0-7.5x10  |\n| Lymphocytes  | 0.67x109L  | 1.0-4.5x10/L  |\n| Monocytes  | 0.61x10%L  | 0.3-0.9x109L  |\n| Sodium  | 142 mmol/L  | 135-145 mmol/L  |\n| Potassium  | 3.4 mmol/L  | 3.5-5.3mmol/L  |\n| Calcium (corr.)  | 2.47 mmol/L  | 2.2-2.6mmol/L  |\n| Urea  | 4.0 mmol/L  | 2.5-6.7 mmo/L  |\n| ALP  | 323U/L  | 30-130 U/L  |\n| ALT  | 48 U/L  | 5-35 IU/L  |\n| Glucose  | 11.0mmol/L  | 3.5-5.5 mmo/L  |\n\n【12】ALP： Alkaline Phosphatase； ALT： Alkaline Transaminase\n\n【13】He also had increased oxygen requirement， thin skin， and reduced tone and sensation in the lower limbs. The patient had persistent hypokalemia. His blood glucose， WBCs and LFTs also remained elevated . A whole spine MRI ruled out cord compression but showed degenerative changes and multiple fractures of the vertebrae. A chest CT revealed consolidation and a new sternal fracture.\n\n【14】Despite improvement of the chest infection after treatment， the patient continued to suffer with confusion， fatigue， poor mobility as well as intractable hypertension， hyperglycaemia and hypokalemia. Tests were， therefore， carried out to screen for Cushing's syndrome. These results are indicative of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome.\n\n【15】A pituitary MRI was carried out， which did not find evidence of a pituitarylesion. Inferior petrosal sampling would normally be carried out to definitely exclude a pituitary source of ACTH； however the patient was not eligible for this invasive procedure due to his poor functional status. As a result of the known neuroendocrine tumour， the very high ACTHleveland the persistent hypokalemia， a diagnosis of ectopic ACTH Cushing's syndrome secondary to metastatic pNET was made. The patient was started on Metyrapone， a reversible inhibitor of 11β-hydroxylase which blocks cortisol biosynthesis， with dexamethasone on a block and replace regimen. He also received a prophylactic treatment for Pneumocystis jiroveci in addition to prophylactic anti-coagulation.\n\n【16】Since initiation of treatment， the patient’s quality of life has greatly improved. He has had a significant reduction in the frequency of infections， his blood sugars have improved， his blood pressure is now well controlled on Spironolactone and he has regained some mobility. However， a recent CT has found marked enlargement of the pNET recurrence and he is now being considered for peptide receptor radionucleotide therapy.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】We report a rare case of EAS in a patient with a complicated post operative course after the resection ofa pNET.\n\n【19】Most of the cases reported to date of this condition were for patients presenting with Cushing syndrome， where the tumour was discovered during investigations for the source ofthe ACTH.\n\n【20】Table 2： Screening for Cushing's syndrome.\n\n| Laboratory  | Results  | Reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mid night Cortisol  | 1583 nmol/L  | fnormal <50 nmol/L)  |\n| ACTH  | 534 pg/mL  | normal range 10-60 pg/mL  |\n| Overnight dexamethasone suppression test： Cortisol level  | 1314 nmol/L  | normal <50 nmol/L  |\n\n【22】We therefore wish to highlight the importance of including cortisol and ACTH levels in screening for neuroendocrine activity in pancreatic tumors. This patient had many of the complications related to Cushing's syndrome and an earlier screening and diagnosis could have helped ameliorating his symptoms and halting disease progression.\n\n【23】Diagnosis of functional pNETs is typically guided by clinical symptoms and confirmed by elevated plasma levels of the hormone通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. An ACTH-secreting pNET will lead to clinical presentation with Cushing’s syndrome.

Cross-sectional imaging studies and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy can be used to localize tumors which may be an ectopic source of ACTH hypersecretion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Central and ectopic sources of ACTH may also be differentiated by plasma ACTH level(typically very high in ectopic disease)， high-dose dexamethasone suppression test (basal cortisol suppression more likely in pituitary-dependent disease) and serum potassium (hypokalemia nearly always seen in ectopic disease).\n\n【26】Management of functioning pNETs requires treatment for both the hormone-excess state and the tumour itself.

The study reports the case of a 54-year-old male who presented with post Trans Arterial Chemoembolization(TACE) residual/recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). He had a history of hepatitis C for10 years. Dynamic MRI showed two distinct lesions， one located in caudate lobe and another in segment VII. The lesion in caudate lobe showed delayed and prolonged peripheral enhancement with non-enhancing central component. The segment VII lesion showed faint arterial phase enhancement which persisted in portal venous phase without any washout. Patient was scheduled forliver transplantation. On histopathologythe larger lesion showed spindle cells arranged in sheets having pleomorphic vesicular nuclei. Immunohistochemistry was positive for vimentin， AFP， Ck8/18， Pan Ck， desmin and myogenin and thus a diagnosis of sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma was established. Microscopy of segment VII lesion was consistent with high grade dysplastic nodule. This case describes the imaging features of sarcomatoid HCC and highlights the importance of histopathology and immunohistochemistry in final diagnosis.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Sarcomatoid Hepatocellular Carcinoma is a rare neoplasm of liver comprising carcinomatous and sarcomatous components. It commonly develops in patients with background of alcoholic cirrhosis， chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus infection. A close relationship has been seen between the sarcomatous appearance in HCC and anticancer therapies. It has very poor prognosis due to high grade on histology and a higher rate of recurrence or metastasis. Therefore identifying this type is important for patient management and treatment planning. Herein， we present a case of sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma. A detailed review of CT and MRI imaging characteristics with histopathological and immunohistochemical features are also discussed.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\nA 54-year-old male patient was referred to our hospital for liver transplantation. He had a past medical history of hepatitis C which was detected in 2009 for which he was not taking any treatment. He subsequently developed abdominal distension and was found to have Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) related cirrhosis in 2017. He was kept on diuretics and antiviral therapy. He developed sustained virological response to HCV in 2019. He was doing well six months back when he developed loss of weight and weakness for which he was evaluated and found to have Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) in segment V in outside hospital (Images not available). Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP)level was elevated measuring删除4:<u> 5368</u>. According to the records he underwent Trans Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) in august 2019 after which he developed sub capsular hematoma. He was managed conservatively for hematoma. A repeat CT was done there one month later which revealed background parenchymal cirrhotic changes， splenomegaly， splenic hilar and paraesophageal collaterals. A complex solid cystic lesion measuring 9.4 cm x 5.8 cm x 6.7 cm was noted in caudate lobe showing some soft tissue enhancement in delayed phases . Possibility of residual or recurrent tumor was suggested and he was referred to our hospital. On admission his general physical examination was normal. Vital parameters were unremarkable. Laboratory tests revealed elevated AFP (846； normal<10 ng/ml) and Protein induced by vitamin K absence-II PIVKA II (744.17； normal 17.36 mAU/ml to 50mAU/ml). Biochemical indices of liver functions revealed mildly elevated SGOT (105； normal 15IU/L to 37 IU/L)， ALP (196； normal 50 IU/L to 136 IU/L) and GGT (162； normal5 IU/L to 85 IU/L). Coagulation profile was deranged with elevated Prothrombin time (16； normal 11 sec to 13 sec) and fibrinogen (471； normal 200 mg/dl to 400 mg/dl). Antibody panel revealed non-reactive status for|删除段之间换行|HbsAg， positive for HBcAb， reactive for HCV Ab and negative for HDV IgG. HBV DNA titer was <20 and titer for HCV RNA was <15. Rest of the biochemical investigations， ECG and echocardiography were unremarkable.Arepeat contrast MRI was done with hepatobiliary specific contrast agent. The scan revealed background cirrhotic changes. Previously mentioned complex solid cystic lesion in caudate lobe appeared hetero-intense on T1/T2 with progressive delayed phase enhancement of peripheral solid component. Central\n\n【6】Segment VIl nodule is alsa seen on liver surface (arrow).\n\npart didn't enhance suggesting central necrosis . There was minimal increase in the size oflesion. Besides this one more lesions was seen in segment VII appearing isointense on T1/T2 with faint arterial phase enhancement which persisted in portal venous phase without any washout . The former lesion was characterized as residual HCC and later was characterized as dysplastic nodule Liver transplantation was performed subsequently. The resected explant displayed firm consistency with brownish nodular external surface and irregular margins suggesting cirrhotic changes. A large variegated creamish yellow tumor mass showing hemorrhagic necrosis was noted in caudate lobe . Another sub|删除段之间换行|centimetric sized nodule was seen in segment VII in subcapsular location . On microscopy the large tumor showed a neoplasm with spindle cells arranged in sheets having pleomorphic vesicular nuclei， prominent nucleoli and moderate cytoplasm. On IHC the neoplastic spindle cells were positive for vimentin， AFP， Ck8/18 and focally positive for Pan Ck and arginase. Desmin and myogenin were variably positive. Tumor cells were negative for S100， EMA， CD34 and HepPar删除4-1:<u>-1</u>. Overall the findings were suggestive for sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma.

The patient was followed up and a repeat MRI was done one month after transplantation. No lesion was identified in transplanted liver and surgical bed . At present， the patient is in good condition.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) with spindle cell component has been referred to as sarcomatoid carcinoma. The pathogenesis of sarcomatoid carcinoma is not clear. There is a continuous debate on whether it is derived from the transition of an ordinary HCC to a sarcomatous morphology or it is a synchronous HCC and hepatic sarcoma. Presence of transitional features from HCC to spindle cell component and vimentin expression in the spindle cell on histopathology favors the dedifferentiation theory of sarcomatoid transformation in HCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.\n\n【10】It mainly occurs in elderly patients. The cumulative incidence is 0.79%. The risk factors include cirrhosis， chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C and are same like non sarcomatoid HCC通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. KojiroM et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> have shown close relationship between the sarcomatous appearance in HCC and anticancer therapies. The developmentofthe sarcomatous appearance is presumed to be caused by the phenotypic change of HCC cells caused by anticancer therapy accelerating the proliferation of the sarcomatous cells existing in the original tumor as one of the histological components. The evidences suggesting this relationship are however poor in literature and there have been studies demonstrating its occurrence without any prior exposure to anti-cancer therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Our patient also had history of hepatitis C infection for 10 years. He subsequenty developed cirrhosis and HCC. Development of sarcomatoid HCC after TACE is in keeping with the relationship of TACE and sarcomatoid HCC described in literature.\n\n【12】Sarcomatoid HCC is known to exhibit central necrosis and hemorrhage owing to its rapid growth and poorly differentiated morphology. Imaging findings on CT and MRI are in keeping with this growth pattern. The typical imaging features on CT include peripheral ring-like enhancement and central non-enhancing region. The peripheral enhancing tissue represents viable neoplastic tissue with fibrous stroma， and internal unenhanced region correspond to coagulation necrosis and hemorrhage. The peripheral enhancing tissue shows delayed and prolonged enhancement which correlates with extensive interstitial space allowing slow diffusion of contrast between vascular and interstitial spaces. The type of enhancement pattern is also seen in hemangiomas， metastases and in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma however， the delayed peripheral enhancement is more commonly seen in sarcomatoid HCC通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>.\n\nOn MRI，sarcomatoid carcinomashowslobulated OI irregular shapes. It shares few imaging features with intrahepatic|删除段之间换行|cholangiocarcinoma like lobulated shape， rim-like arterial-phase hyper enhancement， large necrotic area (if the lesion is large)， delayed central enhancement (if the lesion is small)， biliary dilatation and intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastases， although targetoid appearance or capsular retraction are less common than in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【14】In present case the large lesion in caudate lobe showed typical imaging features of sarcomatoid HCC. Progressive peripheral enhancement was seen on both CT and MRI images. Central part didn't enhance suggesting central necrosis.\n\n【15】On histopathologythesarcomatoid HCC demonstrates transitional features between sarcomatoid tumor and ordinary HCC. Immunohistochemical study for vimentin， cytokeratin， alpha fetoprotein and epithelial membrane antigen are helpful in the pathological diagnosis. It has been seen that sarcomatoid lesions are positive for both cytokeratin and vimentin which are the markers of epithelial and mesenchymal tissue respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The tumor in the present case was diffusely positive for vimentin and alpha-fetoprotein， which is consistent with sarcomatoid HCC.\n\n【16】Similar histopathological findings were seen in present case.On microscopy the large tumor showed a neoplasm with spindle cell arranged in sheets having pleomorphic vesicular nuclei， prominent nucleoli and moderate cytoplasm. On IHC the neoplastic spindle cells were positive for vimentin， AFP， Ck8/18， Pan Ck， desmin and myogenin.\n\n【17】It has very poor prognosis. There are higher chances of lymph nodeand distant metastasis. There are high chances ofearlyrecurrence even after curative therapy， such as RFA， surgical resection， or liver transplantation. Study done by Liao et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> estimated that 1， 3， and 5 vear recurrence-free survival rates of sarcomatoid HCC were50.0%，15.0%， and 5.0% as compared to 83.0%， 44.3%， and 22.6% for the non-sarcomatoid group. The clinical importance of this diagnosis lies in the fact that it is an independent predictor of recurrence after curative treatment and all-cause mortality.\n\n【18】There was no recurrence seen in follow up MR imaging done after1month of post transplantation. He is advised another follow up scan after 6 months.\n\n【19】In conclusion，sarcomatoid HCC is an aggressive tumor with high recurrence rate and tendency for rapid growth. It should be suspected whenever there is history of TACE therapy. The typical imaging features should prompt the diagnosis although the final word is from tissue sampling and intensive immunohistochemical analysis.\n\n【20】Learning Points\n\n【21】1\\. The risk factors for sarcomatoid HCC include cirrhosis， chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C and are same like non sarcomatoid HCC.\n\n【22】2 The typical imaging features on CT include delayed and prolonged peripheral ring-like enhancement and central non-enhancing region.\n\n【23】3\\.

Laboratory evaluation showed severe anemia with hemoglobin level of 2.4 g/dL， leukocytosis with total white count of 36.2 and platelet of 328.Others laboratory results included： serum total bilirubin 59 mg/dL with predominant indirect bilirubin， serum Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) 1761 U/L， serum sodium 135 mmol/L with creatinine level of 52 mmol/L. Blood and urine culture were negative. Urgent peripheral blood film was suggestive of AIHA and active hemolysis. Direct Coombs test was strongly positive (4+) for IgG and C3d suggestive of warm AIHA. Indirect Coombs test was positive as well but antibody identification revealed non-specific autoantibody IgG. Other autoimmune and virology screening were negative. The diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was confirmed on the basis of high mycoplasma antibody titer of 1：1280. Further testing showed red cell phenotype was O positive， R1R1， Jka-b+and ss. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin， intravenous methylprednisolone and oral azithromycin. 2 pints of least incompatible packed cell were transfused during her stay without transfusion reaction. She was discharged after 5 days with oral prednisolone and subsequent follow up reviewed normal blood count .\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Subclinical hemolysis is common in Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection but severe warm AIHA requiring intensive treatment and blood transfusion is rare. Our patient demonstrated a severe form of hemolytic anemia with presentation hemoglobin level of 2.4 g/dl and it showed warm AIHA suggestive by Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT)， requiring high dose steroid with IV immunoglobulin and blood transfusion. Although such cases were rare，there have been several case reports reporting similar presentation删除4-1:<u>1-3</u>.\n\n【8】AIHA was defined as positive Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT-positive) after exclusion of alternatives 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.

Secondary warm AIHA such as lymphoproliferative disorder， autoimmune disease especially systemic lupus erythematosus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>， infections mostly viral or drug induced. The autoantibodies in warm AIHA are the IgG in most cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Complement fragments， most often C3d combined with IgG happened in 50% of warm AIHA. In other word， warm AIHA can be happened in the presence of DAT positive for IgG with or without C3d. C3d may be found in both cold and warm AIHA， hence testing for cold agglutinin in patient is needed.\n\nSerology such aIsS Mycoplasma pneumoniae enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for immunoglobulin M and immunoglobin G antibodies are currently widely used. The most convincing evidence of ongoing infection is a significant increase in IgG or an IgG seroconversion in paired sera， collected 3 to 4 weeks part 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In this case， our laboratory used particle agglunation test (Serodia|删除段之间换行|Myco II). Serodia Myco II is an in vitro diagnostic test for detection of antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae which is manufactured using artificial gelatins particles sensitized with cell membrane component of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mac strain). In a study conducted in Malaysia， it concluded that titer of 1：>80 was the most suitable cut-of titer for diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumonia in Malaysians. Based on her clinical and radiological evidence suggestive of pneumonia， together with high titer ofantibody detected，Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was diagnosed. While other causes of hemolysis had been excluded， it is strongly suggestive warm AIHA in this patient was associated with Mycoplasma infection.\n\n【12】Corticosteroid with or without immunoglobulin remain the mainstay oftreatment ofwarm AIHA. Our case report demonstrated that severe warm AIHA associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae can also be treated with systemic corticosteroid and IV immunoglobulin. Nevertheless， she should be seen periodically to monitor for relapse and reemergence of new symptoms that suggest other underlying causes ofwarm AIHA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Severe warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia can be associated with Mycoplasma infection which responded well with antibiotics， steroid， immunoglobulin and blood transfusion if indicated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Coronary spasm has been observed on angiograms， but exceptionally in left main artery. Vasospastic pathomechanism was repeatedly proven by intracoronary spasm inducement with ergonovine or acetylcholine injection. Although品focal (single or multifocal) coronary artery occlusion occur mostly at rest and is related with ST elevation (variant or Prinzmetal angina)， there are scarce reports of exertional related vasospastic angina leading to ST depression.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】The 43-year old Caucasian male was admitted to the Emergency Department due to one hour lasting chest pain. The routine treadmill stress test performed prior to the admission to hospital revealed significant ST segment depression in leads II， III， aVF， V3-V6 after 3，5 minutes of exercise， without clinical symptoms characteristic for ischemia. The patient had a history of several episodes of chest pain on exertion in the last several months before the stress test； he was not diagnosed and treated for any chronic disease. Smoking was the only known cardiovascular risk factor. The exercise tolerance was sustainably optimal. The same day the ECG positive stress test was performed； patient was hospitalized in the cardiology department. The early coronary angiography revealed two proximal， borderline stenoses in the Left Main Coronary Artery (LMCA) and in Right Coronary Artery (RCA). After the Heart-Team consultation repeated evaluation of coronary arteries was advocated， with additional Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS). The latter angiography showed no narrowing's in the epicardial vessels. Subsequent IVUS of LMCA，proximal Left Anterior Descending (LAD) and Circumflex (LCX) arteries showed absence of stenoses， with no evidence of atherosclerosis . Three weeks after coronary angiography the nuclear stress test was performed according to Bruce protocol. Exercise test was terminated due to increasing chest pain in the sixth minute on exertion (achieved heart rate of 130 per min - 70% of maximal expected heart rate， workload of 4.6 METs). There was significant ST segment depression in leads V5 and V6. Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) performed one hour later showed extensive and severe perfusion deterioration within the apex， anterior and inferior walls of the left ventricle. The rest MPI revealed substantial perfusion improvement of radiotracer uptake in the regions with decreased accumulation. Furthermore， estimated region of improved perfusion comprised approximately 40%of the left ventricle's myocardium. Considering all of these results， the vasospastic mechanism has been suggested， as the reason of described coronaryarterial narrowing's observed in first angiography and not confirmed in further diagnostics. Therefore the treatment has been modified (beta blocker was withdrawn； calcium channel blocker treatment was initiated). Another MPI was suggested by interventional cardiologists a month after treatment modification. Two sublingual doses of 0.4 mg Nitroglycerine (NTG) each were administered within one hour before the next treadmill stress test. Two day stress/rest MPI with9mTc-sestamibi was performed， showing only slight reversible region of perfusion abnormalities in the basal segments of the lateral wall. The enormous discrepancy was observed between two subsequent images of the MPI . No coronary intervention was performed in this subject between these two MPI examinations. Following the treatment modification patient has been released from exertion related symptoms.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\nOccasional chest pain， whether typical anginal or accidental precordial， substernal pain/discomfort， bring about some difficulties in diagnostic process， especially in patients with low and intermediate probability of coronary artery disease. Less frequent manifestation of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) that has to be taken into consideration in such cases is vasospastic angina. Coronary spasm has been observed on angiograms， but exceptionally in left main artery. Vasospastic pathomechanism was repeatedly proven by intracoronary spasm inducement with ergonovine or acetylcholine|删除段之间换行|injection. Although focal (single or multifocal) coronary artery occlusion occur mostly at rest and is related with ST elevation (variant or Prinzmetal angina)， there are scarce reports of exertional related vasospastic angina leading to ST depression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. This phenomenon could be induced by diffused spasm in distal coronaries. According to the 2019 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of chronic coronary syndromes the presence of anginal symptoms and abnormal non-invasive tests in patients with non-obstructed epicardial vessels should lead to the suspicion of a non-obstructive cause of ischemia but because diagnostic pathways to investigate microcirculatory or|删除段之间换行|vasospastic coronary disorders are often not implemented， a final diagnosis supported by objective evidence is seldom reached. The possibility of a microcirculatory dysfunction should be considered in patients with angina， abnormal non-invasive functional tests， and coronary vessels that are either normal or have mild stenosis considered as functionally non-significant on invasive or non-invasive coronary angiography. Additionally development of ECG changes and angina in response to acetylcholine testing but without severe epicardial vasoconstriction is suggestive of microvascular spasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. AHA/ACC/ASE/CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR Guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasizes， that in the presence of non-obstructive coronary artery disease reduced myocardial blood flow reserve may indicate coronary microvascular dysfunction，especially among women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-7\\]</u>. In this particular case the vasospasm appeared in arteries at the catheter tip， which can indicate the mechanical irritation coexisting with hypersensitivity of vessels as potential explanation. Nonetheless it does not expound the extended and severe myocardial perfusion abnormalities in stress MPI with pronounced improvement on the rest images. The ST depression in stress MPI with reversible perfusion defects would rather suggest unoccluded， spastic variant. The repeated stress/rest MPI with mild perfusion abnormalities after treatment was changed (continuous calcium channel blocker treatment， sublingual NTG before stress test) seems to confirm the vasospastic mechanism but do not exclude microvascular dysfunction. Studies with Acetylcholine (ACH) testing revealed， that in stable CAD with normal or near normal arteries in coronary angiography， intracoronary ACH injection provoked vasospasm in 62% (the ACOVAstudy). In 55% of them the ACH test results (ECG changes， symptoms) were interpreted as microvascular spasm. The abnormal ACH tests are directly related with endothelial dysfunction. In response to ACH uptake by endothelial receptor， nitric oxide and other compounds are released， stimulating vasodilation. Instead， when endothelial cells remain dysfunctional， ACH can induce coronary vasospasm via receptors within smooth|删除段之间换行|muscles. Vasospastic variant of angina pectoris， if not demonstrated by ST segment elevation， as well as microvascular angina still cause clinical difficulties in diagnostics and management of our patients. The studies show， that in many cases of CAD there is more than one underlying pathomechanism responsible for anginal manifestation. Yet advanced diagnostic instruments may lead us to appropriate conclusion so we can introduce accurate treatment and relieve patients from inconvenient symptoms.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The presence of an abnormal Hb was confirmed in both instances by hemoglobin chain studies. Structural studies determined the two Hb variants to be heterozygous mutation of Hb D-Los Angeles (HBB：p. Glu121Gln) for mother and homozygous mutation of Hb G-Coushatta (HBB：p.Glu23Ala) for father. The fate of the baby was followed until the first year and an abnormal silent Hemoglobin (Hb) was also detected on her sample. In this report a very rare Hb variant homozygous Hb G Coushatta and also a heterozygous baby of the couple with Hb G Coushatta and HbD is presented.\n\n【2】Keywords： Hb G-Coushatta； Hb D-Los Angeles； Abnormal hemoglobin\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】A new hemoglobin variant，Hemoglobin (Hb) G Coushatta also known as G-Saskatoon (HBB：p. Glu23Ala)， has been firstly found in three generations of a family from the Alabama Coushatta Indian tribe in east Texas in 1960s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and was subsequently identified in several populations throughout the world in Canadian Indians， Chinese， Algerian and Japans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-5\\]</u>. As it is found as prevalent variant in Native Americans and Chinese，haplotype studies were done and they suggested a multiple origin for this variant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. In Turkey it was firstly described in a Turkish male and then in a Turkish family in 1980s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>.\n\n【5】It is abnormal hemoglobin of beta variant with a delta-like substitution. Instead of a negative charged amino acid glutamate， neutral alanine at the 22nd position of beta chains in Hb G Coushatta forms a slow migrating band in alkaline electrophoresis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. So it is sometimes hard to discriminate the band with HbD or HbS.\n\n【6】Hb D Punjab， also known as Hb D Los Angeles， is an abnormal type of Hb with an amino acid substitution of glutamate to glutamine at codon 121 of the beta-globin gene (HBB：p. Glu121Gln) and it is one of the most commonly observed abnormal hemoglobin worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Its incidence has been reported throughout Turkey with an overall frequency of0.2%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. We reported before Hb D as the second most common hemoglobinopathy after beta-thalassemia trait in Kayseriprovince， a city in Middle Anatolia， in Turkey， accounting for 0.36% ofthe total， in premarital screening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【7】The both hemoglobin variants are clinically silent or with slightly microcytosis. We here report a family； a rare case with homozygous hemoglobin G-Coushatta coupled with Hb D-Los Angeles who has an eight week pregnancy.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\nA 25 year old male and 18 year old female admitted to Department of Biochemistry in Kayseri Education and Research Hospital for premarital screening. Firstly for separation and quantitation of hemoglobin types， gel electrophoresis (Interlab G26) was used. Full blood counts and red blood cell indices in this family were determined by the Sysmex XN-9000 semi-automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex Co.，Kobe，Japan). Two abnormal bands between HbA， and HbA。on HbS/D zone|删除段之间换行|were detected at the same gel. The abnormal hemoglobin bands were then confirmed with both cation exchange ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) (Thermo Scientifics Dionex Ultimate 3000， UHPLC) using Recipe Chemicals (Instruments GmbH， Germany) and capillary electrophoresis (Sebia Hydrasys， France). In molecular analysis the coding exon deoxyribonucleic acid from the patients were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. For deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing and fragment sizing molecular analysis ABI 3500/Life Technologies Series Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used.\n\n【10】Results\n\nThe hematological and Hb data are summarized in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. In gel electrophoresis we detected the abnormal hemoglobins of mother and father migrating as Hb S/Hb D. In capillary electrophoresis the mother had an abnormal Hb at a level of 39.9% of total Hb， in|删除段之间换行|Zone 6 suggesting Hb D； and the father had an unknown Hb variant at a level of 97.7 % of total Hb， between Zone 5 and Zone 6， an unknown hemoglobin variant . In UHPLC the unknown hemoglobin of mother eluted just slightly after Hb A， with a retention time of 6.64 minutes， while the unknown Hb of father eluted in a large peak containing Hb A， with a retention time of 6.01 minutes.\n\n【12】As both male and female had abnormal hemoglobins during premarital screening the couple was invited to the meeting for information before giving birth. In the meeting it was learned that the women was pregnant for 8 weeks. The couple was suggested for molecular analysis and genetic counseling.\n\n【13】Molecular analysis of father had homozygosity at codon 68 of the beta-globin gene， an amino acid substitution of glutamate to alanine， called as Hb G-Coushatta (beta22(B4)Glu-->Ala，HBB：c.68 A>C). And the mother revealed a heterozygosity at codon 364of the beta-globin gene， an amino acid substitution of glutamate to glutamine  called as Hb D-Los Angeles (beta 121(GH4) Glu-->Gln，HBB：c.364G>C) .\n\n【14】All parameters of red cell indices and hemoglobin composition of baby was in reference range after birth. So， the fate of the baby was followed until the first year and an abnormal silent Hemoglobin (Hb) was also detected on her sample. Her molecular analysis revealed heterozygous Hb G Coushatta .\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Hemoglobinopathies are commonly present in populations of all Mediterranean countries， and are also common in Turkey. A review of abnormal hemoglobins reported from Turkey indicated that in addition to beta-thalassemia major， sickle cell anemia and sickle cell/B-thalassemia are major causes of public health problems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. HbD and Hb O-Arab are prevalent abnormal hemoglobins in Turkey with a silent clinical state after Hb S. Although Hb G Coushatta is thought to be rare in some regions it is reported to be more than expected通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The major problem of the reported incidence of this Hb may be disability of separation of these Hemoglobin’s with Hb D and Hb Q Iran because of the same electrophoretic mobility in alkaline pH通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. However， in this study our suspicion for the hemoglobin of father because of the homozygosity in alkaline gel electrophoresis， we could have been able to discriminate the abnormal hemoglobin with other hemoglobins by both UHPLC and capillary electrophoresis.\n\n【17】Presumed mutation for Hb G Coushatta is GAA->GCA at codon68 in beta chain and is hematologically normal in heterozygote state.\n\n【18】Table 1： Red cell indices and hemoglobin composition for the members of studied family.\n\n| Complete Blood Count  | Father  | Mother  | Baby  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sex  | Male  | Female  | Female  |\n| Age (years)  | 25  | 18  | 1  |\n| HbA0(%)  | 0  | 56.2  | 55.4  |\n| HbA2(%)  | 3.20  | 1.90  | 3.1  |\n| HbF(%)  | 0.00  | 0.00  | 2.7  |\n| HbD (%)  | 0.00  | 39.90  | 一  |\n| HbG-Coushatta(%)  | 97.70  | 0.00  | 38.8  |\n| White Blood Cells (x10/ul)  | 6.72  | 7.54  | 9.15  |\n| Red Blood Cells (x106/ul)  | 6.32  | 5.02  | 5.02  |\n| Hemoglobin (g/dl)  | 17.4  | 13.4  | 12.4  |\n| HCT(%)  | 52.4  | 40.1  | 36.7  |\n| MCV(fl)  | 82.9  | 79.9  | 73.1  |\n| MCH (pg)  | 27.6  | 26.7  | 24.7  |\n| MCHC (g/dl)  | 33.3  | 33.5  | 33.8  |\n| PLT(x10/ul)  | 282  | 316  | 394  |\n| RDW-SD (fl)  | 40.5  | 39.8  | 8.7  |\n| RDW-CV(%)  | 13.8  | 14.4  | 13.6  |\n\n【20】For that reason it is usually found during HbAlc measurement by chromatographic techniques which are dissociated with blood glucose levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>. Here we report a rare form of homozygous Hb G Coushatta at a level of 97.7% of total Hb.\n\n【21】In Hb G Coushatta there is a neutral alanine instead of negative charged amino acid glutamate at the 23rd position of beta chains. Usually such a replacement would affect the distribution of charges and disturb the functional value of molecule. However 23position of beta chain is not connected with heme or other globin chains. So it is expected that there is no unusual effect due to such a replacement. Our patient with homozygous Hb G Coushatta was also clinically silent， consistent with these expectations. Although we cannot predict for sure， we presume that the homozygous form of Hb G Coushatta， or a combination of this variant with Hb D would not be associated with severe conditions. However， exact determination of these variants by molecular technique is important.\n\n【22】Both Hb G Coushatta and Hb D migrate slowly and it is hard to discriminate them with each other and Hb S by alkaline gel electrophoresis. In HPLC and capillary electrophoresis we found a slight sliding in Hb G Coushatta according to Hb D which is hard to discriminate visually. Nevertheless， some variants cannot be separated and are eventually identified by DNA sequencing if they reveal unexplained hematological anomalies. This is an important issue for an analytical decision to be taken when abnormal hemoglobins are suspected. In this case， the homozygous Hb G Coushatta and heterozygous Hb D were found by chance during a premarital screening program. Even though they both did not reveal any hematological or clinical sign， the women was pregnant and not to miss any heterozygous state of these combinations with a probability of hematologic disease molecular analysis was applied. As there was no literature finding of heterozygote state of Hb G Coushatta and Hb D， the baby was investigated for possible hemoglobinopathy\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\nDifferent hemoglobinopathies are frequently reported from|删除段之间换行|Turkey， but this is the first report of a very rare homozygous Hb G Coushatta mutation married with a heterozygous Hb D and got a baby with heterozygous Hb G Coushatta， those all have no clinical sign. The members of the family those will born in future may have different abnormal hemoglobins with heterozygous state. Because of the same electrophoretic mobility in alkaline pH，Hb G Coushatta can be missed and not separated with other hemoglobins like Hb D and Hb S. But it is possible to discriminate them by UHPLC and capillary electrophoresis with a careful examination.\n\n【25】Consent\n\n【26】Written informed consent was obtained from the family for publication of this report and any accompanying images.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The estimated overall incidence of drug-induced pancreatitis ranges from between 0.1% and 2% based on individual case reports and case control studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. This report describes a 53 year old female patient with recent diagnosis of stage 2 breast cancer who developed acute pancreatitis on day 4 after combination chemotherapy of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】This is a 53 year old female patient recently diagnosis of right sided breast cancer which was found to be triple positive，PR，ER and HER2/neu positive. She underwent multiple lumpectomies with inadequate clearing of margins. Patient received her first dose of adjuvant chemotherapy with IV cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin 4 days prior to admission along with pegfilgrastim. The patient reports later that evening， she started to experience severe mid epigastric pain，radiating to her back that was partially relieved by leaning forward but not much with Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID). Her symptoms were associated with nausea，loss of appetite， and one episode of vomiting. She denied any fevers， change in bowel movements， dysuria， vaginal bleeding or recent trauma. Her past medical history includes ovarian cysts. She has no previous history of pancreatitis. She is a nonsmoker and drinks alcohol occasionally and denies any history of illicit drug use. Family history was noncontributory. Patient was not on any medications except for lorazepam， reglan and zofran that were prescribed to her on the day of chemotherapy.\n\n【7】On physical examination， stable vital signs， anicteric sclera and moist mucous membranes. Heart andlung examination were unremarkable. Abdomen examination was positive for significant epigastric tenderness， normoactive bowel sound， no palpable organomegalyand negative Murphy's sign.\n\nInitial laboratory investigation showed white blood count of 30.8 with 80% neutrophils. Basic metabolic panel was within normal range except for mild hyponatremia 131 mmol/L (normal 136to 145 mmol/L). Serum amylase and lipase were markedly elevated 914 U/L (Normal 23 to 85 U/L) and 710 U/L (0 to 160 U/L) respectively. Liver function tests and coagulation profile were within normal range. Lipid profle was also within normal range. Imaging of the abdomen including an abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of biliary ductal dilation and no cholelithiasis， wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. CT scan with IV and oral contrast showed no peripancreatic inflammatory changes or focal lesions. Patient was admitted to medical floors with the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis presumed to be secondary to cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin as other|删除段之间换行|causes were excluded and based on clinical presentation and elevated enzymes. Upon admission patient was managed conservatively with intravenous fluid，pain medication and NPO initially. During her stay， routine labs including and serum amylase and lipase were monitored closely. Her symptoms resolved completely with improvement of biochemical parameters. Discussed with patient regarding possible drug induced pancreatitis and communicated with her oncologist. Patient was counseled not to have any more Cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin chemo regimen. White blood counts along with amylase and lipase were trending down.

Cyclophosphamide also possesses potent immunosuppressive activity and it’s considered as a pro-drug that must be metabolized to active metabolites in the liver. Some of the adverse reaction well described in literature includes endocrine side effects such as altered hormone level (increased gonadotropin secretion)， amenorrhea and gastrointestinal side effects such as abdominal pain， anorexia， diarrhea， mucositis， nausea， vomiting(dose-related)，and stomatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Drug induced acute pancreatitis account for 1.4% to 2% and chemotherapy-induced pancreatitis is rarer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. The physiologic mechanism of chemotherapy-induced pancreatitis may be by direct damage by antibody formation and interaction with pancreatic cells. This response can activate T cells in vitro and results in tissue damage that is probably T lymphocyte Mediated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Another potential mechanism includes direct tissue injury by the medication.\n\n【12】Cyclophosphamide aand doxorubicineeitherr alonLee in combination， is quite rare that even the drug labels registered with the FDA， do not indicate acute pancreatitis as one of the possible complications and there are very few cases reported this side effect通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In our patient， acute pancreatitis developed on the 4h day of the administration of chemotherapy， and resolved within a few days after discontinuation of the drugs. She didn’t have any other risk factors for pancreatitis as she doesn’t drink alcohol and laboratory finding including serum triglyceride， calcium levels， bilirubin， sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were all within normal levels. Liver ultrasound was negative for gallstones or biliary sludge， Also the patient didn't receive dexamethasone during her first chemotherapy cycle.\n\n【13】Review of other case reports such as Ben Kridis et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>presented a 20 year old patient that developed acute pancreatitis the second day after administration of doxorubicin and ifosfamide. She developed two episodes one was with metoclopramide and methylprednisolone and the second chemotherapy course was received without and both were complicated by pancreatitis. Ben Kridis et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> mentioned 4\n\n【14】pediatric cases ofacute pancreatitis after administration of ifosfamide. He also described Doxorubicin as a rarely blamed medication for acute pancreatitis as per available data.\n\n【15】Another case report by Vincent et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> described the development of acute pancreatitis in a patient with breast cancer three days after receiving the chemotherapy regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. Another episode after re-challenging the patient with cyclophosphamide， and again a few weeks later with a derivative of doxorubicin， epirubicin， acute pancreatitis recurred on each occasion. Reflecting that cyclophosphamide was probably the inflecting agent in both episodes.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】Due to the increasing number of case reports， chemotherapy-induced pancreatitis should remain as a differential diagnosis in patients receiving chemotherapy regimens and presenting with symptoms and signs typical of acute pancreatitis. Physicians can report new suspected adverse drug reactions directly to the FDA via its Med Watch program，by contacting the manufacturer of the drug， and by publishing case reports. Also post-marketing surveillance and adverse drug reporting should be done get a wide angle vision on the true incidence of chemotherapy induced pancreatitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Among the patients， convexal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (cSAH) caused by CVST is relatively rare， accounting for only 0.5% to 0.8%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> of all CVST patients. Convexal SAH is a subtype ofnon-aneurysmal SAH， characterized by the limitation of bleeding in one or several convex cortical sulci. The pathogenesis of CVST is challenging to find but valuable for subsequent treatment. We report a patient with CVST caused by primary Sjogren Syndrome (pSS) and secondary “Non-criteria\" antiphospholipid syndrome， whose first manifestation was cSAH. After diagnosis， the patient was given long-term anticoagulation to treat CVST and \"Non-criteria\" antiphospholipid syndrome. The case aims to discuss the diagnosis， pathogenesis， personalized treatment plan， and the risk of recurrence.\n\n【2】Keywords： Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis； Sjogren syndrome； Convexsal subarachnoid hemorrhage\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Cerebral venous thrombosis accounts for 0.5% of all types of strokes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， with the estimated annual incidence of 3 to 4 cases per 100，000 populations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The common cause of CVST included infections， dehydration， pregnancy， trauma， and inherited hematopathy， and the autoimmune disease， but more than 12.5% of cases remained idiopathic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The Sjogren syndrome-associated CVST or \"Non-criteria\" antiphospholipid syndrome-associated CVST is scarcely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It reminds us of the importance of seeking etiologies for afterward therapeutic anticoagulation. It also illustrates that the CVST as the cause of cSAH can be vital for subsequent anticoagulant therapy， which contradicts in SAH of other reasons.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 32-year-old Asian female presented with sudden headache with extremities spasms and loss of consciousness lasting for hours with nausea， vomiting， blurred vision， diplopia， aconuresis， and left extremities numbness for more than eleven days. The patient denied dysphasia， dysphagia， photophobia， gait disturbance， or sensory loss. Mild xerostomia and saprodontia were also spotted via inquiry of history. The patient had diabetes but denied hypertension or hyperlipidemia， thrombophilia， malignancy， or dehydration. She also denied usage of oral contraceptives or repetitive miscarriages. On admission， her vital signs， including blood pressure， heart rates， and respiration were stable with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15/15. Central nervous examination revealed left extremities weakness with muscle strength grade 4 and mild ataxia on the left side. The cranial nerves， sensory functions， and deep reflexes were normal. Meningeal irritation signs and nuchal rigidity were negative.\n\n【7】Emergency Brain Non-Enhanced CT (NECT) showed linear hyperdensity in bilateral frontal lobe sulcus on day删除4:<u> 2</u>. Subsequent NECT on day 8 revealed subcortical edema and parenchymal hemorrhage ，and Computed tomographyangiography detected no aneurysm or stenosis while computed tomography venography showed filling defect in the Superior Sagittal Sinus (SSS) and right Transverse Sinus (TS) . DSA was made to rule out aneurysmal SAH and show the filling defect in SSS and right TS .\n\n【8】Blood tests showed elevated estimated sedimentary rate of 100mm/h， elevated C reactive protein was 16.99 mg/L， autoantibody spectrumsrevealed anti-SS-relateddantigen1A (anti-Ro/SSA) antibodies (+++)， anti-SS antigen B (anti-SSB) antibodies (+++)， anti-Ro-52 (+++)， Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA) 1：3200 and anti-nuclear RNP/Sm antibodies 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>. The antiphospholipid antibody test showed positive IgA Anti-B2 glycoprotein I antibody (IgA anti-B2GPI antibody) (54.11 RU/ml) positive， negative IgG and IgM anti-B2GPI， and negative anti-cardiolipin. A 12 weeks reexamination also revealed positive IgA anti-B2GPI (40.77RU/ml) with the negative IgG and IgM. The Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA)， complement，\n\n【9】Immunoglobulin G and Immunoglobulin G subtype 4， rheumatoid factor were normal. The prothrombin time， partial thromboplastin time， and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were within normal ranges (11.4s， 29.6s， and 0.99s). The activity of Protein S is 39.9%(63.50% to 149.00%)，antithrombin III is 63% (83.00% to 128%)，and coagulation factor VIII is 191% (50% to 150%). The thyroid functions test showed the thyroxine 36.88 nmol/L (69.97 to 152.52)， Thyroid Stimulating Hormone 18.08 ulu/mL(3.28to 6.47)，anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody were strongly positive， which indicated the Hashimoto thyroiditis. The liver function tests with liver and gall ultrasounds and urinalysis were normal. The labial gland biopsy showed that the cluster of lymphocytes infiltrates the small salivary gland tissue of 4 mm； Leukocyte Common Antigen(LCA)highlights the lymphocyte (+)， which confirmed a diagnosis of Sjogren syndrome .\n\n【10】The Low Weight Molecular Heparin (LMWH) was given after CVST was diagnosed and warfarin was delivered four days later， bridging with LMWH. The clinician adjusted warfarin dose to maintain the INR of the patient at 2 to 3 in 12 weeks.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】In CVST-associated SAH， nearly 90% of patients first appeared as sudden and thunderclap-like headaches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> that mimic the aneurysmal SAH. The seizure occurs in 35% to 90% in 2 case series通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u> as in our case. The mechanism may be the stimulation of the convexalcerebral cortex caused by cSAH，leadingtoabnormal cortical discharge. The NECT is often the preliminary examination for SAH for its high sensitivity but a suboptimal tool for CVST. A case series revealed that the circumscribed convexity SAH localized to the dural sinuses or cortical veins with sparing of the basal cisterns might point to an underlying CVST 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Compared with NECT， the MRI is more sensitive as 21/22 was spotted by the MRI FLAIR sequence in that case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Digital subtraction Angiography is the gold standard\"for the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， which can show the filling defect and blood drainage of the venous and venous sinus. Different hypothesizes can explain the causal relationship between CVST and SAH. Sinus thrombosis increases the adjacent venous pressure， causing the dilation and rupture of cortical veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The occlusion of the cerebral vein also leads to venous infarction presenting as elevated intracranial pressure， brain tissue edema， and brain infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The patients also complained of xerostomia and xerophthalmia with anti-Ro/SSA and anti-Ro/SSB positive. The labial glands biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Sjogren syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Among SS patients， the common neurological manifestations are peripheral neuropathy， autonomic nervous disease， and myelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. To our knowledge， there are only five Sjogren syndrome-induced CVST reported in literature， and none of them had secondary cSAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. A theory declared that the pSS-induced autoimmune vasculitis could cause the vasculitic necrosis and leads to thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>，may explain the etiology.\n\n【14】The IgA anti-B2GPI antibody-positive on day 1 and 12 weeks with the sinus thrombosis， the \"non-criteria antiphospholipid syndrome “or\" Seronegative Antiphospholipid Syndrome (SNAPS)\"can be diagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. Though the Sapporo standard did not include IgA anti-B2GPI antibody 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， it certainly strongly correlates with thrombosis events and recurrent miscarriage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. IgA aB2GPI positivity alone is associated with an increased risk of arteriovenous and venous thrombosis and all types of thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Since the concurrence of Sjogren syndrome and APS and the presence of anti-SSA， we believed the APS has occurred secondary to Sjogren syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Secondary APS can occur in nearly 3%to 4% pSS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Antiphospholipid syndrome can lead to thrombosis by affecting coagulation via increasing the expression of thromboxane A2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u> and tissue factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> or activating the classic complement pathway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. The APL-associated CVST presenting as cSAH has been reported in many cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. In conclusion， The SS that caused the seronegative APS that leads to the CVST and associated cSAH.\n\nThe thyroid dysfunction is the third most relevant risk factor for CVST 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， and Grave's disease-associated CVST presenting as cSAH cases were reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. Hashimoto thyroiditis-related CVST was also revealed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. In general， hyperthyroidism leads to thrombosis due to the endothelial activation and decreased fibrinolytic activity通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>， while the hypothyroidism is often associated with bleeding. Hashimoto thyroiditis relates with APS antibodies present， but no relations of HT with a thrombotic manifestation of APS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Our patients presented anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase|删除段之间换行|antibody， thus， multiple factors may contribute to the onset of CVST， and including SS associated vasculitis，hypercoagulable state stemmed from anti-phospholipid1antibody y syndrome andautoimmune thyroiditis.\n\n【17】The therapeutic dose of LMWH was given after CVST was confirmed by MR專 and DSA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> to prevent the potential of elevated intracranial pressure and herniation. Warfarin was given for long-term anticoagulation in the heparin bridging phase to prevent CVST recurrence， affecting 2 to 7 percent of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. As for this case， since the CVST was caused by Sjogren-induced APS，the priority is the APS treatment which mainly includes antiplatelet， anticoagulant， and immunomodulatory therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. The standard treatment for APS in the first venous thrombotic event is an oral vitamin K antagonist with a target INR of 2 to 3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Due to the high recurrence rate of thrombotic events in APS， a lifetime anticoagulant is recommended. New anticoagulants lack evidence of efficacy in the APS treatment通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. APS also requires immunomodulatory therapy， especially in patients secondary to other rheumatic immune system diseases. Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants shall be considered for the management of pSS， but there is no specific treatment so far due to lack of data on efficacy and safety trials. Hydroxychloroquine， methotrexate， azathioprine， and cyclophosphamide can be used with ESSDAI taken 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The prognosis of CVST is favorable， with more than 80% good outcomes，but the prognosis of CVST-related SAH depends on early diagnosis and treatment. In 2 cases series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>， the mortality rates are 2/10 and 1/22， though the sample size limited， we can conclude that the cSAH was not related to bad outcomes， the occurrence of parenchymal infarcts， raised intracranial pressure， and extensive deep venous thrombosis may worsen outcome. As for the prognosis of APS， a large cohort study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u> confirms that APS patients who survive their first episode are still at risk for recurrent events. Because warfarin and aspirin reduces but do not eliminate the risk of recurrent thromboembolic or obstetric complications， which can sometimes be fatal. So a regular follow-up visit is needed to evaluate the coagulation status and succeeding treatment.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】Cerebral venous thrombosis should be considered when convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients presented with neurological deteriorations and new onsets of headache and seizure. In this case， the Sjogren syndrome and secondary antiphospholipid caused hypercoagulation and leading to thrombosis in venous sinuses， presenting as the convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The CTV， MRV， or DSA should be used to confirm the presence of CVST therefore make a precise therapeutic regime. Finding immunological etiology behind it also matters for a following rational and sound treatment plan.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However，long， large， sharp， irregularly shaped， hardened and/or toxic foreign bodies frequently remain in the digestive system where they may cause obstruction or damage the gastrointestinal mucosa. This can lead to bleeding，perforation， and/or acute peritonitis， and may even cause local abscess， fistula formation， or organ damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>. This report describes a patient who was diagnosed by X-ray with a duodenal perforation caused by having ingested two eyeglass temples and was treated by exploratory laparotomy.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 30-year-old Chinese man was admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University for Abdominal Pain for 18 h duration. Twelve days earlier， while intoxicated on alcohol， he had swallowed two eye glass temples. After experiencing a sudden knife-like pain in the upper abdomen， he visited a local community hospital. Abdominal X-rays showed two long foreign bodies in his abdomen . Conservative treatment， including fasting， antibiotics， gastrointestinal decompression， and hydration was unsuccessful，and he continued to experience severe abdominal pain. The patient could not egest them both spontaneously and after administration of lubricants， and it was difficult to alter their position in the digestive tract. An exploratory laparotomy showed a duodenal perforation with foreign bodies and he was transferred to tertiary care hospital for definitive treatment.\n\nThe patient has a 5-year smoking history of 20 cigarettes per day， was an occasional alcohol drinker， and had no history of allergy. Upon admission to our hospital，he had abody temperature of38.8C， a pulse of 85 beats/min， a respiratory rate of 23 breaths/min，and a blood pressure of 130/80mmHg. He was conscious， appeared sickly，and in acute pain. His heart and lung examinations were normal. A fresh， 15-cm long longitudinal incision was present on the ventral midline. He showed|删除段之间换行|tense abdominal muscle， tenderness to light and deep palpation， and generalized rebound tenderness. Abdominal ultrasound showed a small amount of peritoneal fluid. Blood tests showed a White Blood Cell (WBC) count of 14.71 ×10/L. Coagulation， liver function， and renal function test were normal. He was diagnosed with a duodenal perforation. Because it was considered an emergency condition， laparotomy under general anesthesia was performed. Reopening of the previous abdominal incision showed a 10-mm perforation on the wall of the descending portion of the duodenum. Two eyeglass temples， about 11 cm in length were present . Large deposits of exudate were present around the perforation， including in the lesser omentum，gallbladder， and duodenum. The perforation was|删除段之间换行|leaking a small amount of green fluid when the intestine was pulled. The first temple， 13.8 cm inlength and of maximum diameter 1.0 cm， was removed. A second temple， of the same size， was palpable near the pylorus through the perforation. This stem was also removed from the perforation site . These areas were repeatedly lavage with saline and cleaned. A 0.8 cm T-type rubber drainage tube was inserted into the perforation， and a double drainage tube was placed near the perforation for drainage or lavage， if necessary . A second drainage tube was placed in the pelvis， to allow adequate drainage. Following insertion of a nasogastric feeding tube and tube decompression， the abdomen was closed. The patient was managed by drainage， fasting， treatment with antibiotics (cefmetazole and ornidazole)， and nutritional fluids. He recovered completely and was discharged from the hospital 14 days after surgery. He was found to be well at a clinical foll ow-up 3 weeks after discharge.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\nTo our knowledge， this is the first report describing a patient who had swallowed eyeglass temples. These temples were both long， curved， hard， and with sharp edges. The patient could not egest them both spontaneously and after administration of lubricants， and it was difficult to alter their position in the digestive tract. The temples entered into the pylorus and duodenum. Anatomic characteristics， including a relatively short and solid mesentery， prevented these long temples from bending or progressing further into the digestive tract. Stimulating the intestinal sphincter， contractions or prolonged indwelling of the temples caused intestinal perforation. Subsequent flow of digestive fluid into the abdominal cavity could lead to diffuse peritonitis and bowel adhesions to surrounding tissue， as well as the|删除段之间换行|invasion of blood vessels. Secondary infection may be serious and even life-threatening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Findings from this patient indicate the importance of selecting an appropriate diagnostic method for patients who swallow foreign bodies. These diagnostic methods can include X-rays， ultrasound， and CT. Timely treatment of these patients is also essential， with endoscopic or surgical removal depending on the composition of the foreign body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>. A second observation is that if the medical technology of a primary hospital is limited， patients should be promptly transferred to a higher tier hospital. Third， patients with acute abdominal pain and a history of swallowing foreign bodies should be suspected of having a gastrointestinal perforation； if so， an exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy should be performed promptly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Finally， patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal perforation require surgery for careful probing of involved organs. Drainage tubes should be inserted into the abdomen and pelvis， with lavage performed if necessary until recovery.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Swallowed eyeglass temples and other， similarly long foreign bodies， rarely cause gastrointestinal perforation. Patients who swallow such objects， however， should be promptly examined and diagnosed by ultrasound， X-ray， and/or CT. These foreign bodies should be removed by laparoscopy or laparotomy.\n\n【15】Ethical Approval and Consent to Participate\n\n【16】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and anyaccompanying images.

In Peripheral Blood (PB) leukocytes is was 113 G/l with 58% of myeloid blasts infiltration， anemia and thrombocytopenia. He did not have peripheral lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Cytogenetics showed normal male karyotype with no chromosomal aberrations in FISH. CBFB-MYH11， BCR-ABL1， FLT3-ITD， NPM1 and c-kit were excluded in RT-PCR. The diagnosis was preceded by mild megaloblastic anemia. As induction chemotherapy the patient received DAC regimen (daunorubicin，cytarabine， cladribine) and he achieved hematological Complete Remission(CR)， however， with eosinophilia observed both in BM and PB smears. Eosinophilia as a reaction has been ruled out. Identification of FIP1L1-PDGFRA by RT-PCR was performed using material from the diagnosis (PB) and the time of remission assessment (BM). Both specimens were positive. Then the patient received HAM (high dose cytarabine/mitoxantrone) chemotherapy. One month later the patient experienced progressive leukocytosis with eosinophilia. Immunophenotype of BM showed 63% myeloid blasts infiltration， and then imatinib 400 mg daily was administered. After one month， the patient achieved hematological CR and the treatment continued with imatinib 200mg daily. After four months， the patient reported general symptoms. His leukocytosis reached 27G/L with eosinophilia. BM was infiltrated in 94% by myeloid blasts with positive FIP1L1-PDGFRA， and then dasatinib 100 mg daily was started. The therapy was complicated by severe pneumonia， oral candidiasis， Clostridium dificile infection and enteropathy. The patient achieved hematological CR and then the search for a donor for allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplantation (allo-HSCT) began. After three months， another relapse was noted with leukocytosis 70 G/L and BM infiltration by 24% of blasts with no eosinophilia. CLAG-M (cladribine， cytarabine， filgrastim， mitoxantrone) reinduction chemotherapy was administered. The patient achieved hematologic CR and received allo-HSCT from an unrelated donor. A reactivation of CMV infection was a problem after the transplantation. After four months， a relapse was documented with 30% of BM infiltration. At this time， BM cytogenetics showed complex karyotype including del (17p) and RT-PCR revealed the presence of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion. The patient received DAC reinduction chemotherapy. The second rescue， haploidentical stem cell transplant from the patient’s brother as a donor was carried out. Despite intensive supportive care the patient died due to pulmonary infection in +13day after procedure.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\nFIP1L1-PDGRA mutation is extremely rarely detected in AML通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. This fusion gene generates protein complex， which acts like tyrosine kinase and causes constant proliferation ofeosinophils from progenitor cells despite lack of ligand. The mechanism is analogous to BCR-ABL1 mutation in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). Furthermore， FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene is proved to be about100-fold more sensitive to inhibitors oftyrosine kinase enzymes than BCR-ABL1. That is why it is possible to treat patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive AML-Eo with lower doses ofimatinib with success通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2，5\\]</u>. Nevertheless， a resistance to imatinib might occur related to the acquisition of the T674I mutation in most cases， which is analogous to BCR-ABL1 T315I mutation in CML or because of D842V mutation1-5|.\n\n【9】We know that several descriptions of the course of treatment of patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive AML， whose treatment with TKIs was suiccessful. Barraco et al. described 41-year-old patient with FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive AML-Eo， BCR-ABL1， CBFB-MYH11，RUNX1-RUNXITI， KIT D816V negative who was treated using imatinib 100 mg to 200 mg daily. The patient achieved hematologic， cytogenetic and molecular response without side effects通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Metzgerold et al. presented in their paper seven patients with eosinophilia and FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene. Five of them were diagnosed as AML and two others as lymphoblastic T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. All patients were treated using imatinib 100 mg to 400 mg daily and all of them achieved hematologic and molecular CR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【10】In this case we observed resistance to imatinib， dasatinib， intensive chemotherapy and allo-HSCT with fatal outcome in our patient. Undoubtedly， the course of the disease of our patient is different compared to most previous reports. Sorour et al. had similar observation in the case of a 25-vear-old male with FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive AML-Eo and myelodysplasia resistant to imatinib. In the beginning the patient received FLAG-Ida induction， and reached CR. Subsequently， imatinib 400 mg daily was given， and patient underwent allo-HSCT. Six months after transplantation BM was positive for FIP1L1-PDGFRA and imatinib 400 mg to 600 mg was ordered. After 12 months AML relapsed with the presence of D842mutation， which is known to be resistant to imatinib， so sensitive to dasatinib and he was started with dasatinib treatment， which was not tolerated and the patient died. Authors suggested that the outcome of this kind of AML is not as good as previously thought 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Our patient’s case was probably preceded by myelodysplasia and the course of treatment proved to be relapsed and ultimately refractory. Other authors described a case report of a patient FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive with AML-Eo， treated with imatinib 100 mg daily. After five months of therapy the relapse and T674I mutation were revealed. A patient received sorafenib 400 mg daily and underwent allo-HSCT with hematologic and cytogenetic remission. Unfortunately， the patient died because of respiratory failure five months after the transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\nIn conclusion， we suggest performing the identification of FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene in all patients with diagnosis of AML and eosinophilia. Mutational studies of FIP1L1-PDGFRA should be|删除段之间换行|also completed to choose the most effective TKI. Unfortunately， at the time we treated the described patient mutational studies were not available in our department", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The presence of hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic lesions in patients with multiple metastases is rare. Our case reports that a 61-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with a behavioral disorder， emotional lability， and fatigue of months'duration， accompanied by sudden-onset vomiting， associated with hemicranial headache. The patient was diagnosed with a suspected hemorrhagic brain metastasis due to lung carcinoma. She was diagnosed with a suspected hemorrhagic brain metastasis due to lung carcinoma， and she was undergoing sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy as an alternative regimen. The present case emphasizes the need to consider hemorrhagic metastasis as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with solitary intracerebral hemorrhage whose location is uncommon.\n\n【2】Keywords： Brain metastasis； Intracerebralhemorrhage； Lung cancer\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Brain metastases occur in approximately 30% of patients with metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and confer significant morbidity and poor survival in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Ten percent of metastatic patients have brain metastases identified at the time of lung cancer diagnosis， and 14% to 19% of patients with metastatic (NSCLC) develop brain metastases later in the course of their disease.\n\n【5】Hemorrhagic brain metastases from lung cancer manifest as multiple lesions with significant edema and irregular shape. The presence of hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic lesions in patients with multiple metastases is rare. We present a patient with multiple intracerebral hemorrhagic lesions whose cause was established as lung cancer metastasis.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 68-year-old female patient with a history of smoking was admitted to the emergency department for a 2-month clinical picture with a behavioral disorder of emotional lability between aggression， fatigue， irritability， and depressed mood without improvement with antidepressant therapy. She presented with early and sudden onset of vomiting-associated hemicranial headache. It does not refer to signs of blurred vision， diplopia， seizures， impaired consciousness， motor or sensory deficit， or significant loss of body weight. There was no history of hypertension or family history of cerebral hemorrhage. At admission， her blood pressure was 130/90 mmHg Fc， 84 bpm， Temp：37.2Cand neurological examination was normal. Laboratory results were without changes. In view of the persistence of headache after therapy， it is decided to perform a CT Brain Skull. During transport， she presents with a generalized partial seizure with the need to ensure airway and anticonvulsant therapy with clinical response and hemodynamic stabilization. Computed tomography showed expansive infra and supratentorial hemorrhagic lesions on the right occipito parietal topography with areas of focal vasogenic edema and slight left deviation of the median structures of possible secondary etiology . After diuretic， anticonvulsant， and corticoid therapy to reduce vasogenic edema， the patient’s general condition and state of consciousness improved significantly.\n\n【8】Enhancement of cranioencephalic magnetic resonance imaging that revealed “multiple intra-axial brain lesions spanning both the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres in more than twenty”and“the multiplicity of lesions， their signal enhancement， and the fact that some have hemosiderin deposition， especially the right occipital lesion， translating likely metastatic deposits .\n\n【9】Before this result， I start a CT-TAP staging study that showed the“lobular right lung lobe， large nodular lesion suggestive of a primary lesion about 8.2 cm× 4.2 cm axially. The lesion has extensive contact with the adjacent parietal pleura， allowing invasion of the chest wall with erosion of the cortical bone of the 3d rib that demonstrates some irregularities. On the right are areas of interlobular septal thickening suggestive of carcinomatous lymphangitis in the upper lobe”. We recommended biopsy and fiber bronchoscopy， which presented an anatomopathological result of bronchial mucosa with infiltration (80%) by malignant neoplasia of cells compatible with small cell carcinoma.\n\n【10】The patient was initially submitted to corticosteroid therapy until an initial 35 Gy brain radiotherapy was evaluated and administered for 14 days with an improvement of headache symptoms and changes associated with emotional lability. She was referred to oncological pneumology for the initiation of chemotherapy and then to chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide accompanied by simultaneous radiotherapy， but she eventually died at 4 months after treatment.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\nThe most common causes of hemorrhagic cerebral metastasis include melanoma， choriocarcinoma， renal cell carcinoma， and bronchogenic carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The presence of multiple hemorrhagic lesions starting from a single primary pulmonary lesion is rare. Due to the presence of multiple abnormal bilateral nodules in the brain and cerebellum， we considered the hemorrhage to be caused by brain metastases from the lung starting point. Brain metastasis morbidity is higher in lung carcinoma patients vs. BM patients with melanoma， breast cancer， and renal cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.

The most common clinical symptom of Brain Metastasis (BM) at initial diagnosis was headache (25.2%)， followed by motor dysfunction (20.5%)， dizziness (5.8%)， and seizure (3.5%). Brain lesions were asymptomatic at the time of the initial diagnosis of MC (50.8%)， as these symptoms are easily confused with intracranial hypertension， the diagnosis of (MC) may be forgotten 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Of all hemorrhagic metastases， however， lung and breast cancers are the most common etiologies due to their higher overall prevalence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.

The median survival of these untreated BM patients is 1 to 2 months and maybe extended to 6 months with radiotherapy and standard chemotherapy.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Our reported case emphasizes the need to consider hemorrhagic metastasis as a differential diagnosis in patients with multiple or single intracerebral hemorrhages from a primitive solitary focus accompanied by atypical symptoms of emotional lability， mainly when the patient's general condition cannot be explained by hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage.

It is now admitted that there is a strong association between CVD morbi-mortality and socio-economic status. This has been attributed both to higher prevalence， poor control of cardiac risk and to unequal access to health care facilities. However， most of these studies were carried out in high income countries and only few studies from low-and middle income countries which have the highest burden of CVD. In Tunisia， an increasing country， acute coronarysyndromes： Both with and without ST segment elevations are the most interesting CVD in emergency practice. But the data according to their characteristics， management and outcomes are lacking. In this paper， we will try to analyze the epidemiological profile of patients， the strategy and the different delays for medical care of NSTE-ACS from our local register as well as their short and|删除段之间换行|long term outcomes.\n\n【18】It is now admitted that adherence to guidelines has been correlated with improvements in patient outcomes in ACS，including reduced mortality， improving short and long-term outcomes and so reduced health care costs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Materiel and Methods\n\n【20】This is an analytical transversal study，carried out in theemergency department of SAHLOUL，relating to patients treated for NSTE-ACS during the study period from 01/01/2015 to 31/12/2016. We analyzed the data from our local Registry of Acute Coronary Syndrome(ReSCUS). In brief， this registry is a continually ongoing mono-center registry that prospectively collects information regarding all patients presenting with Acute Coronary Syndrome managed in our emergency department (STEMI and NSTE-ACS). Only data of patients with NSTE-ACS were selected for this study.\n\n【21】We included all patients consulting for chest pain and for whom the diagnosis of NSTE-ACS was retained according to the definition established by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). This definition is based on clinical， electrical and biological criteria.\n\n【22】Non-inclusion criteria\n\n【23】Patients with an STMI or other etiologies of chest pain： Our primary endpoint was to identify predictors of Major cardiovascular events(mortality， recurrence of NSTMI， STEMI， and Acute Congestive Heart Failure) in short and long term. The secondary endpoint was to describe the epidemiological characteristics of these patients and the quality of medical care in emergency department. The data were collected on pre-established sheets.\n\n【24】Statistical analysis\n\n【25】All analyses were performed with the SPSS statistical software.\n\n【26】Results\n\nA total of 850 patients who had presented to the emergency department of SAHLOUL for NSTE-ACS were assessed for eligibility，12 ofwhom were lost to follow-up，and only 500 patients were enrolled because of the incomplete data. The average age of our patients was64±11 years. The majority of our population was over the age of 40(99%) and patients over the age of 65 accounted for 44.8%. The sex ratio was 2.22. Hypertension and diabetes are the two most common risk factors in our population. Acute coronary syndrome without ST segment elevation was inaugural in almost the third of the cases(40.6%). A history of NSTE-ACS is found in (41.8%). Revascularized myocardial infarction was found in 17.6%. Twenty-two patients had a history of chronic kidney disease (4.4%). Five of our patients had a history of ischemic stroke or obliterating arterial disease of the lower limbs. Only 7% of our patients have benefited from transportation by the mobile emergency and resuscitation service team， while the majority： 93% were taken to the emergency department by their own means of transport or by a category B ambulance. In our study population 67%(N=335) of our patients had a chest pain score between 2 and 4， hence considered to be of intermediate risk and 33%(N=165) had a chest pain score ≥5， therefore considered to be ofhigh risk and none of our patients were of low risk (Score <2). Regarding the TIMI risk score， 20.2% were in group 1 (TIMI score： 0 to 2， low risk)， 41.4% were in group 2 (TIMI score： 3 to 4， intermediate risk) and 38.4% were in group 3 (TIMI score： 5 to 7， high risk). For 81patients (16.20%) the initial ECG found no repolarization disorder. The mean initial glucose level was 10.31 mmol/L± 5.2 with a median|删除段之间换行|of 8.5 mmol/L (6.5 to 12.5). The mean initial creatinine level was95.93 meq/l± 60.07 with a median of 81 (69-100.5).

The average time between the onset of pain and the patient's arrival at the first medical care was 248.7 ±212.09 min. In our study， 51% consulted between 2 and 6 h and only 26.6% consulted within 2 h after the start of chest pain. The average delay between the time the patient arrived in the Emergency Room (ER) and the first medical contact at the triage unit was 24.42±30.25 min (ranging from0 minto 295 min). The average time to have the 1st qualifying ECG was30±0.6 min. The average length of stay in the ER before admission to the cardiology department was 24.13±21.33 h and a median of 18 h. The coronary status of patients undergoing angiography was： Mono-trunk involvement in 47.8%， bi-trunk involvement in12.4%， tri-trunk involvement in 6.4% but in 33.4% the angiography was normal (or infiltrated networks without significant stenosis). The MACE rate at 30 days 6 and 12 months is shown in the Table删除4:<u> 2</u>. During our follow-up of 500 patients 12 patients were completelylost to follow-up. At 1 month， 58(11.6%) patients presented with MACE， four (0.8%) patients had died，22 (4.4%) patients had an MI， anginal recurrence was observed in 25 (5%) patients and seven (1.4%) of the patients had an acute edema of the lung/a congestive heart failure. At 6 months， 112 (22.4%) had MACE， only 14 (2.8%) patients had died， 16 (3.2%) patients had suffered from a myocardial infarction. The most common MACE was recurrent ACS ST-， from which 54(10.8%) patients had suffered and 28 (5.6%) of patients presented acute heart failure. At 1 year， 136 (27.2%) patients had MACE， 17(3.4%) patients died，6 (1.2%) patients had a myocardial infarction，79 (15.8%) patients had recurrent acute coronary syndrome and 34(6.8%) patients presented acute heart failure. The main risk predictors for the occurrence of MACE was TIMI Risk SCORE >3， chest pain SCORE， age ≥65 years and a history of coronary artery disease .

And finally the rate of MACE according to time to perform angiography/angioplasty was represented in the Table删除4:<u> 7</u>.\n\n【44】Discussion\n\nThe average age， in the French FAST-MI 2015 register， was 68 ±14 years. According to Eisenmann et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> age is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The epidemiology of our population is also similar， in our study the average age is 64±11 years. In western countries， hypertension is the first cardiovascular risk factor found in patients suffering from coronary disease： 24% in the USA while in our results this prevalence was 56.6%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. For diabetes， numerous studies have concluded that patients with diabetes presented more frequently tritruncular involvement with an often poor quality downstream bed. In our series， 50.2% of patients were diabetic. Thus，the majority of Tunisian studies indicate the high prevalence of this risk factor. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) was the largest study interested in diabetic patients. In this study， conducted between 1977 and 1991， including 5，102 patients aged from 25to 65 years with type 2 diabetes， according to the criteria of the American Diabetic Association， have been followed for 20 years. It|删除段之间换行|has thus been shown that coronary artery disease is the main cause of death in type 2 diabetes and 11% ofpatients developed myocardial infarction or angina over a median of 8 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In our study， the average consultation time was 249 min. This delay is relatively long compared to those observed in the European， North American and Middle Eastern registers. We found a delay of 145 min in the European Heart Surveys 2，150 min in the SPACE register 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>， and180 min in the PRAISE-UK register 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-10\\]</u>. This can be improved by raising public awareness so that they consult as soon as possible in the event of chest pain， especially in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. The HAS recommends a delay less than thirty minutes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In our study， the average time for triage was 24.42 min. There was a significant difference between the group with MACE and the group without MACE during one year of follow-up with a P=0.029 but no significant difference between the group of survivors and the group of non survivors. It is recommended to do an ECG within 10 min of the first medical contact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In our study， this delay is 30 min.\n\n【46】In our study 68% of patients had their angioplasty done in less than 48 h. Experts noted that the decision to invasive or conservative strategy of NSTE-ACS and the timing of angiography is based on the patient's risk stratification.\n\n【47】According to the AHA recommendations， an invasive strategy is indicated within 72 h after the onset of symptoms in the presence of a criterion of high risk and/or recurrence of symptoms (Grade I-A). In case of very high ischemic risk (refractory angina， acute heart failure， threatening ventricular disorders， hemodynamic instability)， a coronary angiography must be performed within 2 h (Grade I-C). In addition， an early invasive strategy (<24 h) is recommended in the event ofa GRACE score>140 or in the presence of atleast one high risk criterion (Grade I-A) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. If we follow the ESC recommendations，an invasive strategy， when decided， should be completed within 72 h. By comparing ourselves to the recommended deadlines， our results are generally satisfactory， regardless of the risk of our patients.\n\n【48】Conclusion\n\n【49】The obiectives of this work were the assessment of our practices compared to those recommended and the assessment of short and long-term prognosis regarding major cardiovascular events. The statistical analyzes carried out in our study do not allow us to establish a causal link between most of the risk factors and mortality or MA CE. There is an urgent need for a national register to generalize our results and compare them with international registers for evaluation. Efforts remain to be made to improve our overall management of NSTE-ACS and to further improve the long-term prognosis of our patients.\n\n【50】Interests and Limitations\n\n【51】Our study is subject to several limits： It is a single-center study， not consecutive.

Within 6 months of dasatinib discontinuation，her pulmonary hypertension improved substantially， her pleural effusion resolved completely， and she is now symptom free.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Dasatinib， a tyrosine kinase inhibitor， is first line treatment for patients with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML). Dasatinib is a break point cluster -ABL gene (BCR-ABL) inhibitor that has 325-fold higher potency in vitro compared with imatinib against engineered cell lines expressing non-mutant BCR-ABL，and inhibitory activityagainst the majority of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) and chylothorax are rare complications of dasatinib and have not been reported to occur simultaneously. We report a patient with chylothorax and PAH after 4 years of dasatinib use.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\nA 44 year old woman complained of worsening exertional dyspnea over 1 month， right chest discomfort， and nonproductive cough. Her exercise tolerance， unlimited 2 months prior， was now limited to 1 block. She was treated for CML with dasatinib 100mg once daily from 2012 to 2016when she presented with dyspnea. Her exam revealed dullness with egophony over the right lung from base to scapula. Chest radiograph showed a large right pleural effusion， new since her last radiograph 8 months before. Computerized tomography with angiography revealed large pleural effusion，parenchymal ground glass opacities， foci of septal wall thickening， nopulmonary embolism，|删除段之间换行|and no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Thoracentesis and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) were performed.Pleural fluid studies revealed a sterile chylous lymphocytic exudate and TTE showed basal right ventricular hypokinesis with tricuspid regurgitation jet max velocity estimated Pulmonary Artery Systolic Pressure (PASP) of 80 mm Hg (severe PAH) ， normal left ventricular function and normal left atrial pressure.\n\n【9】Dasatinib was stopped.\n\n【10】Initially our patient's dyspnea improved， however， she returned with dyspnea and recurrent pleural effusion 11 days later. A repeat thoracentesis showed an exudative pleural effusion with decreasing triglyceride and lymphocyte concentrations. TTE at that time estimated PASP 60 mm Hg (moderate PAH). Twenty seven days after initial presentation she returned with dyspnea and a third thoracentesis was performed that demonstrated persistent exudative pleural effusion with further decline in triglyceride and lymphocyte concentrations. From the first day dasatinib was discontinued (day1)， she was monitored. Table 1 presents pertinent clinical features. Respectively， on days 97 and 120 the estimated PASP had declined to 39 mmHg and the chest radiograph revealed complete resolution of the pleural effusion. On day 169 imatinib was started and one month later (day 201)， her chest radiograph revealed no infiltrates or effusions. On day 349 our patient's transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated estimated PASP 30 mmHg.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Between June 2006-December 2010 Bristol-Myers Squibb identified 51 cases of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) (right heart catheterization confirmed) after initiation of dasatinib therapy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Exudative pleural effusion has been reported as a complication of dasatinib 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Chylothorax rarely has been a complication of dasatinib use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. We are unaware of chylothorax and pulmonary artery hypertension occurring simultaneously in a patient taking dasatinib. Importantly， temporal recovery of chylothorax and PAH after dasatinib discontinuation has not been carefully described. There are no reports of recovery occurring sooner than 15 months. The description of our patient’s serial recovery following dasatinib discontinuation and her recovery sooner than 15 months are features that previously have not been reported.\n\n【13】CML itself has also been cited as a cause of PAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Because our patient seemingly developed PAH only after dasatinib use， chest computed tomography angiogram revealed no pulmonary emboli， and the severity of PAH declined after dasatinib was discontinued， we believe her PAH resulted from dasatinib use and not from CML or pulmonary emboli.\n\n【14】The exact mechanism of dasatinib associated pleural effusion development is unknown. Brixey et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> reported a review of all incident dasatinib associated pleural effusions published from删除4:<u> 2006-2010</u>. They found these effusions were lymphocyte predominant exudates， suggesting an immune-mediated mechanism and rendering cardiac or renal dysfunction of less likely etiology. Typically， these effusions occurred within 6-12 months of bi-daily use of dasatinib. While our patient's pleural effusion was a lymphocyte predominant exudate， she differed from previous cases in that she developed a chylous exudate after four years of once daily use of dasatinib.\n\nA chylous pleural effusion is diagnosed by the presence of chylomicrons， and suggested by a triglyceride concentration of|删除段之间换行|\\>110mg/dL. Chyle leak results from microscopic disruptions in the lymphatic network. Dasatinib， a tyrosine kinase inhibitor， has activity against platelet derived growth factor (PDGFR). Off-target kinase inhibition has been posited as a possible mechanism for dasatinib related pleural fluid development given its PDGFR-beta receptor effect on postnatal angiogenesis， lymphangiogenesis， and interstitial fluid pressure regulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Thus， chylothorax associated with dasatinib use may be related to microvasculopathy associated with a protein leak.\n\n【16】From 2006-2010， the French Pulmonary Hypertension Registry showed among all patients with CML treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)， only those treated with dasatinib developed PAH(N=9). Pulmonary Artery Hypertension occurred after 8-48 months of dasatinib use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The cases from the French registry of dasatinib associated PAH were characterized by rapid clinical， hemodynamic， and functional improvements in 8 patients within 4 months of discontinuing dasatinib. The mechanism of the association has not yet been determined. Guignabert et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> recently published a study in rodents demonstrating that chronic dasatinib therapy can induce direct endothelial toxicity. The same study also found that dasatinib-induced apoptosis in cultured human endothelial cells causing endothelial dysfunction and vascular damage. They posit that dasatinib causes pulmonary vascular damage which may lead to increased susceptibility to pulmonary hypertension development. Further studies are needed，however， to validate this concept and to elucidate how much pulmonary vascular injury leads to PAH. The above literature review instructs us that mechanistically dasatinib-induced chylothorax and PAH typically develop independently. Part of our patient's uniqueness relates to her having both these disorders simultaneously. Perhaps Guignabert et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> and Goldblatt et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> work should be viewed as complementary. While Guignabert et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> did not report chylous pleural effusions in their rodent studies， their observations still may be pertinent to our patient. Dasatinib may have-induced simultaneous apoptotic injury to both pulmonary vessels and lymphatics resulting in PAH and chylous pleural effusion. The development of pleural effusion with regional lung hypoxemia may have facilitated the development of PAH. Quintas-Cardama et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> reported 48 patients with dasatinib-induced pleural effusions. Eighteen of these had TTE measurements that showed mild PAH (median 42 mmHg) that seemingly developed with the onset of the effusion. Both pleural effusion and PAH resolved with discontinuation of dasatinib. They did not report the nature of the effusion among those that developed PAH. In our patient， the effusion was chylous， the PAH was severe， and both resolved with dasatinib discontinuation.\n\n【17】The management of chylous pleural effusions and pulmonary hypertension in patients with these dasatinib-associated adverse effects has included reduction or complete cessation of the drug. Brixeyet al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> have proposed a management algorithm for dasatinib related pleural effusions based on severity of pleural effusions as defined by National Cancer Institute (NCI) guidelines. However， the appropriateness oftheir recommendations focused on management of the dasatinib-induced pleural effusions， may apply only to those with pleural effusion who lack PAH. Our patient instructs us that diagnosis of dasatinib related chylous pleural effusions merits assessment for PAH， which，if present， would warrant discontinuation of the drug.\n\nOur patient's uniquenessderives from aa))simultaneous development of chylous pleural effusion and PAH， b) after four|删除段之间换行|years of c) once daily use dasatinib d) and her early recovery following dasatinib discontinuation. While after initial thoracentesis her dyspnea-producing pleural effusion reaccumulated rapidly over the next 3 weeks， pleural fluid lymphocyte and triglyceride concentrations and PASP had already started to decline. Within 6months of dasatinib discontinuation， her pulmonary hypertension improved substantially， her pleural effusion resolved completely， and she is now symptom free.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The angiomyolipoma of the kidney is a benign tumor that often happens along with tuberous sclerosis. Large renal angiomyolipoma's associated with tuberous sclerosis are in danger of fatal hemorrhage. This study reported a case with an unexpected large size of renal angiomyolipoma's associated with tuberous sclerosis.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： We report a girl aged 5 years and 9 months old with tuberous sclerosis who referred to nephrology clinic due to abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed a large mass in the right flank. Kidney ultrasound reported a large mass with approximate size of 90 mmx 60mm in the right kidney， and abdominal CT scan also showed a non-hemogenic solid mass in the right kidney with size of 91 mm x68 mm×67 mm， was highly suspected for Wilms tumor. Since the large size of lesion and subsequent suspension for malignant tumor， partial nephrectomy was performed and through kidney biopsy an unexpected angiomyolipoma was diagnosed.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Considering extended studies in various populations with tuberous sclerosis and renal angiomyolipoma， this case is challenging and intriguing since she was the youngest one among patients with necessity of nephrectomy due to the large size of lesion and radiologic findings suggestive of Wilms'tumor.\n\n【4】Keywords： Tuberous sclerosis； Renal angiomyolipoma； Children； Nephrectomy\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Tuberous Sclerosis (TS) is an uncommon neurocutaneous and genetic disease， arises from inactivating mutations of either TSC1 (chromosome locus 9q34.3) or TSC2 (16p13.3) genes which encode hamartin and tuberin， respectively. These proteins serve as tumor suppressors by forming complexes that controls proliferation of cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Benign tumors in patients with TS are identified in various organs including retina，lungs，heart， brain， skin andkidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. In affected infants，cardiac rhabdomyomas，hamartomas， epilepsy and skin lesions are the most common symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. The most frequent manifestations in kidneys are unilateral or bilateral renal angiomyolipoma's， which occur in a majority of patients (34% to 80%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. Renal angiomyolipoma's usually appear later in life， and can associate with fatal bleeding， and hypovolemic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4，6，7\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Although renal angiomyolipoma’s usually consist of adipocytes， irregular vasculature， and smooth muscle cells， the proportions of each parts of tumor can differ in patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Renal angiomyolipoma’s with a size more than 40 mm can result in vascular aneurysm and fatal hemorrhage. Vascularity of the lesion can rise with growth of the size 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，7\\]</u>. Complications are usually treated with angiographic embolization or surgical removal such as radical nephrectomy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. This study reported a case with an unexpected large size of renal angiomyolipoma's (90 mm x60 mm) associated with Tuberous sclerosis. It was so interesting that despite large size of tumor， there were no evidences of bleeding， and kidney ultrasound and abdominal CT scan findings were representative of Wilms tumor.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】The patient was an Iranian girl aged 5 years and 9 months old and referred to nephrology clinic due to abdominal pain and a huge right flank mass. At the age of 9 months， following recurrent seizures accompanied by skin lesions the diagnosis of TS was made for this patient. Her weight was 15 kg (Z score： -2) and systolic blood pressure at first visit was 100 mmHg with no detectable diastolic blood pressure. Pulse rates were normal and there were no evidences of internal hemorrhage.\n\n【10】Although she was old enough (age >5 years)， she had fecal and urinary incontinence and because of intellectual disability she was unable to speak. Physical examination determined different Cafe au lait macules and angiofibroma's lesions on the face， limbs， trunk and borders of the fingers， and Shagreen patch in the region of lumbar vertebrates. She had a history of repetitive hand surgeries for removal of fingers lesions which restricted her movements. Physical examination of abdomen revealed a huge mobile mass in the right flank without tenderness.\n\n【11】Imaging test\n\nKidney ultrasound findings reported a large mass with a size of90 mm x 60 mm in the right kidney， very closely resembled a Wilms tumor. Abdominal CT scan with intravenous contrast injection defined a non-hemogenic solid mass in the right kidney with a size of91 mm x68 mm x67 mm，highly suspected to Wilms tumor (Figure|删除段之间换行|1). Thoracic CT scan also performed in multiple sections and their results were unremarkable. Partial nephrectomy was performed and histopathologic examination revealed Pleomorphic Angiomyolipoma as the final diagnosis and there were no histological evidences of Wilms tumor .\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Tuberous Sclerosis (TS) is an autosomal dominant disease， most commonly caused by TSC1 or TSC2 genes mutation and identified by benign hamartomas in about 34% to 80% of TS patients with renal angiomyolipoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. It is a rare genetic multisystem disorder， presented by benign tumors which can develop in any organ system. It’s prevalence in live-birth is 1 in 5，800 births and prevalence of 1 in 12，500 had been reported in total population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Renal angiomyolipoma’s are benign vascular， smooth muscle tumors and are typically asymptomatic but may induce flank or abdominal pain， hematuria， abdominal mass or distension， fever， nausea， vomiting， or progressive loss of kidney function. Death due to retroperitoneal hemorrhage (Wunderlich syndrome) have been reported in cases with renal angiomyolipoma's 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Growth of angiomyolipoma associated with TSC is faster than those associated withsporadic angiomyolipomaa13， Angiomyolipoma’s with a diameter >3.5 cm have the significant risk for severe hemorrhage and selective embolization should be considered as first treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Renal angiomyolipoma lesions are classified as small (<4 cm)， medium (4 cm to 8 cm) or large (>8cm) based on the single largest lesion in each kidney. The severity of complications is mostly related to the sizes oflesions. The mean size of 85 mm (35 mm to 200 mm) and 78 mm (45 mm to 180 mm)renal angiomyolipoma's (sporadic or associated with TSC) referred to selective embolization， have been reported in two studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>and the individual risk of bleeding appears moderate， even in TS patients(around 6%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【16】It has been reported that tumors sized >6 cm are at higher risk of bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， while another study showed that tumors with size of<8cm tend to be asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Similar to our case， a recent study reported asymptomatic giant renal angiomyolipoma's (290 mm×215mmx120 mm) in a patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\nIn a recently extended study among patients with TS， 1070 of2065 enrolled cases (51.8%) had a history of renal angiomyolipoma.

Totally 498 cases with renal angiomyolipoma (46.5%) needed to treatment， including 11/134 (8.2%) patients who were at age of 5 to 9 years (likely the age range of our case). Nephrectomy was a rare modality used for treatment in cases <18 years (5/498cases； 1%)， while in those aged >18 years， 57/572 patients (9.95%) underwent nephrectomy. The youngest age for nephrectomy was >9years 20|.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】Our case is interesting since presents a girl with TS and large renal angiomyolipoma which mimicking the Wilms’tumor findings in the imaging studies (renal ultrasound and abdominal CT scan). Despite large size of tumor there was no sign of bleeding. Patient underwent nephrectomy because of the large sized lesion and suspicion to malignant tumor. Nephrectomy rarely needed in children with TS who were at age of<18 years (1%). Considering an extended study in a large population with TS and renal angiomyolipoma， our case had been the youngest one with indispensable nephrectomy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

A 45 years old African American female patient with past medical history of Hypothyroidism|删除段之间换行|who presented at our Hospital with recurrent episodes of presyncope and syncope， palpitation， dyspnea and mild precordial chest pain. On physical exam， vital signs were normal， cardiac exam showed no sign of murmur or any sign of cardiac decompensation. Patient was thoroughly worked up with： EKG showed Left Ventricular(LV) hypertrophy and T wave inversion on precordial leads . Chest X-ray and Cardiac enzymes were normal. Trans-thoracic Echocardiography showed Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) of 55% with LV apical hypertrophy Perfusion study showed LVEF of54%， good perfusion， no ischemic EKG changes. Cardiac MRI showed thickened LV myocardium involving most of the LV， only sparing a small portion ofthe bases .

With the diagnosis of AHCM， She was started on Beta Blocker for 3 months but she developed severe bradycardia. She was then referred to Mayo clinic at Arizona where she underwent septal myomectomy.\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】Epidemiology\n\nEthnically， AHCM accounts for 13-41% of all variants of HCM among Asian individuals， whereas the prevalence among non-Asians is < 5%. Of all the HCM patients in Japan the prevalence of AHCM was 15%， whereas in USA the prevalence was only 3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> However， much of these epidemiologic data are derived from studies conducted in the early 1990s， and the exact prevalence of AHCM in non-Asians may be underestimated due to diagnostic unawareness as well as the|删除段之间换行|Systoly.\n\n【26】heterogeneous appearance on trans-thoracic echocardiogram， the most frequently utilized diagnostic modality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Diagnosis\n\n【28】Most patients with AHCM are diagnosed incidentally or with mild symptoms including fatigue， fainting， chest pain and palpitation， although cases were reported with symptoms of angina， myocardial infarction， heart failure， atrial or ventricular fibrillation. In patients presenting with severe symptoms， apical myomectomy can be done通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>.\n\n【29】The diagnostic criteria for AHCM include demonstration of asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy confined predominantly to the LV apex. This hypertrophy must present with an apical wall thickness >=15mm and a ratio of maximal apical to posterior wall thickness 21.3. This can be based on either echocardiogram with or without contrast medium. Such medium improve endocardial border visualization or cardiovascular resonance imaging (CMR)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Th1ee F preferredinitialimaging test is 2 trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Image quality can vary however， as it is dependent on many factors including body habitus and the skill of the sonographer to focus on the left ventricular apex. When the baseline images are suboptimal， a contrast echocardiogram may be utilized depicting a“spade-like”configuration ofthe apical segment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Other imaging modalities have been proven useful such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging. This modality usually presents with three distinct findings1) an increased apical tracer uptake， 2) a spade-like configuration of the LV chamber， and 3) the “Solar Polar\" map pattern. This presentation may be seen in 75% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【31】AHCM can be diagnosed accurately with Cardiac computed tomography(CCT)， and the cardiac anatomy， function and coronary artery are also assessed simultaneously. CMR is a valuable tool for diagnosing this entity and it tends to be the modality of choice when echocardiography produces suboptimal images. Furthermore， CMR can accurately measure the myocardial wall thickness， the left ventricular mass， the left atrial volume， and also search for apical aneurysms and myocardial scarring/fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Typical features of apical HCM include： audible and palpable fourth heart sound， indicating LV relaxation impairment， large negative T waves on EKG particularly in the left precordial leads，“Spade-like” configuration of the left ventricular cavity at end-diastole on imaging， and associated apical wall motion abnormalities which may include hypokinesis and aneurysm formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>\n\n【33】Treatment\n\n【34】Regarding management， AHCM are treated like most HCM patients. Symptomatic patients are primarily treated medically that include the use of beta blockers， nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as well as antiarrhythmics including Amiodarone and Procainamide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Beta-blockers have empiricaly been administered to AHCM patients. Numerous studies investigated the effects of beta-blockers on AHCM patients and reported symptom improvement. The beneficial effects might be driven by sympathetic suppression of heart rate， ventricular contractility， and stiffness. However， the long-term benefits of beta-blockers in HCM patients are still unknown. Although a cohort study reported that massive doses of propranolol improved symptoms and long-term survival， this is not standard procedure. Kim et al found beta-blocker use was significantly associated with lower overall death but not lower cardiac death. In other studies， beta-blockers reduced left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and ventricular tachyarrhythmia. It is difficult to determine the benefits of beta-blockers in HCM patients because the agent，dosage， and duration were not consistent in all patients. Kim et al strongly suggested that observation without medical attention for apical HCM patients might in fact be harmful. Further randomized trials should be conducted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Surgical septal wall reduction is rarely done as AHCM almost never cause Left Ventricular outflow obstruction. Our patient is among the few treated surgically. Risk stratification for ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death is the same as for other patients with HCM，but apical HCM is typically associated with a low risk and almost never requires Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator placement for primary prevention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【37】Prognosis\n\nApical HCM has better mortality prognosis than other forms of HCM but it is still associated with a relatively high rates of significant cardiac events. Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in North American patients is very similar to that in Japanese patients， is not associated with sudden cardiac death and has a benign prognosis in terms of cardiovascular mortality. However， one third of APHCM patients may develop unfavorable clinical events and potentially life-threatening complications， such as myocardial infarction， arrhythmias， and stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In one study where 105 patients with AHCM， with a mean age of 41 years， were followed for close to 14years， the total cardiovascular mortality rate was 1.9% and the overall estimated survival was 95% at 15 vears. The study also showed that30% of patients experienced serious cardiac complication， most commonly atrial fibrillation (12%) or myocardial infarction (10%)|12，13.\n\n【39】Conclusion\n\n【40】We presented a rare case of AHCM which was treated surgically. Symptomatic patients are primarily treated medically mostly by Beta blocker. Very few patients may need surgical management. This made our patient among the very few who underwent surgical intervention due to outflow obstruction and severe bradycardia. Thus counseling and management of patients with APHCM should be planned and followed accordingly.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The objective of this work was to report the exceptional case of a colonic foreign body revealed by sub-occlusive syndromes. This is a 65-year-old patient with no significant pathological history， who presented with Koenigs syndrome progressing against a background of deterioration of the general state with a periumbilical impasto on examination. The abdominal CT objectified a thickening of the transverse colon with foreign body at the level of the peritoneal fat making suspect a colonic perforation by clogged foreign body. Colonoscopy showed an impassable stenosis of the transverse colon， the anatomopathological study of colonic biopsies was in favor of granulomatous colitis， the patient therefore underwent colonic resection with end-to-end anastomosis with good postoperative progress.\n\n【2】An anatomopathological study of the operative resection part showed that it was a granulomatous colitis with a foreign body. In the absence of anamnestic orientation， the colonic localization of a foreign body poses a real problem of differential diagnosis with tumor， infectious and inflammatory pathologies. It can be revealed by complications such as occlusion or perforation where imaging plays a key role. Endoscopy always plays an essential diagnostic and therapeutic role in the care of ingested foreign bodies， thus limiting surgical morbidity， although this remains sometimes unavoidable， and the anatomopathological study highlights a granuloma with a constituted foreign body. Granulomatous colitis with a foreign body with clogged colonic perforation is a rarely reported situation and must henceforth be considered before any colonic symptomatology even in the absence of the anamnestic elements in favor such as our case in order to avoid the patient from the side effects and complications of heavy treatments.\n\n【3】Keywords： Granulomatous colitis； Foreign body； Tumor process； Endoscopy； Surgery\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Ingestion of the foreign body is a situation that gastroenterologists are regularly confronted with the symptomatic range is wide.

A biological inflammatory syndrome made of a microcytic hypochromic anemia at 10.3 g/dl and an accelerated sedimentation rate at 58 mm at the first hour|删除段之间换行|is found， a CRP rose to 95. No biological malabsorption syndrome is noted. The LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) level was normal at90 IU/L. The HIV serology was negative. The abdomen without preparation did not showhydroaericlevels. Anabdominalultrasound showed thickening of the transverse colon associated with significant infiltration of peritoneal fat with satellite lymphadenopathy. The abdominal CT revealed a circumferential and regular thickening of the median part of the transverse colon measuring 14 mm thick and extended over approximately 81 mm，enhanced by the contrast and is associated with significant infiltration of the surrounding peritoneal fat with individualization of a foreign body of high density elon gated by 32 mm， absence of visible pneumoperitoneum .\n\nIt is also associated with a thickening of the grcic handles on contact with extension of the infiltration towards the anterior abdominal wall and collections in cubicles of the right muscle measuring 46 mm x 96 mm with discreet infiltration of the fat cutaneous shell opposite ， and peritoneal and mesenteric fat nodes of infra centimeter size， with a left renal cyst of 44 mm in simple diameter with no other visible anomalies.

The patient had a colonoscopy which objectified in the transverse colon after the left colonic angle a thickening of the mucosa with an appearance of large folds converging towards the colonic lumen obstructing it and making it impassable with the colonoscope multiple biopsies were made， the rest of the rectocolic mucosa was without abnormalities . Thehistological study of the biopsies showed granulomatous transmural colitis with non-necrotizing epithelio-giganto-cellular follicles without sign of malignancy .\n\n【9】The tuberculosis assessment was negative. The patient was put on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy and then he underwent colonic resection with an end-to-end colonic anastomosis with drainage of the collections. At the opening ofthe operative resection part， we note the presence at the level of the transverse colon of a stenosing whitish lesion of hard consistency at the center of which a firm foreign body， with sharp edges， reshaped， the nature of which has could be determined probably a fishbone . The anatomopathological studyofthe operating room was in favor of granulomatous transmural colitis with foreign body with non-necrotizing epithelio-giganto-cellular follicles without sign of malignancy. The post-operative suites were simple. The patient is asymptomatic， has gained weight and has a negative inflammatory balance， with a 2-year follow-up.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\nThe Foreign Bodies (FB) ingested are numerous but poorlylisted.

Our patient is an elderly subject with no notable pathological history or particular field without the notion of ingestion of a foreign body， presenting a koenig syndrome evolving in a context of deterioration of the general state. The diagnosis is usually easy and is based on the interrogation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， although not contributory in the case of our patient making the observation exceptional. Retro-sternal pain， odynophagia， dysphagia， hyper-sialorrhea and vomiting may occur at the time of the incident which could also be complicated by bleeding， perforation with infectious consequences (mediastinitis， cellulitis and para-esophageal abscess) and fistulas of the digestive tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，6\\]</u>. Our patient developed a sub-occlusive syndrome on an inflammatory process formed around the foreign body at the level of the median part of the transverse colon.\n\nNo radiological assessment is necessary for non-bone food impactions without complications. The ESGE (European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy) recommends a simple X-ray to locate the FB， determine its size， appearance and number if the object is suspected to be radiopaque or whose nature is unknown. Computed tomography is indicated in case of suspected complications that may require surgical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. In the illustrated case， the radiography of the abdomen without preparation was normal and the abdominal computed tomography showed a thickening of the transverse colon with foreign body at the level of the peritoneal fat making suspect a colonic perforation by clogged foreign body. The exact nature of the foreign body remains unidentified； the anamnestic data were not contributory. The search for an underlying disease during a feeding impaction incident is essential and includes a biopsy of the blocking seat 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The operative part of the colon resection that our patient underwent， was in favor of granulomatous transmural colitis with foreign body while eliminating tuberculosis， Crohn’s disease and neoplasia. Foreign body granuloma is a chronic lesion predominantly made up of cells of the monocyte and macrophage lineage. The phagocytosis function is usually well developed there.

Mainly， it is associated with nervous system involvement and cardiovascular compromise，especially myocardic， is rare. We present the case of a 21 year old patient that was bitten by a Latrodectus mactans spider， who developed neurologic compromise and later presenting severe acute heart failure. After 10 days oftreatment， the patient recovered without sequelae.\n\n【2】Keywords： Latrodectus； Myocarditis； Acute heart failure\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Lactrodectism is a clinical entity with characteristic symptoms and signs caused by the bite from arachnids of the genus Latrodectus with compromise of several organs， specially nervous and cardiovascular systems. Among cardiovascular symptoms， arterial hypertension and brady-tachycardia are common in the first hours. Secondary acute myocardial compromise is rare and the mechanisms of myocardial damage as well as the prognosis ofthis complication have not been well defined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Electrocardiographic alterations could be explained by the effect of alpha-latroxin， which is the most active component of this venom.

He refers to be bitten in his right scapular region by a black spider with red abdomen， while he was performing his job spraying plaguicide with adequate protection of hands and arms. After 20min he describes intense pain and pruritus over the bite zone. On the skin， an intense erythematic lesion with a diameter of 10 cm appeared which， after two hours， presented marked edema. He presented concomitant malaise and diffuse myalgia. He was admitted in the emergency department after 4 h of the event， febrile， tachycardic， polypneic， diaphoretic and with diffuse erythema. The electrocardiogram showed only sinus tachycardia . He was transferred to the intermediate care unit were supportive care was initiated and intravenous corticoids， antiallergics， calcium gluconate and opiods were administered.\n\n【10】Following advice of the local Toxicology Center， therapy with antivenom was not administered because a high risk of anaphylactic reaction. After 24 h， the patient developed progressive dyspnea and oxygen desaturation. He was severely hypertense(220/110 mmHg)， with a hear rate of 140 bpm， febrile and with intense myalgias and shivering. Physical exam revealed rales on both lung fields which were corroborated by chest X-ray were the appearance of bilateral interstitial infiltrates was observed  compatible with acute pulmonary edema. Severe hypoxemia was documented with a PaO，/FiO， of 156 and levels ofultra sensitive Troponin T (usTnT) were 4.74 ng/mL (normal value<0.16 ng/mL).\n\nThe patient was treated with intravenous furosemide and nitroglycerin infusion， achieving blood pressure control and negative hydric balance. Transthoracic echocardiogram evidenced mild LV dilatation with globalhypokinesia that determined a LVEF of29% and a suspicious image of apical ballooning. Mild regurgitation of mitral and aortic valves was observed . Dobutamine infusion was|删除段之间换行|started at a dose of 1 mcg/kg/min without clinical response. The patient developed a new episode of intense desaturation and atrial tachycardia with need or orotracheal intubation and connection to invasive mechanical ventilation. The patient was then derived to our center after 48 h of therapy.\n\n【12】On physical exam a decreased peripheral perfusion was noted， with a third heart sound and pulmonary rales. Laboratory showed leukocytosis (15，000 x mm’， 70% polymorphonuclear)， usTnT of128 pg/mL， CK 123 U/L， CKmb 26 U/L， Lactate 1.3 mmol/L (normal value<1.7) and creatinine of 0.87 mg/dL. On electrocardiogram， atrial tachycardia was seen， with a diffuse PR depression， rS from V1 to V3and diffuse ST elevation and T wave inversion in I， aVL， V5 and V6. A new echocardiogram corroborated a LVEF of 35% with a LV of normal diameters， diffuse hypokinesia more pronounced in anterior and anteroseptal basal and medial segments. RV presented a preserved systolic function without pulmonary hypertension. QUE TERAPIA SE DEJO?\n\n【13】The patient evolved with progressive improvement in oxygen requirements and resolution of lung infiltrates . After four days of treatment， inotropes were suspended and a new echocardiogram showed a LVEF of 45%. usTnT 98 pg/mL. The patient was successfully extubated.\n\n【14】and carvedilol was adjusted. Subsequent electrocardiograms showed intermittent ectopic atrial rhythm and ST elevation resolution with a profound T wave inversion in I， II， aVL and V1 to V6  with posterior normalization .\n\n【15】Echocardiogram after eleven days of therapy denoted a complete recovery of LV systolic function. Patient was discharged after twelve day with the following therapy： Enalapril 5 mg bid and Carvedilol12.5 mg bid. After XXXX months， the subject remains asymptomatic with a normal echocardiogram.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Bite from arachnids from the genus Latrodectus is one of the most common worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> and L. mactans， L. tredecimguttatus and L. hasseelti are the principal species of this genus. In Chile， the bite from L. mactans is described since 1852， generating seasonal epidemics depending on temperatures and agricultural activities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Commonly named “black widow”or “wheat spider\"， it has a black color with characteristic red stains in the ventral side of its globular abdomen. Female spiders are bigger and have a more potent venom. It has daily habits and it is found more commonly in rural areas. The higher rate of bites is registered during agriculture task hours(between 10 h and 19 h).\n\nThe most important component of the venom is a-Latrotoxin(a-LTX)， a protein that consists in two polypeptides of 8 and 130kD， the last of them with biologic activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This toxin produces massive exocytosis of neurotransmitters from neurosecretory cells， predominantly acetylcholine and noradrenalin， into motor|删除段之间换行|synapses.This secretion produces synaptic terminal depletion with neurotransmission blockade deriving into paralysis. Three physiopathologic mechanisms have been described to explain this effect：|删除段之间换行|1 Massive influx of calcium through de novo formed transcellular pores and preexistent channel opening；|删除段之间换行|2\\. The action Neurexins： Transmembrane proteins that bind to a-LTX in presence of extracellular calcium， triggering exocytosis directly through Synaptotagmin；|删除段之间换行|3\\. G-Protein binded receptor， calcium independent， called Latrophilin. The mechanisms of toxicity that predominate are different in every organ， with no available evidence about the direct effects of this toxin over cardiac tissue.\n\n【19】In the typical clinical scenario， local reaction to the bite predominates， with pain and edema on the site of inoculation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，8\\]</u>.

Literature describes secondary myocarditis as a rare phenomenon通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. Typically， myocardial involvement is suspected through elevated Troponin levels and electrocardiographic abnormalities such as： ectopic rhythm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， atrial fibrillation and ST deviation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. QRS alterations， QT prolongation and evolutive T wave changes are also described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

These changes are characteristically reversible within approximately 7 days. In this case， the patient presented with severe transient systolic dysfunction associated with marked electrocardiographic changes in PR and ST segments andT wave inversion.\n\n【21】Therapy is based mainly on supportive measures. Due to the physiopathological evidence of intracellular calcium abnormalities， calcium gluconate infusion has been described as an additional treatment in the first hours； nevertheless， different series have not demonstrated benefits in terms of duration or severity of the disease通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.

Falciparum malaria a protozoan disease is caused by Plasmodium falciparum， transmitted by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. Acute pancreatitis a rare complication of falciparum malaria which is well documented. It is rare complication because despite having high parasitemia there is no any other system involvement. A case report of a 26-yr old army man infected with falciparum malaria with high parasitemia and acute pancreatitis as a sole presentation was presented here. Only few case reports are available.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nA 26-yr old army man of commandant rank posted in forest belt of Mirzapur district， Uttar Pradesh， presented to the medicine emergency department with a 4-day history of high-grade fever which was associated with chills and rigor， vomiting and generalized abdominal pain. There was no significant past medical history of lipid disorders， no history of biliary tract disease， and no steroids and painkillers intake. There was no history of alcohol intake or any other substance abuse. At the time of presentation on clinical examination， he was febrile (102.2°F) with mild jaundice. His temperature fluctuates over next 2 days， abdominal pain increases and he becomes drowsy. Four days after admission his condition improved. Blood pressure was normal. Systemic examinations reveal epigastric tenderness with mild generalized abdominal distension with normal bowel sounds. Systemic examinations of other system were within normal limits. Laboratory examination revealed hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL with total leucocyte count 6400/mm’(with granulocytes 65.6%)， platelet count 90，000， MCV 84.5 fl， MCH 30.2 pg and hematocrit 23.1%.

Treatment in form|删除段之间换行|of intravenous quinine 1000 mg as loading dose in 10% dextrose solution followed by 500 mg in same solution and was monitored for hypoglycemia .\n\n【7】A Ryle’s tube was inserted for bowel rest and acute pancreatitis was managed with analgesics， hydration and supportive therapy. Antibiotic ceftriaxone 1 g twice a day was started and marked improvements in his clinical symptoms was noted， parasitemia load were cleared by more than half after 4th day of therapy， his fever spike came down pain abdomen and jaundice subsided after 84h day. Oral quinine tab was started 8h day up to 15h day. The patient was discharged on 18h day and his condition was good on further follow up. Although abdominal pain is a frequent symptom in malaria， in this patient， the persistent and worsening abdominal pain was related to severe pancreatitis a rare complication of falciparum malaria. Abdominal pain and vomiting were reported to be more commonly associated with falciparum infections than with vivax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The various causes of abdominal pain in malaria include Acalculus cholecystitis， acute surgical abdomen， splenic rupture， splenic infarction， splenic torsion and hepatitis/hepatomegaly， acute renal failure and algid malaria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. The presence of abdominal pain if associated with hepatomegaly has higher mortality in malaria. National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme reported about two million malaria cases every year， among them 50% is P. falciparum. The WHO estimates100 million cases in the Southeast Asia Region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Morbidity and mortality in rural population highest with varying degrees of presentation. Only few case reports are available regarding this complication of falciparum malaria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-8\\]</u>. Pancreatitis is an unusual cause of abdominal pain in malaria with less than 10 cases reported worldwide. Theparasitemia in three ofthese patients werelow (0.5%to1.5%). As none of these patients had fulfilled WHO criteria for severe falciparum malaria. There is no acute respiratory distress syndrome either with severe malaria or with acute pancreatitis in this young man. The parasitized erythrocytes bind toreceptors on the endothelial cells by the formation of knobs (electron-dense structures) and cause obstruction of capillary blood flow. Capillary blockage by parasitized RBCs and acute hemolysis was pathophysiological mechanisms that result in pancreatitis. Occlusion of blood vessels of the pancreas with parasitized RBCs and rosettes have been demonstrated in several autopsy studies. Jaundice is probably because of oedema of the head of the pancreas which compressed the intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct. No correlation between the infestation index and the occurrence of pancreatitis has been established.\n\n【8】Encouraging results with successful outcome were seen in patients with acute pancreatitis in previous study and in present patient leads to early diagnosis of pancreatitis in P. falciparum positive cases and management in early stage so as to prevent the life-threatening complication of acute pancreatitis. Incidence of Acute pancreatitis is much higher than that being reported because of failure to report the patient presenting with acute abdomen in malaria patient. In tropical countries it is of utmost importance to look for signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis in a patient presenting with pain abdomen in P. falciparum positive cases. So， a conclusion is drawn from this case and earlier cases that as falciparum malaria is common in tropical countries and it can present as pain abdomen with acute pancreatitis so routine serology testing is done to rule out the diagnosis to prevent dreaded complications and to decrease the mortality and mortality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The authors present two patients， one with true one and a half syndrome caused by a CVA and another with pseudo one and a half syndrome caused by myasthenia gravis. Clinical presentation of these syndromes can be similar with minute differences appreciated on physical exam； however， the clinical relevance is quite large as the management is entirely different.\n\n【2】Abbre viations\n\n【3】INO： Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia； MLF： Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus； PPRF： Para Median Pontine Reticular Formation； CT： Computed Tomography； MRI： Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】“One and a half syndrome\" was originally described in 1967 as conjugate gaze palsy with a contralateral Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia (INO) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The syndrome is typically due to a single unilateral lesion of the Paramedian Pontine Reticular Formation (PPRF) or the abducens nucleus， and the adjacent Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus (MLF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. Damage to the former manifests as the ipsilateral conjugate gaze palsy. Damage to the latter interrupts the internuclear fibers crossing midline to the contralateral medial rectus resulting in contralateral adduction failure on opposite gaze 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The side of the INO refers to the direction in which the previous adductor palsy manifests and is contralateral to the gaze palsy. The affected adductor muscle in the INO is able to adduct on convergence as this action bypasses the MLF. In addition， the unaffected abducting eye in an INO， during gaze in the direction of the INO， will exhibit nystagmus in the opposite direction of the INO通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4\\]</u>. Damage to these areas is most commonlyseen in strokes or multiple sclerosis. However， other etiologies have been described including traumatic and malignant causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. We report a case of“one and a half syndromeand juxtapose it to a case with nearly identical findings that have been coined “pseudo one and a half syndrome\".\n\n【6】The Case of One and a Half Syndrome\n\nA 53-year-old man with a past history of diabetes mellitus， hypertension， and hyperlipidemia presented to the Emergency Department complaining ofworsening diplopia， headache，dysarthria， nausea and left sided weakness. These symptoms had waxed and waned the prior evening of admission but the patient delayed seeking care. Blood pressure was elevated at 184/107 mmHg. Stroke was suspected but tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) was not administered as the patient presented outside of the required time window 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Computed Tomography (CT) of the head without contrast showed no acute intracranial disease. CT angiography of the brain showed various segments of moderate to severe stenosis in the anterior circulation but unremarkable vertebral and basilar arteries. Detailed neurological examination revealed right sided facial droop， left arm， leg weakness， left dysmetria and dysarthria. Ophthalmologic examination revealed full elevation and depression of both eyes， right gaze palsy (complete restriction of abduction in the right eye and adduction of the left eye)， full abduction in the left eye， inability to adduct the right eye on left gaze， but intact adduction of right eye on convergence. There was right nystagmus of the left eye on left gaze. MRI revealed a right parapontine infarct extending from the ventral pons (basis pontis) to the dorsal pons (pontine tegmentum) just anterior to the fourth ventricle . The MLF and abducens nuclei rest in the dorsal pontine area and a true “one and a half syndrome”was diagnosed. Cardiac work up was unremarkable and patient was discharged to rehabilitation with medical|删除段之间换行|management where the left INO began to resolve but the right gaze palsy remained unchanged after one week.\n\n【8】The Case ofPseudo One and a HalfSyndrome\n\n【9】A 48-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department complaining of right eye ptosis and diplopia for two weeks. The symptoms were associated with numbness and weakness in the first digit of the upper extremity bilaterally and weakness on raising both upper extremities beyond 90 degrees. These symptoms began nearly simultaneously， had no alleviating factors， and were exacerbated as the day progressed. Physical exam revealed left gaze palsy and left adductor palsy on right gaze. The left eye was unable to adduct on conversion. The right eye was able to abduct on right gaze and there was mild left nystagmus. It was believed that the patient had a lesion affecting the left abducens nucleus (due to the left gaze palsy) and right MLF (manifesting with a right INO) in spite of the inability for the left eye to adduct on conversion. CT imaging of the head was significant for encephalomalacia in the right frontal anterior lobe superiorly. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed chronic microvascular ischemic changes but no acute infarct. Diagnoses of stroke or multiple sclerosis were ruled out. Based on the generalized symptoms and fatigability， myasthenia gravis was considered and serology was examined. CT imaging of the chest revealed an equivocal 0.7 cm ×0.8 cm x0.7 cm ill-defined mass in the thymus that suggested a thymoma. Atrial of pyridostigmine 2 mg was initiated and the patient's diplopia and ptosis improved dramatically. Continued improvement was seen upon initiating a regimen of pyridostigmine 60 mg every eight hours. Serology showed was negative for acetylcholine receptor blocking (<15%) but acetylcholine receptor binding antibody level of 13.95 nmol/L (normal range<0.4 nmol/L). The patient successfully underwent an operative thymectomy. Pathology revealed no thymoma and only hyperplasia. The ocular symptoms remained during the post-operative period. This was expected as remission rates with surgery in the first year are approximately 20%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\nMyasthenia gravis is a disease of the neuromuscular junction where antibodies either directly bind to and destroy， or adversely affect receptors in the post synaptic junction interfering with neuromuscular transmission. The result is weakness or paralysis of the affected muscles. Ptosis and diplopia are common symptoms as involvement of the extra-ocular muscles is found in approximately90% of patients either as a presentingsymptom or secondary symptom通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. 20% to 50% of myasthenia gravis patients manifest with only ocular symptoms of ptosis or diplopia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The propensity to affect the extra-ocular muscles is multifactorial. Reduced post synaptic folding in extra-ocular muscles may result in greater susceptibility to receptor|删除段之间换行|destruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Higher firing frequencies of extra-ocular motor units and their unique histology may also contribute. The nature of diplopia also makes it the most conspicuous 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Pupil constriction is mediated through muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and is not affected by myasthenia which affects the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.\n\n【11】Despite the near ubiquity of ocular findings in myasthenia gravis， no clear clinical pattern has yet to be described. Past reports reveal myasthenia can present as apparent singular cranial nerve palsy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia (INO) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> or conjugate gaze palsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Levator palpebrae， medial recti and superior recti are traditionally thought to be the extraocular muscles most commonly affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Subsequent studies suggested ptosis or ophthalmoplegia were present in 80% of myasthenic confirming the frequency of ocular findings. However， the ocular elevators； superior rectus and inferior oblique， were the most commonly affected， followed by the lateral and medical rectus. The high incidence of elevator involvement may have been artificially inflated by the high incidence of baseline up-gaze palsy found in the elderly population. Isolated extra-ocular muscle weakness was found in only 15.4% of the cases. Bilateral extra-ocular muscle involvement was very common (72%) as well as combined vertical and horizontal involvement (59%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Recent study suggested inferior oblique involvement was found in almost 2/3of the cases and lateral rectus in almost 1/3 of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Our case represents the wide spectrum of eye findings from ocular myasthenia gravis that can be easily be mistaken as a central nervous system issue. We describe a case of a true “one and a half syndrome”of an ischemic etiology in order to introduce a case of “pseudo one and a half syndrome\" caused by myasthenia gravis. The apparent INO found in a patient with myasthenia gravis has been termed a“pseudo-INO”. Instead of an abducens/PPR nuclear and MLF lesion， there was a neuromuscular junction blockade pattern that mimicked the pattern of weakness in a true “one and a half syndrome. The presence of nystagmus in both cases was indicative of an expected central compensatory response to ophthalmoplegia regardless of the underlying etiology of the ophthalmoplegia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The clinical symptom differentiating between the two diagnoses was the presence or absence of adduction of the affected medial rectus on conversion as this was found only in the true “one and a halfsyndrome.\n\n【14】Ocular syndromes can be difficult to assess； however， one must be keenly aware of the symptomatology as well as common causes. It has been established that when presented with gaze palsies and internuclear ophthalmoplegia， as we have described， an ischemic process such as a stroke or multiple sclerosis should be the primary differential diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However， when common causes have been properly excluded， further studies should be administered and symptom constellations should guide the diagnostic algorithm.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In human study， normal or hypercholesterolemic subjects administered two capsules/d of NS-7 or NS-6(4-weeks) showed decrease in serum CRP， NO， y-GT， total cholesterol， LDL-cholesterol， and triglycerides levels in normal as compared to hypercholesterolemic subjects (12% to 39%). In second study， hypercholesterolemic subjects were given increasing doses of 6-tocotrienol (125 mg， 250 mg， 500 mg， and 750 mg/day) plus AHA Step-1diet (4-weeks). The most effective dose oftocotrienols (250 mg/day) may be used to lower serum NO(40%)， CRP(40%)， MDA (34%)， y-GT (22 %)， and inflammatory cytokines IL-1a， IL-12， IFN-y by15% to 17%， and increase TAS levels by 22%.\n\n【2】Keywords： Tocotrienols； a-tocopherol； Resveratrol； Vitamin D3； Quercetin； Dexamethasone； HEK293T cells； Chickens； Mice； Dog； Humans； Lipid metabolism； Inflammatory biomarkers\n\n【3】Abbreviations\n\n【4】T2DM： Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus； CRP： C-Reactive Protein； y-GT： y-Glutamyltransferase； LPS： Lipopolysaccharide； TNF-a： Tumor Necrosis Factor-a， NO： Nitric Oxide； NF-KB： Nuclear Factor-kappaB， IkB： Interferon kappaB， iNOS： Inducible Nitric Oxide； IL-4： Interleukin-4； IL-6：Interleukin-6\n\n【5】Introduction\n\nMy journey of studying tocotrienols started thirty years ago， when I first reported the isolation and biological function of a-tocotrienol as a hypocholesterolemia agent from barley in 1986 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This was acknowledged by late Byron J Richards in his article of\"Tocotrienols： Twenty Years of Dazzling Cardiovascular and Cancer Research in 2014， the first recognition of tocotrienols as a regulator of cholesterol occurred in a 1986 study in which a-tocotrienol was isolated from barley and fed to chickens. a-Tocotrienol reduced the rate of synthesis of cholesterol by the liver， in turn reducing total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. In April 1991， the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition published an animal and two human studies， triggering an explosion in scientific interest in tocotrienols， which continues to this day通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-5\\]</u>”. This fact was further supported earlier by Dr. Barry Tan in his review article in Whole Foods 通用删除7(英):<u>(2012)</u> of\"Tocotrienols： Emerging Science and innovation of vitamin E Part 4： A Review of Groundbreaking Tocotrienol Research 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>”， and Tan et al. have published two books under the title “Tocotrienols vitamin E beyond tocopherols\"， in which they have reported most of outstanding results of several world investigators on the biological properties|删除段之间换行|of tocotrienols 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Mr. late Byron J Richards has summarized some of the results on tocotrienols published from my laboratory during1990-2010 in his above-mentioned article 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\nLater， we reported the isolation of four isomers (a-，B-， y-，8-)-tocotrienols and four isomers of tocopherols (a-， B-， y-， 8-) from|删除段之间换行|rice bran with hypercholesterolemic， antioxidant， and antitumor properties as shown in  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The highest biological and pharmacological activity was found with 8-tocotrienol followed by y-tocotrienol， a-tocotrienol， and B-tocotrienol (which does not have any activity) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.

Recently， two other comprehensive reviews on the several biological activities of tocotrienols as hypocholesterolemic， anti-inflammatory， anticancer， antioxidant， neuroprotective， skin protection benefits， bone health and longevity have been published by Wong et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， and Kanchi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. These articles also cover the beneficial properties of different isomers of tocotrienol treatment along with possible mechanisms， signaling pathways in breast， prostate， pancreas， rectal cancers in cell lines and humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>. The present review describes our published results in vitro and in vivo studies on the impact of tocotrienols and other natural products on inflammation， cardiovascular， cancer， hepatitis C diseases， type 2 diabetes and pharmacokinetics using several cell lines， experimental animal models and human subjects from 2011 to present day. Most of the information described here is based on our published papers during last decade 通用删除7(英):<u>(2011-2021)</u>.\n\nAll human studies were double-blind， randomized， placebo-controlled trial (RCT). A non-probability convenience sampling technique was used. The protocol of each human study was registered with WHO regional office in Asia (World Health Organization Sri Lanka Clinical Trial Registry， Sri Lanka Center； srilanactr@gmail. com， after ethical approval by the Institutional Review Board of Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP)， Rawalpindi， Pakistan.

The studies were carried out according to the guidelines provided by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA，2003) at (AFIP)， Rawalpindi， and National University of Medical Sciences， Rawalpindi， Pakistan. All participants of human studies have signed an informed consent form before start of the study. All papers were published in refereed journals.\n\nAnti-Inflammatory and Hypocholesterolemic Properties of TocotrienolsandOther Compounds in Various Experimental Models|删除段之间换行|As mentioned earlier， inflammation has been implicated in cardiovascular disease， and the important role of proteasome in the development of inflammation and other macrophage functions has been demonstrated by us 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14-16\\]</u>. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was also used as a prototype for inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Tocotrienols are potent hypocholesterolemic agents that inhibit B-hydroxy-B-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity， which is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Our results have demonstrated the impact of various tocotrienols 通用删除1(英):<u>(a- y-，or 8-tocotrienol； Figure 1)</u> treatments inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of 20S rabbit muscle proteasome (>50%) in murine RAW 264.7 cells and BALB/c mice. Furthermore， chymotrypsin-like， trypsin-like， post-glutamase activities were decreased >40% with low concentrations(<80 uM) and increased gradually (80 uM to 640 pM) in RAW 264.7cells and BALB/c mice  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Moreover， tocotrienols showed 9% to 33% inhibition in TNF-a secretion in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells . Serum levels of TNF-a with LPS-induced secretion were reduced (20% to 48%) by tocotrienols with the doses of 1 and 10 ug/kg in mice ， and a corresponding rise was observed in serum levels of corticosterone (19% to 41%) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (81% to 145%) . The maximum inhibition was observed with 6-tocotrienol (10.0 ug/kg)\n\n【11】通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Thelow concentrations of6-tocotrienols (<20uM) blocked LPS-induced gene expression of TNF-a， IL-1B，IL-6 and iNOS (>40%)， and increases with higher concentrations (40 uM) in peritoneal macrophages prepared from BALB/c mice compared to controlgroup 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. These results represent a novel approach of proteasome modulators， which may lead to the development of new dietary supplements for cardiovascular and other human diseases based on inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\nOur results on evaluation of 8-tocotrienol and quercetin on inflammatory markers andlipid parameters was reported in Chickens. Itis wellknown that inflammatoryresponses to a wide varietyofstimuli are largely attributable to up-regulation of the pro-inflammatory transcription nuclear factor kappaB (NF-KB). Specifically， Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) up-regulate the pro-inflammatory NF-KB transcription factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The increased transport of NF-KB to the cell nucleus enhances expression of numerous genes encoding proteins that contribute to the inflammatory process， including inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS)， Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)， Tumor Necrosis Factors (TNF-a， TNF-B)， Interleukins (IL-1，IL-6)， chemokines (IL-8， MCP1， and MIP1a)， Activator Protein-1(AP-1) and adhesion factors (ICAM， and VCAM). Several of the proteins encoded by genes that are up-regulated by NF-kB are also potent NF-kB activators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. A series of in vitro tests confirmed the strong anti-inflammatory activities of known inhibitors of NF-KB activation(8-tocotrienol， quercetin， riboflavin， 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> Corey lactone， amiloride，|删除段之间换行|and dexamethasone； Figure 4 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>). As it was demonstrated that6-Tocotrienol suppresses B-Hydroxy-B-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity， and concomitantly lowers serum total and LDL cholesterol levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The results of above compounds were reported in an avian model anticipating that a dietary additive combining 6-tocotrienol with quercetin， riboflavin，通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> Corey lactone， amiloride， or dexamethasone would yield greater reductions in serum levels of total cholesterol，LDL-cholesterol，and inflammatory markers (Tumor Necrosis Factor-a\\[TNF-a\\]，and Nitric Oxide \\[NO\\])，than that attained with the individual compounds 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\nIn these series of experiments， the control diet was supplemented individually with compounds mentioned above  and fed to chickens for 4-weeks， the riboflavin， 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> Corey lactone， 6-tocotrienol， and quercetin produced small reductions in body weight gains as compared to control. Whereas dexamethasone significantly and markedly reduced weight gain (>75%) compared to control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The serum levels of TNF-a and NO were decreased 61% to 84% and14% to 67%， respectively in chickens fed diets supplemented with8-tocotrienol， quercetin， riboflavin， 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> Corey lactone， amiloride， or dexamethasoneas compared to controls . Furthermore， significant decrease in the levels of serum total and LDL-cholesterol was observed with 6-tocotrienol， quercetin， riboflavin and 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> Corey lactone 通用删除1(英):<u>(13% to 57%； Figure 5C，5D)</u>， and these levels were 2-fold higher in dexamethasone treated chickens as compared to controls通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.

Furthermore， these naturallyoccurring proteasome inhibitors appear to be relatively potent inhibitors of multiple proteasome subunits in inflammatory proteasomes. Consequently， these agents could potentially suppress the production of inflammatory mediators in ageing humans， thereby decreasing the risk of developing a variety of age-related diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【54】recent years， the concept that age-associated diseases such as cardiovascular， cancer， dementia might be attributable， in part， to dysregulated inflammatory responses has been the subjects of extensive discussion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Changes in immune function believed to contribute to a variety of age-related diseases， which have been associated with increased production of Nitric Oxide(NO). It was recently reported that dexamethasone， mevinolin， quercetin， 6-tocotrienol， and riboflavin ； can inhibit Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production in vitro in RAW264.7 cells and in thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages derived from four strains of mice (C57BL/6，BALB/c，LMP7/MECL-1' and PPAR-a' knockout mice) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. The potential results of the effects of diet supplementation with naturally occurring compounds(6-tocotrienol and quercetin) on LPS-stimulated production of NO， TNF-a， and other pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the ageing process have been reported. Young (4-week-old) and senescent mice(42-week-old) were fed control diet with or without quercetin (100ppm)，8-tocotrienol (100 ppm)， or dexamethasone (10ppm； included as positive control for suppression of inflammation) for 4-weeks. The thiogl ycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were collected， stimulated with LPS， LPS plus Interferon-B(IFN-B)，or LPS plus Interferon-y (IFN-y)， and inflammatory responses assessed as measured by production of NO and TNF-a， mRNA down-regulation for TNF-a， and iNOS genes， and microarray analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\nThe results of thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages prepared after four weeks offeeding ofthese mice，andthen challenged with LPS (10 ng or 100 ng) resulted in increases of 55% and 73%， respectively in the production of NO of 46-week-old compared to8-week-old mice fed control diet alone (respective control groups)， without affecting the secretion of TNF-a among these two groups通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. However， macrophages obtained after feeding with quercetin，|删除段之间换行|8-tocotrienol， and dexamethasone significantly inhibited (30% to60%) the LPS-stimulated NO production， compared to respective control groups . There was a 2-fold increase in the production of NO， when LPS-stimulated macrophages of quercetin，8-tocotrienol， or dexamethasone were also treated with IFN-B or IFN-y compared to respective control groups. It has been also demonstrated that NO levels and iNOS mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in LPS-stimulated macrophages from senescent(0.69 vs. 0.41)， compared to young mice. In contrast， age did not appear to impact levels of TNF-a protein or mRNA expression levels(0.38 vs. 0.35) in LPS-stimulated macrophages  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. These results have demonstrated that quercetin and 8-tocotrienols inhibit the LPS-induced NO production in vivo. The microarray RNAs analyses， followed by pathway analyses indicated that quercetin or8-tocotrienol inhibit several LPS-induced gene expressions of several ageing and pro-inflammatory genes (IL-1B， IL-1a， IL-6， TNF-a， IL-12， iNOS， VCAM1， ICAM1， COX2， IL-1RA， TRAF1 and CD40) as shown in Table 3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. The NF-kB pathway regulates the production of NO and inhibits the pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in normal and ageing process. The ex vivo results confirmed the earlier in vitro findings. These results of inhibition of NO production by quercetin and 8-tocotrienol may be of clinical significance treating several inflammatory diseases， including ageing process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【56】It was reported earlier that altered immune function during ageing results in increased production of Nitric Oxide (NO) and other inflammatory mediators. Recently， it was also reported that NO production was inhibited by naturally occurring quercetin，6-tocotrienol， and riboflavin in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells， and thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice . In our continuous effort to find more potent， non-toxic， commercially available， naturally occurring compounds that suppress inflammation， the results of study have reported the inhibition of NF-KB activation and NO， TNF-a， IL-6， IL-1B， and iNOS gene expression by trans-resveratrol， trans-pterostilbene， morin hydrate， and nicotinic acid in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells and thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.\n\n【57】TheseIresults havreealso demonstrated that resveratrol， pterostilbene， and morin hydrate caused significant inhibition (>70%\n\n【58】to 90%) in the activities of chymotrypsin-like， trypsin-like， and post-acidic (post-glutamase) proteasome sites in RAW 264.7 cells at a dose of only 20 uM  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. These compounds inhibited the production of NO by RAW-264.7 cells stimulated with LPS alone (>40%)， or LPS + Interferon-y (IFN-y；>60%.

Moreover， these compounds also significantly suppressed LPS-induced gene expression of TNF-a， IL-1B， IL-6，and iNOS genes in RAW 264.7 cells， and in thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.\n\n【59】These results have demonstrated that resveratrolandpterostilbene are particularly potent compounds that suppress expression of genes， and production of inflammatory products in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells， and macrophages from C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Resveratrol and pterostilbene which are present in grapes，blueberries， and red wine， have been implicated as contributing factors to the lower incidence of cardiovascular disease in the French population， despite their relatively high dietary fat intake. Consequently， it appears likely that the beneficial nutritional effects of resveratrol and pterostilbene are due at least in part， to their ability to inhibit NF-B activation by the proteasome inhibitors， thereby suppressing activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS genes， resulting in decreased production of TNF-a， IL-1B， IL-6， and NO levels， in response to inflammatory stimuli.

Additionally， all the treatments except with dexamethasone resulted in lower serum total cholesterol，LDL-cholesterol， and triglycerides levels. The mechanism for this inhibition appears to be decreased proteolytic degradation of P-IB protein due to the inhibition of proteasome， resulting in decreased translocation of activated NF-kB to the nucleus， and depressed transcription of gene expression of TNF-a， and iNOS. The impact of above compounds was increased on these parameters when combined with 8-tocotrienol.\n\n【80】Moreover， these results also indicated that intravenously administered tocotrien ols inhibited acute platelet-mediated thrombus formation， and collagen and ADP-induced platelet aggregation. The8-tocotrienol， riboflavin， and quercetin inhibit NO production in LPS-stimulated macrophages of all four strains of mice， and TNF-a secretion only in LPS-stimulated macrophages of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. Furthermore， these naturally occurring compounds are potent inhibitors of multiple subunits in the proteasomes.\n\n【81】Table 7： Effects of NS-5， resveratrol，quercetin， & 6-tocotrienol (Pre-dose vs Post-dose) on gene expression of messenger RNAs (RNAs) of normal choles-terolemic humans.\n\n|  |  |  | NS-5  | Resveratrol  | Quercetin  | o-Tocotrienol  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| #  | Genes1  | Pre-dose  | Post-dose  | Post-dose  | Post-dose  | Post-dose+  | Descriptions  |\n|  |  |  | %  | %  | %  | %  |  |\n|  | Cardiovascular：  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1  | Resistin  | 100  | 48±3.22\\\\  | 76±1.12\\\\  | 57±1.35\\\\  | 73±2.81\\w  | Pathogenesis of obesity- mediated insulin  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | resistance and type 2 diabetesmellitus  |\n| 2  | IL-2  | 100  | 53±2.07\\\\  | 88±2.48\\  | 64±2.59\\\\  | 72±2.88\\\\  | Interleukin-2  |\n| 3  | IL-6  | 100  | 56±3.06\\  | 71±0.68\\\\  | 85±0.91w\\  | 68±2.87\\  | Interleukin-6  |\n| 4  | IL-8  | 100  | 68±1.22\\\\  | 94±2.90\\  | 95±0.76\\  | 95±0.21\\  | Interleukin-8  |\n| 5  | IL-12  | 100  | 85±1.93\\\\  | 78±1.51ww  | 70±2.12  | 81±0.89\\\\  | Interleukin-12  |\n| 6  | 1L-17a  | 100  | 66±3.44\\\\  | 83±1.56\\\\  | 83±0.46\\\\  | 85±1.62\\\\  | Insulin-enhances nitric oxide， &NF-KB.  |\n| 7  | IL-18  | 100  | 45±3.08\\\\  | 59±1.30\\\\  | 85±1.34\\\\  | 79±3.00\\\\  | Interleukin-18  |\n| 8  | COX-2  | 100  | 41±2.78\\\\  | 73±1.44\\\\  | 55±1.36\\\\  | 65±1.62\\\\  | Cyclooxygenase-2  |\n| 9  | GAPDH  | 100  | 29±2.59\\\\  | 81±1.36\\\\  | 73±0.88\\\\  | 78±2.96\\\\  | Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  |\n| 10  | IP-10  | 100  | 21±2.15\\\\  | 88±1.97\\  | 74±1.74\\\\  | 72±0.94\\\\  | Interferon-Inducible Protein-10  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Inflamm ation：  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 11  | TNF-0  | 100  | 48±2.30\\\\  | 63±1.31\\\\  | 65±2.44\\\\  | 83±2.08\\\\  | Tumor Necrosis Factor-a  |\n| 12  | INF-V  | 100  | 59±2.36\\\\  | 67±1.10\\\\  | 71±1.31ww  | 75±1.60\\\\  | Interferon-v  |\n| 13  | MIP-1a  | 100  | 57±3.94\\\\  | 87±1.13\\  | 81±3.20\\\\  | 74±2.24\\\\  | Macrophage InflammatoryProtein-1a  |\n| 14  | NOS-2  | 100  | 56±0.41\\w  | 57±1.94\\\\  | 67±1.72\\\\  | 67±2.11\\w  | Nitric oxide synthase-2  |\n| 15  | VCAM-1  | 100  | 70±2.01\\W  | 90±3.76\\  | 72±2.93\\\\  | 84±0.70\\\\  | Vascular cell adhesion molecule  |\n| 16  | MCP-1  | 100  | 69±4.99\\\\  | 83±2.83\\\\  | 77±2.17\\\\  | 76±2.02\\\\  | Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Cancer：  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 17  | IGF-1  | 100  | 68±3.56\\\\  | 74±2.33\\\\  | 70±2.99\\\\  | 71±2.93\\\\  | Insulin-like Growth Factor-1  |\n| 18  | P-53  | 100  | 217±4.87\\\\  | 113±1.19\\  | 120±1.96\\\\  | 239±8.66\\\\  | P-53 tumor suppressor protein  |\n| 19  | FAS-1  | 100  | 157±3.72\\\\  | 119±2.78\\\\  | 151±3.07\\\\  | 129±1.94\\\\  | Fatty acid synthetase-1  |\n| 20  | VEGF  | 100  | 71±2.51\\\\  | 73±1.78\\\\  | 83±0.85\\\\  | 90±0.47\\  | Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor  |\n| 21  | CCND-1  | 100  | 40±5.33\\\\  | 71±6.04\\\\  | 54±1.91\\\\  | 67±3.71\\\\  | Cyclin D-1  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| IV  | Diabetes：  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 22  | PAI-1  | 100  | 26±1.21\\\\  | 81±0.48\\\\  | 71±4.79\\\\  | 71±2.37\\\\  | Plasmenogen Activator Inhibitor-1  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| V  | Aging：  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 23  | IL-1a  | 100  | 70±1.67\\\\  | 84±1.52\\  | 84±2.09\\  | 80±0.76\\\\  | Interleukin-1a  |\n| 24  | IL-10  | 100  | 76±1.44\\\\  | 96±1.58\\  | 88±4.12\\  | 69±1.42\\\\  | Interleukin-10  |\n\n【83】\\-wwValues in a row sharing a common asterisk are significantly different at \\p<0.001； \\\\P<0.001.\n\n【84】\"The effect of d-tocotrienal on resistin， IL-2， IL-6， IL-8， IL-10， IL-12， TNF-a & IFN-y has been reported (AAQ et al.

It is also useful in the localization of tremor. The triangle consists of the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum， the red nucleus in the midbrain and the inferior olivary nucleus in the medulla. The central tegmental tract connects the red nucleus with the ipsilateral inferior olivary nucleus， while the superior cerebellar peduncle connects the dentate nucleus with the contralateral red nucleus. The contralateral dentate nucleus and inferior olivary nucleus are connected via the inferior cerebellar peduncle. Any focal lesions iinvolvingtheedentato-rubro-olivary pathway (superior cerebelar peduncle， dentate nucleus or central tegmental tract) result in degeneration of the inferior olivary nucleus and pseudohypertrophy of the inferior olive. This process is called“Hypertrophic Olivary Degeneration\"(HOD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Here we present a unique case ofa unilateral hemorrhage causing bilateral tremor and HOD with interesting imaging findings.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 42-year-old man developed a left sided 2-3 Hz postural tremor that worsened with intention one year after a right midbrain hemorrhage from a cavernous malformation. He was also dysarthric， diplopic with bilateral oculomotor nerve palsy， and hemiparetic on the left side with hemiparesthesia， but he was able to walk with a hemi-walker using his right arm. Thirteen years later， he developed a right-sided intentionaltremor after a rebleedfrom the same right midbrain cavernous malformation . He now had bilateral arm tremorswith truncal ataxia， lower limb ataxia， bilateral dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia. He becamewheelchair-bound and developed autonomic dysfunction (syncope， central sleep apnea， gastroparesis， urinary incontinence). The tremorswerecoarse，slightly irregular， largeamplitude，andl most prominent proximally with a slow frequency of 2-3Hz. The tremors were present with posture and increased with intentional movements. Interestingly， there were no rest tremors in either arm. There was no ocular or palatal myoclonus.Thetremors were refractory to medications (propranolol，primidone， clonazepam，and levodopa). MRI brain， at the time of the second hemorrhage， revealed a right midbrain tegmental lesion affecting the right cerebellar peduncle， the right substantia nigra， and the right red nucleus.\n\n【7】The first hemorrhage into the right red nucleus/midbrain area caused a contralateral left-sided tremor. This hemorrhage， which disrupted the central tegmental tract， illustrates the contralateral GMT 通用删除1(英):<u>(green triangle， Figure 1)</u>. The second hemorrhageextended the damage into the right superior cerebellar peduncle resulting in a right-sided tremor， illustrating the involvement of a second GMT\n\nB： FLAIR sequence showing cavernous malformation of the right midbrain tegmentum， involving the red nucleus and substantia nigra. C： Bilateral hypertrophic olivary degeneration is shown on this T2 axial|删除段之间换行|section through the medulla.

T2-weighted MRI one year after the second hemorrhage showed bilateral hypertrophy of the inferior olivary nucleus suggesting that bilateral pathways of GMT were involved .\n\n【11】The involvement of the right substantia nigra in the second hemorrhage prompted a dopamine transporter SPECT (DAT) scan， which revealed a complete loss of dopamine uptake in the right striatum . A trial oflevodopa resulted in no improvement in the left-sided tremor. Remarkably， the patient had no rest tremor that is classic of rubral tremor or clinical signs of Parkinson disease， despite involvement of the substantia nigra and absence of dopamine uptake in the right striatum.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\nHolmes tremor is a low frequency rest tremor (3-4Hz) that|删除段之间换行|worsens with posture and action. It was first described in 1904 by Gordon Holmes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Holmes tremor is also known as rubral，midbrain or thalamic tremor. The tremor on average develops about 2 months after a CNS insult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Any GMT lesion can result in HOD， which can clinically manifest as Holmes tremor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Midbrain and thalamic vascular lesions areleading causes of Holmes tremor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Our patient did not develop palatal myoclonus， which is commonly associated with HOD. Most patients who have palatal myoclonus from a brainstem injury also have HOD， but not all patients with HOD develop palatal myoclonus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The GMT contains part of the dentato-rubro thalamic tract(DRTT). The DRTT coordinates the initiation， planning and time of movements. The DRTT originates from the dentate nucleus in the cerebellum， ascends up the superior cerebellar peduncle， decussates to the contralateral red nucleus and ends in the ventrolateral nucleus(VL) of the thalamus. A lesion of the DRTT gives rise to tremors， ataxia and dystonia. Our patient with disruption to the DRTT has bilateral postural and intentional tremor with ataxia. The VL in the Hirai system corresponds to the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) in the Hassler system. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the VIM thalamus has been reported to alleviate Holmes tremor通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. VIM DBS for our patient was not advised by the DBS committee due to new symptoms of autonomic dysfunction and dysphagia in this patient. It is common to have autonomic involvement with brainstem lesions due to the interruption off thedorsal longitudinal fasciculus and the medial forebrain bundle， which are the output and input， respectively， to the hypothalamus. These two tracts run the length of the brainstem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\nThe midbrain hemorrhage extends from the red nucleus to involve the right substantia nigra causing interruption to the nigrostriatal pathway. The dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway project from the substantia nigra pars compacta to the striatum. Thus， a right midbrain lesion to the nigrostriatal pathway in this patient resulted in a unilateral loss of dopamine in the right striatum as confirmed by the DAT scan . The implication of the loss of dopamine is yet to be understood. It is thought that|删除段之间换行|perhaps the loss of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system (i.e. due to the involvement of the substantial nigra) may account for the rest tremor component of Holmes tremor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However， our patient did not have a rest tremor， despite having absent dopamine uptake on the DAT scan. He did have a low frequency postural and action tremor， suggestive of a Holmes tremor. Levodopa has been reported to provide benefit in some cases where there is a loss of dopamine通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-12\\]</u>； however， this was not the case in our patient. The right sided loss of dopamine did not produce left sided Parkinsonian symptoms， such as left sided rest tremor， rigidity or bradykinesia in our patient.\n\n【18】Hypertrophic degeneration of olivary complex (HOD) can be differentiated into three types. The first type is a lesion involving the central tegmental tract， resulting in ipsilateral degeneration of the olive. The second type is a lesion involving the superior cerebellar peduncle or dentate nucleus causing contralateral degeneration of the olive. The third type is bilateral degeneration that occurs with involvement of both pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-14\\]</u>. In our patient， T2-weighted MRI one vear after the second hemorrhage showed bilateral hypertrophy of the inferior olivary nucleus suggesting that bilateral pathways of the Mollarets triangle were involved .The concept of two overlapping GMTs offers an explanationof how a unilateral midbrain lesion can cause bilateral tremors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We here report a case of giant liver tumor of hemangioblastoma. The patient showed no signs of Von Hippel-Lindau disease.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】Clinical data\n\n【6】A male patient aged 43 was admitted to the hospital with main complain of discovery of liver space-occupying lesion. In December of 2021， the patient visited the clinic for “hydronephrosis with renal and ureteral stone\". Abdominal computer tomography  revealed a giant space-occupying lesion in the right lobe of liver with a dimension of 20.7 cm×18.7 cm × 11.9 cm. The liver was enlarged and the left margin pushed to the left end of abdomen. The patient was with no complaining of fatigue， poor appetite， abdominal distention or pain. Laboratory investigation after admission revealed no abnormality of blood routine， urine routine， stool routine， coagulation function， CRP， renal function， electrolytes， and the triple liver cancer biomarkers AFP， AFP-L3， and PIVAKII. Digital radiography showed no special findings of heart， lungs and diaphragm. Head and brain MRI revealed no abnormality of brain. The radiologists considered a diagnosis and differentials of mesenchymal originated tumor， angiomyolipoma， solitary fibrous tumor， or hepatic hemangioma. Three days after admission， the right lobe of liver and gallbladder of the patient were dissected out under total anesthesia. The patient recovered smoothly and was discharged 10 days later.\n\n【7】Pathological findings\n\n【8】A giant tumor with very thin margin of liver tissue was seen measuring 20 cmx19cm×12cm. The tumor was solid， dark red， not encapsulated but well circumscribed. Microscopically， the tumor was composed of large amounts of compact capillaries and oval or fusiform eosinophilic or vacuolated stromal cells. The nuclei of stromal cells were small and compact， mitotic figures rarely found. Distended venules and hemorrhages were frequently seen. Hematopoietic foci  were also occasionally spotted. Immunohistochemical  investigation demonstrated that tumor cells were positively stained for vimentin， CD56， and TFE3. GFAP were spottily stained. CD163 and CD68 stain revealed abundant existence of histocytes distributed among the tumor cells. Endothelial cell markers CD34 and CD31 positively labeled large blood vessels but not capillaries and stromal cells. Negatively stained markers included CK， S100， HMB45， Melan A， stat6， NSE， RCC，Pax 8，and a-inhibin. Cell proliferation index Ki67 was about 10%.\n\n【9】Based on the morphological features and Immunohistochemical findings， a diagnosis of hemangioblastomaWasmadeafter excluding the differentials of hemangioma， solitary fibrous tumor， angiomyolipoma and metastasis of renal clear cell carcinoma.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】hemangioblastoma is a rare benign tumor that mostly occurs in the cerebellum，and about one fifth of the cases were in Von Hippel-Lindau patients， with mutations of the VHL gene. It also occurs in other parts of the central nervous system， but in much lower frequency. Outside the central nervous system， there were cases reported in the soft tissues and kidneys. We found only 2 cases of hepatic hemangioblastoma in the literature and both of them were associated with Von Hippel-Lindau diseases， and were much smaller.\n\n【12】Hemangioblastoma generally were very small due to the restriction of cerebellarlocation. But even outside the central neryous system， such as inside the kidney， the tumors were generally not large either. Our case is probably so far the largest one ever reported. Interestingly， with such a large tumor， the patient did not manifest any symptoms. The tumor did not destruct the normal liver tissue but rather enlarged it and pushed the left margin of the liver all the way to left end of the abdomen， indicating the benign nature of the tumor.\n\n【13】CD68.\n\n【14】But in other parts of the body， it could pose a serious challenge because the rarity of incidence. In the present case， the initial differentials were hemangioma， angiomyolipoma， solitary fibrous tumor， and metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The final diagnosis of hemangioblastoma was in fact the last one came to mind after excluding all the others. Although Immunohistochemistry is helpful in the diagnosis， there are no signature markers for the diagnosis of hemangioblastoma. It has been reported in most of the cases that S100， NSE and a-inhibin was positive， but not in the present case. On the other side， the positive staining of vimentin， CD56， TFE3， and spotty positivity of GFAP seen in this case has been reported in some studies and lays support for the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.

Indeed， in the literature， cases are described in anterior arthrodesis， but no case of post-cervical arthroplasty is described. The management of this type of complication is poorly described and not consensual. Surgeons are rarely confronted with this type of complication， especially since the working space is very limited and does not allow direct suturing.\n\n【2】Case Report： We present the case of a patient who underwent cervical arthroplasty complicated by a post-dural tear meningocele. The revision surgery consisted of a combination of closure of the breach with a fatty patch covered by a TachoSil patch， followed by reinsertion of a cervical prosthesis.\n\n【3】Conclusion： At the last follow-up，thepatient did not present any residual effects of the complication， and the mobility of the disc prosthesis was not altered by it. The use of TachoSil appears to be a satisfactory surgical option for the management of these complications.\n\n【4】Keywords： CerebrospinalFluid (CSF) leaked； Duraltear； Anterior cervical discectomy；TachoSil； Dural repair； Cervical arthroplasty\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】We present the case of a 48-year-old patient who underwent cervical disc hybrid surgery， arthroplastyand fusion， complicatedbya compressive anterior meningocele followinga peroperative dural breach. This patient presented a multilevel cervical spondylosis leading to myelopathy (C5-C6， C6-C7 and C7-T1)； benefited from a hybrid surgery， arthroplasties of the C5-C6 and C6-C7 levels(MOBI-C， Zimmer Biomet) and an arthrodesis of the C7-T1 level (ROI-C， Zimmer Biomet). The initial procedure was performed with the patient in the dorsal position under C-arm fluoroscopy and microscope. During the C5-C6 discectomy， it was noted that a small portion of the posterior longitudinal ligament was adherent to the dura on the right foramina. A lateralized punctiform dural tear is then visualized under the microscope with minimal flow. The placement of a 5 mm TachoSil sponge at the level of the tear allows drying up the flow immediately. The rest of the surgery was carried out without any complication. Initial post-operative course was simple. The patient was discharged from the department on the first day after surgery， with no postoperative headache and no cervical abnormality， no dysphonia. The patient was seen in consultation at fifteen-day post op because of the persistence of a \"clear water\" flow through a punctiform orifice， laterally to the skin incision without any clinical or biological signs. He was seen again on 26h day with persistent clinical discharge. A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed and a 10 cm×7 cm×4cm pre-vertebral fluid collections was identified， with leftward discharge of the esophageal tract without any abnormality of the medullary cord. No dysphagia or dysphonia was observed but the leakage was evident. Despite neurological post op improvement from myelopathy signs， it was decided rehospitalization urgently for 2D surgery with evacuation of the collection， bacteriological sampling and closure of the dural tear at the origin of the meningocele fistulizing to the skin .\n\n【7】Diagnostic Imaging\n\n【8】The diagnosis was therefore made on a cervical MRI with a 10 cm x7 cm × 4 cm image of prevertebral fluid collection， without cord abnormality， with a suspicious hypersignal opposite the right foraminal C5-C6 consistent with the intraoperative tear. Material-related artifacts did not allow accurate visualization of the dural disruption .\n\n【9】Historical Review. Diagnosis and Management\n\nIn the literature， the incidence of cerebrospinal fluid leakage following anterior cervical spinal decompression surgery is in the range of 0.5% to3%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In the literature， male gender， revision surgery， and surgery for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament are risk factors for accidental durotomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. Most surgeons have very limited experience in the management of these anterior cervical spinal tears， because its rarity. In the cervical spine， the pressure of the CSF is low and one surgical option is to do anything to close these leaks except simply complete the operation and avoid using drainage. In our case， the prosthesis allows communication between the|删除段之间换行|neurological elements and the esophageal and tracheal prevertebral structures. No article in the literature describes the management of an anterior meningocele in the context of cervical arthroplasty. Over time many techniques have been used to treat anterior dural tears； gelatin foam， fibrin glue， fascia， fat， muscle graft and sometimes postoperative placement oflumbar shunt (drain)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，5-10\\]</u>. In 2019 the team of Gazzeri presented a study of 8 cases treated with a TachoSil patch with very good efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. TachoSil is a tissue sealant patch containing two layers， namely one collagenous layer， and a layer containing fibrinogen and human thrombin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. The sponge is manufactured from horse tendons. TachoSil reacts upon contact with blood， other body fluids or saline to form a clot that glues it to the tissue surface. Sealing is reached in a few minutes， and the sponge is absorbed by the body within several weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The use of TachoSil was a very satisfactory option for us， allowing us to avoid enlarging the bone window to perform a direct suture.\n\n【11】Procedure\n\nThe patient was reoperated on 27 day of his initial surgery， under general anesthesia， in strict dorsal decubitus position， under C-arm fluoroscopy and high magnification microscope. First， we made a skin opening opposite the incision of the first surgery. Sampling of liquid with a \"clear water\" appearance (200 ml) for systematic bacteriological analysis as usual. The sternocleidomastoid approach|删除段之间换行|is taken from the anterior aspect of the cervical spine between the aero-digestive axis and the jugulo-carotid bundle， following the plane of the meningocele. The C5-C6 prosthesis is approached with an opposite leak. Placement of a Caspar and TSI retractor to obtain the best possible exposure. Easy removal of the C5-C6prosthesis without bony complications. Under the microscope， we observe a dural breach lateralized on the right side of the dura mater. No more TachoSil seen at that place. A regular flow of CSF was observed through a tiny hole of a few millimeters. It was therefore decided to place fatty tissue at the level of the breach and then apply a new TachoSil patch to close the breach， which was difficult to suture given the limited space available . We waited for four minutes (minimum duration of effectiveness) and then performed Valsalva maneuvers which did not reveal leak anymore. Given the absence of leakage， it was decided to install a new total disc prosthesis (identical to the previous one). Closure without the use of a suction drain， as usual.\n\n【13】Outcome， Follow-Up\n\n【14】The patient was evaluated clinically and radiologically at 2 and6 months postoperatively and had no documented complications suggesting persistent leakage. In addition， tear and meningocele has not caused any complications of mechanical failure to the prosthesis for the moment .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Subsequently， mesenteric vasculitis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis in the legs completely recovered， and there was no recurrence .\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】The incidence of vasculitis in patients with AS is unusual. There have been five reported cases of cutaneous vasculitis and 1 case of retinal vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3，8，9\\]</u>. Severe cases of AS， such as mesenteric vasculitis， have not yet been reported. Vasculitis is usually idiopathic in nature. The known causes include infection， such as viral hepatitis， HIV， bacterial and fungal infections， or drugs， such as NSAIDs or antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Additionally， vasculitis in AS may occur due to a paradoxical response to TNF-a inhibitors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. Most TNF inhibitor-induced vasculitis occurs within a short period of time after administration and is often limited to cutaneous vasculitis or worsening of existing symptoms. In addition， in many cases， the symptoms are mild enough to improve without the use of steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Our case is a case of severe vasculitis and since TNF-a inhibitors have been used for a long time， it is not considered to be vasculitis caused by a drug， infection， or TNF-a inhibitor， which are known probable causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Recently， the incidence of vasculitis has been increasing worldwide owing to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12-14\\]</u>. SARS-CoV-2 invades endothelial cells and induces a hyper inflammatory response， which can cause vasculitis by depositing immune complexes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Since vaccines contain antigens of these infectious agents， these antigens can cause cross-reactivity and molecular mimicry， and adjuvants added to vaccines to enhance immunity can increase autoimmunity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16-18\\]</u>. Additionally， vasculitis can be induced by a mechanism that increases autoimmunity. The reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccination-induced vasculitis is often skin-localized cutaneous vasculitis. In a patient with Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases (RMDs)， one case of popular erythema and urticaria skin lesions was reported 10 days after AstraZeneca inoculation in a patient with psoriatic arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Severe vasculitis cases induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination reported to date are summarized in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>.

The gastrointestinal location is very rare， been the stomach the most affected organ； however Gastric schwannoma (GS) represents only 0% to 2% of all gastric tumors. Usually they have benign prognosis， but malignant transformation has been described. Symptoms are usually vague and depend on the localization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>.\n\n【13】In this case report we present a patient with and antral submucosal gastric tumor that received totallylaparoscopic resection.\n\n【14】Case Presentation\n\n【15】A 56-year-old woman， with hypertension and hypothyroidism. Clinical history of six months ofepigastric pain， without vomits， dysphagia， jaundice， fever or weight loss， no specific founding at physical examination. The upper endoscopy showed an anterior antral submucosal tumor of 5 cm， with no ulceration . The abdominopelvic CT scan showed an anterior antral submucosal exophytic solid tumor of 5.2 cmx4.8 cm，without celomic，lymphatic or visceral metastasis . With the diagnosis of an antral GIST， the patient underwent laparoscopic exploration and resection of the lesion.\n\n【16】A 15 mmHg pneumoperitoneum and 4 trocars (1 of 5 mm and 3 of 12 mm) were used. A 6cm exophytic gastric tumor was found in the same position describes by the endoscopy and CT. Dissection of the grater curvature was performed to access the lesser omentum and posterior wall of the stomach. After passing a 36F bogie throw the pylorus， a total resection of the tumor was performed with 2 staplers .\n\nThe patient had a good recovery from surgery， initiating oral intake at 24 h. After surgery and|删除段之间换行|was dismissed at the 3rdpostoperative day with no post-operative complications.\n\n【18】The histopathologic examination showed a 6.2 cm x5 cm gastric schwannoma， with 0-2/50 field mitotic count， non-necrosis， free margin， S100 highly positive， Actine： negative， Demin： negative， CD34 negative， CD 117： negative， COG1： negative， KI67： nuclear positive in 5% of cells . After discussion at the Oncology Committee， a surveillance conduct was decided. At 8 months follow up the patient had no signs of surgical or oncologic complication.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Submucosal gastrointestinaltumors have three different histological groups： GIST， myogenic (Leiomyomas OI leiomyosarcomas)， and neurogenic tumors (schwannomas， granular cell tumors and neurofibroma). In the neurogenic group 91% are schwannoma， and the most frequents locations are stomach (60% to70%) and colorectal. GS represent 5% of nonepithelial gastric tumors通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>.\n\nAs describe Bruneton et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and Mekras et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， the majority of the patients with GS are women， between the 6\" and 7h decade of life. Usually they are asymptomatic， but when they require surgery，42% to 88% has abdominal pain， 25% to 65% has gastrointestinal bleeding and 10% to 25% have weight loss. The localization is usually at the body (50%) or antrum (32%) and the size is less than 10 cm in 88% of cases， and less than 5 cm in 48% of them. In our case report， these demographic， clinical and anatomical characteristics are|删除段之间换行|present.\n\nEndoscopic and tomographic studies are the first line approach， but they cannot differentiate accurately between GIST， myogenic|删除段之间换行|and neurogenic tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. A second line of study is the Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) with guided biopsy， but the cost and availability should be consider， especially if the lesion is located at the gastric wall， which usually has in experience groups a comfortable surgical access and low morbi-mortality in case of resection. In our case report the preoperative diagnosis was a presumed GIST， principally because is the most frequent gastric submucosal mesenchymal tumor. Considering the symptoms and little additional benefit of EUS， we decided to perform a total resection ofthe tumor.\n\n【23】Surgical therapy is the cure in most cases without any other adjuvant therapy. The surgical approach depends on the tumor size， localization， surgeon experience and preference. The most important thing is to achieve negative margins， and to do so， resections could be from an economic enucleation and suture， to a partial or total gastrectomy. Because of the nature and frequency of this tumor， the literature available consist in Case Reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，6\\]</u>， Case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，7\\]</u>， Case-controls studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and Reviews 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5，7，8\\]</u>. Many of the reports doesn’t declare the surgical approach， some of them specified a laparoscopic one 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，9\\]</u>. As we mentioned before， in trained groups a laparoscopic approach with haemostatic sealant technology and staplers， are comfortable， short and safety procedures， that also contribute with all the benefit of minimally invasive surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【24】The pathologic examination is the key to differentiate between all subtypes of submucosal gastric tumors. Before the advances in immunohistochemical stain， the majority of this tumors were diagnosed as leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma， but now with the advent of c-Kit， DOG1 and CD34 which are usually positive in GIST， SMA and Desmin positive in Leiomyoma， S100 positive in Schwannoma the diagnosis.\n\n【25】After free margin surgery the prognosis is excellent， some argue that the risk of malignant transformation is theoretical， and that histology findings such as tumor size and mitotic rate have no prognostic significance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>， but since malignant schwannoma have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，11-14\\]</u>， and the follow-up in tumors larger than 10cm or with a mitotic rate>10/50 HPFs is limited，a clinical，endoscopic and tomographic surveillance should be consider according to each patients 7J.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】The GS can mimic GITS and should be consider in the differential diagnosis of submucosal gastric tumor. The treatment of choice is complete resection， and total laparoscopic resection of a GS can be achieved safely， with the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We present the case of a neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of the liver that mimicked Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS)， not previously described in the literature. Diagnosis can be difficult given the rarity and nonspecific presentation of hepatic NETs. Histology and immunohistochemistry remains the most definitive diagnostic modality， which can be limited in diffusely infiltrative NETs by poorly defined margins. In this case， initial biopsy failed to show NET cells and demonstrated venous obstruction as seen in BCS. Follow up hepatic venography revealed patent veins， inconsistent with BCS， and another diagnosis was sought. This case illustrates the importance of hepatic venography， the standard imaging technique for diagnosing BCS， and that a NET can mimic BCS.\n\nA 52-year-old male presented with four weeks of abdominal distension and pedal edema. Apart from a 75 pack-years of smoking， his medical history was unremarkable. He had no risk factors for chronic liver disease. Examination revealed tender hepatomegaly， ascites， and pedal edema. His blood chemistry panels were normal. Liver serologies were not elevated but his a-fetoprotein level was elevated to 17 ng/mL. Doppler ultrasound， computed tomography (CT)， and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed compression of the inferior vena cava with absent flow in the middle hepatic and portal veins； MRI also showed flow voids in the hepatic veins. CT revealed numerous liver nodules with some hyperdense enhancement on arterial phase and heterogenous iso to hypodense enhancement on venous phase， consistent with dysplastic lesions of BCS but also raising concern for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) . There were no other masses seen in other organs. On MRI， some nodules were iso to hypointense on T1 weighted images and heterogenous on T2 weighted images， but few were hyper-intense. Taken together， CT and MRI findings were less consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma but rather regenerative nodules seen in BCS. Ascitic fluid analysis showed no malignant cells and an elevated serum ascites-to-albumin gradient consistent with portal hypertension. Percutaneous liver biopsy revealed diffuse stromal|删除段之间换行|fibrosis and venous congestion with dilated vascular spaces typical of venous obstruction. The patient was diagnosed with BCS. Workup for hypercoagulable conditions was negative， and he was transferred to our institution for further management.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis ofBCS，hepatic venography was pursued but revealed patient veins without any evidence of obstruction， inconsistent with BCS. His hepatic venous pressure gradient was elevated to 16 mmHg and repeat biopsy now demonstrated multiple foci of NET cells with background findings suggestive of outflow tract obstruction . Immunostains were positive for synaptophysin， chromogranin， and cytokeratin 7 . Serum|删除段之间换行|chromogranin A level was elevated to 6800 nG/mL and an octreotide scan showed increased isolated uptake throughout the liver； all of these findings were consistent with a NET. There was again isolated liver uptake on positron emission tomography scan.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Primary hepatic NETs are rare， with fewer than 150 reported cases， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and differentiating them from other hepatic lesions can be challenging. Our case of a diffusely infiltrative NET mimicking BCS has not been previously.\n\n【11】Our patient’s presenting symptoms of abdominal pain， hepatomegaly， and ascites， as well as his IVC narrowing， elevated serum ascites-to-albumin gradient， and initial biopsy were suggestive of hepatic venous outflow obstruction as seen in BCS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Furthermore， radiographic tests demonstrated compression of the IVC with hepatic venous outflow obstruction. Abdominal CT revealed liver nodules inconsistent with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but rather resembles the regenerative nodules associated with BCS.

The nodules are also hyper-intense on T1and hypo-intense on T2 weighted MRI images 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【12】This is a case of NET diffusely infiltrating the liver with obstructed hepatic venules， resulting in venous congesting and mimicking BCS. The absence oftumor on initial biopsy or imaging was also suggestive of BCS. However， hepatic venography demonstrated flow through the hepatic veins， inconsistent with BCS， and concurrent biopsy demonstrated NET cells. This tumor’s rarity posed a diagnostic challenge， especially given the variable presentation of NETs in liver and absence of tumor on initial biopsy.

Case 1 showed mild acanthosis of epidermis， small foci of necrotic keratinocytes with cell debris and focally massive intraepidermal extravasation of red blood cells， with a bullous pattern. Numerous extravasated red blood cells were also present in the dermis， associated with mild superficial perivascular infiltrate  with numerous histiocytes CD68+ ， T lymphocytes CD3-positive and swollen blood vessels.\n\n【14】In Case 2 histological modification were less significant than Case1， with only a mild increase of extravasated red blood cells in the dermis with a mild lymphocytic infiltrate .\n\n【15】Laboratory tests revealed a normal white blood cells and platelet count (WBC 6.82×10/uL，PLT306×10/uL)， normalliver andkidney function and mild increase PCR (0.8 mg/dl)， erythrosedimentation rate ESR (30 mm/h)， homocysteine (17.1 umol/L)， D-Dimer Test(1.74 mg/L). COVID-19 serological test was positive. Additional laboratory tests were performed as shown in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n【16】Immunohistochemistry revealed that the inflammatory infiltrate consisted mostly of T lymphocytes CD3-positive .\n\n【17】Discussion\n\nA few months after the outbreak of the pandemic， many narrative|删除段之间换行|and systematic reviews concerning the dermatological manifestations of COVID-19 have been published通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-6\\]</u>.The clinical and histopathological differential diagnosis of an exanthematous eruption most commonly includes drug eruptions and viral infections. All of our patients were strongly positive to COVID-19 serological tests and negative for other viral and bacterial agent's tests thus suggesting cutaneous manifestation COVID-19 infection associated. Although COVID-19 is best known for causing fever and respiratory symptoms， it has been reported to be associated also with many extrapulmonary manifestations， including dermatological ones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Whilstthe COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestations have been increasingly reported， their exact incidence has yet to be estimated， their pathophysiological mechanisms are largely unknown， and the SARS-Cov-2 role in their pathogenesis is still debated. Furthermore， evidence is accumulating that skin manifestations associated with COVID-19 infections are extremely polymorphic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. In this small study we described two cases with late cutaneous lesions COVID-19associated. Both patients had COVID-19 positive serological tests and the patient in Case 2 had previous skin manifestations.\n\n【19】Cutaneous manifestations of Case 1 were less pronounced and fewer in number than Case 2； however the histological findings in Case 2 were less evident than in Case删除4:<u> 1</u>. Both cases presented perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and extravasated red blood cells. Laboratory tests also showed the presence of an inflammatory picture in both patients， mild increase in PCR， ESR， homocysteine， and D-Dimer Test.\n\nSkin lesions increased in number day by day since the first onset and， after systemic corticosteroid therapy only， they decreased|删除段之间换行|both in number and severity (Bolus for Three consecutive days， methylprednisolone 40 mg for three day) suggesting an immune-mediated inflammatory reaction affecting the skin. Our hypothesis is that COVID-19 infection can give rise to cutaneous manifestations through mechanisms that are not known yet， even after the elimination of the virus by the organism.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】Many cutaneous findings after COVID-19 infections have been increasingly recognized， just as in the case with other viral infections. These two clinical cases describe the skin lesions arising after COVID-19 infection， which also seem to have a worsening trend as these improved following steroid treatment only， suggesting an immune-mediated inflammatory reaction affecting the skin. Furthermore， in order to understand the pathophysiology of the skin damage， in all cases a histological report has to be performed.

We reported a case of adult patient with uncommon presentations following ear foreign body and discussed the management with its literature review.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】This is a case report of a 36-year-old lady with underlying chronic schizophrenia， which had been diagnosed since删除4:<u> 2005</u>. She was compliant to her medications and follow-up. She presented to emergency department in March 2020 with septic shock secondary to scalp and deep neck abscess and newly diagnosed Diabetes Mellitus (DM). She had fever， extensive scalp swelling and poor oral intake for four days prior to her visit. Her scalp swelling extended to her eyes and face. She did not complaint of any ear symptoms. Clinically， she was febrile and had fluctuant swelling on her left scalp extending from left temporoparietal region to her forehead，eyes and her left face. She also had bilateral preseptal cellulitis.\n\n【7】Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the brain， orbit and temporal bone showed large rim enhancing subperiosteal collection on left temporoparietal region extending to the left and right subgaleal frontal region . There was left lateral skull base osteomyelitis with eroded left mastoid cortex that communicating with the subperiosteal and subgaleal abscesses .\n\n【8】She was resuscitated for septic shock secondary to extensive otogenic scalp abscess in the casualty department. After inotrope infusion， fluids resuscitation，insulin andintravenous third generation cephalosporin she was stabled. The White Blood Cells (WBC) was18.06 × 10/L predominantly neutrophils and C-Reactive Protein(CRP) was 242.6 mg/L. Random blood sugar was markedly high 22.9mmol/L and blood ketone was within acceptable range. Other bloods Darameter was normal.\n\n【9】Subsequently， left neck abscess drainage was performed which drained about 15cc of pus and in the same setting we performed Canal Wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy to eradicate the disease. The CWD mastoidectomy was opted in her case in view of erosion of the posterior EAC wall and present of cholesteatoma sac. The mastoid cortex had a defect and the mastoid cavity was filled up with granulation tissue extending into the middle ear. The ossicles were eroded. The skin and soft tissue surrounds the surgical wound were contracted. However， the wound managed to be closed primarily.\n\n【10】She underwent scalp abscesses drainage via retrosigmoid incision and about forty cc of frank pus drained out. Ear examination under microscopic revealed cerumen in the meatus occluding mucopurulent discharge and debris in the External Auditory Canal (EAC) with intact tympanic membrane. The posterior canal wall was eroded and multiple small pieces of cotton found embedded within debris and granulation tissue in the cavity . Thorough ear cleaning was performed and all foreign body were removed under general anesthesia together with drainage of the abscesses.\n\n【11】Her spiking fever had settled after the surgeries. In view of concurrent skull base osteomyelitis， the IV antibiotics were administered for six weeks. Patient was discharged after 2 months of hospital stay. After 4 months， patient was afebrile. However， the common cavity was still not well epithelized.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】She was improved clinicaly and became afebrile. Bactroides fragillis was isolated from her blood culture and Enterococcus avium was isolated from the scalp pus drainage. However， on day 8 post drainage， she developed picket fence spiking temperature despite improvement on the scalp abscess wound. Repeated septic workup， showed similar organisms were cultured from the blood and the surgical wound respectively. Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) smear test of the pus reported negative. Antibiotics IV Ampicillin， IV Ceftazidime and IV Metronidazole were tailored accordingly based on culture and sensitivity results. Repeated CT showed abscess collection had extended to the left deep neck spaces .\n\nForeign body in the ear in an adult is uncommon. However， it should be considered in an adult patient with psychiatric disorder presenting with otogenic scalp abscess. Subperiosteal abscess as sequela from mastoiditis due to otitis externa following EAC foreign body is rare. The subperiosteal abscess， can rapidly progress to the subgaleal and the deep neck spaces， in cases with undiagnosed and uncontrolled DM. This was a serious condition because it can lead to intracranial complications， septic shock and skull base osteomvelitis|删除段之间换行|In the past centuries， incidence of acute mastoiditis following otitis media have been decreasing drastically.

Subperiosteal abscess is the most common complication of acute mastoiditis in pediatric， however it is rare in adult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3-7，9\\]</u>. It can spread by continuous passageway via the middle ear to the antrum then to the mastoid cavity or direct erosion of the posterior wall of the EAC as in this report. This destructive infection may also spread via tympanomastoid suture and vascular channels in the cribriform area which can lead to lateral skull base osteomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Necrosis of the mastoid due to infection or inflammation may provide pus tracking medially to the neck spaces via the digastric groove. Bezold was the first to describe abscess in the neck arising from mastoiditis in 1908. Bezold's abscess can spread to the posterior cervical region，the perivertebral spaces and the deep neck spaces. The abscess may extend into the mediastinum and the base of skull via the danger spaces of the neck. These abscesses are more common in adult with well pneumatized mastoid because of the mastoid cortex bone are relatively thinner as compared to those with sclerosed mastoid通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，10\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Most common bacterial organisms isolated in mastoiditis were Streptococcus pneumoniae， Streptococcus pyogenes， Staphylococcus aureus， Haemophilus influenza and Bacteroides species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa commonly colonizes in the external ear canal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，8\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Studies showed that conservative management such as IV antibiotic， myringotomy with or without ventilation tube insertion and pus needle aspiration or limited incision and drainage of the abscess were effective in most of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2，6\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Mastoidectomy was said to be reserved for refractory cases and patients with associated cholesteatoma or intracranial complications通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.

Studies found out that the length of hospital stay reduced significantly in preserving mastoidectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Chesney et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> in 2013 had developed an algorithm where simple mastoidectomy is reserved in cases with intracranial and uncomplicated or subperiosteal abscess that had poor response to the initial treatment of IV antibiotics， myringotomy and drainage.\n\n【19】In our case， patient condition failed to improve despite regular ear toileting， IV antibiotics and drainage of the abscesses. A mastoidectomy was a necessity to clear out the source of infection. A multidisciplinary teamwork of Otorhinolaryngology (ORL)， neurosurgical， internal medicine， infectious disease， psychiatric and ophthalmology teams involved in managing her.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】in an adult， it should be considered in those with psychiatric disorder presenting with otogenic scalp abscesses. Stabilization of acute condition along with IV antibiotics， regular ear cleaning， ventilation and pus drainage are the first line of management in patients with subgaleal， subperiosteal and deep neck abscess developing from mastoiditis.

Various augmentative surgical methods have been proposed to fix chronic and retracted quadriceps tendon but have shown variable results in literature.

Prior to symptom onset， he regularly played Parkour， a sport involving frequent high impact landings in precarious positions. He subsequently was forced to stop playing the sport due to increasing knee pain and weakness but did not seek treatment. He only sought medical treatmen1during his mandatory national service enlistment in the army， where his knee symptoms were limiting his physical training.\n\n【14】Upon our examination， wasting ofthe left quadriceps muscles was noted. Pain was maximal on palpation at the quadriceps insertion at the superior pole of the patella. Although the passive range of motion was intact， knee extension power was reduced at 4/5 (MRC grade) with an extensor lag of 20 degrees.\n\n【15】Radiographs showed chronic intra-tendinous calcifications at the superior patella pole. MRI scan of the knee showed edema and swelling of the quadriceps insertion at the superior patella pole， with no acute tear. Overall impression was of left knee quadriceps chronic tendinopathy and the patient was started on physiotherapy.\n\n【16】The patient presented late with worsening pain and new onset inability to extend his knee of 6 weeks duration. The patient denied new traumatic events to the knee. Knee examination revealeda mild effusion with a palpable gap in the extensor mechanism at the quadriceps insertion to the patella. There was a “knee drop” with complete loss of extensor mechanism and the patient was unable to perform or maintain a straight leg raise. Radiographs revealed a patella baja and an urgent MRI showed high grade tear of the distal quadriceps tendon .\n\n| A B C Allograft Krakow 5mm(Fibertape) Reamer D E F Suture Anchor Allograft inBasketWeave FiberwireTechnique Figure 3： (A) Retracted patella tendon with removal of unhealthy tendon tillhealthy bleeding tissues.

A midline incision was utilized with exposure down to the ruptured tendon. The patella tendon was checked to be intact. Unhealthy quadriceps tendon was removed till healthy bleeding tissue ； the superior patella bone surface was freshened with a rongeur till healthy bleeding bone surfaces.\n\n【21】Surgical Technique\n\nFollowing a combination of general and regional anesthesia， an arthroscopic assessment of the knee joint was first undertaken.

The tendon was then pulled down to its attachment on the patella and anchored down to bone using two PEEK Swivelock suture anchors 4.75 mmx19.1 mm (Arthrex， Inc.，Naples，FL，USA)， taking care to avoid the horizontal bone tunnel and in an oblique trajectory to increase pull out strength.\n\n【25】We describe a rare presentation of a chronic quadriceps tendon rupture on background of a long history of tendinopathy in a previously young patient involved in Parkour. The patient presented with progressive knee weakness and extensor lag before subsequent loss of extensor mechanism over a protracted period of time. Such delayed presentations are rare in developed countries.\n\n【26】Using a “basket weave technique\"， each end of the allograft was weaved in and out of the quadriceps with as many passes as possible with a trocar needle before the ends were tied together . Further augmentation was performed unitizing the weave and quadriceps with fiberwire . Post repair and reconstruction， the quadriceps tendon tension was noted to be re-established and patella height was restored. On-table passive flexion up to 80 degrees was achieved without gaping of the construct .\n\n【27】Outcomes\n\n【28】Post-operatively， the knee was immobilized in extension for one month with non-weight bearing restriction in a back slab. After which， a knee brace was utilized for controlled range of motion. The range was increased at 30-degree increments at every 2 weeks. Brace was removed at 3-months post-surgery.\n\n【29】Chronic quadriceps tendon rupture is an uncommon pathology with inferior outcomes in comparison to its acute injury counterpart通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，8\\]</u>. There is limited data on the outcomes of surgical management of chronic repairs. Carlos Scuderi in 1958 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> reported a reinforcement technique for contracted tendon ends using a partial 1/3V-shaped tendon flap inverted on the proximal end to approximate the torn ends of the quadriceps tendon. In his series of 18 patients he reported excellent result in 11 cases with complete return to function and minimal extension lag 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This procedure has been traditionally supplemented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> with Codivilla tendon lengthening technique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> which provides further length to the repair procedure. However more recent data on these repair procedures appears less promising with Rao et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u> reporting satisfactory results in less than half of his repair cohort. Failures and inferior outcomes were also noted in cohorts studied by Rougraff et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and Rehman et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\nAt 6-months post-operatively， the patient had recovered to full power in all aspects of movement and knee ROM was 0°C to 90°C. At 16-months post-op the patient was asymptomatic and was participating in highly activity sports with knee ROM back to|删除段之间换行|Main drawbacks with these traditional repair approaches is the disruption of the native tendon architecture when creating flaps， which further undermines collagen integrity and impacts healing potential 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Modified Pulvertafttechnique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> is a more recent repair|删除段之间换行|technique which involves graft augmentation using intraosseous semitendinosus autograft passage across the patella and then weaving the graft across the quadriceps tendon. Promising outcomes were reported 3-months post op， where patient had full active knee extension. This technique retains the original fiber orientation of the quadriceps tendon as compared to traditional methods， and presence of graft directly increases the total concentration of collagen at the site of recovery， potentially increasing speed and quality of recovery of the quadriceps tendon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【31】In our technique， a modified Pulvertaft weave with allograft was utilized to augment our suture anchor repair. The use of suture anchors confers several advantages in this technique. Firstly， approximating the quadriceps tendon to the bone with good tension was efficiently and accurately done with suture anchors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Secondly， the use of suture anchors obviates the need to drill full length transosseous tunnels which may increase risk of bone fracture for the repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Furthermore， short suture anchors crucially allow the separate drilling of ahorizontal bone tunnel for graft passage and augmentation. This would not be feasible with full length tunnels in the usual transosseous repair of quadriceps tears 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【32】The subsequent use of allograft augmentation with a bone tunnel and weave technique allows bioaugmentation and integration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. It substantially increases the tensile strength of the entire construct post repair and was further supplemented with fiber wire sutures. This allows the surgeon to confidently accelerate rehabilitation post-surgery.\n\n【33】This patient had excellent outcome post-surgery with this modified pulvertaft weave reconstruction technique with suture anchor repair. He was able to regain full range of motion， full muscle power at 6 months post op and resume high impact/velocity activities at 16 months post-op. ideally a larger series with a longer follow up will provide a more information and validate the efficacy of this surgical technique. However as mentioned， it is increasingly rare now to see neglected cases in developed countries for us to have a large case series.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n\n【35】Allograftaaugmentedrepair tforchronicCquadrupture， supplemented with the use of suture anchor and FiberTape has delivered excellent mid-term outcome in a young high demand patient.

Gait impairment exacerbates the energy cost of movement activities. This case-control investigation sought to quantify the caloric expenditure and gait movement patterns of a case with a cervical seven， iSCI and an age-，sex-，and height-matched control (CON). Laboratory data were combined with free-living step activity to evaluate the appropriateness of prescribing physical activity using step metrics after iSCI. Participants completed a six-minute walk test and three， paced-walks wearing a portable metabolic cart. Step activity monitors were worn for seven days to capture daily living activity prior to participants returning for three-dimensional gait evaluation. Kilocalories per step， step count， and Lateral Deviation (LD) of the seventh cervical spinal process were compared between the iSCI and CON. Peak oxygen consumption， daily step count， and walking speed were lower while energy cost (of walking) and LD were higher in iSCI compared to CON. Though iSCI took two thirds fewer steps， they expended nearly twice as many calories per step compared to CON. A LD to walking speed index (LDI) was created to represent gait pattern relative to actual locomotion. The iSCI LDI improved by 45% and CON by 21% when walking speed increased； this improvement may represent greater efficiency of movement at faster walking speeds. Walking mechanics impact energy expenditure of walking post-iSCI and step activity recommendations should be reconsidered. Rehabilitation specialists may implement LDI as a clinical metric that represents gait pattern and efficiency.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Individuals post incomplete Spinal Cord Injury (iSCI) are prone to a highly sedentary lifestyles secondary to gait impairment. Musculoskeletal adaptations in an iSCI are more severe than prolonged bed rest， weightlessness (space travel)， and immobilizations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. The muscles below the iSCI atrophy with concomitant decreases in metabolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Moreover， those with iSCI present with a greater concentration of anaerobic muscle fibers (i.e. IIx) relative to those without iSCI通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， making the musculature more predisposed to fatigue. Those with longstanding iSCI are slow to develop torque below the injury， thereby limiting locomotor function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and efficiency. The diminished gait leads to higher energy cost when completing movement activities (e.g.， daily living， self-care，leisure) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Despite this higher metabolic cost， there is no recommended step count value for those post-iSCI.\n\n【4】A lack of modified step prescriptions leaves a person with iSCI to follow the standardized recommendation of 10，000+ daily steps to be considered “active； a recommendation which was created for able-bodied individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Step activity criteria were designed to reflect an overall daily energy expenditure， but this objective measure is exposed to error when gait is impaired. Individuals with functional limitations， such as iSCI， are known to expend more energy during locomotion when compared to non-impaired controls (CON)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The purpose of this study was to investigate the energy cost of Daily Step Physical Activity(DSPA) post-iSCI and compare that to an able-bodied CON of similar physical characteristics. The research team also examined kinematic parameters of gait between iSCI and CON walking to better understand differences noted in walking energy cost. Appraising these changes may help clinicians better prescribe treatment plans to improve quality of movement.\n\n【6】Table 1： Participant demographic data.\n\n|  | Age  | Weight  | Body Fat  | Total Limb Length  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Case  | 36  | 196.5  | 28.1  | 31.9  |\n| Control  | 38  | 179.6  | 18.9  | 32.5  |\n\n【8】Note： Age-years； weight- pounds； body fat- percent； total limb length- in inches\n\n【9】Case-ControlPresentation\n\n【10】One ambulatory male case with an iSCI was recruited. The iSCI was the result of a traumatic head and neck injury (level C5) twelve years prior to participation. There was no evidence of a traumatic brain injury resulting from the accident and the case was scored an ASIA D upon hospital discharge. Chronic repercussions to the iSCI are persistent neuropathic pain treated by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and mild clonus in the lower right limb. One age-， sex-and limb length-matched CON (±2 years and 2 inches) was also recruited. Descriptive statistics for each participant are shown in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n【11】Volunteers signed an IRB-approved informed consent prior to initiation of data collection. Participants’ limb length (femur and shank) were measured by a licensed physical therapist with a nylon tape. Values were totaled for a summed limb length. Weight and body composition were assessed via bioelectrical impedance (InBody570， In Body USA， Cerritos， CA).\n\n【12】Walking tasks\n\n【13】Session one began with an activity specific warm up followed by a familiarization and fitting of the calibrated portable metabolic cart (Cosmed K4b， Cosmed， Rome， Italy). To assess peak oxygen consumption (VOzpeak)， each participant completed a Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) on an oval track while wearing the metabolic cart. Participants were asked to walk at the fastest， maintainable pace for six minutes. The case was permitted to use typical daily walking aids (cane and Bioness L300) for all study walking tasks. Heart rate， VO zpeak (using a 15-breath rolling average) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， and total distance covered were collected for each participant.\n\n【14】Matching the paces on the Step Activity Monitor (SAM； Modus Health， Oklahoma City， Oklahoma)， participants completed three-minute walk tests paced at 15 (low)， 35 (moderate)， and 55(high) steps per minute， respectively. Each test was separated by a minimum of five minutes rest. Participants were fitted with a SAM on the dominant limb， immediately superior to the lateral malleolus. Participants wore the SAM for the remainder of the day and for the next seven consecutive days. The monitor was calibrated following a previously established protocol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Biomechanical analyses\n\n【16】No sooner than seven days after session 1， participants returned to complete the biomechanical assessments during the following tasks：Self-selected and fast-10-meter walk tests (SS10MWT & F10MWT) and balancing on a flat platform (both feet， then alternating single leg attempts). Gold standard 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>， three-dimensional motion analysis(Qualisys AB， Gothenburg， Sweden)was used to capture gait speed and Lateral Deviation (LD) during SS10MWT and F10MWT. LD was determined by movement of the seventh cervical spinal process (C7) reflective marker along the frontal plane .\n\n【17】Participants safely completed the walking trials without issue； however， the case was unable to maintain the 55 steps per minute cadence. Metabolic and step activity data are presented in Table删除4:<u> 2</u>.

If we truly consider|删除段之间换行|the concept of step count， we would recognize the goal of such recommendations is about energy cost of movement； the threshold count is a helpful metric for aiming to maintain healthy weight and physiological processes (e.g.， cardiorespiratory， metabolic). Tudor-Locke and Bassett 通用删除7(英):<u>(2004)</u> recognized early that the step goal of10，000 or more a day would likely be unattainable by many， therefore suggesting an adjustment to as low as 5000 to 7500 steps per day to avoid a sedentary classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Rather than sticking with step counts，however， Marshall et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> suggested identifying step counts that relate to moderate-intensity walking (3 to 5 METs) to account for effort. Findings from this investigation were that estimating MET values from step counts was prone to considerable error and that walking at a pace greater than 100 steps per minute represented the minimum threshold for attaining moderate-intensity. Another issue with translating steps to METs is the inconsistency of using the resting energy expenditure constant of 3.5 ml/kg/min. The case in this investigation had a standing energy expenditure of 7.35 ml/kg/min(or2.1 METs)， with typical adults having a standing MET value of 1.59±0.37 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Therefore， it is likely inappropriate to standardize activity recommendations based on step metrics or stan dardized MET values for those with functional limitations without first considering their biomechanical and metabolic efficiency.\n\n【24】In the clinical setting， LD is often indicative of an abnormal walking pattern， but is not typically quantified for objective assessments. While both participants increased gait speed between10MWTs， LD did not change as expected. LD decreased in the case and increased with the CON when going from SS10MWT to F10MWT， as shown in Figure删除4:<u> 3</u>.\n\nRather than looking at LD in isolation， it may be relevant for clinicians to consider evaluating a LD and walking speed index (LDI) as a clinical outcome. The case’s LDI (calculated as LD/walking speed) improved from the SS10MWT (2.15) to the F10MWT(1.18). The CON's LD index also improved from 0.66 to 0.52 when walking faster. It is possible that the case adopted a gait pattern that allowed for greater weight bearing on the more impaired limb during the SS10MWT when compared to the F10MWT. Clinicians may consider a more segmental approach to fully gain insight on compensatory mechanisms adopted during self-selected and fast walking after neurological trauma. Rehabilitation specialists may also consider implementing a more objective view of C7 movement when assessing|删除段之间换行|pathologic gait， as it is clearly impacted by altering walking speed.\n\n【26】Unrealistic expectations may heighten perceived barriers， undermine mobility related to self-efficacy， and discourage adoption or adherence of activity behaviors. Exercise prescription based on energy expenditure goals may serve as an alternative mode to individualize daily activity for those with functional limitations. Future research should attempt to establish new recommendations based on functional status for those outside the typical gait norm. Clinicians may also consider evaluating the relationship between C7， pelvic response， trunk flexion， and metabolic cost of walking speeds to better direct therapeutic attention to the component most responsible for the dysfunction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The ELF-EMF is Non-Ionizing Radiation (NIR) and does not carry enough energy per quantum to ionize atoms or molecules. The ELF-EMF are generated by electrical devices and power systems (1 Hz to 300 Hz). In recent decades， exposure to ELF-EMF has emerged potential concerns on public health. Exposure to ELF-EMF has an adverse biological effect depending on the current intensity， strength of the magnetic field， and duration of exposure. Accumulated epidemiologic evidence indicates a correlation between exposure to ELF-EMF and childhood cancer incidence， Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)， and miscarriage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Data on the effects of Extremely Low Frequency Electromagnetic Fields (ELF-EMF) on pregnancy outcomes (Condition of the fetus or newborn after termination of pregnancy， including preterm birth， stillbirth， low birth weight， miscarriage， small for gestational age， etc.) are inconclusive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. For example， a report showed ELF-EMF has been studied as a potential risk factor for miscarriage (pregnancy loss at<20 weeks of gestation) and other adverse reproductive health outcomes. This research priority arose from reports of miscarriage and birth defect clusters among Video Display Terminal (VDT) operators in the U.S. and Canada. Although several studies have demonstrated that ELF-EMF is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes， other studies have shown no|删除段之间换行|evidence of associations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. A recent study by Wilson reports that personal magnetic fields exposures were not associated with fertility treatment outcomes or pregnancy outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Prematurity or small for gestational age is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity in developed countries， and also increase the risk of chronic diseases in adult life. Both are multifactorial phenomena associated with fetal， maternal， placental and environmental factors， and though several risk factors are now well known，the effect ofELF-EMF on it remains unidentified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

The quality of the included articles was evaluated from ten aspects in the following table. The total score of the coding manual is 10 points. If the total points are greater than or equal to8， it is considered as a high-quality article. As is shown in Table 1， 6articles are high-quality literature.\n\n【32】Basic information of the included literature\n\n【33】A total of 7 studies were finally included in the review， and comprised a total of 3055，644 total sample. All of the literature are cohort studies. Information obtained from each full-text study included first author， publication year， area， primary outcomes and so on. Basic information extraction is shown in Table删除4:<u> 2</u>.\n\n【34】Analysis results\n\n【35】Adverse pregnancy outcomes： Miscarriage， stillbirth， birth defects， and preterm birth were included in the analysis as bad pregnancy outcomes. A total of 7 studies were finally included. P<0.00001，I=97%，A random effects model was used. Total effect Z=1.35， P=0.18，\\[RR=1.30， 95% CI (0.89，1.90)\\]. The results showed that there was no statistically significant between the two groups. There was no significant increase in bad pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women who lived near electromagnetic fields compared with those who lived far away from magnetic fields .\n\n【36】Birth defect： A total of 4 studies were included.

There was no significant increase in preterm birth risk among pregnant women who lived near electromagnetic fields compared with those who lived far away from magnetic fields.\n\n【39】Miscarriage and stillbirth\n\n【40】The outcomes of miscarriage and stillbirth were similar. So， analyze it as one situation， and a total of 2 studies were included. P=0.001， I=84%， A random effects model was used. Total effect Z=0.93， P=0.35， \\[RR=1.48， 95% CI (0.65， 3.33)\\]. The results showed that there was no statistically significant between the two groups. There was no significant increase in miscarriage and stillbirth risk among pregnant women who lived near electromagnetic fields compared with those who lived far away from magnetic fields .\n\n【41】Subgroup analysis\n\n【42】we conducted subgroup analyses by European region and non-European region (Asia and North America). The results showed pooled effect size for the European region Z=0.74， P=0.46， \\[RR=1.30，95% CI (0.65，2.63)\\]，non-European region Z=1.04，P=0.30，\\[RR=1.13，95% CI (0.90， 1.43)\\]， Between subgroups P=0.71，I2=0%，there was no statistically significant， but the heterogeneity is significantly reduced.\n\n【43】Sensitivity analysis\n\n【44】Sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding each study in turn. After omitting the article KG Blaasaas 2004， Heterogeneity was significantly reduced， P=0.07， I=50%， however， there was no significant change in heterogeneity after omitting the other articles. This suggests that the source of heterogeneity in combined effect sizes for bad pregnancy outcomes is KG Blaasaas 2004 .\n\n【45】Discussion\n\n【46】Epidemiologic studies have provided inconsistent results on the association between exposure to ELF-EMF and various health\n\n| Author  | Publishvear  | Location  | Primary outcomes  | Exposure conditions definitions  |  | Total samplesize (person)  | Year ofinclusion  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Elisabeth Robert通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>  | 1993  | France  | chromosomal aberrations， central nervous system anomalies， skeletal malformations，cardiac defects， facial clefts， hypospadias anomalies of the digestive system， and anomalies of the urinary system  | maternal residence in a municipality inwhich at least one point of habitation waslocated within 500 meters (0.5 cm on the1/100，000 scale map) of 225 or 400 kVoverhead power lines  | 5925  |  | 1988-1989  |\n| ManoochehrMahram 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>  | 2013  | Iran  | preterm labor，neonatal birth weight，length，head circumference and congenitalmaltormations  | the areas under the ELF-EM elds wereregistered on the maps.  | 380  |  | 2011  |\n| KG Blaasaas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>  | 2004  | Norway  | Birth defects： Central Nervous System(CNS) defects， cardiac defects， respiratorysystem defects， esophageal defects， and clubfoot  | the estimated magnetic field was 0.1 pTor above.  | 744324  |  | 1980-1997  |\n| Nathalie Auger\\[101  | 2019  | Canada  | Nine major categories of birth defects wereincluded， covering the central nervoussystem， sense organs (eye， nose， ear)，orofacial clefts， heart， respiratory， digestive，abdominal wall or diaphragm (gastroschisis， omphalocele， diaphragmatic hernia)， genitourinary， and musculoskeletal systems.  | calculated the distance between thepostal code centroid and the nearesttransmission line and transformer stationin meters.(<200).  | 2164246  |  | 1989-2016  |\n| Frank de Vocht\\[111  | 2014  | England  | Low Birthweight (LBW)， Small forGestational Age (SGA) and Preterm Birth(PTB) (included spontaneaus preterm birth)  | linear residential proximity of 200 m or less based on measurement dataindicating that magnetic field strengthsfrom overhead power lines would notexceed normal domestic backgroundlevels at cistances of more than 200m from high voltage lines.  | 140356  |  | 2004-2008  |\n| Nathalie Auger通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> Qiang Wang 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>  | 2012 2013  | Canada China  | stillbirth miscarriage  | The referent was defined as 2 100 m，The straight-line distance between pastalcode centroids and the nearest power line werecalculated with Maplnfo Professional 8.0.the estimated magnetic field was 0.1 pT or above.  | 516685 413  |  | 1998-2007 2010-2012  |\n\noutcomes. It may be associated with neurodegenerative diseases， specifically Alzheimer’s disease； however， limited evidence was found to suggest that ELF EMFs are associated with several types of cancer， CVD， and reproductive outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Many research studies regarding the impact of low frequency electromagnetic fields on residents living close to very high voltage overhead power lines were carried out. A review study has shown that childhood leukemia is associated with exposure to magnetic field. Many other studies suggest the role of this exposure and the increased risk of birth defect. In addition， the results from some studies have indicated that exposure to magnetic field may be associated with the increased risk of adverse birth outcomes such as low birth weight and miscarriages. Some studies， however， did not find a statistically significant increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight in relation to exposure to electro-magnetic field during pregnancy reproductive outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Most residents living in close proximity to overhead power lines are more concerned about the outcome of their pregnancy. The scientific evidence for other outcomes of pregnancy such as preterm birth is quite weak. A total of 7 studies were included for meta-quantitative analysis. Miscarriage， stillbirth， birth defects， and preterm birth were included in the analysis as bad pregnancy outcomes. there was no statistically significant between the exposed group and the non-exposed group. Birth defects， preterm births， miscarriages and stillbirths were analyzed separately， and no statistically significant differences were found. The results showed that there was no statisticaly significant in pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women who lived near electromagnetic fields compared with those who lived far away from magnetic fields. We conducted subgroup analyses by European region and non-European region. The results suggest that different regions may be one of the sources of its heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the|删除段之间换行|source of heterogeneity in combined effect sizes for bad pregnancy outcomes is KG Blaasaas删除4:<u> 2004</u>. Sensitivity analysis showed that the KG Blaasaas 2004 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> study had a greater impact on the heterogeneity of combined studies. However， after careful evaluation， there was no sufficient reason to exclude this literature study， so it was included. The limitations in this study are listed as follows. First， the definition of magnetic field exposure was not consistent across studies included in the meta-analysis. Second， the distance assessment method used is not completely consistent. Third， birth defects are also defined differently， for example， Elisabeth Robert 1993 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and Nathalie Auger 2019 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> have a more comprehensive description of birth defects. While Manoochehr Mahram 2013 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> only mentioned congenital malformations. The population of birth defects included in the original literature may vary， which may have some impact on the pooled results. Due to the small number of included studies， the publication bias ofthe studies could not be fully evaluated. In addition， most of the maternal and neonatal conditions are not clearly recorded in the literature， so it is impossible to explore confounding factors such as birth defects and preterm birth through multivariate analysis ofother influencing factors of pregnant women. Electromagnetic field exposure is flowing everywhere， and wherever there are wires， motors and electronic equipment， electromagnetic fields are generated. This is one of the reasons why it is difficult to assess the effects of electromagnetic fields on human health. For research consistency， this study pooled mainly electromagnetic exposures to residential high-voltage lines. Eventually， larger sample size and higher quality studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms ofthese magnetic fields. Although there is no direct evidence from the current study that ELF-EMF has an effect on pregnancy outcomes， studies， empirical observations， and patient reports clearly indicate interactions between EMF exposure and health problems. On the one hand， there|删除段之间换行|is strong evidence that long-term exposure to certain EMFs is a risk factor for diseases such as certain cancers， Alzheimer's disease， and male infertility. On the other hand， the Emerging Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EHS) is more and more recognized by health authorities， disability administrators and case workers， politicians， as well as courts of law. It is very important to take the individual susceptibility into account. The primary method of treatment should mainly focus on the prevention or reduction of EMF exposure， that is， reducing or eliminating all sources of high EMF exposure at home and at the workplace. The reduction of EMF exposure should also be extended to public spaces such as schools， hospitals，public transport， and libraries to enable persons with EHS an unhindered use (accessibility measure). At the same time， individuals should strengthen their physique and maintain homeostasis in order to increase their ability to resist disease and thus resist the bad effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【49】Conclusion\n\n【50】This meta-analysis shows that no correlation has been found between maternal ELF-EMF exposure and miscarriage， stillbirth， neonatal birth defects and preterm delivery， while the effects on small gestational age and low birth weight are still uncertain. Related research with high-quality large samples and different regions are still needed for further verification.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The aim of this case is to draw attention to the fact that caution during the examination and suspicion of Aberrant Internal Carotid Artery(ICA) is the first and most important step in the management of nasopharyngeal masses.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 72-year-old female patient presented with tinnitus in the left ear and hearing loss in both ears. The patient had a history of tinnitus in both ears and increased in the left ear for the last year.

In this article， we present a 72-year-old woman with aberrant nasopharyngeal ICA who presented with left-sided tinnitus. We aim is to remind the patient who comes with tinnitus， not only otoscopy but a complete ENT examination and especially the evaluation of the nasopharynx in terms of vascular masses before the surgical approach.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 72-year-old female patient presented with tinnitus in the left ear and hearing loss in both ears. In the patient's history， it was learned that the complaint oftinnitus has been in both ears for a long time and increased in the left ear for the last year. The patient’s medical history was unremarkable except for asthma. In the otorhinolaryngologic examination， bilateral otoscopy and oropharynx were normal； a submucosal， regular pulsatile mass was observed in the nasopharynx， moving from the right side by swallowing to the right .\n\n【9】Computed Tomography (CT) angiography with a preliminary diagnosis of aberrant ICA revealed bending in the aberrant right ICA， curvature in the left ICA， and atherosclerotic wall calcifications in both ICA’s .\n\n【10】The patient was told that aberrant ICA may cause complaints such as difficulty in swallowing， foreign body sensation， pulsatile sound perception or mouth pulsation. It was recommended that anesthesia physicians should be informed of this condition and cardiology control， especially if nasopharyngeal surgery is necessary and may cause any bleeding during intubation. Audiologic examination of the etiology of tinnitus， the main complaint of the patient， was found to be consistent with presbiacusia. Betahistine 2 ×1 was started and the patient was followed up.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\nICA is embryologically cranial of the third branchial artery and dorsal aorta. In the fifth week of fetal life， a loop occurs at the junction of these two vessels. When the heart vessels and large vessels descend from the mediastinum， the ICA becomes flattened. If it doesnt flatten， it can be aberrant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although the etiology of aberrant ICA is not known， it is thought to be caused by embryological and acquired diseases. It may occur as a result of atherosclerotic changes due to acquired diseases such as DM， HT and CAD， especially in elderly patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In the case we presented， CT both ICA’s showed atherosclerotic wall calcifications that did not cause stenosis. Firstly， the ICA variations were classified by Weibeland Fields in 1965 and are still valid. In this classification， the ICA variation is classified in4 ways； straight， curved， bend， curl. The most common variation was straight. In the case we presented， on right ICA bending and left ICA curving was observed. In the patient with bilateral subiective non-pulsatile tinnitus， the presence of bilateral ICA variation， although not objective， suggests its role in the etiology of tinnitus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Aberrant ICA， which is generally asymptomatic， is present in a wide range of symptoms such as difficulty in swallowing， extraneous object sensation， pulsatile sound perception， mouth pulsation， nonspecific dizziness， tinnitus， headache， cervical distress， glossopharyngeal|删除段之间换行|neuralgia and sleep apnea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6\\]</u>. In our case， there was a left-sided increase in bilateral tinnitus. Nasal endoscopy showed right-sided ICA and imaging showed variation in left-sided ICA. In another case in the aberran ICA case series of Jafarov et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Humeral increase in the right ear and flexion variation on the same side were observed.\n\n【13】Aberrant ICA isusually asymptomatic， but in clinically suspected cases， full ENT examination should be performed and pulsatile lesions should be sought imaging methods Doppler USG(Ultrasonography)， CT， angiography， MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) are helpful in detecting vascular anomaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In our case， a right sided pulsed mass was observed in the nasopharynx and CT and CT angiography examinations were performed and bilateral ICA anomaly was detected.

The tremor was disabling， preventing or hindering her from performing her activities of daily living (ADLs). An evaluation including a detailed neurological examination， brain magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and a dopamine transporter scan (DAT-scan) was unrevealing. She did not have Parkinson disease (PD)，or Essential Tremor (ET)， or dystonic or task-specifictremor. She was diagnosed with a functional (psychogenic) tremor. She denied being anxious or depressed. There was no obvious secondary gain from her tremor： she was not working， was not claiming disability， and was living at home with her parents. She refused to accept a psychological or psychiatrist evaluation. She was referred for occupational therapy with a “mirror box\". A“mirror box\"is a box with two mirrors in the center one facing each way originally invented to alleviate phantom limb pain by “tricking the patient into believing the amputated limb is whole， moving， and painless.

Functional movement disorders account for at least 5.0 % of patients at a movement disorder clinic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Among functional movement disorder one- third are tremors. The mean age of onset of functional tremor is 18-50years. The ratio of females to males is 3：1通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Functional tremor is usually characterized by an acute rather than a gradual onset， by disappearance with distraction， and by variability in character， frequency and amplitude at rest， on sustention and in action 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Functional movement disorders are a “Crisis for Neurologybecause patients usually don't accept the diagnosis， are reluctant to seek psychiatric care， and when they seek such care often， in our experience， don’t respond.

The onset of her tremor was acute. The tremor was variable and was inconsistently increased by physical activity. The tremor affected her activities of daily living to the point where she stopped using her right hand. Her handwriting was often legible often not. It did not exhibit micrographia. When asked about her tremor she said it was present all the time although it was distractible.\n\n【6】Neurological examination revealed no cranial nerve abnormalities， no head or chin or lip tremor. Muscle strength and tone were normal： there was no rigidity. There was no slowness of mov. There was no rigidity， no gait difficulty， and no postural instability. Sensory examination was normal. There was no family history of tremor.\n\n【7】Resting tremor was present in the right upper limb involving both proximal and distal muscles. Tremor was inconsistent， jerky， and of high and variable frequency. Tremor was distractible by talking to the patient and by asking her to move her left hand or left leg.\n\n【8】Brain MRI was normal. A DAT- scan revealed no dopamine depletion. Neuropsychological revealed no obvious issues. She was neither unduly anxious nor depressed. There was no obvious secondary gain： she was not working， was not claiming disability， and was living with her parents at home without obvious financial pressures. She was not on any drugs that could produce tremor.\n\n【9】The patient was referred for occupational therapy for what she said was an incapacitating tremor of her right dominant hand. The main intervention was the use of a mirror box. During mirror box therapy her left upper limb which had no tremor was reflected as her right upper arm， while her right upper limb was outside the box and invisible to the patient. In this setting the absence of tremor in her left upper limb was seen， by the patient as an absence of tremor in her right upper limb and the tremor in her right upper limb (held outside the box) decreased in amplitude at rest， on sustention and during action.\n\n【10】The patient was instructed on how to use the vanity mirror in her home to have her left non-trembling upper limb reflected as her right in various positions. This maneuver over several days resulted in the tremor in her right upper limb disappearing.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】The concept ofthe mirror box is based on the concept of“reflective illusion.” It was popularized by Ramachandran to treat the pain of phantom limb pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5，10\\]</u>. He used the term \"learned paralysis\". The mirror box consists of a mirror in the center. The upper limbs are placed on the both sides of the mirror. The affected， trembling limb， is always covered and the unaffected limb is placed on the other side whose reflection is seen in the mirror to create an optical illusion： that the trembling limb is not trembling.

A strategy implementing autologous Stromal Vascular Fraction(SVF) cells from adipose tissue represents a novel approach in this chronic and devastating disease. Here we present a case study of a 71 year old woman who underwent SVF cell therapy during one surgical procedure. Clinical status of the patient was closely monitored with regular spirometry before and up to 14 months after SVF cell therapy. Nine months after SVF therapy patient did not require anti-fibrotic drugs and spirometry showed improvements that continued further at14 months. SVF therapy is a rapid， safe， and cost-effective method which can be easily applied in patients with pulmonary fibrosis and other chronic lung diseases.\n\n【2】Keywords： Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis； Chronic lung disease； Chronic asthma； Stromal vascular fraction； Stem cells\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and disabling lung disease characterized by irreversible loss of lung function due to scarring of the lung tissue ultimately resulting in death通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The median of survival is 3-5 years after diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Typical pathological features of IPF are scarring and fibrosis of the interstitial lung tissue due to activation of fibroblasts and accumulation of myofibroblasts into the alveolar space， leading to dysfunction and failure of the lung. Clinical manifestations include respiratory deterioration， dyspnea on exertion and heart failure eventually leading to death. Aging， smoking， bacterial or viral infection， industrially processed food and air pollution are the most critical risk factors of IPF. Physical， environmental and genetic factors may also contribute to the pathogenesis and development of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Current conventional therapy relies mainly on the reduction of symptoms or slowing the progression of the disease， including corticosteroids and beta-mimetics， unfortunately is frequently associated with various side effects. Oxygen supplementation is needed for patients with advanced IPF. Typically， conventional medicine cannot cure IPF. A promising novel strategy implements regenerative medicine based on Mesenchymal Stem/stromal Cells (MSCs) which can be easily obtained from adipose tissue together with other regenerative cells as Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) cells. MSCs have strong homing effect to the sites of injury and ischemia， inhibit chronic inflammation， and contribute to tissue restoration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and so have potential to be used for the treatment of IPF. SVF cells can be readily isolated from adipose tissue obtained by a standard liposuction， and administered during one surgical procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Previously， we described that SVF cells containing MSCs have a great regenerative potential in a large cohort of 1128 patients with osteoarthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> including elderly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.

Briefly， 150 ml of adipose tissue was obtained， SVF cells isolated and resuspended in normal saline and administered intravenously during one surgical procedure. Clinical status of the patient was closely monitored during said procedure. For the long-term|删除段之间换行|follow-up， data including spirometry with objective measurements of the Functional Vital Capacity (FVC) of the lungs as well as Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) were monitored closely. These data were measured starting 2 months before through 14months after SVF cell therapy.\n\n【7】Results\n\n【8】Seventy one years old female， ex-smoker with IPF for 2 years preceded by 4 years of chronic asthma， had been suffering from a chronic dry and stifling cough， tiredness， shortness of breath and significant decrease in her quality of life. Her lung functions were also objectively monitored by spirometry on a regular basis. During last 2 years， she was on continuous oxygen therapy via nostrils， and underwent pulmonary rehabilitation. She received standard medications including inhaled corticosteroids and beta-mimetics， oral prednisolone 10 mg to 80 mg per day， and omeprazole 20 mg/day. She was also taking supplements with calcium 2 mg x 500 mg daily and Vitamin D3 800 IU daily. Her situation was complicated with pneumonia 5 months before SVF cell therapy. Pneumonia required hospitalization and intensified medical care including oxygen， antibiotic and other supportive therapy. After that acute pneumonia resolved， she remained quite weak， in a wheelchair and unable to walk more than about 10 meters due to severe dyspnea. She remained on her medications above and on continuous oxygen delivery at 6 1/min. via nostrils. Chest X-ray demonstrated progression of the lung fibrosis with diffuse alveolar changes. Due to constant deterioration of health， the patient decided to undergo autologous SVF cell therapy during one surgical procedure. She underwent autologous intravenous SVF cell therapy using 2.38×10/kg ofher body weight of nucleated SVF cells with viability 99% isolated from 150 ml of adipose tissue. No serious side effects were documented in association with the cell therapy procedure. Besides SVF cell therapy， she received recommendations to avoid calcium supplementation and initiate magnesium supplementation together with trace minerals containing zinc， selenium and manganese (Anti-Aging Minerals) and vitamin supplementation containing vitamins B1， B2， B3， B6， B12， folic acid， pantothenic acid， vitamin C， D3， and K2 (Anti-Aging Vitamins) for12 months. One month after the SVF therapy， she was able to reduce her standard prednisolone and beta-mimetic medication， and her spirometry showed mild improvement . She was constantly improving further. She was able to stop inhaled beta-mimetics and corticosteroids 5 months after SVF cell therapy， and was able to wean herselfoff oral prednisolone by 9 months after SVF cell therapy. Nasal oxygen was reduced to 3-4l/min. At 12 months after SVF celltherapy， she became independent of oxygen only when inside her house， may be psychologically dependent， as she tended to use it when walking outside the house. Spirometric examination 9 months after SVF cell therapy revealed dramatic improvements in lung functions (FVC104%， FEV1 92%) and similar and stable results were documented at14 months after SVF cell therapy (FVC 102%，FEV1 97%) . Clinically， the patient felt very good， was able to walk without oxygen， and without a need for anti-fibrotic or anti-asthmatic medications. Her quality of life had improved dramatically. No respiratory tract infection was documented during the 14 months period since SVF cell therapy.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\nBecause current conventional treatment of IPF is limited and ineffective， including serious side effects and the disease progressively|删除段之间换行|deteriorates and often ends with lung transplantation or death，novel therapeutic approaches， including regenerative medicine， are needed. Various stem cells therapies have been used for IPF treatment in clinical studies， for example bone marrow isolated MSCs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， Adipose Tissue-Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， placenta-derived MSCs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> or alveolar type II progenitor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. As was described previously， adipose tissie-derived MSCs are more genetically stable and can be safely and easily isolated in much higher quantities from adipose tissue by a standard liposuction as a part of SVF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. SVF therapy was successfully clinically used in treatment of many disorders including pulmonary diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease(COPD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>， IPF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and pulmonary emphysema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. As we described previously， SVF cells have a distinctive tissue regeneration potential in patients with osteoarthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. Moreover，International Consortium for Cell Therapy and Immunotherapy has experience with neurodegenerative diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>， and pulmonary diseases including COPD.\n\nStem cells have pleiotropic effects in the place of lung injury that include anti-inflammatory， immunomodulatory， anti-fibrotic and paracrine effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. They are able to differentiate into various local cell types， including cells in bronchioles， alveoli， and pulmonary vasculature and also contribute in activation of the resident stem cells. Typically， large amounts of SVF may be obtained from 200ml of adipose tissue (10° nucleated SVF cells per each ml of the adipose tissue) when CT-SVF-03 Kit is used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u> leading to clinical application of more than 2×10\\/kg of body weight nucleated freshly isolated SVF cells. Based on our clinical experience， this amount leads to optimal clinical result， i.e. complete cure of chronic and debilitating disease such as IPF. These non-manipulated autologous SVF cells may be directly administered intravenously to the patient with no serious side effects. Another route， i.e. endotracheal application of SVF cells in IPF patients has also been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Here we were able to demonstrate that only one application of SVF cells is sufficient to initiate the immunomodulatory and regenerative processes in the lung. Obviously， other parameters may affect the clinical results of the cell therapy， including age， disease stage， extent of tissue damage， and|删除段之间换行|other diseases of the patient.\n\n【12】Here we document for the first time to our knowledge， the IPF cure using autologous SVF cells isolated and administered during one surgical procedure. This treatment is safe with no serious side effects. It may represent a promising new therapeutic approach for the treatment ofIPF. Definitely， this method is still at an experimental stage and large multicenter randomized trials should be performed to further evaluate the efficacy of SVF cells as a treatment for this devastating chronic lung disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However， its side effects have seldom been mentioned. Hereby we report an impressive case of post-operative hemorrhage， which were probably caused by miss-chosen and mal-positioned CSD system. Meanwhile， invasion of vertebral venous plexus should also be taken into consideration when unexpected hemorrhage happened. After adjusting the type and position of the CSD system， this patient healed without any complication.\n\n【2】Keywords： Closed suction drain； Post-operative hemorrhage； Cervical surgery\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Closed Suction Drain (CSD)， a medical drainage system consisting of an internal drain tube that connected to a pre-vacuumed container or grenade-shaped bulb， is commonly used as a direct and effective method to achieve evacuation of liquids or debris from cavities or wounds in surgical procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Generally，CSD has been a routine procedure in orthopedics practices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However， seldom studies have recognized the possible hazardous consequence bought by this technique. Recently， our institution confronted a case of unexpected post-operative iatrogenic hemorrhage caused by CSD system.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 50-year old female patient was admitted to our institution with a diagnosis of atlantoaxial dislocation and paraplegia on basis of conventional physical examination， CT scan， and MRI. She accepted posterior cervical surgery soon after. A posterior reduction of atlantoaxial dislocation and internal fixation with rod-and-screw system was then performed as described before 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> . Both sides of vertebral venous plexus were invaded when placing the C1 lateral mass screw， and led to profuse bleeding， which was stopped by pressing and stuffing with gel-foam. Prior to closure， any existing bleeding was stanched with bipolar cautery， and the wound was irrigated copiously with saline to clean away all the debris， blood and devitalized tissue. A pre vacuumed closed wound drainage system (Medinorm， Germany) was applied to avoid problems caused by potential bleeding and no vacuum suction was used before closure. The wound was then conventionally closed by intradermal suture after obtaining a dry wound. To our surprise， a profuse and rapid blood flow into the drainage container occurred right after the tube was connected to the 600 ml pre-vacuumed container and filled up to more than 200 ml in 60 sec. The vacuum suction was terminated immediately and incision was re-opened to the surgical field. However， no active bleeding could be found. The tip of drainage tube was found right point to the left side of invaded venous plexus. The drainage tube was then repositioned to keep away from both sides of venous plexus and gel-foam area， and incision was closed as above. A French JP drain was used instead. Finally， no more sustained blood loss occurred. The drainage tube was removed 48 h after surgery and the incision healed without any problem. No more complaint during the 10 months postoperatively.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\nAs described by Dougherty and Simmons， CSD mainly shows its values in reducing wound hematoma and post-operative edema， which would help to decrease the morbidity of infection and external contamination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Nevertheless， side effects， such as multiple intracranial hemorrhages due to the over-drainage of cerebrospinal fluid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， increased total blood loss and higher homologous blood transfusion rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， should also be given enough significance during daily applications. Hence， the application of CSD could be a potential risk for post-operative blood loss. In our case，|删除段之间换行|we figured out that mal-positioned drainage tube and miss-chosen aspiration system should be the reason of such unexpected post-operative hemorrhage. The tip of tube was found right pointed to the invaded venous plexus， so was unsuitable for focal hemostasis and likely triggered direct suction. Moreover， the stuffed gel-foam， together with drainage tube， might work as a Vacuum Suction Drainage (VSD) system and then creates a vacuum phenomenon established through the drainage tube lying in it. Such specific device was associated with elimination oflocal tamponade effect and resulted in a continuous aspiration of blood from venous plexus. According to the Boyle's law 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， the 600 ml container provides higher and more persistent aspiration power comparing to the JP drain. Overwhelmed aspiration power might enlarge side effects of CSD， for instance， eliminated tamponade effect and dislocated local tissues induced by suction， and lead to terrible hemorrhage consequently. Hematoma is one of the main complications after orthopedic surgeries. The incidence of symptomatic post-operative spinal epidural hematoma， which requires intervention， has been reported to range from 0.1% to|删除段之间换行|3%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Post-operative hematoma can be resulted from either patient-or surgical-related factors. Among those， the injury of venous plexus is a predisposing element. With its thin and fragile wall， venous plexus is vulnerable even to blunt traction. In addition， lack of valve deteriorates the local hemostasis and leads to disastrous hemorrhage eventually. The reported number of incidence and mortality of pre-sacral venous plexus injury were 9.4% and 4.3%， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. Various hemostasis techniques have been introduced to clinical practice， including package of glue (gel-foam， fibril collagen， surgical and bone wax)， thumbtacks and coagulation. However， unexpected blood loss in certain structures still takes places 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The invasion of vertebral venous plexus is another important factor contributing to post-operative hemorrhage in our current case . The vertebral venous plexus， accompanying with deep cervical veins and anterior internal vertebral venous plexus， is a composition of vertebral venous system. Its initial portion starts from the atlanto-occipital space and connects with the anterior internal vertebral venous plexus in the manner of an intervertebral vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. To our knowledge， neither clinical research nor case report could be found to convincingly clarify the occurrence or treatment of post-operative hemorrhage caused by this venous plexus system. This may result in deficient understanding to many spine surgeons and inevitably leads to unconscious damage as well as inadequate treatment. Summary， we present a new view of the merits of CSD system， which is not only for the prevention of post-operative hematoma，but also accompanying by accidental stimulation of iatrogenic hemorrhage. Mal-positioned drainage tube and miss-chosen aspiration system are two significant considerations. Besides， to master the local anatomy also should be kept in mind for orthopedic surgeon. We believe that improvements of above will benefit both orthopedic surgeon and patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Its rapid rise in popularity coupled with good initial results made it a major component of patient care for the treatment of morbid obesity and its comorbid medical problems. LSG is a relatively safe procedure but has rare， sometimes serious complications such as staple line leak， bleeding and strictures. Liver abscess is a rarely reported complication of LSG. An infected material in the gastrosplenic area after LSG due to hematoma or staple line leak has the potential to cause spread of the bacterial content to the liver and later on pyogenic liver abscess.\n\n【2】Methods： A case report study type with literature review.\n\n【3】Results： We report a rare case of liver abscess as a complication of LSG.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Although rare， clinicians should be aware of liver abscess after LSG due to the serious consequences and the high mortality rate. Image-guided percutaneous drainage plus intravenous antibiotic therapy is usually sufficient\n\n【5】Furthermore， it is advisable to repeat the diagnostic imaging in the follow up of patients.\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) is the most popular bariatric and metabolic operation performed. It was initially added as a modification to Biliopancreatic Diversion (BPD) and then combined with a Duodenal Switch (DS) in 1988. It was first performed laparoscopically in 1999， as part of DS. Subsequently， Gagner et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> began to perform the gastric resection portion of the DS operation， as a first-stage procedure in 2000. With the revelation that patients experienced weight loss after LSG， interest in using this procedure as a bridge to more definitive surgical treatment has risen.\n\n【8】LSG has various advantages over other bariatric procedures. The technique is relatively easy， it does not need anastomosis as it preserves the pylorus； avoidance of complications associated with malabsorptive operations such as dumping syndrome and diarrhea.\n\n【9】Furthermore， the need for trace elements and vitamin supplements is less or much less than the other types. On the other hand， LSG remains to have significant complications， including， but not limited to， bleeding， staple line leak， twist and dehiscence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. The aim of this work is to discuss a unique presentation of liver abscesses after LSG.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\nA 37-year-old man， not known to have chronic medical illnesses. His BMI was 33 kg/m， presented to the Emergency Department (ED) 10 days after he had Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy(LSG) in another tertiary care hospital outside the Kingdome and was admitted under the bariatric surgery care. Until three days of presentation， the postoperative course was uneventful. He was discharged home after tolerating clear liquids a day post operatively. Upon presentation in ED，he was complaining ofabdominal pain and back pain that increased in severity prior to his presentation. On examination， he was dyspneic and looking sick. His temperature was 36.7， with spikes of fever at midnight， pulse rate 123/min， BP 127/75 mmHg. His abdomen was soft on examination， with mild tenderness on deep palpation. Laboratory studies revealed leukocytosis with a count of 31，000/mm²|删除段之间换行|(4.5-11.00)， serum albumin 22.7 g/l(35-45 g/l). The rest of the results were unremarkable. CT abdomen with oral and IV contrast showed a loculated collection with air-fluid level measuring 7 cm ×5 cm， seen in close contact to the left lateral aspect of the fundus and body of the stomach with evidence of extraluminal encysted large air bubbles with mild thick fluid component at the gastrosplenic area. Overall appearance is in keeping with gastric sleeve leakage. Large elongated linear hypodensity measuring 6 cm containing air bubbles seen in left liver lobe segments 2 and删除4:<u> 3</u>. Two large collections with foci of air， one in the anterior right dome of the liver， segment 4a and the other one in segment删除4:<u> 6</u>. Three smaller collections noted in the left lobe， segment 6，posterior to caudate lobe and another one anterior to that. Portal vein， hepatic veins and IVC are patent. No obvious contrast extravasation. Moderate diffuse dirty mesentery in upper abdomen and right paracolic gutter area suspicious for focal peritonitis. Mild free fluid in right paracolic gutter and mild to moderate one in the pelvis. Right mild pleural effusion with partial collapse of the right|删除段之间换行|lower lobe. Minimal atelectatic changes in left lower lobe .\n\n【12】The patient was started on fluid boluses through peripheral IV lines， plus a broad spectrum antibiotic and an antifungal.\n\n【13】Two right subcapsular hepatic collections， segment 6 and 4A were drained by interventional radiology under US guidance utilizing10-Frenchx30 cm pigtail catheters. Large amount of pus was drained. The perigastric collection was targeted under CT guidance using 19Gx 13.8 cm through a coaxial needle followed by the insertion of10F pigtail catheter over wire. Turbid greenish and smelly fluid was drained. Collection in the left lobe was not drained.\n\n【14】Gastrografin study was undertaken later which showed a gastroesophageal junction leak .\n\nCT abdomen with oral and IV contrast was repeated after 3days as the drains were accidentally removed. Redemonstrations of extravasation of the intraluminal contrast in the left upper quadrant along with interval increase in the size and number of liver abscesses. The one in anterior dome of right lobe returned back to same size|删除段之间换行|before drainage. The segment 6 abscess became smaller. The 3collections in left lobe noted previously are slightly larger now.\n\n【16】Reinsertion of pigtail drains for both collections in right lobe was done successfully.\n\n【17】Esophagogastroduodenoscopy(EGD ) ) ) Was performed and revealed a very small opening measuring 4 mm at the gastroesophageal junction. This was stented with an 18 mm x 140 mm double Niti-S stent under fluoroscopic guidance.\n\n【18】Septic work up showed a growth of streptococcus anginosus in the liver abscess. Another culture also from the liver abscess sent a week later showed Acinetobacter baumanni (MDRO). Antibiotics were adjusted accordingly.\n\n【19】Follow-up CT abdomen one week after aspiration demonstrated again the perigastric complicatedffluid collection containing multiple foci ofpneumoperitoneum. Stable appearance of multifocal subcapsularloculated fluid collections in segment 4A， with tip of drain tube seen within it. Mild decrease in the size of the two subcapsular fluid collections， seen at segment 6 and删除4:<u> 7</u>. Another CT abdomen a week later showed a complete resolution of the right lobe collections and significant decrease in size for the left lobe ones.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】LSG is emerging to be one of the commonly performed bariatric procedures worldwide for patients with different degrees of obesity. This procedure has several advantages. It is technically simpler to perform without the need of an anastomosis. It induces a reduction in ghrelin causing appetite suppression， which adds to the effect of restriction. It has been reported to have a lower morbidity and mortality rate in comparison to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion with or without duodenal switch. It can be performed concomitantly with other procedures.\n\n【22】LSG can be associated with three significant complications， which include staple line gastric bleeding， staple line gastric leaks and gastric strictures. Of these， a gastric leak after sleeve gastrectomy is associated with significant and prolonged morbidity， remaining one of the most feared complications.A. gastric leak can present as peritonitis， abscesses， cutaneous or other fistulas， sepsis， organ failure and even death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【23】In this case report， we present an unusual complication post sleeve gastrectomy as a consequence of leak and/or infected hematoma leading to peritonitis and liver abscess. Also， we demonstrated that not all liver abscesses appear on first presentation and repeat CT is sometimes required to fully visualize the whole picture of the abscesses.\n\n【24】A liver abscess is defined as a pus-filled mass in the liver that can develop from injury to the liver or an intra-abdominal infection disseminated from the portal vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The majority of these abscesses are categorized into pyogenic or amoebic， and less frequently caused by parasites and fungi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Pyogenic Liver Abscess (PLA) is caused by a Bacterial infection of the liver parenchyma consists of inflammatory cells and the collection of Pus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\nThe usual pattern of formation is the leakage of bowel to the abdominal cavity travelling to the liver through the portal vein. Many cases have an infected biliary tract may cause an abscess via direct|删除段之间换行|contact.\n\n【27】Another classification ofliver abscesses is based on the location in the liver. 50% of solitary liver abscesses occur in the right liver lobe (a more significant part with more blood supply)；less commonly in the left liver lobe or caudate lobe.\n\n【28】Historically， PLA was most commonly a complication of acute appendicitis， occurred predominantly in young men， and was associated with high mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Infection of the biliary tree (cholangitis) represents 40% to 50% of liver abscess diagnoses， usually as a result of obstruction， often leads to the formation of multiple lesions.\n\n【30】Bacterial seeding of the liver parenchyma either through the hepatic artery (e.g. in endocarditis) or by direct drainage from the portal venous system (pylephlebitis associated with appendicitis， diverticulitis， omphalitis， pancreatitis， or postoperative infection) each account for roughly 5% to 15% ofthese hepatic infections. Direct extension from a contiguous focus of infection (e.g. subphrenic abscess) and traumatic events (either penetrating or blunt) are presumed to be the source of infection in 5% to 10% and 1% to 5%of cases， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The organism can enter into the liver via vessels of the bile ducts or even directly by contiguity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Radiographic imaging is essential to diagnose pyogenic liver and splenic abscesses. Contrast-enhanced CT scans and ultrasonographic are the most useful. Both of these imaging studies have a sensitivity of 98%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【32】The most common finding at contrast-enhanced CT is a well-defined，low-attenuation， round mass with an enhancing peripheral rim.\n\n【33】The hepatic abscess was most often found in the right hepatic lobe(56%)， left lobe abscess (34%) or bilobar abscesses (9%) respectively.\n\n【34】The majority of patients presented with a single cavity， but 31%had multiple abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Presence of gas and rim enhancement is suggestive of abscess.\n\n【35】In 1938， Ochsner et al. reported the first comprehensive case series of PLA， in which the case-fatality rate was 77%. Nowadays， with the improvement in diagnostic imaging and the development of minimally invasive therapies， mortality rate had decreased to below20%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. A series from Memorial Sloan Kattering Cancer center(MSKCC) has reported a 3% mortality rate.\n\n【36】Surgery remained the therapy of choice until the mid 1980s， when percutaneous drainage was shown to be a safer alternative in many cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【37】Currently， the treatment of pyogenic liver and splenic abscesses almost always requires a combination of drainage and antimicrobial therapy. Percutaneousimage-guided drainageeproceduress are preferred to surgery. Nonetheless， surgical intervention may be required if percutaneous drainage cannot be accomplished or management of coexistent intra-abdominal disease is necessary.\n\nMedical treatment of liver and splenic abscesses alone should only be reserved for very small lesions not amenable to drainage or if the circumstances are such that the risk of drainage is too high|删除段之间换行|Antimicrobial therapy is usually provided for four to six weeks； the first one half of which preferably is given parenterally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Post|删除段之间换行|LSG， an infected material in the gastrosplenic area due to hematoma or staple line leak has the potential to spread of the bacterial content to the liver which can result in pyogenic liver abscess. Although this probability is extremely rare， there are previously reported few cases with liver abscess after LSG.\n\n【39】There are two possible sources or risk factors for the development ofliver abscess after LSG. First is the leak at the staple line resulting in migration of the bacteria to the liver? Second is ascending migration of bacteria from the portal venous system due to pylephlebitis of the portomesenteric veins secondary to leak-related collection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Reviewing the literature， two cases of a pyogenic liver abscesses and two cases of splenic abscesses were reported after LSG in gulf countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Another case of liver abscess post sleeve was report in Turkey通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In 2017， Abdelhadi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> published two cases of liver abscess and two cases of splenic abscess occurring after the LSG procedure. The liver abscesses developed after a gastric leak (managed by endoscopic stenting) and were treated using antibiotic therapy and percutaneous drainage in one case and laparoscopic drainage in the other. The splenic abscesses involved a gastric leak in one case that was managed by endoscopic stenting， and a partial splenic tear is the other complication that required blood transfusion and diagnostic laparoscopy on postoperative day one with no further intervention. In the case of failure of treatment by percutaneous drainage and antibiotics， the abscess was managed by open or laparoscopic splenectomy. In 2012， Alfalah et al. published a case of liver abscess in a 32-year-old woman 44 days after LSG. No gastric leak was observed， and her treatment included percutaneous drainage with antibiotic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【41】Fever and abdominal pain are the chief presenting complaints in patients with liver and splenic abscesses. More often than not， concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting， diarrhea， and abdominal cramps are absent. Our patient came complaining upper abdominal pain， repeated vomiting， and intermittent fever.\n\n【42】Radiographic imaging is essential to diagnose pyogenic liver and splenic abscesses. Contrast-enhanced CT scans and ultrasonographic are the most useful. Both of these imaging studies have a sensitivity of 98%\\[91.\n\n【43】Surgery remained the therapy of choice until the mid 1980s， when percutaneous drainage was shown to be a safer alternative in many cases \\[81.\n\nNowadays， treatment of pyogenic liver and splenic abscesses almost always requires a combination of drainage and antimicrobial therapy. Percutaneous image-guided drainageprocedures are preferred to surgery. Nonetheless， surgical intervention may be required if percutaneous drainage cannot be accomplished or management of coexistent intra-abdominal disease is necessary. In some patients， percutaneous aspiration without placement of an indwelling catheter may be adequate. Medical treatment of liver and splenic abscesses alone should only be reserved for very small lesions|删除段之间换行|not amenable to drainage or if the circumstances are such that the risk of drainage is too high.\n\n【45】Antimicrobial therapy is usually provided for 4 to 6 weeks， the first one half of which preferably is given parenterally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Our patient was diagnosed， with staple line leak (managed by endoscopic stenting)， intra-abdominal collection and multiple liver abscesses， ten days post LSG based on CT scan. The abscesses were successfully managed with CT guided drainage and antibiotics.\n\n【46】Conclusion\n\n【47】In conclusion， although the development of pyogenic liver abscess after LSG is rare， clinicians should be aware of it to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this life-threatening condition. Image-guided percutaneous drainage plus intravenous antibiotic therapy is usually sufficient.

AAM is a slow-growing， locally infiltrating tumor that tends to recur locally but is unlikely to metastasize. To date， surgery is the standard treatment for AAM， although it carries limited success rates. The literature around AAM is also limited.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： We report an unusual case of a 67-year-old woman with an extensive soft-tissue mass in the pelvic and abdominal cavities. We performed complete tumor excision， and a diagnosis of AAM was confirmed via pathology. The mass recurred within 5 months of surgery and grew in size rapidly. A wider tumor excision was performed 8 months after the initial surgery； however， a recurrent mass was again detected during the subsequent follow-up period. Four months after the second resection， the patient underwent 1 cycle of chemotherapy (cisplatin， ifosfamide， and epirubicin) at another hospital； however， the diameter of the mass continued to increase. At our last follow-up visit (15 months after the initial surgery)， the patient was in poor health and had abandoned further treatment.\n\n【3】Conclusion： AAM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of asymptomatic， slow-growing masses in the abdominopelvic cavity.

Upon physical examination， her abdomen was soft and distended. Gynecological examination revealed a 200×100×100 mm mass with low mobility and without clear margins. Ultrasonography revealed an irregularly shaped soft-tissue tumor with mixed echogenicity， approximately 195×129×108 mm in size . Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a huge， hypodense mass in the pelvic and lower abdominal regions with a longitudinal diameter of 190 mm . The patient had a normal menstrual|删除段之间换行|history， no history oftaking drugs， and had not undergone any prior surgical procedures. Surgical exploration revealed a soft， poorly circumscribed mass，approximately 200×150×100mm in size， within the pelvis and abdomen. A spontaneous rupturing of the mass， which produced bloody ascites approximately 200 mL in volume， was also noted. The tumor had adhered to the intestines and the maior omentum， and covered the uterus as well as the adnexa bilaterally. After careful dissection， the uterus and the adnexa appeared to be normal. The surfaces of the liver， spleen， stomach， and appendix were smooth. Owing to the high possibility of a mesenchymal tumor， we performed tumor resection， total abdominal hysterectomy， bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy， and omentectomy. On gross examination， there were large， poorly circumscribed lesions with irregular extensions into the surrounding tissues. Microscopic examination showed the proliferation of small fusiform or star-shaped cells without cytonuclear atypia that were interspersed in a myxoid background enclosing several capillary structures with thin walls. Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor strongly expressed desmin and moderately expressed vimentin， CD99， CD34， and smooth muscle actin； the tumor was negative for CD117， cytokeratin，estrogen receptor， progesterone receptor， and S100. The diagnosis of AAM was confirmed on pathologic examination. After radical surgery， no further treatment was conducted except for close follow-up.\n\nFive months after surgery， a recurrence of the mass was detected. Ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic， solid tumor (71x56×42mm) located on the vaginal stump. At the next monthly follow-up， magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed an irregularly shaped tumor in the pelvic cavity， measuring 84 mm in diameter . Eight months after the surgery， the recurrent mass was approximately|删除段之间换行|(C) (D)\n\n【11】204×113×97 mm in size； the mass grew gradually to the point where it severely affected gastrointestinal peristalsis and caused abdominal distention. Hence， the patient underwent a second， wide excision. Surgical exploration found that the tumor in the pelvis and abdomen，200×185×160 mm in size， was gelatinous， poorly circumscribed， and had no capsule. The recurrent tumor had occupied the inter-intestinal space and the vaginal stump. After the second operation， we continued close follow-up. Four months after the second tumor resection， a third recurrent mass developed. Ultrasonography revealed a solid， cyst-like mass in the pelvis and abdomen 294×272×100 mm in size. Following the third recurrence， the patient sought treatment at another hospital， where she was administered a chemotherapy regimen of cisplatin， ifosfamide， and epirubicin for1 cycle. Five months after the second operation， ultrasonography indicated an irregularly shaped mass measuring 409×335×128mm. When she was last seen 15 months after the initial surgery， the patient could barely eat or sleep， and had abandoned treatment.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】AAM is one of the rarest and perhaps most misdiagnosed types of genital stromal tumors. It is often detected incidentally during physical examinations， owing to its slow growth pattern and lack of symptoms. If they manifest， symptoms may include pelvic fullness and pressure， dysmenorrhea， and changes in bowel and bladder function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，9-11\\]</u>. No characteristic symptoms of AAM have been identified， making it difficult to diagnose this disease.\n\n【14】The appearance of AAM on CT is variable. It may be a well-defined， homogeneous mass that is hypodense relative to muscle， or may be predominantly cystic with solid components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Characteristic appearances on MRI include hypointensity on T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. The“swirl sign\"is characteristic on T2-weighted MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. With its better soft tissue resolution， MRI is more reliable for the diagnosis of AAM. MRI was performed following the first recurrence of the tumor in our patient to evaluate her condition； however， CT was used during follow-up visits owing to the patient’s financial situation. Given its characteristic features， MRI should be used for delineating the extent of disease， determining eligibility for surgery and clinical follow-up examinations for recurrent tumors if a patient's financial situation allows. On gross examination， AAMs are typically soft， bulky masses. Microscopic examination shows a sparsely cellular tumor composed of pale-to-eosinophilic stroma with numerous haphazardly arranged blood vessels that stand out against a myxoid background. There is no specific immunohistochemistry marker for AAM； however， these tumors are generally positive for vimentin and desmin.\n\n【15】The preferred treatment for AAM is surgery， although achieving negative resection margins is challenging owing to the infiltrative nature of the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. It is especially difficult to remove large and deep-seated tumors in the pelvis compared to the small and superficial tumors of the vulva or vagina. To assess the necessity of radical resections， researchers analyzed data from 111 patients with AAM and found no statistical differences in survival according to the time to relapse or resection margin status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Although complete surgical resection should be the preferred aim， incomplete or partial resection is acceptable when significant operative morbidity is anticipated or SPT when the preservation of fertility is required. Our patient experienced recurrence despite wide excision with negative surgical margins； she chose not to undergo a third excision after recurrence and sought chemotherapy at another hospital. Generally， adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy is not a preferred route because of the low mitotic activity of AAM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>； however， several cases of tumor recurrence have been treated with radiation therapy resulting in patients achieving relapse-free intervals of 2-3 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. To our knowledge， ours is the first report of chemotherapy used for a patient with AAM； however， it did not provide any curative benefit.\n\nThe treatment of recurrences， however， may be challenging and require various therapeutic options to be explored. This is especially true given that no single modality has been proven to be effective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. AAM tends to recur after surgical excision despite being a benign and non-invasive tumor； such recurrence can occur at the original site after the initial resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Recurrence rates range from 25% to47%， and 85% of all recurrences appear within 5 years ofinitial surgery通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3，19\\]</u>. It is highly recommended that patients with AAM be closely followed by using clinical and imaging tests， particularly MRI. To our knowledge， only 2 cases of metastasis from AAM have been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，21\\]</u>， suggesting that metastasis is an exceedingly|删除段之间换行|rare event. Because recurrences have been observed 14 vears after the initial diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， proper management， combined with long-term follow-up， is necessary to identify recurrences of AAM.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】AAM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a painless， soft， slow-growing mass in women. Wide local excision remains the first-line treatment to date. Long-term follow-up and careful monitoring with imaging techniques are required for timely identification of the recurrent tumors and prompt resection. In our patient， chemotherapy did not provide any curative benefit.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Thymoma-associated pure white cell aplasia is a rare and fatal condition. Few cases are reported that relate thymoma， recurrent myasthenia gravis and neutropenia. There is a speculation of circulated anticytokine auto-antibodies that may be directed to Granulocyte/Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) receptor. Possible alteration to positive and negative T-cell selection disturbs the T-cell immunization and leads to uncontrolled auto-antibodies production. We report a case with recurrent myasthenia gravis， graft versus host-like disease and pure white cell aplasia along with a short literature review.\n\n【2】Keywords： GvHD-like syndrome； Pure white cell aplasia； Thymoma\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Approximately 28% of patients with thymoma have Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and thymoma occurs in about 10% of patients presenting with MG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Patients with thymoma have an increased incidence of several paraneoplastic syndromes.

We report a case of“Thymoma-Associated Multiorgan Autoimmunity(TAMA) admitted 8 years after thymectomy with recurrent myasthenia gravis， agranulocytosis with multiple positive immunological profiles that had an unfortunate fatal outcome. Using flow cytometry and short-term cultures we found an interesting T cell phenotypic profile and total inhibition of colonies growth.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 46-year-old woman presented with recurrent myasthenia gravis and previous thymectomy，8years ago. She admitted due to fever， diarrhea and vomiting. She had localized skin lesions looked like erythema nodosum spread centrifugally with central clearing. Chest auscultation revealed reduced breath sounds to the right lung base， abdomen was soft without pain and heart examination was normal with S1 and S2 clear and rhythmic. The patient also presented with tissue swelling of both leg extremities. The palpation did not reveallymph nodes. Liver and spleen were not palpable. Patient's vital signs were normal.\n\n【7】Investigations on admission were as follows： CBC： Hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL (normal 12 g/dL to 16 g/dL)， platelet count of 216×10/L (normal 150 to 400×10/L). Her total WBC count was1.37 ×10 /L (normal 3.8 to 10.5 ×10/L) with a neutrophil count of0 ×10/L (normal 1.6 to6.5×10/L) and lymphocyte count of 1.28×10° /L (normal 1.5 to 3.6×10/L). Renal and liver function tests were normal. The C-reactive protein was 7.7 mg/dL (normal <0.8 mg/dL) and ESR\n\n【8】Table 1： in vitro inhibition of hematopoietic progenitors of both erythroid lineage and granulocyte-macrophage colony forming cells by adding patient's serum.

Additional investigations showed low level of Immunoglobulin G (IgG)， and IgA and normal IgM level. An autoimmune profile was performed that included antinuclear antibody， double-stranded DNA antibodies and anti-smooth muscle antibody all of which were positive， C3 and C4 were low. Thyroid function tests showed low level of TSH with slightly increased FT and FT and clotting tests were normal. Investigating the diarrheal syndrome， stool cultures were negative along with the blood analysis for Shigella and Salmonella. Clostridium dificile test was also negative. Viral tests for CMV and EBV were negative for current infection. Blood cultures revealed infection from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia sensitive to many categories of antibiotics.\n\nComputed tomography scan showed chest infection of right lung base and small pleural bilateral effusion. Chest X-rays showed right hemi-diaphragmatic elevation while abdominal ultrasound was normal. The patient was immediately covered with wide spectrum antibiotics and granulocyte growth factors. Consultations from surgeon， neurologist， rheumatologist， dermatologist and cardiologist were also requested. Colonoscopy was recommended when the situation of the patient would allow it. Dermatologist examination was positive for subacute nodular migratory panniculitis of Vilanova and Pinol. Expertise meeting concluded that clinical and laboratory|删除段之间换行|results indicated the presence of circulated autoimmune antibody directed simultaneously to multiple targets. It appears that clinical features of diarrhea associated with skin lesions leads to a syndrome that resembling GvHD-like disease. Unfortunately， a colonic or skin biopsy specimen to confirm the presence of colitis or GvHD-like dermatitis was not pursued in our patient mainly because of poor functional status， suppressed immune status， and no apparent impact on treatment.\n\nSimultaneously， Bone Marrow (BM) aspiration and biopsy were performed to exclude an underlined hematologic malignancy. BM revealed a nearly complete absence of granulocytes precursors with normal maturation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. Lymphoid population was proportionally increased with normal ratio CD4：CD8. Peripheral blood cytometry had been assessed by standing surface expression antigens especially on T-cells. We therefore analyzed the phenotype of peripheral blood T-cells that oni presented the 81% of the mononuclear cells. Seventy three percent of CD3+ was also CD8+. Interestingly， the majority of the CD3+ CD8+cells co expressed CD45RA and CD27 which made them similar to naive T-cells. In order to evaluate the effect of patient's serum in blood cells we performed short term cultures in methylcellulose with and without patient’s serum. Mononuclear cells (2 x10/ml) were|删除段之间换行|isolated from peripheral blood sample of three voluntary healthy donors by centrifugation with Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma St Louis， MO， USA) and were placed on culture dishes coated with methylcellulose(Methocult HC4435， Stem Cell Tegnologies， Vancouver， Canada). Short term cultures without patient's serum comprised the control group (Group A)， while short term cultures with patient's serum in different doses (10 ul， 50 p1， 100 ul and 150 ul) comprised the test sample (Group B， C， D and E). The cultures were incubated at 37-C for 14 days in 5% CO. Two independent investigators evaluated the number of hematopoietic progenitor cells per dish. Samples were viewed with an inverted fluorescent microscope (Axiovert 25， Zeiss AG， Gottingen， Germany). We observed in vitro inhibition of hematopoietic progenitors of both erythroid lineage and granulocyte-macrophage colony forming cells. The inhibition was directly related to the dose of added patient's serum .\n\n【20】The patient chest infection rapidly progressed despite the multiple antibiotic combinations including empiric antifungal agent administration. Corticosteroids and intravenously immunoglobulins administration could not reset absolute neutrophil number to normal state. The patient was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit where she died with multiorgan failure due to infection 3 weeks after her admission.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】The thymus is a lymphatic organ located in the anterior mediastinum which is responsible for many immunological functions， including the production of mature， functional T cells and the induction of self-tolerance. Thymoma is the most common malignancy that originates from the thymus gland and accounting for50% of anterior mediastinal tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Current scientific evidence relates several autoimmune diseases with thymoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-16\\]</u>， and defective immune regulation has been suggested to be the link between these diseases. The time of the diagnosis of autoimmune disorder widely varies. In 30% ofpatients with thymoma，autoimmune diseases will be found either in a comorbid state or after thymectomy， where up to 50% of patients are diagnosed simultaneously with two autoimmune diseases \\[171.\n\n【23】MyastheniaaGravis{(MG) ) considered aSthecommonest autoimmune disease that is related with thymoma. MG auto antibodies were found to be directed against the Acetylcholine Receptor (AChR) in the neuromuscular junction of sskeletal muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. 75% of patients with MG have some degree of thymus abnormality， including thymic hyperplasia in 85% of those patients and thymoma in 15% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The co-existence of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and thymoma differs between 1.5% and2% in clinical epidemiological studies and up to 10% in cases where thymus biopsies were studied 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Furthermore， in some patients this co-existence of SLE and thymoma was associated with poor prognosis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The close relation between these two diseases is highlighted by the remission of steroid therapy-resistant SLE disease observed post-thymectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Other studies have described that polyarthritis， skin rashes， fever and cytopenias are frequent in SLE patients with thymoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Thus， it seems that although the exact mechanisms underlying both pathologies are still unclear， the association between thymoma and SLE is arguable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\nHematological manifestations are also observed in patients with thymoma， highly associated with immune dysfunction. Acquired pure red cell aplasia is the commonest cytopenia that will be demonstrated|删除段之间换行|with thymoma. Impairment oferythroidprogenitors orprecursor cells seems to be T cell-mediated， and it is estimated that 5% of thymoma coexist with pure red cell aplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. In several studies including histological analysis of thymoma from patients diagnosed with pure red cell aplasia， small germinal centers and lymphoid aggregation were demonstrated in their bone marrow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. This suggests a link between humeral and cellular alterations observed in these patients. Other immune-mediated cytopenias， such as thrombocytopenia and neutropenia， were also reported in combination with thymoma \\[171. Pure white cell aplasia is reported in few cases with thymoma. The co-existence with other autoimmune diseases and the remission with immunosuppressive therapy are considered as indirect proof of an underlying autoantibody production. In few studies autoantibodies against granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor were found that could also explain the absence of myeloid lineage that was present in bone marrow biopsies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Dermatological manifestations are also observed in patients with thymoma. Many dermatological diseases are associated with thymoma such as pemphigus a， paraneoplastic pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，14\\]</u>. More than 20 cases of pemphigus have been reported in the past several decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>， and in a recent case study， thymectomy resulted in regression of bullous dermatoses通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Interestingly， there are reports of skin lesions associated with thymoma resembling GVHD skin lesions. There have been 7reported cases of thymoma associated GVHD-like disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. All of the cases involved the gastrointestinal tract. In 5 out of 7 reported cases morbilliform eruption on biopsy specimen was consistent with acute GVHD. Hypogammaglobulinemia was seen in each 3 of the 7patients， whereas three patients had abnormal liver enzyme levels， especially alkaline phosphatase， that reveals a hepatic involvement to the GVHD-like disease. All patients were reported to have chronic diarrhea with negative stool culture findings， among them four patients had colonic biopsy specimens that showed a GVHD-like colitis. Five patients died of serious infections. Thus， it appears that the development of a GVHD-like eruption in a patient with thymoma foreshadows a progressive disease with a fatal outcome  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\nThe etiology of many autoimmune diseases appears to be a combination of factors that usually involves genetic propensity and another factors， such as the environment， immune-mediated processes， infections， hormones and drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26，27\\]</u>. In the case of the thymus and autoimmunity， it is rational to conjecture that the underlying mechanism is based on a dysregulation in immune function. Progenitor T cells， like B cells， are produced in the bone marrow； however， they later migrate to the thymus for a series of normal procedures including maturation， differentiation and selection. T-cell maturation in the thymus consists of， as expected， rearrangements of the germ-line T-cell receptor genes and the expression of various membrane markers. Along with T-cell modification and maturation into an effective group of lymphocytes， a meaningful pair of selection is happening in the thymus. Positive selection allows the survival of the T cells whose T-cell receptors can recognize self Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules. Alternately， negative selection rejects T cells that respond forcefully with self-MHC or with self-MHC plus self-peptides， thus eliminating autoreactivity of these T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. These thymic functions are important to eliminate auto-reactivity， to maintain self-tolerance and to enhance the production of regulatory T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. These cells represent a specific subset ofT cells which dominantly control auto-reactivity in the periphery. Based on these observations， the|删除段之间换行|association of thymoma with loss of self-tolerance is rational， and several mechanisms have been proposed based on the hypothesis that the abnormal thymus produces impaired T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.\n\n【27】The combined cellular and humeral dysregulation theory suggests a connection between the adaptive arms of the immune system that permits them to act together in order to support autoimmune disease. The export of auto-reactive T cells from thymus to the periphery is supposedly a critical step in the thymoma-associated autoimmunity； on the other hand， an additional step has been reported as necessary to bond these auto-reactive T cells to autoantibody-producing B cells. This suggested model is consisting oftwo independent steps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. The first contains a great number of CD8 T cells produced by thymus to exhibit impaired tolerance， thus initiating an autoimmune cascade. However， during the second step， the humoral immunity succeeds the cellular by activating CD4 T cells， which， in turn， stimulate B cells to produce autoantibodies. This mechanism could explain the over-production of autoantibodies in patients with thymoma or myasthenia gravis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Recently peripheral flow cytometry to a patient with thymoma， pure white cell aplasia and autoimmune thyroiditis showed the presence in the peripheral blood of CD8+ T cells that expressed a homogeneous naive phenotype. CD8+ CD45RA+ CD27+ T cells represent the majority of CD8+ T cells in cord or newborn blood， whereas their number decreases with age along with antigen encounter and immunological experience. Thus， after the age of 50year， they represent less than 50% of total CD8+ T cells， the others being memory CD45RA-CD27+ and effector CD45RA+CD27-cells. Phenotypic analysis performed 2 and 4 months post-thymectomy to the patient showed no changes in CD8 and CD4 subset population. These data indicate a remaining alteration in the composition of T cells of the patient’s peripheral blood. Thus， it can be speculated that pre-T cells may create a neoplastic thymus where they can be matured通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【29】In order to distinguish the reaction of different T-cells subsets on GVHD onset， Dutt et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u> in 2007 reported that naive T-cells resulted acute colitis characterized by severe diarrhea， rapid host weight loss and death. On the other hand， memory T-cells cause chronic pattern of liver and colon injury that isn’t associated with early diarrhea and weight loss. The paradoxical ability of naive T-population to induce rapid and acute type of GVHD than effector memory T-cells is probably due to different trafficking and expansion capacities of the two T-cell subsets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.\n\nIn our patient， severe diarrheic syndrome， agranulocytosis and skin lesions were present in admission. She rapidly developed severe lung infection and multiorgan failure that led to her death. Bearing in mind her medical history of thymoma， it seems that the patient developed GVHD-like disease characterized by colitis， skin lesions， normal hepatic function and hypogammaglobulinemia. It was also accompanied with agranulocytosis and positive autoimmune profile similar with this observed in SLE. According to our knowledge this is the first case report with GVHD-like disease associated with agranulocytosis and SLE diagnosed eight years after thymectomy. Studying the lymphoid population of patient’s peripheral blood we observed an interesting increased number of naive T-cell population that confirmed the suspicion of T-cell dysregulation， happened probably in bone marrow that disturbs the control of autoreactivity. The production of different types of antibodies attacking several parts of the body induces a phenotype similar with that we observe in|删除段之间换行|GVHD after allogeneic transplantation. Simultaneously， the possibly production of antibody against GM-CFU， indirectly proved by in vitro cultures， causes the agranulocytosis. Unfortunately， the rapid aggravation of patient clinical status did not allow us to proceed to biopsies that would show typical histopathological organ injuries that would reinforce the diagnosis of GVHD-like disease.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n\n【32】In conclusion， GVHD-like diseaseis a rare multiorgan autoimmune disease that is associated with thymoma at diagnosis as well as after thymectomy.Dysfunction in selection process permits to lymphoid population to react abnormally against antigen that should be recognized as familial. It is likelythat the pathophysiologyofHSCT-associated GVHD is similar to that seen in thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. Theoretically， self-reactive deregulated T cells， originating in the thymoma， are responding similarly to grafted allogenic lymphocytes. IDermatologists， hematologists， oncologists， gastroenterologists， and pathologists should maintain a high index of suspicion for TAMA in patients with thymoma， who have a morbilliform skin eruption， chronic diarrhea， abnormal liver enzymes associated with other immune paraneoplastic syndromes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

En bloc removal is advised to prevent recurrence. Replacement of the removed bone was done by several methods. We present a report of two cases； one a child with aneurismal bone cyst， and an adult woman with aggressive giant cell tumor. Both bones removed completely and replaced by the third metatarsal bone of the left foot.

Giant Cell Tumor (GCT) and Aneurismal Bone Cyst(ABC) may give the same clinical and radiological pictures. GCT is a rare benign bone lesion most often found in the extremities of women in the third and fourth decades of life. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment and usually consists of intralesional curettage. Local control rates range from 80% to 90% after this procedure. ABC is a reactive lesion of bone， locally destructive and not considered as a true neoplasm. Most common in proximal humerus， around the knee and spine. Treated by curettage and bone graft with a recurrence rate up to 20%. Aggressive inaccessible lesions may be treated by arterial embolization or low dose radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Aggressive ABC and GCT occur in the metacarpal bones， grow fast and tend to recur after curettage removal. They can be multicentral and destroy the whole bone and the Metatarsophalangeal Joints (MPJ) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>. These conditions can affect greatly the function ofthe hand. Drastic treatment is by ray amputation whichleaves immense dysfunction. Complete en bloc removal ofthe affected bone with adjacent soft tissue and replacement provide cure，preservation of function and cosmoses of the hand 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. Replacement of the removed metacarpal can be done by different modalities； autografting with metatarsal bone， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u> vascular or non-vascular fibular graft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> silicone end prosthesis and iliac crest graft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. A small subset of patients with incompletely resectable GCT or with lesions that are surgically inaccessible may be treated with moderate-dose radiotherapy (45-50 Gy) and have a 65% to 80% likelihood of being locally controlled 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. We report 2 cases of aggressive ABC and GCT of the second metacarpal with gross destruction of bone， removed and replaced completely with the third metatarsal bone successfully\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Case 1\n\n【7】Eight years old boy presented with painful swelling of the left hand in the area of the second metacarpal bone of three months duration. The swelling was spontaneous with no history of previous trauma or infection in the hand. On physical examination， hard oval swelling on the dorsum ofthe hand in the second metacarpal area measuring 3 cm x2 cm. The mass was moderately tender on deep palpation. The range of movement of the second MPJ was moderately affected， and the neurovascular bundle was intact. Radiological examination revealed a largelytic lesion involving the whole second metacarpal bone， expansile ballooning in shape reported as aneurismal bone cyst.\n\nDecision was made to do en bloc removal and replacement with complete third metatarsal|删除段之间换行|bone. Dorsal approach was appropriate， lazy S incision done， separation and isolation of the extensor tendons， then removal of the whole MC with its periosteum. The harvested metatarsal， with its periosteum， was implanted at the site of the removed metacarpal and fixed with intramedullary K wire for eight weeks. Care was taken to reconstruct the MPJ. Plaster of Paris (POP) volar splint keeping slight dorsiflexion of the wrist and 80 degree flexion of the MPG kept for 8 weeks. The K wire was removed by the end of 12 weeks when index mobilization started.Histopathologic examination of the excised metacarpal revealed aneurismal bone cyst . After18 months follow up， the graft was completely incorporated and the second MPJ movements were satisfactory， no recurrence at the site， normal appearance of the hand and no morbidity at the donor foot.\n\n【9】Case 2\n\nThirty six years old housewife referred with a painful swelling of her left hand for six months. She carried a histopathological report of giant cell tumor from a biopsy of the second metacarpal bone. Radiological examination showed complete destruction of the bone. Treatment was by en bloc removal of the affected second metacarpal bone with replacement by the left third metatarsal bone|删除段之间换行|placed and fixed by K. wire for 12 weeks. Dorsal approach was used as well， care taken to reconstruct the second MPJ. Rehabilitation by passive and active movement of the joint after three weeks from surgery. After 42 months the hand was free of recurrence and maintained good function with no morbidity at the donor left foot.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\nAggressive benign tumors of the hand are rare； they can destroy the whole metacarpal bone. They occur in young age group， grossly affecting the function of the hand. These tumors can be multicentric and tend to recur after local removal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，7，9，12\\]</u>. En bloc resection is the preferred method to ensure the cure of the disease. To preserve the function of the hand， replacement of the removed metacarpal is done by several methods； free fibular graft， vascular iliac crest strut， cement spacer， all with or without endoprosthesis， and autotrasplant of metatarsal bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-9，13-15\\]</u>. We presented two cases of successful autotransplant of metatarsal bone for a completely destroyed second metacarpal with the MPJ. The first was for a child with aneurismal bone cyst， and the second for a woman with aggressive giant cell tumor. After 18-42 months of follow up this method proved to cure the disease with retrieval of a good satisfactory function as well as the cosmetic appearance of the hand. Mikkelsen OA and Menon J used metatarsal head to replace destroyed MPJ in rheumatoid patients with satisfactory results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. Saikat Sau also used metatarsals to replace destroyed metacarpal bones by giant cell tumors with satisfactory|删除段之间换行|functional results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Because of the rarity of theses tumors， studies of large number of patients are not available， however many case report studies have been published consistent with our results. We recommend metatarsal replacement as it is more physiological and less demanding. In addition， it provides cure with satisfactory function and cosmoses.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The objective of this article is to analyze the combination of two well known surgical techniques： turning over the alar cartilages as well as the addition of grafts in order to obtain satisfying esthetic and functional long term results.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： From August 2016to June 2018，62 rhinoplasties， a combination of both primary and revision cases， were performed at our hospital 8 of these involved the correction of concave alar cartilages. The turnover technique alone or in combination with Batten grafts was performed.\n\n【3】Results： Immediate and 3 month’s post-operative esthetic results using the turnover flap technique were satisfactory. Alar batten grafts were occasionally employed in order to maintain the newly positioned alar cartilages and avoid long-term contour depressions.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The combination of these two techniques seems to be an interesting solution to maintain long-term esthetic results.\n\n【5】Keywords： Alar convexity； Rhinoplasty； Alar batten graft； Nasal tip； Nasal valve\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Concave lower lateral cartilages not only cause an esthetic defect but can also lead to external nasal valve insufficiency. This defect can be congenital， post traumatic or iatrogenic following a previous rhinoplasty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.Over thelast twenty years， multiple surgical techniques have been developed to address this issue. Nen uses trans cartilaginous sutures to recreate the complex convexities of the alar cartilages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Fischer， Toriumi and Becker all use alar batten grafts， mostly to correct an insufficient external nasal valve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>. Procedures involving turning over the alar cartilages were introduced a few years ago and recently popularized by Haack 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and Janis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， which are today the most commonly used techniques.\n\n【8】Admittedly， rhinoplasty techniques must stand the test of time and provide pleasing long-term results. As Toriumi mentioned in his presentation at the Sixth Bergamo Open Rhinoplasty Course(Bergamo， Italy， March 2018)， the nose can continue to evolve for up to 10 years post rhinoplasty. This is why we propose systematically combining alar batten grafts to the turnover flap technique in order to prevent the appearance of a posterior concavity created by flipping over the medial portion of the alar cartilage.\n\n【9】The objective of this article is to demonstrate that combining these two techniques： alar batten grafts and turning over the alar cartilages， can be beneficial in the management of concave alar cartilages and provide pleasing long-term esthetic results.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】Patients\n\nFrom august 2016 until the end of July 2018 we performed 62 primary and secondary rhinoplasties at our hospital. During this period we corrected 8 concaves malformations. Lower lateral crural turnover flap (n=3) and lower lateral crural turnover flap combined with alar batten|删除段之间换行|graft. A-C) Right unilateral concave alar cartilage. D) Dissection line of the lower lateral crural reverse plasty.E-G) 1 month results. H) Lower lateral reverse palsy and fixation of the graft. I-K) 3 months results. L) View of the depressian at the level of the pyriform aperture.\n\n【13】graft (n=3) were performed. The follow up period ranged from 2 to24 months.\n\n【14】Surgical technique\n\n【15】All patients underwent an open rhinoplasty. Local anesthesia consisting of xylocaine 1% with epinephrine was utilized in order to achieve hemostatic control and hydro-dissection. The alar cartilage was dissected in its integrity， both internally and externally， with careful attention not to violate the vestibular mucosa. The division of the cartilage is done at the beginning of the concavity and is complete. In certain situations (n=2)， in order to limit alar retraction， the section was incomplete in order to preserve 2 mm of alar cartilage along the rim (modification proposed by Gilbert Aiach and described in Haack's article) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Lower lateral crural turnover flap (n=3)\n\n【17】The cartilage is then dissected and turned over in order to expose its convex side. The cartilage is then sutured in place with 5/0 PDS， medially to the remaining crus and laterally to the adjacent soft tissues， with careful attention not to violate vestibular skin.\n\n【18】Lower lateral crural turnover flap combined with alar batten graft (n=3)\n\n【19】The technique is the same as previously described with the addition of alar batten grafts harvested from the cartilaginous septum. In the majority of cases， these rectangular grafts measure 18 mm to25 mm in length and 4 mm to 6 mm in width. It is important to have sufficient length in order to properly flatten the newly turned alar cartilage. It is fixed to the alar cartilage with 5/0 PDS suture between its middle and distal third. The lateral end of the alar batten graft then lies against the pyriform aperture as usual.\n\n【20】Case 1： Lower lateral crural turnover flap\n\n【21】This is a 24-year-old patient that consulted for right nasal obstruction as well as esthetic concerns concerning a right concave alar cartilage . She underwent a primary open rhinoplasty procedure consisting of a unilateral lower lateral crural turnover flap. No other surgical techniques were performed .\n\n【22】Case 2： Lower lateral crural turnover flap combined with alar batten graft\n\n【23】This is a 61-year-old patient that consulted for esthetic concerns regarding bilateral concave alar cartilages， without any associated breathing issues . A primary open rhinoplasty procedure involving bilateral turnover flapas with alar batten grafts was performed. No other surgical techniques were performed. Furthermore， conservative hump resection， as per the patient's wishes， was accomplished. This patient did not want his nose to be deprojected .\n\n【24】Results\n\n【25】In the first case， the use of the lower lateral turnover flap provided immediate satisfying esthetic results by diminishing the concave aspect of the right alar cartilage. Furthermore， right external nasal valve collapse was improved with increased right nasal airflow .\n\n【26】However， as early as 3 months post-operatively， a change in the esthetic appearance of the nose was noticed consisting of recurrence of alar cartilage collapse as well as a depression at the level of the pyriform aperture. The nasal airway remained patent. This change could be due to lack of support of the lateral end of the alar cartilage against the pyriform aperture .\n\n【27】In the second case， in order to diminish this risk， the decision was made to add alar batten grafts in order to provide lateral support to the newly flipped alar cartilages and prevent late recurrence of collapse. Both immediate and long-term results were very satisfying.\n\n【28】Discussion\n\n【29】The repair of deformed alar cartilages is a real challenge during rhinoplasty given their esthetic and functional importance. The majority of the time， an excessive convexity is to blame. However， concavities can occur and rhinoplasty surgeons should be familiar with the various surgical techniques needed for correction， especially if the concavity is associated with external valve collapse and breathing difficulties.\n\nBy dissecting the lateral crus， flipping it over， and putting it back in place we can “reconstruct\"a new lateral crus and reshape it to correct the concavity without the need to harvest additional grafting|删除段之间换行|material. By preserving a band of cartilage caudally， the continuity of the lateral crus is maintained. Unfortunately， this surgical technique seems to be associated with inconsistent long-term results， mainly involving recurrence of the collapse laterally and a depression at the level of the pyriform aperture， likely due to weak lateral support.\n\n【31】Toriumi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> extensively describes multiple types of cartilaginous alar grafts used to correct functional issues while preserving the integrity and esthetic appearance of the lateral nasal wall. Long-term follow-up of these grafts has proven satisfactory with no evidence of warping or absorption. The coupling of the alar batten graft to the turnover flap can therefore provide a promising solution in order to optimize long-term results.\n\n【32】Cakir et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， in his interesting description of nasal surface anatomy， concludes that a good esthetic result relies on certain lines， reflections and shadows with specific proportions and cut-offs. The complete esthetic evaluation of nasal surface anatomy utilizes geometry and the existence of a lateral drop-off angle of the lateral crus is defined. Lateral esthetic lines are therefore of paramount importance and serve to highlight the triangular nature of a nose通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It is therefore necessary to flatten the cartilage in order to avoid excessive convexity that would go against these esthetic norms.\n\n【33】删除6:<u>1\\. Gruber RP， Nahai F， Bogdan MA， Friedman GD.

Patients inherit one copy of mutated RPE65 gene from both parents (mutation site may be different). The function of RPE65gene is to make RPE65 protein， an enzyme involving in the visual cycle (converts light into electrical signals) which is important for normal vision. If two copies of RPE65 genes are mutated， the number of RPE65 proteins will rapidly decrease or disappear， resulting in the block of the visual cycle and causing visual impairment. The condition of vision loss will become worse with age， and the patients may even be totally blind in young adulthood. In the United States， almost 1，000 to 2，000 people are affected by eye diseases due to biallelic RPE65 mutation.\n\n【2】There was limited effective drug or treatment to cure the biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy prior to Luxturna. A common applied treatment is using the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System， an artificial device that can help patients with blindness caused by outer retinopathy restore a basic vision. This device is first approved in the United States under a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) and is now commercially allowed in many countries. The Argus II System includes external components (a pair of glasses with camera and a portable computer) and internal components (a specific microelectrode implanted into eyes by surgery). The camera on the glasses can capture external images and the computer translates the light perception into electricalstimulation and is received by implanted electrode to activate retinal cells. The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System is proved to be relatively safe and effective； however， the recovery of vision acuity varies in different patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【3】The mechanism of Luxturna is to transmit a normal copy of the RPE65 gene directly to living retinal cells through a transformed adeno-associated virus as a vector. Thus， RPE65 proteins can be complemented and the visual cycle can continue again.\n\n【4】FDA review of clinical safety and efficacy\n\n【5】This section discusses the clinical trial program of Luxturna， including t thestudyydesign， important resultsand FDA's recommendations. The Luxturna regulatory approval is based on a clinical phase 1 analysis and a clinical phase 3 studies that established the key safety and efficacy proof for the BLA submission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Phase 1 and phase 3 studies： The phase 1 study was an open-label， dose-escalation protection study in a total of 12 patients with reported retinal dystrophy associated with biallelic RPE65 mutations. Eleven of 12 patients with an injection time of 1.7 to 4.6 years received subretinal Luxturna injection to either eye. One patient got just one eye with a subretinal injection. Additionally， the Phase 1 analysis evaluated three doses and results indicated that no apparent dose\n\n【7】Table 2： Magnitude of MLMT score change using both eyes at year删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n| MLMT Score Change  | LUXTURNAn=21  | Control n=10  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | \\-0  | 3(30%)  |\n| 0  | 2(10%)  | 3(30%)  |\n| 1  | 8(38%)  | 3(30%)  |\n| 2  | 5(24%)  | 1(10%)  |\n| 3  | 5(24%)  | 0  |\n| 4  | 1(4%)  | 0  |\n\n【9】Source： FDA Statistical and Clinical Reviews\n\n【10】that might affect safety， bioactivity， or preliminary efficacy. The high dose (1.5×10\" vector genome in an injection volume of 0.3 mL) was chosen for the phase 3 study.\n\n【11】The Phase 3 study was an open-label， randomized， controlled， cross-over trial. It was developed to test the effectiveness and efficacy of Luxturna sequential subretinal injection into each eye. Patients were randomized to either the Luxturna therapy group or the observational control group in a 2：1 ratio，and were monitored for the primary efficacy evaluation for duration of one year. After one year of study， patients in the control group were crossed over to receive Luxturna. The phase 3 study recruited 31 patients in the United States from two locations. At the stage of baseline evaluation， 21 of the 31participants were randomized to the therapy group with one drop. Ten patients were randomized to the control group with withdrawal of consent of one patient at the screening visit. A crossover study was conducted in the nine patients with one-year observation of Luxturna injection. The mean age was 15 years (4 to 44 years)， including 20(64%) pediatric patients (4 to 17 years) and 11 adult patients. The subretinal injection period ranged from 6 to 18 days for each patient's two eves.\n\n【12】Efficacy evaluation： The primary efficacy endpoint in the phase3 study was change in Multi-Luminance Mobility Testing (MLMT) performance from baseline to one vear after Luxturna administration. MLMT assessed the ability of a patient to traverse a course correctly and at a fair speed at various degrees of ambient light. The MLMT was measured at one or more of seven light levels， ranging from 400lux (corresponding to a brightly lit office) to 1 lux (corresponding to a moonless summer night)，using both eyes andeach eye independently. A score code ranging from 0 to 6 was assigned to each light level. A higher score implied that a patient was able to pass the test at a lower light level. Patients who did not pass MLMT in the brightest environment (400 lux) were given a score of -1. Each patient's MLMT was recorded and tested by independent， blinded graders. The MLMT score was the lowest light level at which the patient successfully passed the MLMT. Another parameter defined in this study is the MLMT score change from baseline to the end of study. An increase of the MLMT score suggested an improvement of eyesight. Additional efficacy endpoints included Full-Field Light Sensitivity Threshold(FST) and Visual Acuity (VA). The phase 1 and phase 3 regulatory review analyses are summarized below.\n\nThe results of the primary endpoint (MLMT score change) from|删除段之间换行|| X180 X365 Study Duration (Days) Figure 1： MLMT time-course over two years (using both eyes).

A median MLMT score change of two and zero were observed in the Luxturna treatment group and control group， respectively， independent of the use of both eyes or the first-treated eye. An MLMT score change oftwo or greater is considered a clinically meaningful benefit for functional vision.\n\n【16】Table 2 and Table 3 illustrate the number and percentage of patients with different magnitudes of MLMT score change using both eyes and individual eyes， respectively， at year删除4:<u> 1</u>. If we consider both eyes， eleven patients (11/21，52%) in the Luxturna treatment group had an MLMT score change of two or greater， while only one patient(1/10，10%) in the control group had an MLMT score change of two， .\n\n【17】On the other hand， if we consider the first-treated eye and second-treated eye separately， fifteen patients (15/21，71%) in the Luxturna treatment group had an MLMT score change of two or greater， while no patient in the control group had a score change of 2 or greater.\n\nSafety assessment： Twenty-seven (27/41，66%) ofthe 41 patients(12 from phase 1 and 29 from phase 3， totally 81 eyes) receiving Luxturna had ocular adverse reactions in 46 injected eyes (46/81，57%). The most common adverse reactions (incidence 2 5%) were conjunctival hyperemia， cataracts， increased intraocular pressure， retinal tears， dellen， macular hole， eye inflammation， macular breaks， subretinal deposits， eye irritation， eye pain， and maculopathies . Whether these ocular adverse symptoms are associated with injection of Luxturna is not clear. However， most of these adverse|删除段之间换行|events were temporary and controllable. There were no deaths in the clinical studies. There were two serious adverse reactions， including (i) endophthalmitis (infection inside of the eye) with a series of subsequent complications， and (ii) loss of vision due to fovea thinning as a result of the subretinal injection. Systemic adverse events included hyperglycemia， nausea， vomiting， and leukocytosis. These systemic events were likely caused by systemic corticosteroid use and reactions to anesthesia.\n\n【19】As noted by the FDA， Luxturna subretinal injection should be given only to patients who have viable retinal cells as determined by the treating physician (s). Treatment with Luxturna must be done separately in each eye on separate days， with at least six days between surgical procedures. Patients should be treated with a short course of oral prednisone to limit the potential immune reaction.\n\n【20】Summary： The safety and efficacy of Luxturna were well established in a clinical trial with 41 patients aged between 4 and删除4-1:<u>44</u>. All participants had confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations. The primary efficacy endpoint of Luxturna was based on the phase 3 study with 31 participants by measuring the change from baseline to one year in a subject's ability to navigate an obstacle course at various light levels. The treatment group demonstrated significant improvements in their ability to complete the obstacle course at low light levels as compared to the control group. The most common adverse reactions， such as eye redness， cataract， can be mitigated by medical care.\n\n【21】Advisory committee recommendations\n\n【22】The Cellular， Tissue， and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee\n\n【23】Table 4： Ocular Adverse Reactions Following Treatment with Luxturna (N=41).\n\n| Adverse Reaction  | Patients n=41  | Treated Eyes n=81  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Any ocular adverse reaction  | 27 (66%)  | 46 (57%)  |\n| Conjunctival hyperemia  | 9(22%)  | 9(11%)  |\n| Cataract  | 8(20%)  | 15(19%)  |\n| Increased intraocular pressure  | 6(15%)  | 8(10%)  |\n| Retinal tear  | 4(10%)  | 4(5%)  |\n| Dellen (thining of the corneal stroma)  | 3(7%)  | 3(4%)  |\n| Macular hole  | 3(7%)  | 3(4%)  |\n| Subretinal deposits\\  | 3(7%)  | 3(4%)  |\n| Eye inflammation  | 2(5%)  | 4(5%)  |\n| Eye irritation  | 2(5%)  | 2(2%)  |\n| Eye pain  | 2(5%)  | 2(2%)  |\n| Maculopathy (wrinkling on the surface of the macula)  | 2(5%)  | 3(4%)  |\n| Foveal thinning and loss of foveal function  | 1(2%)  | 2(2%)  |\n| Endophthalmitis (infection inside of the eye)  | 1(2%)  | 1(1%)  |\n| Fovea dehiscence (separation of the retinal layers in the center of the macula)  | 1(2%)  | 1(1%)  |\n| Retinal hemorrhage  | 1(2%)  | 1(1%)  |\n\nNote： \\Transient appearance of a ring-like deposit at the retinal injection site 1-6 days after injection without symptoms Source： Madified from the applicant's BLA submission|删除段之间换行|(CTGTAC) evaluated the safety and effectiveness of Luxturna， giving several feedbacks. First， a 2-score increase of MLMT is clinical meaningful. Second， the potential risks of Luxturna are acceptable. Third， Luxturna may not work until 8 to 12 months of age because the retina has not been fully developed. Fourth， it should be considered if the efficacy of Luxturna declines over time. Consequently， the CTGTAC voted 16(Yes) to 0(No) in favor the approval of Luxturna.\n\n【26】Concluding Remarks\n\n【27】In this paper， a case study regarding Luxturna which is a gene therapy drug intended treating a rare disease of an inherited form of vision loss that may result in blindness. The FDA granted Luxturna(i) priority review， (ii) breakthrough therapy and (iii) orphan drug designations to assist the sponsor in Luxturna development. As discussed in Section 4， FDA's recommendation for regulatory approval of Luxturna was made based on a phase 1 clinical study and a phase 3 clinical study.\n\n【28】Although the CTGTAC voted for approval of Luxturna， several questions and concerns remain. These questions， which are likely to occur due to small sample size， include， but are not limited to (i) the treatment effect may have been contaminated by some covariates and/or interaction/confounding factors， (ii) no scientific/clinical or statistical justification for the selection endpoint and/or clinically meaningful difference， (iii) it is not clear that the study design can provide an accurate and reliable assessment of the treatment effect， and (iv) statistical methods for assessment of treatment may not be adequate (e.g.， shift analysis before and after treatment was not done). In addition， one of the major concerns is probably that whether the performance of Luxturna based on limited number of patients is not by chance alone and hence is reproducibility. Based on a quick assessment， the reproducibility probability was calculated based on the observed responses and the variability associated with the responses of the 31 subjects. The result indicates that there is a less than 60% probability of reproducibility if the study is conducted under similar experimental conditions in the future.\n\n【29】Thus， it is suggested that statistical considerations as described in Section 3 and some innovative thinking regarding study design and analysis should be taken into consideration when conducting rare diseases clinical trials.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

According to GLOBOCAN， it is an estimation of more than 1.9 million new cases of CRC and 930，000 deaths in2020通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. CRC occurs as a result of multiple biochemical processes regulated by genetic mutations， microenvironmental factors and epigenetic alterations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Metastatic colon cancer is a highly aggressive tumor type with a higher grade of malignancy among colon cancers and is characterized by poor treatment efficacy and poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Several predictive biomarkers have emerged to aid treatment decisions in metastatic colorectal cancer， such as KRAS (40%)， NRAS (5%-10%)，and BRAF (8%-10%) mutation status， tumor laterality， Microsatellite Instability (MSI) (5%-7%)， and other less common alterations such as HER2 (2%)，MET(2%)，NTRK(0.2%-2.4%)，ALK(0.2%-2.4%) and ROS1 (0.2%-2.4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. Chemotherapy combinations based on the inclusion of 5-Fluorouracil(5-FU) are the standard of care for metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC). However， there is some proof that patients with DNA Mismatch Repair-deficient (dMMR)/Microsatellite Instability-High(MSI-H) mCRC respond to conventional chemotherapy less favorably and have a poorer prognosis than those with Mismatch Repair proficient (pMMR) or Microsatellite Stable (MSS) disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. MSI is associated with high mutational and neo-antigenic loads and the immune system recognizes the tumor， hence the high response and survival observed with immunotherapy in MSI-H CRC， Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) blockade has emerged as a highly effective therapy for dMMR/MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-11\\]</u>. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo') are the two recognized PD-1 inhibitors approved by the FDA for patients with dMMR or MSI-H metastatic CRC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Data from the KEYNOTE-177 study found that pembrolizumab met the criterion of superiority for progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy， with longer progression-free survival for pembrolizumab (median 16.5 months，95% CI 5.4-38.1) vs. chemotherapy (median 8.2months， 95% CI 6.1-10.2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Despite significant advances in Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) therapy， more than half of patients do not respond to immune monotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Multiple ongoing studies are currently investigating the benefit of adding chemotherapy to PD-4/PD-L1 inhibitors in patients with dMMR/MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer， including the COMMIT， CA209-8HW  and MK-1308A-008  studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【14】In this paper， we report just such a unique case study of a MSI-H CRC patient with a KRAS wild-type mutation， where we aimed to highlight the superior anti-tumor activity of combining PD-1blockers with chemotherapeutic agents as a therapeutic option for MSI-H CRC.\n\n【15】Case Presentation\n\nA 29-year-old young man in Dunhuang City Hospital because of no obvious cause of bloody stools in 2021.12. Notably， several of the patient's relatives had colon， stomach， pancreatic， rectal and bladder cancers. The patient performed colonoscopy found： colon mass.2022.1.1， in Gansu Provincial People's Hospital，Department of Anus and Gastroenterology， chest， abdominal and pelvic CT examination showed： Sigmoid colon occupancy， more than the consideration of colorectal cancer (T3N2M1)， localized with the small bowel， the bladder may be adhered to the MRI of the whole abdomen found that MRI of whole abdomen revealed multiple enhancing nodules along the peritoneum in the abdominal cavity， which was mostly considered as metastasis. The patient and his family requested conservative treatment， and after excluding the contraindications to chemotherapy， he was discharged from the hospital on 2022.1.9 after1 cycle of intravenous oxaliplatin 250 mg d1， and oral Xiloda 2.0 g three times a day d1-14 chemotherapy. On 2022.02.18， the patient was readmitted to the hospital for thoracoabdominal-pelvic CT， which suggested that the sigmoid colon occupation had increased in extent compared with the CT findings on 2022.1.3， and the patient's disease progressed. We obtained the pathological tissue wax block of the patient from Dunhuang City Hospital and performed immunohistochemical staining to obtain the results of MLH1(+)； MSH2通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>； MSH6通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>； PMS2(+)， which suggested that the patient was MSI-H； at the same time， the immunohistochemical staining results showed： Tubular choriocarcinoma of the (colon)， the glands with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia， and some of the glands with carcinomatosis， as the tissue from the Dunhuang City Hospital， the tissue was superficial and fragmented， and the possibility of higher-level lesions could not be excluded. Then we improved the genetic testing： KRAS Exon-4 mutation was found. At this time， the patient was clearly diagnosed as sigmoid colon malignant tumor (T3N2M1stage IV KRAS Exon-4 mutation MSI-H) with retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis.

Completed 13 cycles of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy treatment .\n\n【20】Discussion and Conclusion\n\nImmunotherapy， as an innovative anti-cancer strategy， activates the body s immune response by intervening in the signaling pathways between tumor cells and the host immune system， enabling the body’s immune cells to recognize and attack tumor cells. In MSI-H colon cancer patients， inhibitors targeting immune checkpoints (e.g.，PD-1or PD-L1 inhibitors) have been shown to be effective， which bring significant therapeutic effects by restoring the anti-tumor immune|删除段之间换行|response and promote prolonged survival in a subset of patients. It has been reported in the literature that MSI-H/dMMR stage IV colorectal cancer patients represent approximately 4% to 5% of all colorectal cancer patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. A pooled analysis of 13 clinical studies of first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer showed that the median Overall Survival (OS) was 6.16 months for dMMR patients and 8.1 months for pMMR patients (HR=35.95；1% CI： 13.1-61.0； P=001.27 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.MSI-H/dMMR mCRC patients have a poorer prognosis， especially patients with the BRAF V28E mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. ICIs targeting the PD-1 protein are highly effective and are now the first-line standard of care for patients with dMMR/MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Although ICI therapy has made progress in colorectal cancer treatment， >50% of dMMR/MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer patients are non-responders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Therefore， it is particularly significant to go in search of new strategies to extend the benefits ofPD-1 immunotherapy to improve the prognosis ofpatients with dMMR/MSI-H mCRC. It was reported at 2022 ASCO ANNUAL MEETING that 12.3% of patients in the chemotherapy group progressed compared to 29.4% in the pembrolizumab group， and that these MSI-H patients may be primary resistant to immunotherapy， and whether they are better suited for chemotherapy or whether they are suited for the immune-combination chemotherapy，mFOLFOX6/evacizumab +Atezolizum combination regimen is underway in in the NRG-GI004/ SWOG-S1610 COMMIT study. It is also worthwhile to reflect on the fact that MSI-H patients with K-RAS mutations do not benefit from immunotherapy in the same way that KRAS wild-type patients do. There is no research data on primary immune resistance， and various clinical attempts are underway， such as double immunotherapy， immunotherapy combined with conventional chemotherapy， or immunotherapy combined with antiangiogenic therapy，etc. The CheckMate-142 study showed that the ORR of PD-1antibody combined with CTLA-4 antibody was significantly higher than that of PD-1 monoclonal antibody monotherapy in the backline treatment (51% vs. 31%)； and the first-line treatment with dual immunotherapy had an ORR of up to 69% and a complete remission rate of 13%， which was significantly higher than other studies of PD-1 antibody monotherapy. In addition， it has been reported in the literaturethat patients with metastaticcolorectal cancer got a complete pathological response after concurrent use of pembrolizumab and radiotherapy， which suggests that the combination of PD-1blockade and radiotherapy may be a potential therapeutic strategy for metastatic colorectal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Chemotherapy in combination with immunotherapy is another common clinical attempt to treat some patients with very high tumor loads， where there is a risk of tumor progression prior to the onset of immunotherapy alone. Therefore， combination chemotherapy has the potential to help or reduce the risk of early tumor progression， buying valuable time for immunotherapy to take effect. Unfortunately， no clinical studies have yet demonstrated that chemotherapy in combination with a PD-1 antibody significantly improves the efficacy of immunotherapy compared to immunotherapyalone. In the case of the patient reported here， it was the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy that enabled the patient to survive for nearly two years or more.\n\nIn conclusion， although immune checkpoint inhibitors have fundamentally changed the clinical management of MSI/dMMR CRC patients， some MSI/dMMR CRC patients may develop primary resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors， and finding new ways to improve the prognosis and prolong the survival of patients in these patients is an issue that deserves in-depth study now. Therefore， even|删除段之间换行|though the booming precision medicine and immunotherapy are at the forefront and hold great promise for the treatment of cancer， we still have to work hard to select the right patients， find the right targets， and give the best treatment to the patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In addition， pomegranate extract inhibits the proliferation of human cancer cells and modulates inflammatory subcellular signal pathways and apoptosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In recent years， most health advantages of pomegranate have been attributed to the presence of ETs， mainly punicalagins and Ellagic Acid (EA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>.

After PJ consumption， the remaining ETs and EA are retained unabsorbed in the gut lumen where they likely interact with the complex intestinal bacteria of the microbiome.

In the urine， the concentrations of DMEAG and UAG were at much higher concentration compared to breast milk. For both subjects， a trend of increase of DMEAG and UAG concentration was observed from day删除4:<u> 1-14</u>. The absence of DMEAG in breast milk was associated with absence or very low DMEAG in the urine .\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】To the best of our knowledge， this is the first human case report describing the presence of ellagic acid metabolites in the breast milk. Pomegranate has a long history of use for medicinal purposes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The potent antioxidant property as well as other biological activities of pomegranate has been mainly attributed hydrolysable tannins(ETs) including punicalagins and EA as well as anthocyanins and other polyphenols found in pomegranate extract and juice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Pomegranate ETs are hydrolyzed to EA in the stomach. EA can then be absorbed into the bloodstream or further transformed to bacterial-derived metabolites including urolithins A-D in the intestine. Urolithins can be absorbed from the colon， conjugated， and excreted in the urine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，9，10\\]</u>. Depending on the individual's gut microbiota， variability of the urolithin formation has been observed. Among healthy overweight/obese individuals about 57% formed urolithin A(UA)， 31% urolithin B (UB) and 12% did not form urolithins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，13\\]</u>. EA and urolithins are both bioavailable. Our previous bioavailability study demonstrated that after consumption of 180 mL of PomJ the metabolite DMEAG occurred the same day and plasma EA reached the maximum concentration at 0.06 umol/L + 0.01 umol/L 1 h after PomJ consumption. While an increase from 0.04 umol/L to 0.11umol/L of conjugated urolithin A in plasma occurred between 0.5 and6 h and in all participants conjugated UA and UB occurred in urine24 h after consumption of PomJ通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. It is interesting to see that breast milk containing UAG at the level between 5 nmol/L to 36 nmol/L(0.005 umol/L to 0.036 umol/L)， within the range of previous plasma UAGlevel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. More and more evidence has indicated that EA as well as its microbial metabolite urolithins are involved in many biological activities. The antioxidant， anti-inflammation， and antimutagenic effects of EA have been studied 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.Furthermore， neonatal Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in human newborns with motor and cognitive sequelae frequently seen in survivors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，19\\]</u>. HIE has been associated with increases in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and recent studies suggest that new avenues of treatments of neonatal HIE should include selective responses to the generation of oxidative damage通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，21\\]</u>. Phenolic phytochemicals are known for their antioxidant capacity， and studies have indicated the neuroprotective effects of dietary supplementation with food rich in phenolic compounds， such as green tea polyphenol EGCG，blueberry， and pomegranate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22-27\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\nBreast milk is the perfect nutrition for infants， a result of millions of years of evolution. In addition to providing a source of nutrition， breast milk contains a diverse array of microbiota and a myriad of biologicaly active components that are thought to guide the infant's developing mucosal immune system as well as neonatal gut microbiota.

Newborns often present with a moist umbilicus which can be associated with various abnormalities from simple granulomas to persistant urachus. When serous， feculent or bilious drainage are identified at the umbilicus it is suggestive or a patent omaphalomensenteric duct with fistulous communication with the umbilicus. Symptoms of fecal drainage (“congenital umbilical anus) and prolapse of the intestine are well known， however infrequent. The surgeon is advised to avoid resection of the umbilical \"tumor\"， in the fear of exposing intestinal lumen indicating a vitellointestinal remnant.\n\n【5】Newborns presenting with fecal drainage from the umbilicus can be quite alarming to parents Providing counsling and reassurance that the clinical diagnosis and subsequent treatment are both straight forward and curative. The extent of the work up andtiming oftreatment usually depends on the age of presentation and the ultimate diagnosis. Persistent omphalomesenteric duct remnant is a less common entity and fistula to the umbilical cord at birth remains rare. Here provide a brief review of the literature and describe a case where the patient presented at birth with an omphalomesenteric remnant fistula to the umbilical cord.\n\n【6】This report describes the case of a newborn presenting with a patent omphalomesenteric duct fistula identified at birth with meconuim in the umbilical cord. A 33 week male neonate was born to a mother with a known history of drug abuse who presented in labor without antenatal care. Maternal urine drug screen was positive for amines but the specific agent could not be identified. At birth he presented in mild respiratory distress with meconium discharge within the right side of his umbilical cord . There were no abdominal wall abnormalities and the remainder of the physical exam， including rectal exam， were unremarkable. Differential diagnoses included intestinal perforation， meconium peritonitis， and small omphalocele with perforation and patent omphalomesenteric duct with ileal fistula into the umbilical cord. An abdominal x-ray showed air filled small intestine without air-fluid levels or any intra-abdominal calcifications. The colon could not be confirmed on plain x-rays so contrast enema  was performed to interrogate the colon for any anomalies. The contrast enema showed no abnormalities and demonstrated contrast entering the umbilical cord confirming our diagnosis of patent omphalomesenteric duct remnant with ileal to umbilical cord fistula. A cardiac workup， including an echocardiogram and electrocardiogram， was negative except for a small patent ductus arteriosus.\n\nThe patient was subsequently taken to the operating room and an exploratory laparotomy through a supraumbilical omega incision was performed. An intraoperative diagnosis of a patent|删除段之间换行|omphalomesenteric duct with omphalo-ilio umbilical fistula was confirmed . Options for resection included a segmental small bowel resection to include the fistulous connection， a diverticulectomy across the base of the anomaly with a stapler， versus excising the base of the tract and performing a hand-sewn closure. Resection across the base of the fistula was performed by dissecting the fistulous connection away from the cord structures and stapling across the base with a JustRight 5mm stapler (JustRight Surgical， LLC. Boulder， CO， USA). This decision was purely surgeon preference to expedite and minimize the risk of stricture formation. At completion of the resection the closure was tested by milking intestinal contents across the segment of bowel under pressure. Once satisfied with the|删除段之间换行|resection， the abdomen was irrigated and closed in the usual fashion. The defect in the umbilical skin was closed with a pursestring suture and tacked to the fascia completing the umbilicoplasty. The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the NICU where he began feeding and was discharged without complication.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】The Omphalomesenteric duct is a communication between the primitive midgut and the yolk sac. Normally， the duct obliterates around 6 weeks of gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， yet varying degrees of incomplete obliteration can take place in 1-4% of infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Exact etiology of incomplete obliteration remains an enigma. Various teratogenic models are present in the literature however none accurately address a direct cause/effect relationship with these anomalies. In our patient the working hypothesis include maternal amine exposure throughout pregnancy which has been linked to abdominal wall defects and intestinal atresias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Meckel's diverticulum， vitellinecyst， vitelline ligament， and umbilical sinus represent incomplete obliteration of the omphalomesenteric duct and are the most common forms of presentation. Figure 4 shows various forms of omphlaomesenteric duct remanats withletter F illustratingour case. Meckel's diverticulum is the most common anomaly and is often asymptomatic. When symptomatic they can present with painless gastrointestinal bleeding， intestinal obstruction， intussusception and rarely Meckel's diverticulitis. An omphalomesenteric fistula， as in our patient， is a complete failure of obliteration of the omphalomesenteric duct and is a rare finding at birth. A review of the literature  found only one case of a patent omphalomesenteric duct presenting at birth with meconium in the umbilical cord. The report by Ng J et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> comprises a 10 year review which identified two cases of ileal umbilical fistula and its association with exomphalos minor. All of the other reports describe a delayed presentation and management of these umbilical anomalies.

To our knowledge， this is the first canine case of Salmonella spp. osteomyelitis.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 7 months old， male mixed breed dog weighing 16.5 kg was presented to XXX for worsening lameness on the right hind limb from 3 weeks. No other clinical sign was present. The dog was adopted from Sicily 4 weeks earlier， regularly vaccinated but without prophylaxis for ectoparasites. Other anamnestic information was unknown.\n\n【4】On presentation， the physical examination revealed poor body condition (BCS of 3/9)， muscular hypotrophy of the right hindlimb and increased thickness of the right femur with algia to palpation. The dog also had generalized lymphadenomegaly. Blood tests and hind limb radiography were performed. Hematologic abnormalities at presentation included normocytic， normochromic， mild regenerative anemia (Hematocrit \\[Hct\\] 32.2%)，leukopenia (2.84×10/mL；reference range，6-17×10/mL) characterized by lymphopenia (0.8×10/mL； range 1-4.8×10/mL)， neutropenia 1.69×10'/mL (range 3-12×10/mL) and thrombocytopenia (8×10'/mL； reference range 160-500×10/mL). The blood chemistry panel， including electrolytes， was normal except for hypoalbuminemia(2.02 g/dL； reference range 2.75 g/dL to 3.85 g/dL) and a decreased albumin/globulin ratio (0.46； reference range 0.75-1.35). Electrophoresis showed hypergammaglobulinemia. Coagulation panel was in the range of normality. Indirect Immunofluorescent (IF) assay test was performed on suspicion of an infectious disease， with positivity for Ehrlichia canis with a title of 1：1280. The radiographic exam of the right hind limb  revealed a focal osteopathy with severe mixed proliferative-lytic pattern. In particular， it was evident a focal deformation of the distal third of the femoral diaphysis， characterized by a severe and non-homogeneous increase of the radiopacity of the bone with evidence ofa radiolucent， sharply round， intralesional area. Moreover， there were an extensive proliferation of periosteal bone tissue with “a palisade” aspect， in correspondence with the caudal aspect of the lesion and thickening of the cortical bone involving a large part of the femoral diaphysis. The main differential diagnoses for this type of bone lesion were osteomyelitis or bone abscess with sequestrum (of bacterial or fungal origin) or neoplasia. Therefore， it was decided to carry out a bone biopsy and X-rays of the chest to exclude metastatic involvement. The lesion bone biopsy was performed with the patient under general anesthesia with a Jamshidi needle 10G：Seven bone biopsies were performed， of which four underwent histological examination； two were subjected to bacteriological examination and one to PCR examination for Ehrlichia canis detection. Waiting for the results of biopsy， the patient was placed on doxycycline 7.5 mg/kg BID for the treatment of Ehrlichia canis.\n\nThe histological examination revealed a moderate， chroniclympho plasma cellular osteomyelitis with areas of necrosis， severe fibrosis and bone remodeling. The PCR was negative for the presence of Ehrlichia canis， while the bacteriological culture was positive for the presence of Salmonella spp. with isolation of large amounts of the bacteria. A stool test was also performed which was negative for parasitic elements and negative for the presence of Salmonella spp. Accordingtothe antibiogram， Salmonella spp. was sensitive to doxycycline，therefore the already set therapy was kept unchanged. Clinical and radiographic checks were performed once a month for the first three months， then every 3 months up to a year. One month after the start of therapy， the dog was no longer limping. Check blood tests was performed with the resolution of hematological abnormalities. After 6 weeks an additional bone biopsy was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy. Bacteriological|删除段之间换行|examination of biopsies was negative. The focal lytic lesion of the bone progressively disappeared， and the periosteal reaction was considerably reduced while maintaining a thickening of the cortical bone . Doxycycline therapy was stopped after negative bacteriological result of bone biopsies.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory condition of bone usually caused by infectious agents， such as bacteria， fungal or viral agents通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>.The condition generally results from iatrogenic or spontaneous inoculation of these agents into traumatic or surgical wounds 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4\\]</u>. It can also develops following hematogenous spread to the bone， and occurs relatively more frequently in young than in adult animals， especially in those with predisposing conditions including failure of passive transfer of maternal immunity or concurrent infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Hematogenous osteomyelitis most frequently involve the metaphysis and epiphysis of developing bones in young dogs， and the diaphysis of long bones in adults， and localization within vertebral bodies can also occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. Radiographic evaluation is often helpful in successfully diagnosis of osteomyelitis， but the current gold standard is a positive microbial culture. The most common bacteria isolated in cases of osteomyelitis in dogs and cats are Staphylococcus spp.\n\n【8】(circa 60% of cases)， followed by Escherichia coli and Streptococcus spp. Other Gram-negative organisms (e.g.， Pasteurella，Pseudomonas， Proteus， Serratia and Klebsiella species) and Gram-positive organisms(e.g.， Corynebacterium spp.， Enterococci) have also been isolated. Anaerobic organisms should also be taken in consideration (e.g.， Bacteroides， Nocardia， Clostridium， Actinomyces， Fusobacterium)， andpolymicrobial infections are notuncommon. Moreover， fungal agents (e.g.， Blastomyces， Aspergillus， Candida， Cocidioides， Cryptococcus， Histoplasma) have been also isolated， even if not so commonly， and so are viral agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. Salmonella is a very rare agent of osteomyelitis and there are only few cases reported in human medicine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Even if young animals are thought to be predisposed to hematogenous osteomyelitis， in this case we present， the first suspect was a post traumatic osteomyelitis (bite injury or penetrating wound) due to the localization of the lesion and the severe periosteal reaction， usually not present in hematogenous infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However， being the patient's remote medical history unknown and blood culture not performed， a hematogenous infection cannot be totally excluded. Osteomyelitis can generally be managed medically，but some cases require surgical debridement with removal of sequestrum and necrotic bone or surrounding necrotic soft tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7，11，12\\]</u>. Antibiotic treatment should be based on an antimicrobial susceptibility test whenever possible. However， until culture and antibiotic susceptibility test results are available， broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The prognosis of osteomyelitis depends on the time of the presentation， the degree of alteration in bone architecture and response to treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In the case shown the choice of antimicrobial therapy was based on the outcome of the antibiogram and doxycycline was chosen as a treatment also for Ehrlichia canis.\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】This case represents a rare and unique presentation of Salmonella osteomyelitis in a dog.Osteomyelitis remains a challenge in all animal species commonly encountered in veterinary medicine.

In these cases， high-sensitivity cardiac enzymes alone could be insufficient to confirm an Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). However， the use of technetium-99(99Tc) Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) in the acute phase of an Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) may be useful in detecting abnormalities of coronary blood flow during acute myocardial ischemia.\n\n【6】In this article， we describe the case of a patient who presented with unstable angina while in the waiting room for a myocardial perfusion study. Gated-SPECT confirmed the diagnosis of Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI).\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 52-year-old female patient with a history of tobacco use came to our Nuclear Cardiology Department for myocardial perfusion assessment due to atypical angina. During her preparation for the test in the waiting room， she suddenly presented with oppressive chest pain 10/10 on the Visual Analogue (VAS)Scale whichlasted 10 min； and was accompanied by dyspnea and adrenergic symptoms. Three 12-lead EKGs taken at rest showed no ST-segment abnormalities ， while two more subsequent EKGs showed dynamic changes in the ST-segment . With the possibility of unstable angina， 10 mCi of Tc99m MIBI radiotracer was administered intravenously， and the patient was referred to the cardiology department for classification and management. Myocardial perfusion images during this period showed a non-transmural perfusion defect from the apical to the basal third of the inferior wall and in the inferolateral region (Right Coronary Artery\\[RCA\\]/Circumflex Artery \\[Cx\\] territory)， and a transmural apical and middle-third of anteroseptal perfusion defect， which extends as non-transmural to the middle-third of the septal and inferolateral walls (left anterior descending arteryterritory)，. The enzyme curve confirmed a NSTEMI. The patient was admitted to the catheterization laboratory， where an obstructive lesion was observed in the proximal segment of the Left Anterior Descending artery (LAD). Thus angioplasty with drug-eluting stent placement was decided.

In NSTEMI events， an enzymatic curve is useful to differentiate between myocardial infarction and unstable angina. In patients with unstable angina， mortality risk stratification scales like GRACE， TIMI or HEART are useful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. High-risk patients are submitted to coronary intervention，while intermediate-to-low risk patients have been shown to benefit more from noninvasive anatomical or functional studies， such as Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) or SPECT. The ERASE study demonstrated improved outcomes when nuclear medicine was employed， 2，475 patients with chest pain were|删除段之间换行|randomly assigned to a conventional or a SPECT-guided approach， demonstrating an improvement of triage effectiveness with the latter method 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Nuclear cardiology studies offer considerable advantages in a cardiology department， such as safe radiotracers use without prior renal or hepatic function evaluation； the versatility of usage in patients with cardiac devices (e.g.， pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators)； and the ability to demonstrate which territory ofthe myocardial wall is most affected.\n\nAdditionally， in patients that present in the acute phase ofan ACS， complete revascularization in comparison to revascularization of only the affected vessel is a current controversy. Studies like COMPLETE通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and DANAMI 3 PRIMULTI favor complete revascularization， whereas others like PRAMI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> or CULPRIT SHOCK 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> did not and even reported an increase of adverse events through complete|删除段之间换行|revascularization. In patients with unstable angina， evidence is even scarcer. The SMILE study evaluated 584 patients with NSTEMI who were randomly assigned to single or complete revascularization， revealing a discretely larger benefit with complete revascularization通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Myocardial perfusion studies allow physicians to determine which myocardial territories are at higher risk and if an invasive and aggressive revascularization strategy might be more appropriate.\n\nThe radiotracers of choice for these protocols are typically technetium-containing agents. Their physical and pharmacokinetic properties allow image acquisition of up to 6 h after administration， reflecting myocardial perfusion at the moment of intravenous injection. Most of the studies that have used SPECT in cardiology departments show both high sensitivity and a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) close to 100% for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction， especially if the radiotracer is injected during an episode of chest pain or during the 6 following hours. Its high sensitivity comes at the|删除段之间换行|expense of its low negative predictive value and specificity which is close to 75%. Another disadvantage is the requirement of an in-situ99Mo/99mTc generator for radiotracers preparation， in addition to the need for trained personnel and an exclusive emergency-image-acquisition gamma camera 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>.\n\n【19】A future direction for research could be the inclusion of Tc-containing agents (which give a “frozen\" image at the moment of administration) while comparing different revascularization strategies in patients with an ACS， aiming to identify the amount of viable myocardium.\n\nBecause of the above-mentioned advantages， myocardial perfusion imaging is an extremely useful tool in patients with chest pain and unclear or unavailable EKG or cardiac enzymes. Myocardial perfusion studies may be used to guide diagnosis， management and as a prognostic tool in patients that are admitted to the cardiovascular emergency room. They have demonstrated a significant risk reduction|删除段之间换行|(5% to 0.5%) of erroneous hospital discharge in patients with chest pain.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】Myocardial perfusion studies possess a high positive predictive value for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction， improving therapeutic interventions and patients'prognosis. Hence， they are of great use in emergency settings and for the evaluation of patients with chest pain. In this particular case， the anatomical and functional correlation between the perfusion defect at gated-SPECT and the obstructive lesion observed in angiography prompted the diagnostic and therapeutic decision in this patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We report a case of a patient with a large thyroid tumor invading the trachea， causing trachea narrowing and resulting in breathing difficulties， who required Awake Tracheal Intubation (ATI). A 54-year-old woman required surgery for removal of the thyroidtumor under general anesthesia. The tumor was invading and compressing the trachea， causing difficulty in breathing. To facilitate surgery， thyrocricocentesis and nerve block were considered but would have been difficult to implement. Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is expensive and has several complications during ECMO， such as failure of the oxygenation membrane， rupture of the circuit， coagulation of the system， intracranial hemorrhage， Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and infections. Placement of a tracheal stent may also worsen airway problems. The process of airway establishment in this case was completed without the need for ECMO or tracheal stent placement. If it refers to the avoidance of more expensive options and complications， an alternative would be local anesthetic to the airway， and successful ATI would reduce healthcare costs associated with other techniques.\n\n【2】Keywords： Awake； Fiberoptic intubation； Thyroid tumor； Trachea； Case\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Thyroid cancer is a common endocrine malignancy， and its incidence has been increasing for nearly three decades in most developed countries， while the overall mortality has decreased通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Patients with advanced disease often have difficulty breathing as a result of the thyroid tumor pressing on the trachea. However， there is little reported on the risk of malignant thyroid tumors invading the trachea， which can cause trachea narrowing and result in breathing difficulties. We report a successful Awake Tracheal Intubation (ATI) in a patient with a large thyroid tumor.\n\n【5】Cases Presentation\n\nA 54-year-old woman， who consented to the reporting of this case， presented for removal of a thyroid tumor during May 2021， which was involvingthe trachea. On admission，the patient reported repeated dyspnea for 5 years and aggravation for more than 10 days. Ultrasound examination revealed a thyroid tumor that needed immediate surgery. A Computerized Tomography (CT) scan showed that the trachea was significantly compressed； the patient could not breathe lying on her back. The tracheal stenosis caused by tumor invasion was located at C7 to T1 and was only2 mm wide at its narrowest point and 3 cm in length . The patient's medical history included hypertension， controlled by medication. Preoperative fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed that the tumor was invading and protruding into the trachea under the glottis . Once in the operating room， the patient was placed at 30 degrees head up， and supplemental oxygen was given by mask， at a rate of 5 L/min. Standard monitoring was performed； the BP was 134/81 mmHg， Heart Rate (HR) 86 beats per minute， and oxygen saturation (SpO，) 99%. After obtaining venous access， dexmedetomidine was infused at a rate of 0.7 ug/kg within 10 min， delivered by infusion pump. Topical anesthesia of the larynx was achieved with 2% lidocaine by throat spray in three doses： 2 ml each time， over three minutes each. The local anesthetic was sprayed on the tongue， epiglottis， glottis， and oropharynx. Once the patient was not able to feel discomfort when a sputum suction tube was passed， fiberoptic bronchoscopy commenced. When bronchoscope reached the glottis， 2 ml of 2% lidocaine was administered through the working channel； local anesthesia of|删除段之间换行|the subglottic trachea was achieved. After two minutes， when the local anesthetic had begun to take effect， the fiberoptic bronchoscope passed through the epiglottis， and a circular neoplasm under the glottis was observed . The narrowest point was noted to be along the left side of the tumor， in agreement with the CT， and 2 ml local anesthesia (1.5 ml 1% tetracaine and 0.5 ml 0.01%norepinephrine) was sprayed into the airway. After two minutes， the patient was instructed to cough gently to expose the glottis and the bronchoscope suiccessfully crossed the narrowest point and reached the tracheal juga. A size 5.5 Endotracheal Tube (ETT) was guided smoothly through the stenotic site over the bronchoscope. After the End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide (ETCO，) waveform was confirmed， induction drugs were given intravenously immediately and surgery commenced. The vital signs are stable： BP 145/95 mmHg， HR 78/min， and SpO， 98%. The operation lasted about 7.5 h， and the patient recovered uneventfully.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\nATI involves placing ETT in an awake， spontaneously breathing patient， most commonly with flexible bronchoscopy. This allows the airway to be secured before induction of general anesthesia， avoiding the potential risks and consequences of difficult airway management in an anesthetized patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. A thyroid malignancy may make the airway difficult to manage， especially when the tumor invades the airway and causes dyspnea. Establishing an airway is therefore a challenge for anesthesiologists. In this case， establishing an airway was completed without the need for ECMO or a tracheal stent， and our experiences of the case are summarized below. In this case， postoperative anatomy showed that the space of stenosis to pass through was only enough to accommodate a sputum suction tube . ECMO is expensive and has several complications during ECMO， such as failure of the oxygenation membrane， coagulation of the system， intracranial hemorrhage， acute kidney injury and infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. Tracheal stent may help in particular cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Unfortunately， we do not have facilities to carry out such|删除段之间换行|a procedure. ATI may be the preferred solution， but if the process is difficult or has to be repeated a number of times， any further airway swelling or bleeding may increase the difficulty of establishing an airway. Therefore， dynamic evaluation of the airway should be performed by an experienced anesthesiologist. If the airway is lost， an alternative airway technique may be required， such as a low tracheotomy， delayed surgery. Malpas et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> reported a case of a large and extensive thyroid tumor with only 1 mm subglottic stenosis； the authors chose to establish ECMO before intravenous induction； endotracheal intubation was attempted， but unfortunately failed.In the current case， the patient's brachiocephalic trunk was found to be deformed and compressed on the trachea ring of C6 and T1. The brachiocephalic trunk could easily have been injured once dissection commenced. ATI is a safe airway management strategy for patients with potential technical difficulties in intubation and ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However， it canlead to unnecessary gag reflex and distress when topical anesthesia is not performed appropriately. Constant communication with and encouragement of the patient was essential for reassurance. In addition， a good relationship should be established with the patient to help build up confidence and cooperate with the procedure. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a bite pad， and there were no episodes of desaturation. Local anesthetic was administered to obtain full topical anesthesia， especially to the laryngopharynx and airway. Fiberoptic intubation should be done gently and not rushed. Although the narrowest part of the trachea was smaller than the outer diameter of the endotracheal tube， the tumor was soft in texture and the stenosis had good extensibility. The bronchoscope passed through it successfully and ETT could therefore be inserted into the airway over a bronchoscope， without airway injury or bleeding.\n\nIn conclusion， ATI has a high success rate and a favorable safety profile， but is underused in cases of anticipated difficult airway management. Good anesthetic technical skills， a cooperative patient， and adequate topical anesthesia are the three vital components for success.ECMO and tracheal stent also can solve a number of difficult airway problems. However， a successful ATI could reduce the cost，|删除段之间换行|complications and the risk to the patient of more invasive procedures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

During this period， the patient had his first bleeding four years ago that was managed by the left external carotid artery ligation. After that， he had a CT angiography that showed a huge left mandibular AVM. The patient was advised to totally control the AVM by endovascular intervention， yet he did not seek advanced management for his case. This time， the patient has presented to the emergency room of Al-Shifa Hospital (Gaza， Palestine) due to a sudden massive mouth bleeding. He was controlling the bleeding by clinching his mouth. Upon arrival， the patient was hemodynamically unstable， the blood pressure was 85/40 mmHg and heart rate of 120 beat per minute. Subsequently，two large-pore IV cannulas were inserted and blood samples was drawn. Hemoglobin level was measured at 7.2 g/dL and blood transfusion was given (6 Units of RBC)， creatinine level： 1.7， IV fluids was started. As a result， maxillofacial and vascular surgeons were called to control the bleeding and they preferred the urgent head and neck Angiography CT and endovascular management.

During the procedure， the bleeding did not stop， and it was controlled by the assistance of the patient by clinching his mouth，and pRBCs transfusion was continuous along the procedure|删除段之间换行|and a total of six units were transfused. Additionally， the patient developed right side hemiplegia and he was diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke； thus， mechanical thrombectomy in the same session was done to remove small thrombus from left middle cerebral artery and complete reversal of symptoms was noted.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\nTo the best of our knowledge this is the first case in literature that was treated successfully using PDA device to control life treating bleeding from the mouth due to left mandible AVM by occlusion of bilateral external carotid arteries and coil embolization for the left superior thyroid artery after previous ligation of the proximal left external carotid artery. On the other hand， the procedure was complicated by acute ischemic stroke that was managed by thrombus aspiration from the left middle cerebral artery. AVMs are the most common high-flow lesions， frequently identified in the limbs， head and neck. However， lesions of the oral and maxillofacial regions are very rare. AVMs have been reported in the maxilla， but at half the frequency of AVMs in the mandible. AVMs of the mandibular are relatively rare， with fewer than 200 cases reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Mandible is much denser and thicker than that the maxilla， so blood pressure in the varix of mandible is higher. So that， there is a difficulty in controlling emergency bleeding in the AVM of the mandible by local pressure only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. If the AV shunts exists， embolic material could pass through the internal jugular vein， resulting in pulmonary embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-10\\]</u>. As a result， embolization using coils or vascular plug accompanied with endovascular embolization is more effective. In our case we used the embolization material， coils and PDA device， and we did not use alcohol particles that have a risk of passing|删除段之间换行|through the internal jugular vein leading to pulmonary embolism. Despite that during embolization of left external carotid artery left sided hemiplegia was happened and treated urgently by aspiration of thrombus from left middle cerebral artery. Wu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> show that proximal ligation in 9 (~30%) of 29 patients treated for AVM of the auricle but that the condition was exacerbated in all patients with 8requiring auricular resection and 1 requiring additional treatment. They excluded proximal ligation from treatment options for AVM， because it makes subsequent trans-catheter treatments difficult and failure. Slaba et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> evaluated 25 patients with AVM of the tongue and reported that 3 (25%) of the 12 symptomatic patients who underwent ipsilateral external carotid artery ligation at another facility showed marked development of collateral network. In addition， Yamamoto et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> reported a case in which TAE was performed for AVM of the mandible via the maxillary artery， facial artery， lingual artery， and ocular artery but was not effective due to the development of collateral network from the internal carotid artery and vertebral artery. Although surgery alone is not recommended，a combination of surgery with endovascular embolization (including sclerotherapy) can be recommended depending on the case.\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】Endovascular treatment by embolization is performed using various approaches and embolic agents selected depending on the facility and the patient's characteristics. There are a wide variety of surgical treatment options， yet proximal surgical ligation alone is not effective to treat AVM. Therefore， we see that the treatment may be performed by combining many options of surgery and interventions. AVM of the mandible should be treated at main hospitals where multidisciplinary treatment can be performed by experienced physicians.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

PRES is a neuroimaging-based syndrome and is associated with multifocal vasogenic cerebral edema. Patients with PRES are frequently manifested by headache， seizure， encephalopathy， altered mental function， visual loss， etc. We here report a patient who showed persistent neurologic deficits after PRES and was ultimately diagnosed with Autoimmune Encephalitis (AE).\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 37-year-old man visited the Department of NCU in First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University complaining of a general fatigue for 1 week， aggravated with disturbance of consciousness for 1 day. He had no medical history. When admitted to the hospital， his GCS score was 9 (E4/V1/ M4)，he showed a normal blood pressure， no cervical resistance， increased muscular tension， hyperactivity of tendon reflexes and ankle clonus. At presentation， brain MRI showed bilateral multifocal vasogenic edema especially in his bilateral occipital lobes， which is compatible with PRES . Meanwhile， spot-like microbleeds can be found on SWI mapping . During admission， follow-up MRI at 1 week showed reversed vasogenic edema in both cerebral hemispheres， with decreased microbleeds on SWI . Serum and CSF autoantibody tests using a cell-based immunocytochemistry kit (Shaanxi MYBiotech Co.， Ltd.) showed the presence of anti-Casper 2 antibody with tilter of 1：3.2 in CSF and 1：100 in blood serum. The patient’s CSF profile was otherwise normal (red blood cell 20/pL； white blood cell 1/pL； protein 0.25 g/L； and glucose 4.5 mmol/L) with no evidence of infection. The patient was diagnosed with anti-Casper 2AE. After immunotherapy， his symptoms partly resolved. However， due to economic problem，he didn't perform EEG and EMG. After 3 weeks， he was transferred to local hospital.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\nThis case exhibits a rare imaging manifestation of anti-Casper 2 encephalitis which was initially well-matched with PRES and associated vasospasm.Generally，PRES is predicted to be both clinically and radiologically reversible and especially has a good prognosis. One of the major causes of PRES is acute hypertension. Nevertheless， patients with normal BP who accompanied with systemic autoimmune disorders can also perform classic PRES radiologically. Jaeho Kim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>proposed a case of PRES patient with anti-LGI1 antibody who's MRI showed apparent vasospasm edema. It is presumed that factors such as Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-a) and Interleukin-1 (IL-1)， that lead to PRES can activate the immune system and release other cytokines. These cytokines produce expression of adhesion molecules (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1)， which cooperate with leukocytes and lead them to produce Reactive Oxygen Species(ROS) and proteases that result in endothelial damage and consequent fluidleakage. TNF-a and IL-1can furthermore stimulate astrocytes to secret Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)， which deteriorates the form of junctions of the brain vasculature. Thus， these cascades result in vasogenic edema. In conclusion， endothelial hypotheses maybe considered the most relevant in PRES patients with autoimmune disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Meanwhile， PRES might cause the breakdown of Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) and the disorganization of brain tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In this case， it can be either presumed that BBB breakdown could uncover neuronal membrane antigen epitopes， such as Casper 2，and further induce a process of autoimmune inflammatory encephalitis. More experiments should be|删除段之间换行|taken in vitro and in vivo to further test the pathogenesis associated PRES-AE. Clinical observations should also be emphasized when a patient original with PRES neuroradiological features.

In the present case， patient was diagnosed with Casper 2 AE rather than PRES due to the effectiveness of immunotherapy.\n\n【6】In conclusion， AE can mimic PRES radiologically. AE should be further considered when the etiology， clinical manifestations， and course of PRES are atypical. Persistent encephalopathic symptoms， imaging abnormalities in the multiple cortical and subcortical areas， and specifically， autoantibody analysis can be the evidences of AE. Last but not the least， immunotherapy and relevant systemic supportive treatment such as antiepileptic treatment， can lead to a better prognosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In this article， we present the case of a 27-year-old patient who was stable on Aripiprazole 20 mg/day for bipolar disorder but experienced a manic attack two day after increasing their testosterone dose. Patients with bipolar disorder who receive testosterone replacement therapy should be closely monitored for any behavioral or mood changes. It is crucial to recognize that administering testosterone replacement therapy to patients with bipolar disorder may lead to mood changes or even trigger the onset of bipolar disorder.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a dysfunction that manifests itself in the insufficiency and absence ofpuberty and infertility， caused by Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone deficiency(GnRH)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

The psychiatric effects and the circumstances that precipitate them are still the subject of studies. In this article， we present a case of a patient who developed a hypomanic episode following testosterone replacement therapy.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 30-year-old single Moroccan patient who has been followed for osteoporosis since the age of删除4-1:<u>21</u>. He is treated with Risedronate 35 mg weekly. As part of the etiological research for osteoporosis， he was diagnosed with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The patient also has psoriasis and his brother is being followed up for intermittent explosive disorder.\n\n【6】In terms of his psychiatric history， he has been under treatment since the age of 22 for depressive episodes and a substance use disorder， notably alcohol and tobacco， with occasional use of ecstasy. He has received several antidepressants since the beginning of his illness and has been hospitalized only once for the management of depression with anxious features and suicidal ideation. During this hospitalization， he was treated with escitalopram 20 mg/day and alprazolam 3 mg/day with gradual decrease. The evolution was marked by occurrence of hypomanic episode that was likely induced by ecstasy use； therefore， a bipolar disorder type II was diagnosed， and this hypomania episode was treated ambulatory with aripiprazole 20 mg/day and carbamazepine 800 mg/day， which led to a rapid resolution of symptoms. However， after a few months， the patient stopped taking carbamazepine due to a decrease in his libido that he attributed to the treatment， and continued taking aripiprazole at a dose of 20 mg/day.\n\n【7】He presented with his mother to the psychiatric emergency department for psychomotor agitation and insomnia. The psychiatric examination revealed that the patient was agitated in terms of motor activity with increased energy and logorrhea， he had an irritable mood， disinhibited，he presents a flight of ideas， increased self-esteem and insomnia. His mother indicated that he had been unusually unstable over the past few days， presenting multiple violent anger outbursts at the slightest frustration. After completing the ANGST hypomania questionnaire， this episode was diagnosed as hypomania.\n\n【8】His mother noticed that these symptoms began after 2days of receiving the Andotardyl 250 mg/1 ml injection for his hypogonadotropic hypogonadism， which his treating physician had increased to one ampoule per month， instead of half ampoule as an initial dose. The patient was hospitalized and treated with aripiprazole20 mg/day and chlorpromazine 200 mg/day， which resulted in gradual improvement during the second week of his hospitalization.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Hypogonadism is an endocrine disorder characterized by insufficient production of testosterone. Symptoms of hypogonadism include low libido， difficulty achieving or maintaining a satisfactory erection， difficulty ejaculating， testicular atrophy， infertility， reduced hair growth， gynecomastia， asthenia， sleep disorders， loss of muscle mass， muscle pain， signs of bone fragility， weight gain， poor concentration， memory impairment， decreased motivation， and mood changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Several studies have established a correlation between low testosterone levels and depressive symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The results of Woodson et al. study revealed a significant decrease in testosterone levels in men with bipolar depression compared to control men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Similarly， a cross-sectional study of 856 men aged50 to 89 years， which measured free testosterone levels and evaluated major depressive disorders using the Beck Depression Inventory， revealed a correlation between low testosterone levels and depressive symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. This suggests that chronically low testosterone levels in our patient may be an etiological factor in the initial depressive episodes.\n\nOur patient presented signs of hypomania shortly after receiving an injection of 250 mg/1 ml of Androtardyl， which his treating physician had increased to one ampoule per month. Although we cannot definitively exclude spontaneous decompensation of bipolar disorder. This case suggests that testosterone administration can induce hypomania or manic episodes in vulnerable individuals， particularly in patients with personal or family histories suggesting a predisposition to mania or psychosis. Given that our patient had bipolar disorder， it seems that he was particularly sensitive to the increase in testosterone substitution dose，which probablycontributed to his hypomanic episode. Similar cases have been reported in the literature. Elboga et al. described the case of a 25-year-old patient with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and a history of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)， who experienced a manic episode after testosterone replacement therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.

Similarly， Barbenel et al. also described a case of mania in a bilateral orchiectomy patient taking testosterone replacement therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.

She was admitted to the hospital on March 26h，2020 due to “sudden unresponsiveness with reduced speech for two days\". Two days ago， after breakfast， the patient was found by her family to be apathetic and less responsive to the outside world than when waking up in the morning， she showed a significant decrease in speech and lack of words when asked by her family， but no obvious difficulty in understanding language. In the following two days， the patient continued to have these symptoms without relief and often sat for hours without active speech or activity， so she was sent to our hospital by her family. During the course of the disease， the patient had no gibberish， choking and coughing with water，limb weakness， or urinary and fecal incontinence. Personal history： History of hypertension for 3 years， with blood pressure reaching up to 180/110 mmHg. She used to take 2.5 mg of levamlodipine benzoate tablets orally at bedtime for antihypertensive treatment， but blood pressure control was not monitored.

ECG： Sinus rhythm， heart rate of 70 beats/min， normal ECG. Chest CT scan and abdominal ultrasound showed no unusual findings. Lumbar puncture showed intracranial pressure of 160 mmH2O. The routine， biochemical and viral nucleic acid tests of cerebrospinal fluid were normal.

In the present case， the patient had a sudden onset and a clear previous history of hypertension， so it was easily misdiagnosed as acute cerebrovascular disease in these areas based on her clinical presentation. However， acute cerebral infarction in the left basal ganglia region was later confirmed by cranial MRI.\n\nPrevious studies have reported few cases of acute unilateral infarction in the basal ganglia region manifested with behavioral and cognitive abnormalities but completely persevered motor functions， and most cases were acute ischemic lesions in the unilaterallenticular nucleus， predominantly on the left side. Reiji Koide et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> reported a case of infarction of the left globus pallidus with behavioral abnormalities as the only manifestation in 2013. They also suggested that compared with Multi-Infarct Dementia (MID)， which is more common in clinical practice， the cognitive decline caused by cerebral infarction of the left globus pallidus belongs to Strategic Infarct Dementia (SID). They also believed that the pathogenesis of such infarcts is mostly penetrating lesions of the middle cerebral artery， with good prognosis. That is， the behavioral and cognitive impairment are often partially or completely recovered after timely intervention. Giroud et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， on the other hand， divided the infarcts in the lenticular nucleus into two different clinical syndromes according to the anatomical regions： Putamen infarction， which is characterized by dystonia and cognitive decline， and globus pallidus infarction， which is characterized by mental and behavioral abnormalities and cognitive impairment. They also concluded that the globus pallidus infarction result in mental and behavioral abnormalities， usually manifesting as apathy and unresponsiveness， whereas the range of cognitive impairment is mainly associated with attention，short-term memory， and executive function. Su Hyun Kim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> analyzed and explained the behavioral and cognitive impairment alone caused by|删除段之间换行|infarction of the left globus pallidus： Since the function of the cortical projections to different regions of the globus pallidus is relatively independent， the disruption between the frontal cortex and the ventral circuit ofthe globus pallidus may be the mechanism by which a frontal lobe syndrome is produced. In addition， the frontopontine bundle of the anterior limb of the internal capsule is damaged by compression due to infarction of the anterior part of the globus pallidus， thus affecting frontal lobe function， which has also been speculated to be a mechanism of the condition. In addition to behavioral and cognitive impairment， a case of motor aphasia alone due to the lenticular nucleus infarction has been reported in China. The author suggested that the lenticular nucleus is also directly involved in the regulation and output of speech functions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The present case showed mental symptomssuch as apathyandunresponsiveness，reduced spontaneous speech，and normal comprehension after the onset of the disease. The cognitive function assessment showed impaired attention， memory， and executive function， and imaging examination confirmed that the ventral lesions of the left globus pallidus， among other features， were basically consistent with the above report.\n\n【9】In conclusion， the possibility of infarction in the basal ganglia region， especially in the globus pallidus of the dominant hemisphere， should be considered in patients with sudden onset of mental and behavioral abnormalities and cognitive impairment， in order to avoid missing the best time window for treatment. Meanwhile， neuropsychological assessment should also be carefully performed for cerebral infarction in the lenticular nucleus to avoid missing the possible behavioral and cognitive impairment， and timely targeted treatment and rehabilitation should be provided to achieve early return to normal life.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This comes from physical appearance comparisons and self-objectification -people often compare themselves with social media imagery containing representations of very thin bodies \"thinspiration\"or lean and muscular bodies \"fitspiration\"，leading to feelings of depression， anxiety and extreme stress that drive them to dedicate more time investing in their body image by dieting or excessive exercise. These effects might be more severe with the consumption of social media content than traditional media (TV， magazines) because there is a continuous exposure， there is always new content and there is a possibility in engaging with other users with real time evaluative components - getting a like or a comment on a photo they just posted通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\nAlthough this feeling of inadequate body image can happen in any given age it’s more common， and growing in numbers， amongst teenagers who are more likely to be influenced by the display of an \"ideal body type”given the fact that they are going through a constant changing process， and they are extremely sensitive to third parties’ opinions and criticism.

This highly increases the risk of developing both pathological physical conditions such as： Delayed puberty， digestive/urinary abnormalities and mouth ulcers； and psychological conditions： depression， suicide attempts， anxiety and substance abuse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【11】The desire for obtaining social approval concerning how they look and whether their body is “attractive\"is important for teenagers and the building of their self-esteem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Every teenager has its own personality and personal convictions which affects the degree of influence that social media has on them and their perception if they have or not the “dream body\". It’s hard to have a clear notion of what the ideal body represents， since it may vary from individual to individual and from society to society， but the common trace is that for females the perfect figure normally is about being thin(\"thinspiration\") and for males is about being muscled and lean(“fitspiration\")通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【12】The concept ofhow a person should look in the eyes of societyhas always been around， in fact people have always been manipulated by what others thought represented elegance and attractiveness，beauty standards are part of our everyday life they have always appeared on TV and magazines. But now with the use of social media platforms is much easier to spread the pictures and images of\"perfection”and teenagers are known to spend a lot of time scrolling down Instagram， Facebook， Twitter and even dating Applications (apps) such as Tinder or Grindr. The use of this platforms has also become an addiction that furthers feeds their need to be perfect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. These social media apps are mostly centered in body image and how others perceive them what eventually leads to influence how one perceives themselves based on the number of compliments they get - likes， comments， number of shares and visualizations.\n\n【13】The amount oftime adolescents spends on social media platforms it's already a cause for concern but with increasing number of ED arising from that use it's now， more important than ever， time to pay attention to potential triggers and to be aware of certain behaviors.\n\nThis concern grew largely with the pandemic COVID-19 and the lockdown that happened in most countries.COVID-19 besides being a physical health crisis it also represents a mental health crisis： With rising numbers of anxiety， depression， stress， disturbed sleep and ED 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. When teenagers found themselves locked away， they found a way of being out： Using social media， that led to a rising number of hours they spent looking at social media content， per day. The social media content also changed during this period focusing more and more on body image and even body positivity， but this content is often generated by model influencers that typically have a very specific body type - that many can’t achieve； and that use a lot of filters， such as facetune or bodytune， to correct their “imperfections”|删除段之间换行|and thus creating an image that is impossible to copycat. Adolescents are now exposed to a glamorization of a specific body shape that is fomented by the fashion industry， fitness industry and that has become a business 10|.\n\n【15】With this review we intend to see the correlation between use of social media， body dissatisfaction and eating disorders and create awareness in parents， physicians， psychologists， psychiatrists and teachers so they can develop strategies do correctly help and lead these adolescents by properly addressing the root of the problem.\n\n【16】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【17】Upon the reading of a total 12 articles addressing body dissatisfaction， ED and the relationship between those and the exposure to social media we concluded that there is indeed a strong connection between all of them.\n\n【18】The internalization of appearance ideals controls the relationship between exposure to media images on Instagram， Snapchat， Twitter， Facebook， datingapps andbody perception that commonly translates into dissatisfaction. The last publications concluded that the most dangerous social media was Instagram， followed by Facebook and Twitter， due to the instant satisfaction of having positive peer reviews 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Over the past decade the overall hours per day that early adolescents dedicated to social media had risen and the percentage of those who use social media daily had almost doubled， especially after COVID-19 and the lockdown \\[8，91. There were many studies about the impact of the traditional media： Television and magazines； in eating disorders and body dissatisfaction in teenagers， but now it's important to focus on the influence of social media and further explore the impact that it may have on the health of these adolescents.\n\n【19】Social media allows teenagers to interact with each other’s trough likes and commentaries they have on the posts they made (that are mostly image focused)， these are the stimulus that drives them to improve their body image furthermore so they can continuously receive positive feedback that for a while helps them being comfortable about themselves. This exposure constantly pushes them to be what others like to see so they keep on trying to show themselves has perfect， the problem is： The ones they look up to usually look a certain way by using filters， apps of body enhancement (bodytune， facetune)， posing and recurring to plastic surgery meaning that they don't even look like that so having that appearance is virtually impossible for one to get. This unrealistic beauty standards shown by celebrities， “instagramers\"， “insta models\"， youtubers， etc. largely contribute for a never ending pursue of a body image that they can never achieve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. They engage into extreme diets， extreme workout routines that eventually lead to ED and other psychiatric issues such as： Depression，anxiety and stress. This deep dissatisfaction they feel about their image happens fortrying to mirror unrealistic images，50%of boys and 74% girls have been found to want to modify something about their body by the age of 14 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Girls aged 12 to 15 were found to be the least satisfied with their body and also revealed more efforts to become thinner， especially trough bulimic tendencies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Adolescence is a crucial period in terms of building one's personality； it’s a period that comes with a lot of insecurities， body changes， peer pressure and teasing and now social media pressure. All these challenges plus being exposed to “not so achievable rule models”enhance their poor self-esteem that prospectively predicts negative physical and psychological health outcomes： Depression， development of ED， engagement in risky body change behaviors -\n\n【21】supplement use， excessive exercise， muscle gaining strategies and restrictive eating practices.\n\n【22】For a period， it was thought that body dissatisfaction was solemnly related to young girls when compared to boys， but new evidence suggests that is becoming an increasing issue in both genders. However， this displeasure with their body is different： Girls typically focus on attempting to have a thin and slender appearance- developing an irrational fear of fat and certain foods (such as carbohydrates) as well as firm conviction that weight and shape are central determinants in their identity； whereas boys tend to try to be muscular and lean. Their paradox is to be “strong”and“skinny通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，11\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Inside the boys’ group there is also the sexual minority boys(homosexuals or bisexuals) that use a lot of dating apps such as：Grinder and Tinder plus other social media platforms. These sexual minority males had more tendency (in comparison with heterosexual boys) to have greater muscularity dissatisfaction， greater self-objectification and more frequent appearance-based comparisons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The discovery of one's sexuality in teenage years is also a challenge， especially for those who don't seem to fit in the sexual orientation that most of their peers have. They recurrently use dating apps that are 100% centered in body image with a real time feedback that can either be positive of negative thus influence an already disturbing behavior. In a study lead in Australia with a sample of 2.733 sexual minority males shown that they， as the other boys’ group， also aim to achieve overtly muscular bodies - lean (no fat) very muscular bodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However，they tend to be a little more rigorous with their workout routine and dieting due to be under social media pressure， dating pressure and peer pressure and teasing- about their looks and about their sexuality.\n\n【24】The teenagers in order to achieve the “perfect body”engage in maladaptive eating behaviors such as： Restricting or binging and/or purging， often these behaviors do not necessary fall into a ED by clinical criteria but they are considered a phase of a diagnosed ED， so it’s demanding that an action is taken before it comes to an actual diagnostic with severe outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Vomiting is more prevalent during first adolescence years and restrictive dieting usually happens in the late years of adolescence. Patients with AN， BN and binge-eating disorder caused by a disturbed body image and followed by eating and weight loss unhealthy behaviors have more impairment in their life quality， forever being high-risk persons for developing a psychiatric pathology. There are also nonspecific eating behaviors， that don't meet the criteria for an ED but are also severe and in need for intervention： Chronic dieting， fasting， binge eating， purging and abuse of laxatives and or diuretics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【25】EDs are largely associated with mood and anxiety problems， substance abuse and other impulse control disorders contributing for a poor quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【26】In conclusion， the never-ending desire for approval SO characteristic of adolescent years makes them a vulnerable group， exposed to various stimulus that may influence them for the rest of their life. Indeed， body dissatisfaction as a product of never-ending comparison and glamorization of specific body shapes encouraged by social media figures is a leading cause of EDs among those ages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Adolescents spend an average of 7 plus hours/day interacting with media， which is more than any other activity they do except sleeping通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【27】All the data we reviewed are in consensus with previous investigations and reviews concerning body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem and linking them to mental illness and the direct influence it has on developing EDs. The incongruity between what society presents as the “ideal body\"and the real body that many young males and females have results in deep image and body anxiety that lead to maladaptive behaviors： Restrictive eating， purging， excessive exercise通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Media models have a meaningful impact in the last beauty tendencies and dictate the trends that young people are following， so researchers have also noted how social media and influencers could address this body dissatisfaction issue and help teenagers， but some studies have showed that economic interests are related with the promotion of dieting in social media， exercise and even plastic surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【29】The ages between 12 and 15 years old are a crucial developmental period in which teenagers begin to build their personality， identity and are exposed to multiple emotions. During this particular period， it's imperative to define one’s self and reconcile the private self and the public self， a task that persi it's already hard to accomplish without a good support network： Parents， teachers， physicians， friends 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This jointly with sociocultural pressure to have a certain body type can create too much stress and ambiguous emotions related to their body in a teenager's head.\n\n【30】That said it's very important that the adolescent support network is aware of certain behaviors that might indicate a bad relationship with food， excessive exercise， abuse of substances and complete dissatisfaction with their body. Once one of these problems is noted it’s imperial that parents (and other family members)， physicians， teachers， Phycologists know to search for the original root of the problem： That being social media imagery that exposes impossible-to-achieve beauty standards. By knowing the source of the problem， the help， guidance and support they can provide can be much more accurate and precise.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

These aneurysms are more often due to celiac stenosis from atherosclerosis but can also be due to median arcuate ligament syndrome. We report the case of a 68-year-old female with a history of unease with eating， who presented with retroperitoneal hemorrhage of unknown origin. CT angiography revealed a ruptured inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm and celiac artery compression with the characteristic “hook”appearance， consistent with median arcuate ligament compression. The ruptured IPDA aneurysm was managed with endovascular coil embolization and the patient was discharged hemodynamically stable with stabilized hematocrits.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】68F with history of hypertension， hypothyroidism， migraines， hemorrhoids， and unease with eating， presented with 3 days of abdominal pain and bloody stools. The pain was located in the epigastrium， was 10/10 in severity， and associated with several episodes of bright red blood per rectum and one syncopal episode. Of note， the patient endorsed “unease with eating\"that resulted in decreased intake for 8-9 months. She attributed this to stress from an ongoing divorce. She also reported a long history of\"problems with gas\" for which she takes over the counter medications. The patient denied any aspirin or anticoagulant use.\n\n【4】In the ER，her vitals were normal.On exam， she appeared fatigued however in no acute distress. Her abdomen was soft， non-distended. She was noted to have tenderness in the epigastrium and left lower quadrant however there was no rebound or guarding. On digital rectal exam， there was gross blood， no internal hemorrhoid， sphincter tone was normal， external hemorrhoids were present， non-thrombosed and non-bleeding. Her initial hematocrit was 42， however after 1L of crystalloid， downtrended to 35 and continued to downtrend to as low as 26 within 24 hours. Otherwise， her lactate level was normal as well as her lipase.\n\n【5】CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV and PO contrast obtained during workup in the ER revealed retroperitoneal hemorrhage with extensive retroperitoneal induration which was higher attenuation than simple fluid measuring on the order 50 Hounsfield units centered about the pancreas . Additionally， there was colitis from the transverse colon to the descending colon. Surgery was consulted and the decision was made to obtain a CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis. This revealed a ruptured inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm  as well as kinked and hooked appearance of the celiac origin in the absence of significant atherosclerotic disease raising the possibility of median arcuate syndrome .\n\n【6】Lt2sy：10：1\n\nGiven this diagnosis， the patient underwent a diagnostic visceral angiogram with subsequent embolization of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm. The left radial artery was accessed with a 21 gauge micro needle and ultrasound guidance. A wire was placed through the needle and a 5F hydrophilic glides heath was advanced over the wire. The complex collection measures39-85 Hounds field units， highly suggestive of blood products. A.035 wire and 5F diagnostic catheter was used to navigate through the arm and into the descending aorta. A 5F Sarah Radial catheter was used to selectively catheterize the SMA and a micro catheter system was used to catheterize the posterior branch of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery. Coil embolization was used to occlude the artery distal to the aneurysm and the aneurysm sac. After the procedure， the patient was monitored in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) for two days. She tolerated a regular diet after two days|删除段之间换行|and no longer had bright red blood per rectum. Her hematocrit was stable， abdominal pain improved， and she was discharged with plans for follow-up .\n\n【8】Discussion\n\nInferior上Pancreaticoduodenaalartery aneurysms are very|删除段之间换行|rare，comprising onlyy2%0o1fvisceral aneirysmIs. Inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms are more frequentlyidentified given theincrease in diagnostic radiographictesting such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery (IPDA) aneurysms when symptomatic can present with rupture， and in-hospital mortality for patients not treated with ruptured inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm rupture approaches 80%.\n\n【10】T aneurysms of the pancreaticoduodenal arteries are distinguished from false aneurysms on the basis of etiology and location of the bleeding. With respect to location of bleeding， true aneurysms rupture into the retroperitoneal space whereas false IPDA aneurysms rupture into the abdomen. True inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms are often secondary to celiac stenosis， either by atherosclerosis or extrinsic compression from the median arcuate ligament. In contrast， false IPDA aneurysms occur in patients with recent surgery， trauma， pancreatitis， or with septic emboli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Patients with celiac stenosis may develop aneurysms of the pancreaticoduodenal arcade. The hypertension that results distally to the stenosis leads to aneurysmal dilation of the pancreaticoduodenal arcades. Extrinsic compression of the celiac artery can result in median arcuate syndrome， which is a rare condition which comprises clinical manifestations e.g. postprandial pain and celiac stenosis. The median arcuate ligament is a fibrous band that connects both sides of the diaphragmatic crura. In most people， the median arcuate ligament passes superior to the celiac axis. However， in a minority of patients， the median arcuate ligament passes much lower and anterior to the celiac artery and causes compression. Median arcuate syndrome consists of post-prandial abdominal pain associated with 5-10 lb. weight loss. The syndrome， while in part due to stenosis， most likely has a neuropathic origin as well. Celiac stenosis， alone， is unlikely the cause，since 47% of patients continue to have recurrence of symptoms with celiac revascularization alone. In contrast， only 21% of patients have recurrence with revascularization and surgical release of the ligament 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Median arcuate ligament syndrome is best visualized with CT angiography where the sagittal view is preferred. With conventional angiography， the region of narrowing is better identified during expiration whereas it improves with inspiration. 13-50% of healthy patients will have extrinsic compression of the celiac artery due to the median arcuate ligament. However， only 10-24% of patients with extrinsic compression of the celiac by the median arcuate ligament will have the syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The goal for our patient during this admission was to control the bleeding. She was hemodynamically stable and therefore a prime candidate for en dovascular coil embolization of the IPDA aneurysm. She will need further workup of her previous abdominal pain symptoms and possibly release and revascularization of the celiac axis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

ANCA antibodies were negative as well. After symptoms persisted a 3 mm biopsy was carried out and resulted normal.

Dynamic contrast enhanced computed tomography can revealed a hypovascular tumor of 8 cm in diameter in the left kidney. She was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma T3aN0M0 and underwent a left radical nephrectomy.Histopathological analysis showed papillary type 2 renal cell carcinoma and the tumor cells lacked immunohistochemical expression of fumarate hydratase. This suggests fumarate hydratase deficient renal cell carcinoma. Next-generation sequencing of tumor revealed two FH variants. In the one (NM\\000143； c.1144A>G) of two， germline FH gene variant was confirmed by sequencing DNA extracted from the patient's blood. She was diagnosed with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. She had uterine fibrosis but no cutaneous leiomyomas. And she had no family history of renal cell carcinoma or these symptoms. Cutaneous leiomyoma is observed in 70% to 100% among patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. While conventional diagnostic criteria require the presence of this symptom， genetic analysis enables us to diagnose hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. We report the case that the patient with an early onset of papillary type 2 renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed with HLRCC-associated renal cell carcinoma by identifying potentially actionable germline FH variant.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer (HLRCC) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by heterozygous germline mutations in the Fumarate Hydratase (FH) gene. FH is a Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of fumarate into malate通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Potential pathogenic mechanism is that intracellular accumulation of succinate and fumarate caused by loss of function mutations in FH inhibit Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) and activate oncogenic pathway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. Recent genome studies have shown that pathogenic FH variants are observed in 0.1% to 0.3%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>.HLRCC are characterized with symptoms of cutaneous leiomyoma， uterine fibrosis and renal cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Approximately 6% to 20% of carriers with FH variants develop RCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. HLRCC-associated RCC was classified as a separate tumor entity in the 2016WHO classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The fifth edition of the WHO classification of urogenital tumors， published in 2022， revised diagnostic criteria of renal cell carcinoma. It highlights the importance ofa diagnosis that involves not only morphology but also immunohistochemistry and relevant molecular tests通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Conventionally， HLRCC has been diagnosed based on the fact that patients have cutaneous leiomyoma as a major criterion， and have symptomatic uterine fibrosis before age 40， papillary type2 Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) before age 40 and a first-degree familial history of these symptoms as minor criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However， penetrance of these manifestations is not always completed. Here， we report the case in which a patient with a heterozygous germline mutation in the fumarate hydratase gene had papillarytype 2 RCC and was later diagnosed with HLRCC without cutaneousleiomyomas.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\nA 30-year-old woman who had no past history and no familyhistory presented gross hematuria and lumber backache.

There was no evidence of metastasis. She was diagnosed with RCC of T3N0M0 and underwent a left radical nephrectomy.\n\n【8】Pathological findings showed that capsulized tumor was mixed with solid and fragile tissue with hemorrhage and necrosis and localized within renal parenchyma (pT2apN0M0). Tumor cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm， nuclear pseudostratification and high prominent nucleoli had extensive papillary growth . Histological appearance corresponded to papillary type 2 RCC. TP In addition， immunohistochemical staining showed that FH was negative . Next-generation sequencing of tumor with FoundationOne' CDx revealed two likely pathogenic variants in the FH gene (NM\\000143； c.1144A>G， NM\\000143； c.307delG). In the one (NM\\000143； c.1144A>G) of two， germline FH gene variant was confirmed by sequencing DNA extracted from the patient's blood. She was diagnosed with HLRCC. Gynecological and dermatological examination revealed uterine fibrosis but had no cutaneous leiomyomas. After genetic counseling， we recommended her family to take germline investigation. She has had no recurrence of HLRCC-associated RCC for two-year follow-up period and will have annual examination of gynecology and dermatology.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\nHere， we presented a case that the challenges associated with the diagnosis of HLRCC in a patient with papillary type 2 RCC who had no family history or cutaneous manifestations. Most of HLRCC-associated RCC are in advanced stage at the time of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Their aggressive biological feature confers adverse prognosis for the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The average age at diagnosis of HLRCC is known to be young 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Wu et al. reported 18 (9.4%) of 190 patients with renal tumor younger than 45 years old had pathogenic germline variant including FH variant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. On the process of the WHO classification revision， while papillary RCC type 1 can be regarded as the papillary|删除段之间换行|RCC， papillary RCC type 2 is abolished 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. It is because papillary RCC type 2 has a heterogeneous molecular background， which can include FH deficiency as well as gene fusions involving TFE3 or TFEB. Approximately 5% of patients with papillary RCC have a CpG island methylator phenotype， which is associated with poor survival rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Half of these patients also have a mutation in the FH gene通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In Japan， it is also known that approximately 5% of patients with non-clear cell renal carcinoma have pathogenic variants， such as FH or BAP1. These careers were diagnosed with RCC 15.8 years earlier than those who don’t have 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. That is why physician awareness and understanding of HLRCC is very important for conducting an appropriate management.\n\n【11】Diagnosis based on clinical manifestations， even major criteria， may be with a risk of delayed diagnosis due to incomplete penetration. In some cases， as in the present case， the major criteria are not met通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Uterine fibrosis and cutaneous leiomyoma have been reported to be observed in 70% to 80% and 70% to 100% among patients with HLRCC， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，18，19\\]</u>. However， uterine fibrosis is more common in women and cutaneous leiomyoma is low in young patients (about 30%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. That makes it more complicated to diagnose HLRCC. Therefore， accurate diagnosis by genomic testing is necessary.\n\nIn the present case， FH immunohistochemical staining was negative. This indicated loss of function in FH due to its gene alteration. The comprehensive next-generation sequencing analyses revealed two genetic alterations in the FH gene. FH variants were evaluated in an online database (Leiden Open Variation Database(LOVD) system)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The FH database includes 107 variants of which93 are thoughted to be pathogenic and 14 may be non-functional intron variants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. It was reported that the most common types of mutations at the protein level are missense in 57%， frameshifts and nonsense in 27%， with the remainder composed of deletions， insertions and duplications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In the present case， the database|删除段之间换行|revealed the one (NM\\000143； c.1144A>G) of two variants was a germline missense mutation in FH gene. This missense mutation was located in exon 8lesion. This germline variant was confirmed by sequencing DNA analysis. SmithDLet al. showed clinical and genetic data from 33 families with suspected of HLRCC on a nationwide level in the Netherlands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Four of the 11 pathogenic FH germline mutations identified were novel mutations， including this missense mutation (NM\\000143； c.1144A>G). Of the two family members with this mutation， two had cutaneous leiomyoma and one had uterine fibrosis， but did not develop RCC. Our patient is the first case of HLRCC-associated RCC harboring this missense mutation.\n\n【13】We proposed an approach to the clinical diagnosis and indications for FH mutation analysis. Although we have not been able to confirm the FH mutation in the family， there were no significant findings in the family history. Given that an identified mutation was reported in another HLRCC case， it suggests that this mutation is likely to be de novo. Thus， it is very important for urologists to consider possibility of HLRCC-associated RCC for young patients， even having no family history or other clinical manifestations， with papillary RCC. We believe that our findings will be useful in clinical practice.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】It is important for youngpatients with RCC to consider hereditary diseases. If the pathologically FH immunochemical staining of the tumor is negative， it is crucial to investigate the patient's family history and consider dermatological or gynecological screening. Considering the risk of poor prognosis in renal cancer， it is essential to be aware of the importance of a definitive diagnosis， including genetic testing. Cases like this present one， which lack cutaneous leiomyoma， may also occur. After diagnosing HLRCC， it is recommended for family members to undergo genetic testing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

These factors pose negative impact on glycemic management in people with diabetes. This study aimed to determine the relationship between glycemic changes， physical activities， and eating behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n【2】Methods： Study involved both retrospective and cross-sectional data analyses. The glycated Hemoglobin (HbAlc) values in patients with type 2 diabetes before the pandemic in 2019 and during pandemic in 2020 were evaluated. A self-administered questionnaire survey was used to measure physical activity and eating behaviors. Patients with type 2 diabetes who had HbAlc values ≥ 7%at any month during 2020 were included. Data collection was performed at the medical outpatient clinic of Kagawa University Hospital.\n\n【3】Results： Two hundred participants completed the survey. During the COVID-19 pandemic， the average HbA1c values significantly deteriorated (7.72%) than those pre-pandemics (7.57%)， with an increase of 1.98 percent (p=0.002，r=-0.157). Additionally，the scores for All Physical Activities (all PA) decreased and total eating behaviors improved. There was no significant relationship was found between the HbA1 values， physical activities， and eating behaviors during the pandemic.\n\n【4】Conclusion： HbAlc levels deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic， but this change was unrelated to physical activity or eating habits. The stress factors may contribute to these changes.\n\n【5】Keywords：COVID-19； Type 2 diabetes； Glycemic control； Physical activities； Eating behaviors\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】The COVID-19 caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first detected in Wuhan in December 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide. In Japan， the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported on January 16h，删除4:<u> 2020</u>. By the end of August 2021， the total number of domestic infections and deaths increased to 1，469，327 and 15，994， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The mortality cases due to COVID-19 is considerably higher accounting for 1.1%of the infected people， and more than half of the cases recorded involved elderly and people with comorbidities. The Japanese government declared the first state of emergency on April 07h，2020，for Tokyo and the other six prefectures for one month； on April 16h，2020， the emergency was exten ded to the rest of the country， which ended in May 2020 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Compared to scenario in other countries worldwide， Japanese government did not impose a total strict lockdown. However， the emergency declaration disrupted daily routine lives 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and psychosocial well-being of the people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>.\n\nIn people with diabetes， maintaining healthy daily life， especially physical activities/exercises and diet are crucial components for improving their glycemic control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. There is no conclusive evidence that patients with diabetes are at a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection， but a few studies suggest that diabetes in patients with COVID-19 is associated with a two-fold increased risk of disease severity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u> even in the absence of other comorbidities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. A retrospective， multi-centered study of 7，337 cases with COVID-19 in Hubei Province， China， found that patients with poorly controlled diabetes or stress hyperglycemia (blood glucose>180 mg/dl)|删除段之间换行|have a significantly higher risk of severe COVID-19 and increased mortality than the patients with well-controlled blood glucose (blood glucose <180 mg/dl)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【9】In the present study， during routine outpatient assessment of patients with diabetes at Kagawa University Hospital， located in Kagawa Prefecture， we observed an increasing trend of glycated hemoglobin (HbAlc) values in 2020 than those in 2019. To the best of our knowledge， there are limited studies in Japan investigating glycemic changes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A retrospective study conducted at the Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University Hospital， Sendai， reported that HbA1c values significantly increased after the emergency was declared 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However， the factors of physical activity and diet were not included in this study. Therefore， in the present study， we aimed to evaluate whether there were any significant changes in HbAlc values before通用删除7(英):<u>(2019)</u> and during 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u> the pandemic. Additionally， we also examined that whether Physical Activities (PA) and eating behaviors relate to higher HbAlc values during the pandemic in 2020.\n\n【10】Materials and Methods\n\n【11】Study design and participants\n\n【12】This was a retrospective， observational， cross-sectional study. Data were collected in two stages： Stage 1 involved retrieving and analyzing data from the hospital's patient information system， and stage 2 involved the patients'survey. Patients analyzed at stage 1 were then followed up for a survey at stage 2 during their hospital visits between November 2020 and January删除4:<u> 2021</u>. This was a single-center study conducted at the medical outpatient clinic of the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism at Kagawa University Hospital in Kagawa Prefecture.\n\n【13】We included all patients who meet the following inclusion criteria； patients with type 2 diabetes， aged ≥ 18 years， on regular consultations (in every 1 to 2 months) in 2020 with HbAlc values 之7% in any month in 2020. In a month， the average number of type 2diabetes patients with HbAlc values 2 7% is approximately 81， thus230 of patients were randomly selected for this study. We excluded patients with a history of hospitalization during the study period， and those who refused to complete the questionnaire.\n\n【14】Ethical approval\n\n【15】The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Kagawa University (approval number： 2020-155； approval dates： November20h，2020). Written informed consent was obtained from the participants， and all procedure adhered to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 and later versions.\n\n【16】Data collection\n\n【17】During stage 1， the data extracted from the hospital patient's information system included HbAlc values； age and gender The HbAlc values in 2019 and 2020 were extracted and evaluated.\n\nA self-administered questionnaire was used during stage 2 to measure physical activities and eating behaviors of the participants before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Short Diet Behaviors Questionnaire for Lockdown (SDBQ-L) was adapted from a previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> to evaluate the eating behaviors， and the questionnaire was translated into Japanese. The questionnaire enquired five types of eating-related behaviors： 1) Unhealthy food， 2) uncontrolled eating，3) snacking between meals， 4) binge drinking， and 5) the number of main meals per day. There were four choices as responses and|删除段之间换行|the designated scores for questions 1 to 4 were as follows：“Never”=0；“Sometimes\\=1；“Most of the time\"=2； and “Always=3. The responses for question 5 were as follows； “1-2 times/day=1；“3 times/day'=0；“4 times/day=1；“5 times/day\"=2； and “>5 times/day”=3. The total score of the questionnaire corresponded to the sum of the scores of the five questions. The total score ranged 0 to 15， where“0”indicated no unhealthy dietary behavior and “15”indicated severely unhealthy behavior.\n\n【19】The Japanese version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ) was used to measure the extent of PA. It is a self-reported questionnaire that assesses the average frequency and duration of three domains of PA performed over a one-week period， as follows： 1) Vigorous Physical Activity (VPA)，2) Moderate Physical Activity (MPA)， and 3) Brisk walking. The Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) was computed from the data collected by multiplying the MET value of each PA domain. MET is a unit of measurement for energy expenditure that represents the ratio of the working metabolic rate to the resting metabolic rate. One MET equals one kcal/kg/h of energy expenditure while sitting quietly.\n\n【20】The MET value in each domain was based on the guideline：VPA=8.0 METs， MPA=4.0 METs and Brisk walking =3.3 METs通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Total PA was calculated by summing the METs of weekly PA(MET-hours/week) as follows： Total PA (MET-hours/week)=(VPA minutes/week×8.0 METs) + (MPA minutes/week x 4.0 METs) +(Brisk walking minutes/weekx3.3 METs)/60. This measure has been used worldwide and has been accepted for its reliability and validity in Japanese adults删除4:<u> 14</u>.\n\n【21】Statistical analyses\n\n【22】Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Data Analysis version 25 (SPSS Inc.， Chicago， IL， USA) and figures were generated using Microsoft Excel删除4:<u> 2019</u>. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test for normality. Descriptive analyses were performed on the demographic variables， HbAlc values， PA， and eating behaviors. Data are reported as frequency， percentage， and mean ±Standard Deviation (SD).\n\n【23】The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to examine the significant differences in HbAlc levels， PA， and eating behaviors before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Effect size (Cohen's d) was calculated to determine the magnitude of change in score and was interpreted using the following criteria： 0.2 (small)， 0.3 (moderate)， and 0.5 (large). Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient tests were used to assess the possible relationships between HbAlc values， PA， and eating behaviors. The strength of a relationship was interpreted using the following criteria： r=0.10-29 (small)， r=0.30-49 (moderate)， and r=0.50-1.0(large). Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.\n\n【24】Results\n\n【25】Demographic characteristics of participants\n\n【26】We successfully reviewed and surveyed 200 patients with type 2diabetes at our medical outpatient clinic. A total of 30 patients were excluded for several reasons including incomplete data and refusal. Demographic characteristics of the participants are presented in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. Of all participants， 59% were men， with a mean age of 65.5years， and a mean duration of diabetes of 16.8 years. The participants were primarily unemployed (42%)， completed high school education(54.5%)， stayed with family (47.5%)， and reported no heart disease(80%). The mean weight in 2020 was slightly reduced compared to 2019 with 69.2 kg and 68.3 kg respectively by 1.3%.

The change of weight in 2020 was significantly associated with total eating behaviors score (p=0.005， r=0.199) but not observed with HbAlc values and PA.\n\n【29】Changes in HbA1c values before 通用删除7(英):<u>(2019)</u> and during the pandemic 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u>\n\nAs presented in Figure 1， the average HbAlc values are higher|删除段之间换行|in 2020 than in 2019， with 7.72% and 7.57%， respectively. The values increased significantly during 2020 by 1.98%(z=-3.145，p=0.002，r=-0.157). Figure 2 shows the HbAlc values for each month for both years. Significant differences were found in the months of March (z=-3.450， p=0.001，r=-0.172)，April(z=-3.033，p=0.002，r=-0.152)，May(z= -2.142， p=0.032， r= -0.107)， June (z=-2.789，p=0.005，r=-0.139)， and September (z=-2.446，p=0.014，r=-0.122).\n\n【31】Changes in eating behavior scores before 通用删除7(英):<u>(2019)</u> and during the pandemic 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u>\n\n【32】The eating behavior scores before 2019 and during 2020 were 3.61and 3.51， respectively. During 2020， the score significantly decreased by 2.94% (z= -2.441， p=0.015， r= -0.122). Table 2 presents the responses to each question. A majority of the participants responded“never(score 0) or\"sometimes\" {score 1) to most of the questions. During 2020， the scores for Q1 to Q3 decreased， but those for Q4 and Q5 increased slightly. Only Q3 showed that the percentage of score decreased significantly by 6.03% in 2020 (z=-2.6， p=0.009，r=-0.130).\n\n【33】Changes in PA before 通用删除7(英):<u>(2019)</u> and during the pandemic通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u>\n\n【34】The PA ofvigorous， moderate， and walking (days/week， minutes/day， MET values) decreased during the pandemic in 2020 than that before pandemic in 2019 . However， no significant changes for all types of PA including sitting were found before and during the pandemic. Additionally， we observed a significant change in total all physical activities (all PA) (days/week， minutes/day， MET values)， with a small effect size. The number of days/week， minutes/day of all PA， and MET values of all PA during the pandemic decreased by3.19% (z= -1.998， p<0.05， r= -0.100)， 7.69%(z= -2.302， p<0.05，r=-0.115)， and 8.02%(z=-2.311，p<0.05，r=-0.116)，respectively.\n\n【35】Relationship between HbA1c levels， eating behavior， and PA during the pandemic 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u>\n\n【36】No significant relationship is found between HbAlc levels， PA， and eating behaviors during the pandemic . There was a strong positive relationship between days/week， minutes/week， and MET/week for all PA. There was also a moderately negative， significant relationship between average time of sitting and PA (days/week， minutes/week， and MET/week)， with longer sitting duration associated with lower PA (days， minutes， and MET in a week).\n\n| Item  | 2019  | 2020  | 4(%A)  | Z  | p  | r  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Q1：Unhealty food  | 1.07±0.59  | 1.03±0.59  | 0.03(3.73)  | \\-1.46  | 0.144  | \\-0.073  |\n| Q2： Eating out of control  | 0.98±0.73  | 0.96±0.69  | 0.02(2.04)  | \\-0.832  | 0.405  | \\-0.042  |\n| Q3. snacking between meals  | 1.16±0.66  | 1.09±0.60  | 0.07(6.03)  | \\-2.6  | 0.009\\\\  | \\-0.13  |\n| Q4： Alcohal binge drinking  | 0.30±0.58  | 0.31±0.56  | \\-0.01(-3.33)  | \\-0.816  | 0.414  | \\-0.041  |\n| Q5： Number of meals/day  | 0.10±0.32  | 0.12±0.34  | \\-0.02(-20.0)  | \\-1.069  | 0.285  | \\-0.053  |\n| Total eating behavior score  | 3.61±1.73  | 3.51±1.59  | \\-0.11(-2.94)  | \\-2.441  | 0.015\\\\  | \\-0.122  |\n\n【38】Difference is significant at p<0.01level (2-tailed) \\.

We also evaluated whether HbA1c values associated with PA and eating behaviors. The findings suggest relatively deteriorated HbAlc values during the pandemic than those before pandemic. Additionally， the variables of all PA were significantly decreased and the total eating behavior scores was significantly improved during the pandemic. However， we failed to find any variables in the questionnaire that were clearly related to the increasing values of HbAlc. A Japanese study by Tanji et al.， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> involving 1，009 patients with type 2 diabetes， also had a similar outcome， where the HbAlc values worsened after declaration ofemergency. Furthermore， women aged 2 65 years， those with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m，and those on oral hypoglycemic agents were significantly associated with higher HbAlc|删除段之间换行|values during the pandemic. Compared to values in the present study， the HbAlc values in the study by Tanji et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> werelower by 7.45%and 7.53% before and after emergency， respectively. Moreover， PA and eating behaviors were not investigated in their study.\n\nRecent studies from Japan reported contrasting findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，15，16\\]</u>. Study by Tanaka et al.， showed that the HbAlc values after state of emergency (June 2020) were significantly lower than those before， with 7.5% and 7.7%， respectively， and the changed in HbA1cafterthe emergency was related to the changed in body weight 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The physical activities descriptively showed a reduction after the state of emergency， however， no association with HbA1c was investigated. Takahara et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， analyzed HbA1c values of 1，402 diabetes patients during the state of emergency (March to May 2020)， revealed that34.9% of patients had increased HbA1c by ≥ 0.3% and only 13.4%decreased by ≤ 0.3% with the mean HbAlc was 7.2%. They found that the changed in HbAlc was related with bodyweight， eating behaviors，|删除段之间换行|leisure-time physical activities， but the other physical activities were not significantly related. Another study by Kishimoto et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， in168 patients found the change in HbAlc was associated with both changes in physical activities and eating behaviors. Weight gain was observed in patients with increased HbAlc during the emergency period； however the relationship was not statistically evaluated. Compared to outcome of the present study， these studies， only evaluated a single value of HbAlc before and after state of emergency which involved for several months， wherein seasonal variations may have strongly influenced HbAlc fluctuations in Japanese patients with diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Furthermore， the definitions of physical activities might differ between the studies， which contributed to the different findings.\n\n【46】We believe that other factors， such as the stress environment， which was not included in the study， may add complexity to the outcome. When a person physiologically experiences stress and/or anxiety， cortisol and epinephrine are released by the adrenal glands in response to stress. These hormones then trigger the release of glucose stored in various organs that frequently leads to elevated levels of glucose in the bloodstream. This condition causes glycemic deterioration in patients with diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，19\\]</u>. Furthermore， people with diabetes mellitus are at risk for developing depression and diabetes mellitus-related distress that are associated with poor glycemic control and cardiovascular complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In the current COVID-19 pandemic， there is growing evidence of people experiencing stress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，20，21\\]</u>. Furthermore， olderrpeople with diabetes are more vulnerable to the severity of COVID-19 infection and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22，23\\]</u>. Thus， fear and anxiety ofacquiring COVID-19and the impact of the situation contribute to stress. People who fail to manage their stress effectively， develop chronic physiological stress， depression， health-related problems， and lack of motivation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，22\\]</u>. We could not directly measure stress and cortisol levels， but we believe that studies should be conducted to investigate these aspects in the future.\n\n【47】Japan had not imposed a strict lockdown like many other countries worldwide， but enforcement of COVID-19 management， such as restrictions for out door or unnecessary activities， less meeting with peers， social distancing policies， and business restrictions drastically changed the social and daily lives of people， which contributed to factors of stress. In the present study， the frequency and duration of total all PA decreased significantly during the pandemic and demonstrated a significant relationship with a longer duration of sitting. This is not a surprising finding， as staying at home was one of the primary containment measures used to limit the spread of COVID-19. Moreover， many studies worldwide have reported substantial reductions in PA during the pandemic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，24\\]</u>. Regular PA is important for improving glycemic control and maintaining individual mental health 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However， the restrictions on outdoor activities during the pandemic may have also influenced the emergence of stress in the patients. A previous study conducted with 519 older people in Japan revealed that depression and apathy scores significantly deteriorated in July 2020 than those in December2019， and that these conditions were more prevalent in people aged<75 years who were constantly active 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\nIn the present study， there was a significance changed in eating behaviors during pandemic where the total eating behaviors scores were improved slightly and the changed was related to the reduction of weight in our study population. The score on snacking between meals|删除段之间换行|showed a significant reduction during pandemic. The association between changes in snacking and changes in weight was reported in previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，25\\]</u>. A larger online survey among 6，000participants across Japan revealed that the dietary behaviors in 2020mostly unchanged (71.6%)，healthier(20.3%)， and unhealthier (8.2%) compared to 2019， and changed in weight was significantly related to dietary behaviors. In this survey， only 3.5% of the participants had diabetes， and no data on HbAlc can be compared 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. This finding was different from countries that imposed a complete lockdown. Analysis of a systematic review revealed that the frequency of food intake， meals， and consumption of unhealthy foods/snacks increased during home confinement. Furthermore， psychological changes， such as boredom， stress， distress， and anxiety were associated with people who consumed more food 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【49】There are some limitations to the present study. First，the findings of stage 2 were based on participants’ self-reported PA and eating behaviors. As these questions required the participants to recall their experiences， misreporting was possible. Second， this study was conducted at a single medical institution with a small sample size and specific characteristics； thus， the findings cannot be generalized to other patients at other medical institutions. Therefore， further studies are necessary to clarify whether PA， eating behaviors， and/or stress affect the changes in HbA1c levels during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【50】Conclusion\n\n【51】The present study showed that there are worse glycemic changes during the pandemic in 2020； however， they are unrelated to PA or eating behaviors. We propose that stress factors may contribute to these changes. Furthermore， as older people with uncontrolled diabetes are more vulnerable to the severity and mortality of COVID-19， crucial interventions to improve the glycemic changes should be implemented， even in the challenging pandemic situation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In cases without history of trauma， rare causes like coagulation defects， dural vascular malformations， craniofacial tumors and intracranial infections should be investigated. With this case our aim was to report a rare case of pediatric intracranial epidural hematoma as a result of sinusitis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Epidural； Hematoma； Pansinusitis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The first sinusitis related Intracranial Epidural Hematoma (IEH) was reported by Kelly in 1968and the most recent was a review article in 2014 by Aviner et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. As IEH generally occurs due to trauma， rarely coagulation defects， dural vascular malformations， craniofacial tumors and intracranial infections may be the cause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. Intracranial complications as a result of sinusitis are known； however，IEH is a very rare condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this case report we described a pediatric patient presenting with fever and headache due to IEH.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A fifteen year old male patient presented with rhinorrhea， fever， headache and swelling of the forehead. No history of trauma or bleeding disorders was present. There was no other neurological finding other than neck rigidity. The laboratory findings were as follows： C-Reactive Protein (CRP)51.4 mg/L (reference range 0 to 6)， WBC： 11.88 K/mm’(reference range 4.5 to 11)， Mon： 13.27%(reference range 3% to 8%)， Baso： 0.79% (reference range 0% to 3%). Coagulation panel， liver and kidney function tests， and electrolytes were all normal. On Computerized Axial Tomography Scan of the Brain (CT)； on the left frontal area a highly attenuated epidural collection with 27 mm thickness， and millimetric air densities compatible with hemorrhage were detected.Maxillary， ethmoidal and frontal sinusitis were also present . On the Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain(MRI)； a hyperdense left frontal epidural hemorrhagic collection with milimetrica air densities， accompanied by infection， thickenning of the neighbouring dura and contrast enhancement， maxillary， ethmoidal and frontal sinusitis (Pansinusitis) was detected . The patients were operated， and the hematoma discharged with a burr-hole. The specimens obtained from the hematoma were evaluated on direct microscopy； showing 95% of polymorphonuclear leucocytes，4% oflymphocytes. No microorganisms were grown on culture.\n\n【7】In the postoperative period the patient was admitted to the pediatric department for antibiotic treatment without any neurological deficits. After a 14 days course of empirical Ceftriaxone， Metronidazole and Vancomycin treatment CRP was <3 mg/L，WBC9.15K/mm'and the patient was discharged in a good general condition. In one month follow-up the patient’s cranial CT findings were compatible with postoperative findings .\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】In the neurosurgical practice IEH is a condition that needs fast diagnosis and emergency surgery. On contrary the possibility of morbidity and mortality is very high. It is known to occur often due to trauma. Otherwise， rarely the causes are bleeding disorders， dural vascular malformation， neighbouring infections and tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Sinusitis， maylead to intracranial complications such as meningitis， subdural abscess/empyema， epidural abscess/empyema， cerebral abscess， deep and superficial vein thromboses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-8\\]</u>. However IEH is a rare condition caused by sinusitis.\n\nIn previous cases of sinusitis and intracranial epidural hematomas various microorganisms(Hemophylus influenzae， Staphylococcus aureus， Streptococcus anginosus ve milleri， Pseudomonas|删除段之间换行|cepacia) have been grown in the cultures from the specimens obtained from the hematoma during surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This could also be one of the theories proving that IEH is caused by sinusitis through neighbouring.\n\n【12】The mechanism of sinusitis that leads to IEH has not yet been clearly described. It was tried to be explained with the process of retrograde advancement of inflammation through the diploic vascular canals reaching the intracranial space and rupturing the vessel via inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，8\\]</u>.\n\n【13】It can be envisioned that sinusitis erodes the posterior wall of the frontal sinus， and chronic polymorphonuclear infiltration and irritation causes the vessels in the epidural space to rupture. In our case it is in our opinion that the inflammation reached the epidural area eroding the vessels and causing IEH. The free air densities in the intracranial space supports the theory that sinusitis may have eroded the posterior wall of the frontal sinus. As a matter of fact， in Aviner et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> review， 13 patients were included of which 9 were children； thus the thin bone structure at this age group makes us believe that inflammation leads to sinus wall erosion more easily 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This also supports our theory.\n\nThe patient history should be integrated with radiological findings. Headache， fever and neurological findings； hemorrhage and|删除段之间换行|air densities on CT and MRI， contrast enhancement of the paranasal sinuses and the dura， bone destruction or osteomyelitis are all findings that would help make the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】High fever， headache and change in mental state particularly in childhood should suggest of sinusitis and IEH as a complication. Emergency surgery after a fast diagnosis is of ominous significance. On contrary besides the morbidity and mortality； more difficult to treat and fatal complications such as epidural/subdural empyema， cerebral abscess may develop.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

A 41-year-old healthy man started from an altitude of 143 feet (43.5 meters) and reached an altitude of 13，780 feet (4，200 meters) within one day. After 4 months of residence， he developed decreased vision accompanied by visual field defects in his left eye. Ophthalmic examination revealed bilateral papilledema， peripapillary hemorrhage in his left eye， and retinal hemorrhage in the macular area of optic papilla. He was diagnosed with HAR. After 3 months of treatment， the patient's symptoms and signs improved.\n\n【3】HAR can occur when the human body enters the high-altitude area (the altitude above 3，000 meters) from the low altitude area in a short period of time. This case has deepened the understanding of the effects of high-altitude environment on the retina， and suggested the importance of early diagnose and treatment.\n\n【4】Keywords： High-altitude retinopathy； Retinal hemorrhage； High-altitude sickness； Hypoxia\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】When the human body enters the high-altitude area (the altitude above 3，000 meters) from the low altitude area， a series of diseases caused by hypoxia are collectively called High-Altitude sickness (HAI). The clinical manifestations of high-altitude diseases include Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)， High-Altitude Retinopathy (HAR)， High-Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) and High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE). It has been shown that HAR is closely related to the occurrence and progression ofHACE and HAPE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【7】The ocular symptoms of HAR are tortuous retinal veins， diffuse or punctate retinal hemorrhage(occasionallylocated in the macula)，vitreoushemorrhage，papillaryedema， congestion，peripapillary hemorrhage， etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This paper describes a case of HAR in a 41-year-old healthy man who started from an altitude of 143 feet (43.5 meters) and reached an altitude of 13，780 feet (4，200 meters) within one day.\n\n【8】In July 2022， the 41-year-old man set off from the area at an altitude of 143 feet (43.5 meters) and reached 13，780 feet (4，200 meters) above sea level in Yushu， Qinghai Province， within one day. Yushu City is located in the eastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau， which is the backbone of the terrain formed by the remaining veins of Tanggula Mountain， and has an average elevation of 4493.4meters. It is a typical plateau and alpine climate. The oxygen content of the air is low， only 40%~60% of what it is at sea level. The atmospheric pressure is about 60 kPa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. He resided there until November 2022 for 4 months， with about 4 h to 8 h of physical activity every day. He subsequently developed reduced vision and visual field defects in his left eye， with no systemic symptoms such as headache， dizziness， vomiting or other discomfort. Because his symptoms did not alleviate，he returned to the area of an elevation of 143 feet (43.5 meters) to visit the ophthalmology department.\n\n【9】During the presentation， it was noted that he had decreased visual acuity in his left eye and a sub-nasal visual field defect that had persisted for 2 weeks. The patient had no history of other ocular diseases， systemic diseases， trauma， or surgery. At the same time， he was not taking any oral medication. At the first visit， the corrected visual acuity was 1.0 (20/20) in the right eye and 0.7\n\n【10】(14/20) in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 12 mmHg in both eyes. Slit-lamp biomicroscope showed no positive sign in the bilateral anterior segment of both eyes. Color fundus photographs showed indistinct and congested disc boundaries with papilledema bulges， which were more severe on the left than on the right. The retinal veins were slightly tortuous and dilated， and the ratio of retinal arteries to veins was about 1：2. Lamellar superficial hemorrhage was seen on the nasal side around the optic disc in the left eye， and lamellar retinal hemorrhage was seen in the optic papilla macular area . OCT showed an increase in the thickness of the optic nerve fiber laver in both eves and a W-shaped protuberance in the optic disc. FFA showed mild late-stage fluorescein leakage in the right optic disc and significant late-stage fluorescein leakage in the left optic disc. Blocked fluorescence was observed on the nasal side of the optic disc in the left eye， which was consistent with color fundus hemorrhage . Humphrey's visual field showed an inferior visual field scotoma in the right eye and an inferonasal visual field defect in the left eye .\n\n【11】At the same time， the patient underwent blood routine and biochemical tests. It was found that his hematocrit and hemoglobin content were elevated. This suggests an increase in blood viscosity， which， notably， is thought to be a contributing factor to HAR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The patient was given a peribulbar injection of triamcinolone acetonide to the left eye for anti-inflammatory treatment， oral medication to improve microcirculation， oral mecobalamin tablets， and vitamin B1nutritional nerve therapy.\n\n【12】Four months later， the patient returned to the ophthalmology clinic and reported a reduction in visual field defects in the left eye. The corrected visual acuity in both eyes was the same as in the initial presentation. Color fundus photography revealed reduced papilledema in both eyes. There was also significant absorption of superficial hemorrhage in the macular area of optic papilla and on the nasal side of the optic disc in the left eye . OCT showed a reduction in papilledema . Humphrey's visual field showed that the defect in the inferior nasal quadrant of the visual field in the left eye was smaller than that in the anterior . ERG showed that cone function was impaired in both eyes， more so in the left eye than in the right .\n\n【13】Discussion\n\nPrevious reports have suggested that high-altitude and hypoxia as risk factors for HAR通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Hypoxia can lead to incomplete oxidation of the body's tissues， and the accumulated metabolites can have toxic effects on the tissues， thereby increasing vascular permeability and causing retinal edema，hemorrhage， and exudation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Weidman and Tabin divided HAR into four different grades. Grade 1： Mild retinal hemorrhage of the retinal vein in one PD area； Grade 2： Moderately dilated retinal vein with retinal hemorrhage in two PD areas； Grade|删除段之间换行|3： Significantly dilated retinal vein with retinal hemorrhage in three PD areas， as well as perimacular retinal hemorrhage and vitreous hemorrhage； Grade 4： The retinal vein is significantly dilated and bluish-purple， the retinal hemorrhage is larger than in 3 PD areas， and the macula and retinal vein are tortuous and dilated， affecting central visual acuity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Meanwhile， high-altitude climbers often have elevated hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations， which can lead to increased blood viscosity， increased clotting， and reduced oxygen delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In the first report on HAR published in 1968， Singhet et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> observed papilledema， retinal vein dilatation and retinal hemorrhage in a patient who rose to high-altitude within a short period oftime. In addition， Frayser et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> found that 9 out of 25 subjects (36%) had retinal hemorrhage at an altitude of 17，500\n\n【15】feet (5，334 meters). These are the earliest documented cases of HAR. Subsequent reports of related cases are rare.\n\nInterestingly， Arora et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> found that HAR is more common in young， well-trained people at high altitudes. This may be due to the dilation of blood vessels and the increase of systemic circulatory pressure to which the retina is more susceptible in young adults during exercise. This case is also a case of ocular disease in young and middle-aged people under continuous high-intensity physical activity， which may support the above statement. The study by xi Tian et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> showed that three months after subjects returned to baseline altitude， their retinal condition could return to a normal state， indicating that an increase in atmospheric oxygen content and a decrease in altitude can restore nerve and vascular function. This|删除段之间换行|could also provide evidence that the disease generally has a better prognosis. The occurrence and development of high-altitude sickness depends not only on the rising height， but also on the rising speed， adaptation to high-altitude， personal baseline level and other possible genetic and environmental factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Because the human body moves rapidly from low to high altitudes in a short period of time， it is difficult for the body to immediately adapt to the high altitude and hypoxia environment， and is therefore prone to HAI. The most important thing for HAR is prevention， with a particular focus on slow ascent rates and adequate adaptation time. Once symptoms of HAI appear， stopping further ascent and starting oxygen supplementation and slow altitude reduction are recommended as the best treatment options 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.Other related literature reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>， if the human body can gradually tolerate high-altitude and low oxygen content during the slow adaptation process. Therefore， a climber who is already well adapted to such conditions can climb the Himalayas， reach (and descend from) the summit without using additional oxygen. This sggests that slowing the ascent rate and gradually adapting to lower oxygen levels is beneficial for HAI prevention. Moreover， Wiedman and Tabin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> observed 40 climbers with an altitude of more than4，870 meters and found that all those with HACE had HAR. They argued that treatment of HACE with oxygen， steroids or diuretics should be initiated as soon as possible following a diagnosis of HAR， and that altitude reduction should be initiated immediately to prevent further development of HACE. Another study also confirmed that the severity of HAR was significantly associated with diseases such as HAPE and HACE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. All the above studies demonstrate the importance of early diagnosis of HAR to prevent the development of life-threatening HACE. With the development of science and improved examination methods， early HAR can be identified and diagnosed with modern advanced instruments. In addition to the conventional diagnostic methods， it is worth mentioning that ERG can detect the impaired function of cone cells in early HAR and it can be seen that ERG was used for early diagnosis of HAR in this patient.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】In conclusion，this case of early HAR makes us pay more attention to the early clinical symptoms and signs of HAR. Early diagnosis and treatment， prevention and further prevention of HACE and HAPE may create a better prognosis for patients.\n\n【19】More importantly， timely detection and diagnosis of acute altitude illness can alert physicians to the possibility of the presence or occurrence of other more lethal conditions， such as HAPE and HACE.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Ligament tears due to sports injuries or tissue aging often require surgical intervention， and reconstitution using autologous， allogeneic or artificial ligaments as grafts is currently the gold standard for treating such diseases， but these grafts have many drawbacks. With the development of material science and manufacturing technology， artificial ligament tissue based on biological scaffold is expected to become a new type oftissue donor， by simulating the structure， composition and biomechanical characteristics of natural tissues， the purpose of tissue regeneration can be achieved， in addition to growth factors， mechanical stimulation and other factors also have positive significance for stem cell repair ligament， this paper summarizes the in vitro and animal experimental research of ligament tissue engineering， with biomimicry as the design principle， all aspects of ligament tissue scaffolding are evaluated. In addition， the performance and effect of various factors on stem cells to promote ligament repair and reconstruction are summarized， and the future development direction of bionic scaffolds and mechanical stimulation combined with growth factors on stem cells in ligament tissue engineering research is summarized and prospected， in order to provide new ideas for clinical repair of ligament damage.\n\n【2】Keywords： Ligament tissue engineering； Scaffold； Bionic； Biological materials； Biological factors\n\n【3】Introduction\n\nLigaments are dense connective tissue that connects the bone and maintain joint stability during exercise and rest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The mechanical properties of the ligament make it prone to laceration after sports injury or tissue aging. The repaired ligament is mainly disordered fibrous scar tissue， and its biomechanical properties are far inferior to those of normal tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. About 33 million musculoskeletal injuries are reported in the United States each year， with 50% of tendon/ligament injuries， and on average over 300，000 patients undergo surgery to repair a damaged tendon or ligaments annually 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In China， the incidence of rotator cuff injury is 20% at 60 years old and31% at 70 years old， but there is no accurate statistics on the incidence of ligament injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-8\\]</u>. Although transplantation can restore some mechanical function in a short period oftime， the use of autologous， allograft or xenograft brings some problems， such as artificialligament/tendon products represented by Leeds Keio and LARS show good initial mechanical strength and postoperative joint stability in clinical use， lack of viscoelasticity， wear and aging， limited autologous tissue regeneration caused synovitis， medium and long-term injury mechanical strength and even graft failure， making the clinical application of artificial ligament/tendon graft controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The purpose of ligament tissue engineering is to combine the scaffold， cells， growth factors， and mechanical stimuli in viro to reconstruct the structure and function of the injured ligaments. Seed cells， growth factors， and mechanodynamic stimulation can greatly increase the application effect of fiber scaffolds in ligament tissue engineering， and the review of scaffold manufacturing technology is conducive to the development of ligament tissue engineering. As a structural basis， the scaffold provides mechanical support and a cellular microenvironment， it functioning similar to the Extracellular Ligament Matrix (ECM). Composition and mechanical properties mimic natural ligament tissue. Now a days， the most studied ligament tissue engineering projects are fibrous stents and heterogeneous|删除段之间换行|interface stents， which facilitate the reconstruction of the tendon -bone interface and ultimately anchor the regenerated ligament in the bone. In recent years， due to retaining the structure， composition and mechanical properties of the original tissue， scaffolds derived from biological tissue have been studied more and more in ligament or interface tissue engineering， among which book acellular scaffolds are more innovative|10|.\n\n【5】Seed Cells\n\n【6】Immune rejection and disease transmission. Adult bone marrow is a collection of bone marrow recharge stem cells， and Bone Marrow Recharge Stem Cells (BMSC) can self-renew and have the ability to differentiate into various mesenchymal cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. Several remarkable properties ofBMSCs make them a clear choice for various tissue engineering： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> they can form a single colony of fibroblasts that can be isolated and expanded according to their ability to adhere to a solid surface to contain large numbers of cells； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the massive amplification of BMSCs in vitro has no obvious pathological effect on the eventual formation of ligament tissue in vivo and can differentiate into ligaments and tendons， and it is precisely because of this property that it is a popular seed cell in tissue engineering ligament construction； 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> by setting the same culture conditions can induce the differentiation of BMSCs into different mesenchymal phenotypes， including osteoblasts， chondroblasts， adipoblasts， and tendon/ligament cells； 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the tissue-engineered ligaments formed by BMSCs can be used as a suitable autograft without surgical resection. No risk of an immune response (an allograft may occur) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Growth Factors\n\nGrowth factors play an important role in inducing and/or supporting the expression of specific mesenchymal cell lines. Oxygen can influence the rate of extracellular matrix synthesis and the development of tissue-engineered tissues in vitro. Whether oxygen affects stem cell differentiation into ligamentous fibroblasts is unknown. Fermor et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> showed that high oxygen concentration(21%) maximizes the differentiation of ACL fibroblasts， while low oxygen concentration (10%) promotes extracellular collagen synthesis. As a long-acting source of vitamin C， phosphate vitamin C has significantly increased the viability of cultured cells in vitro and increased the expression level of type I collagen by. Epidermal birth Growth Factors such as long factor (EGF)， basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF)， Insulin-like Growth Factor-II (IGF-Il， and Transforming Growth Factor-(TGF-) can enhance cell proliferation. Furthermore， insulin， TGF-，and IGF-can promote connective tissue protein expression and extracellular matrix production. Its effect on the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells is also related to concentration， but the specific dose-effect relationship needs to be further studied. TGF-and EGF as well as TGF- and insulin can synergistically stimulate the proliferation of fibroblasts and stromal cells. BMSCs were cultured in vitro using Advanced DMEM (ADMEM) medium with or without added growth factors by Morrow et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The expression level of collagen type I was all significantly increased in BMSCs when compared with DMEM medium. The combination of EGF and TGFs (in sequence) maximizes cell proliferation and type I collagen expression. The effect of growth factors on BMSCs is dose-dependent.Hankemeier et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> have shown that low-dose bFGF (3 ng/mL) significantly promotes the differentiation of BMSCs into fibroblasts and significantly increases ligament and tendon-specific extracellular matrix expression of cytoskeletal components， but has no effect at high doses of bFGF 通用删除7(英):<u>(30)</u>|删除段之间换行|ng/ml)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16-18\\]</u> .\n\n【9】Mechanical Stimulation\n\n【10】Mechanical signals that affect ligament growth and development in vivo also play an important role in tissue-engineered ligament cultures in vitro.Theapplication of stress can affect tissue development in at least two ways： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> enhancing the matrix 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> directly stimulating cells. Mechanical stimulation of cultured ligamentous fibroblasts enhanced the expression of type I and type III collagen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， fibronectin， and mucin-C. In the absence of specific growth factors and regulators， human MSCs can differentiate into ligament-like cells by exposing human MSCs to physiological circulatory stress. Stress can alter the autologous and the fineness of the tissue-engineered ligaments. The extracellular environment， which directly affects cell shape and fibrillary clearance， or enhances mass delivery in and out of the cell through fluid flow. Mechanical pressure stress directly acting on the cellular level can stimulate the proliferation and regeneration of BMSCs and promote bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to repair ligament damage.\n\n【11】Stent Material\n\n【12】The scaffold materials involved in ligament or tendon tissue engineering are generally divided into synthetic polymers， natural polymers， inorganicc osteoconductive materials and biological tissue-derivedmaterials.Synthetic polymersmainly include Polycaprolactone (PCL)， Poly-L-Lactic Acid (PLLA)， Polyglycolic Acid (PGA)， Poly-L-Lactide-Co-Caprolactone (PLCL)， Polylactic Acid-Co-Glycolide (PLGA)， Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET)， etc. Natural macromolecules mainly include Collagen (COL)， Silk Fibroin (SF)， silk， chitosan， Hyaluronic Acid (HA)， Chondroitin Sulfate (CS)， fiber glucosamine， Glycosaminoglycan (GAG)， alginate， Gelatin (GEL)， etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.

Traditional electrospinning techniques can spray material solutions into filaments by applying an electric field， and the arrangement or diameter of the fibers can be tuned by multiple parameters. Melt electrospinning can generate more precise and repeatable fiber patterns， such as sinusoidal fibers with specific wavelengths and amplitudes， mimicking the coiled structure of collagen fibers， further enhancing the guiding effect of fiber topology on cells.

Munsterb For the first time，4 PET and 20 PLLA wires were used to construct a \"Tiger\"scaffold， a composite gradient mesh， and the mechanical strength of the composite scaffold reached the maximum peak load (996 N) in the current rabbit ACL reconstruction study. Two mechanically enhanced scaffolds were used for ACL reconstruction in rabbits， and the scaffold structure remained intact and supported tissue ingrowth at 12 weeks postoperatively. Liu used SF/PLCL composite braid based on multilayer braided scaffolds to improve the pore size of SF braided scaffolds by surface modification of L-lysine andhyaluronic acid on the adhesion， migration and proliferation activities of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)， rate and mechanical strength. Zhang et al. performed3 chemical optimizations on the ordered PLLA fibrous scaffolds and found that surface modification of COL on the scaffolds significantly improved cell penetration， allowing uniform distribution within a week， and then used fibroblast growth factor and transforming sequential biochemical stimulation of growth factors significantly improves ECM synthesis and organization， while fibrin glue can bind between fibrous layers， increase scaffold thickness to some extent， and synergize with growth factors to promote ECM synthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29-31\\]</u>.

Recent studies have found that theassembly ofPCLandPLGA fibers can enhance the axial mechanical strength of fiber scaffolds， promote the axial stretching and alignment of cells， induce tendon differentiation and ECM deposition of MSCS， and even alleviate inflammatory conditions (FBS) by inhibiting ECM deterioration. By simulating the diameter and structure of natural|删除段之间换行|collagen fibers， Lu prepared SF membranes with parallel groove comb-like structures with groove widths ranging from 5 um to 20um.

In one study， ordered PCL nanofiber bundles were implanted in sheep cadavers for ACL reconstruction， and mechanical testing showed that the scaffold was similar to ACL in terms of fatigue resistance， toe stiffness， and post-implantation anterior-posterior stability. Petrilliano Rat ACL reconstruction using ordered PCL nanofiber scaffolds. After 12 weeks， collagen deposition was found on the scaffolds in the bone tunnel and the intra-articular area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>， smaller than natural ligaments. Leong's team fabricated a PCL/COL ordered fibrous scaffold for rat ACL reconstruction and found that the initial maximum load and stiffness of the graft in vivo were 13.5%and 15.7% of that of native ACL， respectively， and increased by 28.2%over 31.3% postoperatively， 16 weeks %. A similar scaffold was then fabricated with super-polymer PCL for rat ACL reconstruction. In vitro mechanical properties were not tested. Although the mechanical strength of the ultra-high polymer PCL graft was found to be stronger than that of ordinary PCL at 16 weeks after surgery， its ultimate load and stiffness only reached 41.9% and 21.3% of that of the native ACL. Taken together， it is found that although ordered fibrous scaffolds made of such synthetic polymers can induce tendon differentiation and ECM deposition in vitro and in vivo， the mechanical strength after implantation is still much lower than that of ACL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38-39\\]</u>.\n\nCore-sheath structure： Theligamenthas a multi-layered structure such as collagen fibers and fiber bundles. The fiber bundles at all levels are wrapped by appropriate endothelium and tendon sheaths. The mesh structure also improves the overall mechanical strength of the ligament. Some scientists fabricated PLLA nanofiber mats by electrospinning and rolled them into fiber bundles. After bundling100 parallel fiber bundles together， the disordered PLLA fiber sheath was attached to the surface， successfully simulating the gradient. Fiber and core sheath structure. The frame stress-strain curve has a good toe-in and linear range. Similar stiffness to tape， but lower tensile strength. FB can penetrate between fibers and perform well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>， proliferation activity. The Teuschl et al. used degummed silk fibers|删除段之间换行|for graded twisting and braiding， wrapped two inner braided ropes with a tubular braided outer sheath， and constructed a core-sheath structural framework based on the braided fibers， with a maximum load and stiffness of 1，450 N and 1，300 N， respectively. It is 450 N. 200N/mm， all within the range of mechanical strength of sheep cruciate ligament. One year after the operation， it was found that the fibrous filaments of the intra-articular skeleton were significantly reduced， to a large extent， the new ligament tissue grew in， and the graft was connected to the spherical new bone at the junction of the bone tunnel. The use ofautologous vascular stromal tissue has no long-term effect. Cai et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u> first fabricated PCL fiber bundles wrapped with PLCL/SF nanofibers， and then weaved the core-sheath-structured wires into a 3D scaffold with peak load and elastic modulus of 77 N and 91 MPa， respectively， which are suitable for in vitro studies. The tendon differentiation of MSCs was significantly increased. When the scaffold was used to repair the patellar ligament defect in rabbits， the histological and mechanical properties of the repaired tissue were better than those of the PCL fiber scaffold at 6 months after surgery， and were similar to the natural tissue. It can be seen that the sheathed graded fiber scaffold improves the integrity and mechanical strength of the scaffold by mimicking the natural ligament structure while supporting cell and tissue ingrowth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Multiphase Tendon Bone Interface Stent the Tendon\n\nBone interface is composed of tendon， fibrocartilage， calcified fibrous cartilage， and bone tissue junctions， and the mechanical performance differences and structural gradients of this composition formation can avoid tissue damage caused by stress concentration during stress conduction. The difficulty of interface tissue engineering lies in the simultaneous regeneration of multiple tissue types and restoring their unique gradient structure and mechanical properties， while the multiphase scaffold designed based on biomimetic principles brings hope for the regeneration of such complex tissues. Different regions on the scaffold have different representative phases depending on the structure or composition， such as the typical three-phase tendon-bone interface scaffold usually including the ligamentous phase， fibrlochondral phase， and bone phase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>. Inorganic materials are commonly used bone conduction materials in bone tissue engineering， and growth factors have the ability to induce multidirectional differentiation. Recent studies of interface tissue engineering often construct heterogeneous scaffold 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u> based on the constituent gradients of both. TCP has become a commonly used material in bone and interface tissue engineering due to its inherent bone-induction properties and an appropriate degradation rate. In one study， 3D printing was used to create a porous PCL (tendon region) -tubular PCL/TCP (fibrocartilage region) -porous PCL/TCP(bone region) three-phase scaffold forming a TCP gradient from the bone region to the tendon showing good pore connectivity at both stages， supporting the adhesion and proliferation of FB， Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells (BMSCs) and osteoblasts， respectively， and chondrogenesis in the scaffold fibrocartilage region 21 days after chondrogenesis induction and culture. After implantation in mice at8 weeks after subcutaneous injection， marker genes were identified from tendons， cartilage， and bone during the scaffold stage， and the upregulation of COL-X further clarified the formation of calcified cartilage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. In another study， a 3D-printed PCL/PLGA/-TCP stent was wrapped and secured in the femoral and tibial tunnel to complete the rabbit ACL reconstruction， forming a TCP gradient-visible bone junction tissue between the stent and the autologous tendon， rich|删除段之间换行|in fibrocartilage， and the bone tunnel area was significantly reduced by 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. Interestingly， some scientists used polyethylene glycol gel to connect the COL/GAG at both ends and the calcified COL/GAG material at both ends to form a three-phase scaffold， which enhanced the toughness of the gel by optimizing the gel viscoelastic transition process， and the stress concentration became the interface framework designed to combine the mineral gradient with the stress distribution mechanism of \\[471.\n\n【34】Both HAp and TCP are calcium phosphate materials， with a long degradation cycle and good bone conductivity， which are often used in the design of interface tissue engineering scaffolds. The three-phase woven fiber scaffold， designed by Calejo was woven from wet-spun PCL/GEL ordered fibers and PCL/GEL/HAp disordered fibers into the middle and deposited COL-II and COL-X， suggesting bone and cartilage matrix synthesis， and another study found that the deposition of COL-I， GAG + COL-II and calcium in human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSCs) was similar to the composition gradient of the tendon-bone interface matrix8 weeks after implantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>. Rat rotator cuff injury to mature collagen fibers and fibrocartilage structures were clearly visible in the repair group.\n\n【35】Biological Tissue-Derived Scaffolds\n\nBiological tissue scaffolds are obtained directly taken from tissues or organs， preserve ECM after physical and chemical cell removal， and scaffolds are more similar in structure， composition， and function to native tissues than other types of scaffolds， and low immunogenicity ensures biocompatibility. Recently， several studies have used single tissue or composite tissue to prepare de-acellular scaffolds for tendon or ligament tissue engineering， and achieved some results by cell replantation， mechanical stimulation or material addition， but there are also insufficient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>. Studies have shown that the fiber parallel structure and some mechanical properties(tensile strength， stiffness， fracture elongation) of decellularized tendon do not differ significantly different compared with before decellularization. In the study of rabbit ACL xenocellular tendon reconstruction， it was found that the cell replanting of the scaffold combined with mechanical stimulation significantly increased the mechanical strength after the graft， while the HAp/gold nanoparticle composite scaffold could promote regeneration， however， the host tissue remodeling had varying degrees of inflammation and graft degradation or necrosis. In interface tissue engineering， the un-celled composite bone-fibrocartilage-tendon tissue is a multiphase scaffold with natural structural and compositional gradients. Su et al. took the tendon bone junction complex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[50\\]</u> in the porcine Achilles tendon. After decellularization， they found that the structure of collagen fibers and cartilage fibers were basically retained， while the COL and GAG were partially retained， similar to the human Achilles tendon. Mouse BMSCs showed excellent adhesion， infiltration， and proliferative activity on the scaffold， and the tendon and bone marrow genes were upregulated in the corresponding regions 2 weeks later. After the re transplantation of the cells to the scaffold， the rabbit medial collateral ligament significantly promoted the osseointegration within the tunnel as compared with the cell-free tendon alone. Another study decellularized the canine patella-patellar ligament complex and confirmed that the retention of fibrocartilage matrix and collagen fiber axial structures promoted the infiltration， axial arrangement and tendon differentiation of BMSC under traction stimulation， but not obvious cartilage differentiation. In recent years， Professor Tang’s et al. has been committed to the study of the cell-|删除段之间换行|free scaffold structure of the cell layer. The book structure cuts the whole scaffold into a page structure. The side of the tissue is cut off， and the opposite side is connected to the spine to facilitate the binding between the scaffolds or with the cell sheet. They successively prepared fibrocartilage and tendon tissue from rabbit bone， and demonstrated their good biocompatibility and ability to induce MSCs to differentiate into scaffold original tissue lineages and bind to MSCs in vitro. The rabbit patellar tendon junction and Achilles tendon defects were repaired，respectively， with good tissue structure and function. The team recently designed a book-like composite scaffold that combines acellular bone， fibrocartilage， and tendons， which cross-connects between pages to form four transition areas similar to the tendon-bone interface， attaching the BMSC cell layer evenly to the 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[51\\]</u> between them. After 2 weeks， the expression of bone， cartilage and ligament marker genes and proteins in each region， and then the scaffold/cell constructs were implanted in the rabbit patellar-patellar-tendon defect， which was locally formed at16 weeks after surgery， retained the continuous bone-fibrocartilage-tendon interface tissue，histological and biochemical analysis showed structural and composition gradient， the mechanical strength of the interface is also significantly higher than the control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[52\\]</u>. Biological tissue-derived scaffolds were found to have good biocompatibility because the original tissue ECM microenvironment is preserved to varying degrees and has the potential to induce MSCs to differentiate into native lineages of scaffolds and undergo tissue regeneration. However，such scaffolds still have the problem of cell residues leading to an inflammatory response of the immune system or variable loss of components， causing its mechanical strength and diminished abilityto induce differentiation. Some studies improved the retention of ECM components and growth factors by optimizing the sodium dodecyl sulfate concentration and de-cellulation time with sufficient cell removal，andthescaffold showed a more significant differentiation induction on MSCs.TTherefore， while further optimizing the cellular desalination technique， a comprehensive evaluation of the decentralized frame structure， composition， and mechanical properties of the 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53-59\\]</u> should be completed in the future.\n\n【37】Summary and Outlo ok\n\nThe study of ligament tissue engineering scaffolds involves a wide range of materials and manufacturing techniques， whose bionics is embodied in achieving similar mechanical properties and physicochemical environments by mimicking the composition and macroscopic and microstructures of ligaments with endogenous tissues. In vivo animal studies show that such scaffolds still have problems such as insufficient mechanical strength， fatigue resistance and tissue regeneration ability， and composite biomimetic multi-phase scaffolds are still the main idea of ligament tissue engineering scaffold design in the future. Bionics in structure and composition is difficult to achieve. The advent of biological tissue scaffolds yields a simplified scheme for the construction of scaffolds， and their inherent biomimetic properties in composition and structure confer a favorable bio-induced environment and mechanical properties， including ligament creep resistance and stress distribution at the interface. Subcellular matrix components and matrix degradation caused by inflammation in vivo can affect scaffold properties.

Her past medical history includes coronary artery disease， diabetes and has dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease. The notes in her chart are sparse and specific questions related to this case were answered by her principal care givers and her daughter. In February， 2021， a swab was collected from an ankle lesion which had been persisting for a \"long time. The request to the clinical microbiology laboratory was to specifically look for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The wound was described as red and inflamed and the patient complained of itchiness. The patient considered the wound to be“old ringworm\". The patient has been in this care home for the past 5 years and there is no history of travel. Due to province wide COVID-19 restrictions for long term care facilities， visitation was limited or not allowed and patients were restricted from leaving the facility. The patient’s daughter (and family) has a farm with cattle， sheep， chickens and llamas along with dogs and cats. The rural location is also known to have an abundance of wild squirrels. The patient had not visited the family farm in the past 5 years. Goats and miniature horses were brought to the care home property for residents to interact with but it is unclear if this patient was in physical contact with them. New care products|删除段之间换行|have not been introduced to the patient in the period leading up to the ankle lesion being sampled.\n\n【17】Laboratory Investigations\n\n【18】The swab was inoculated to blood (tryptic say agar containing 5%sheep red blood cells)， phenylethyl， MacConkey and Chromogenic(specific for MRSA) agar plates and incubated for 18 h to 24 h in ambient air. A Gram stain from the swab showed abundant squamous epithelial cells and abundant Gram-positive cocci isclusters. Polymorphonuclear cells were not seen. As such， this swab was likely a superficial collection from the wound rather than a “deep”ulcer collection.\n\n【19】Following overnight incubation， Staphylococcus kloosii and Staphylococcus capitiIsS were recovered. The organismIsSwere identified by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) (bioMerieux， Lyon France). Staphylococcus capitis was not further investigated and reported as “skin flora”. Staphylococcus kloosii was repeatedly tested by MALDI-TOF with the same identification. To further confirm the organism identification， Staphylococcus kloosii was sequenced using the Nanopore MinION Mk1C with sequence analysis using EPI2ME software from Nanopore Technologies. Susceptibility testing was by Kirby-Baurer and e-test as per the recommended procedures， interpretation and quality control organisms of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).\n\n【20】The organism was resistant to oxacillin (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) 1.5 ug/ml) and was D-Zone negative. It was susceptible to cefoxitin (zone size 26 mm)， ciprofloxacin (26 mm)， clindamycin (24 mm)， erythromycin (28 mm)， linezolid (MIC 2 ug/ml)， moxifloxacin (28 mm)， rimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) (34 mm) and vancomycin (MIC 0.75 ug/ml). The patient was treated with cephalexin 500 mg 4 times/day for 10 days and the wound returned to \"normal\". Further testing or antimicrobial therapy was not done.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】We report on recovery of Staphylococcus kloosii from an ankle wound of an elderly lady in a long-term level 4 health care facility without an explanation on how this organism might have been transmitted to this patient. To the best of our knowledge， this is only the 2nd report of this organism being recovered from a human specimen with a suspected infection. Peer et al reported a 60 year old male patient with an intracranial bleed and sepsis associated with Staphylococcus kloosii and the patient subsequently died. In their report， the organism was susceptible to ciprofloxacin， gentamicin， amikacin， vancomycin， teicoplanin and tigecycline but resistant to penicillin， oxacillin， erythromycin， clindamycin， TMP/SMX， ofloxacin and linezolid. Our isolate was borderline oxacillin resistant(MIC 1.5 ug/ml) but cefoxitin susceptible and pan susceptible to the non-beta lactam agents tested. Borderline oxacillin resistance has been previously described with Staphylococcus aureus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Unfortunately， there was no suggestion in the case report from Peer et al. as to neither where this organism might have been acquired nor a sufficient description of the patient and patient's environment to make any assumptions.\n\nStaphylococcus kloosii a coagulase negative Gram positive cocci within the Staphylococcus genus of bacteria and are typically novobiocin， erythromycin and bacitracin resistant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Schleifer et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> indicated that Staphylococcus kloosii is mainly found on the|删除段之间换行|skin of various wild animals， including squirrels and only rarely on farm animals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Prevalence data on this organism in wildlife in Saskatchewan and Canada is unavailable. This organism has also been associated with soy sauce manufacturing during the fermentation process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， from sweet paste (Chinese Traditional Seasoning)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>， from the respiratory tree of Holothuria (Mertensiothuria) leucospilota-sea cucumber in Malaysian waters 12 and in the nasal passage of the common buzzard (Buteo buteo) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Sea cucumbers are in high abundance in marine Malaysian environments being used in both traditional and modern medicine. As well， they are also an important food source for some geographical regions of Malaysia. There is no indication that our patient had any connection to medicines or products that could have been potentially contaminated with this organism. Becker et al. reported on Staphylococcus kloosii from goats 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> and Condas et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> reported 1 strain recovered from dairy cows from 91 farms in Canada in 2007-2008 as part ofa national study investigating bovine mastitis. The rarity of this organism from cattle makes acquisition from these farm animals unlikely. Fountain et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> reported on Staphylococcus kloosii from fruit bats (Pteropus livingstonii) and Montgomery et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> reported on recovery of this organism from the oral cavity of 1/23 wild Komodo dragons (Varanus komodoensis). These are not associated with our patient.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】In summary， we report a case of Staphylococcus kloosii from an ankle wound of an elderly female patient with no obvious source of transmission from an animal or animal environment. The apparent rarity of this organism raises an intriguing question as to its source. Regardless， this represents only the 2n report ofthis organism from a human patient and potentially related to infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Here I present a 28years old woman diagnosed with primary amenorrhea secondary to congenital absence of the endometrium.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】History\n\n【7】A 28 years old lady presented to Gondar University Hospital complaining failure to menstruate. She was also married 5 years back but failed to conceive. She had no problem of sexual intercourse. She has never used contraception. Her peer friends are menstruating and have children. She has 2sisters but both are yet below age of 13years. She noticed development ofher breasts and pubic hair at the age of 14 years. She has monthly cyclic lower abdominal discomfort and breast pain. A year back she was seen at nearby health institution and was prescribed with progesterone but there was no withdrawal bleeding. She was then given combined oral contraceptive pills for 3 months and there was no uterine bleeding. She has no head ache， visual disturbance or galactorrhea. She has no history of uterine instrumentation， history of pelvic infection or tuberculosis. She had no history of chronic medical illnesses.\n\n【8】Physical examination\n\nShe is apparently healthy looking with normal body makeup and stature. The vital signs are|删除段之间换行|within normal range. Her weight is 60 kg and height is 168 cm . She has female type hair distribution over her head. No anterior neck masses. Breasts are well developed symmetrical and pendulous. She has normal female type external genitalia with female type pubic hair distribution of adult type. Vagina is 9 cm long with normal cervix and cervical opening seen.

{"seq_id": "065c38bd-25f0-4abc-83fb-d70346596613", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that is classed as a demyelinating disorder of the nervous system along with other leukodystrophies. The disease is characterized by a genetic deficiency of Arylsulfatase A (ARSA)， or the deficiency of Saposin B (which activates ARSA and is a non-enzymatic protein co-factor). ARSA has the function of breaking down and removing sulfatides from the body， and is toxic to myelin when built up in the CNS or PNS， causing pathological demyelination of the nerves. Cerebroside sulfate， which is normally broken down by ARSA， consequently accumulates， and is what causes the toxicity to myelin. We present a 2-year-old male who presented with recurring seizures and drop attacks beginning 18 months of age. He then recently began to regress with regard to milestones and subsequently progressed to quadriplegia. The case was investigated with an MRI and confirmatory biochemical testing for MLD. The MR imaging showed areas of elevated signal intensity of periventricular white matter， and the contrast MR shows early signs of demyelination on the basis of the lack of enhancement.\n\n【2】Keywords： Metachromatic leukodystrophy； Lysosomal storage disorders； Leukodystrophies； Demyelinating disorder； Seizures； Developmental delay\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\nA 2-year-old male presented to the outpatient pediatric neurology department of a large tertiary care center for further evaluation of persistent deterioration of gross motor skills as well as regression of his developmental milestones. He began experiencing paroxysmal drop attacks starting around 18 months of age， described as sudden loss of motor tone and consciousness that would result in him falling to the floor during normal everyday activities. Although previously meeting all developmental milestones， including walking unsupported，his motor functions deteriorated to the point that on presentation he was unable to sit up unsupported. He waspreviously misdiagnosed with Doose's syndrome， which is a seizure disorder characterized by frequent myoclonic and myoclonic-atonic seizures， owing in part to the limited availability of MR imaging studies in the rural areas of which the patient was a resident. The patient had no family history for seizure disorders. No other significant past medical or surgical history was reported， and he was delivered at term， via normal vaginal delivery， with an uncomplicated post-partum course. On initial examination the patient was a non-dysmorphic male who appeared his stated age. Vital signs were within normal limits. Neurologic examination was pertinent for generalized weakness in all muscle groups， with muscle power being 2/5. Reflexes were exaggerated， and bilateral plantar reflexes were up going. A generalized increase in body tone was also noted. Basic investigations including a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were unremarkable. Further imaging was sought with an MRI of the brain， which showed bilateral symmetrical confluent areas of periventricular deep white matter signal change， in particular around the atria and frontal horns with sparing of subcortical U fibers leading to a \"butterfly pattern\" on T2 weighted imaging， along with the tigroid' pattern on the axial section and the leopard'pattern on sagittal sections which were classic for a diagnosis of metachromatic leukodystrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. A contrast enhanced MRI showed lack of enhancement in areas of demyelination， a finding which also indicative of MLD . Biochemical testing also confirmed deficient ARSA activity in leukocytes. The patient was managed with injectable levetiracetam and divalproex sodium syrup for seizure control， along-with muscle relaxants for|删除段之间换行|symptom control. Physical therapy rehabilitation services were offered. Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the standard of care for management of early or no MLD disease， the parents of the patient refused to provide consent for the procedure in view of the risks and complications of the procedure.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】The pathogenesis of MLD revolves around the fact that deficiency of arylsulfatase A disrupts the normal metabolism of sulfate compounds， which are the most important components myelin. This defect leads to the accumulation of lipid material (e.g.， cerebroside sulfate)， which stains metachromatic in the white matter of the CNS and PNS， as well as in other organs like the gallbladder and kidney \\[1-41. When the accumulation occurs in glial cells and neurons， it causes a pathological demyelination. The clinical course is progressive， characterized for symptoms such as paralysis， tremors， stiffness， dysphagia， seizures， ataxia， optic atrophy， speech alterations， and deterioration of mental abilities， dementia and deterioration of the peripheral nervous system. In a growing child， this is characterized by a regression of milestones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. This pathology is classified on the basis of age of onset of symptoms， and there are three recognized variants：Late infantile， between 6 and 24 months； juvenile， between 3 and 16years old， and adult MLD which begins at any age after puberty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In the early-onset variant， there is a predominant motor loss that comes before the mental deficit； in later-onset variants， the deterioration is reversed with neuropsychiatric symptoms preceding the motor. The progression of the disease is unstoppable and typically patients tend to die around a decade after symptoms present. The brain changes can be evidenced in magnetic resonance images， in T2 sequences， FLAIR and diffusion studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. The classic findings， notably the afore-mentioned \"butterfly pattern， as well as the classic ‘tigroid' pattern on axial or ‘leopard pattern on sagittal sections with relative sparing of sub-cortical U fibers were well described in our patient， and with progression can lead to cortical and subcortical atrophy. The gene that encodes Arylsulfatase A is on Chromosome 22p13.33. Treatment options currently available include bone marrow transplantation， enzyme replacement therapy， and gene therapy. However， their effectiveness in improving the long-term prognosis of the disease has not yet been proven. Bone Marrow Transplantation has been implemented to curb CNS effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， and the best clinical results are obtained when it is done before the symptoms present. Other treatment aspects include physical rehabilitation andpharmacological treatment of symptoms.\n\n【7】Conclusion\n\n【8】Since the clinical course of metachromatic leukodystrophy is fatal， it is necessary for early recognition of this disease. As our case demonstrates， it is important to limit misdiagnosis， which can delay appropriate care. The almost crucial role of MRI for accurate diagnosis is also highlighted here. The disease has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern， and therefore carrier screening and genetic counseling are important aspects of the management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Approximately 5% of MPNSTs are EMPNSTs.EMPNST is similar to MPNST in that they are both of neural origin. Histologically， EMPNST differs in that its cells are epithelioid in nature. EMPNST has a specific histologic marker profile which is diffusely positive for S100 & SOX-10 with alack of expression ofINI-1. In this study， we present the case of a 30-year-old female with a non-locally invasive EMPNST who underwent wide local surgical excision. Research is limited in this disease process and management of these neoplasms is not structured or standardized. Wide local excision currently remains the mainstay of treatment and chemoradiation is an option for advanced or metastatic disease.\n\n【2】Keywords： Epithelioid Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor； Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor； Excision\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST) are considered a rare form of sarcoma which originate from peripheral nerves or from cells associated with the nerve sheath， such as Schwann cells or fibroblasts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Also known as malignant schwannomas， the incidence of MPNSTs is approximately 3% to 10% of malignant soft tissue tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. MPNST is considered to be an aggressive soft tissue tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. MPNSTs are， for the most part， bulky， deep-seated tumors， which often form in the neck， extremities or buttocks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Generally speaking， half of MPNST's present de novo and half are related to Neurofibromatosis type I(NF-1)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Prognosis of patients with these MPNST nerve sheath tumors is decreased in certain circumstances including the presence of neurofibromatosis， tumor size， excisional margins，site and depth of tumor location.In patients with a tumor size >5 cm it seems that tumor recurrence and metastases is increased 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，7\\]</u>.

The mass had grown slowly over time at the site of her last epidural which was 3 years prior. The mass itself was non tender， irritation was present with certain clothing but due to its location and increasing size， the patient requested surgical removal. The patient had no history of cancer|删除段之间换行|or radiation exposure. Family history was positive for cancer on her father's side， but was unaware of any specific details regarding that history. Physical exam revealed a large 3 cm × 4 cm x 1 cm pedunculated exophytic mass roughly at the level of L4. The mass was non-tender with a firm and rubbery texture on palpation. There was no erythema， induration， or other signs of infection. The patient had no similar masses or skin lesions elsewhere. The initial differential diagnosis was lipoma vs. acrochordon. The patient was scheduled for elective surgical excision. In the operating room， a wide elliptical incision was made along the vertical axis of the spine using a 15 blade scalpel. The soft tissue was dissected using electrocautery until normal appearing subcutaneous adipose tissue was encountered. The mass was then excised en bloc. The subcutaneous tissue was approximated using a simple interrupted stitch with 3-0 Vicryl suture and the epidermis was closed using an interrupted horizontal mattress stitch with 2-0 nylon. Post operatively， the excision site healed well without any complications. Gross pathology revealed a 4.0 cm x3.0 cmx1.8cm mass weighing 16.0 grams . Located centrally within the specimen is a 3.5 cm x 2.5 cm x2.5 cm subcutaneous lobulated mass with the nearest margin being 0.2 cm. Immunohistochemical stains were performed with the results shown in Table 1通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13-18\\]</u>， which also highlights a description and some of the common uses of each stain.\n\nWith this initial stain pattern， the diagnosis was indeterminate. The pathologist recommended an outside pathology consultation with the Cleveland Clinic for further evaluation and confirmation. At the Cleveland Clinic， additional immunostains included smooth muscle actin， EMA， BRAF and INI-1. The mass showed weak|删除段之间换行|immuno-activity against EMA， as well as loss of nuclear expression of INI-1. No significant activity was seen for the other tumor markers. Based on their evaluation， the diagnosis of epithelioid MPNST was made with the following features： mitotic rate of 3/10 HPF， no necrosis noted， histologic grade 2 with negative margins， and no lymphovascular identified.\n\n【11】With the diagnosis of EMPNST， the patient was referred to an oncologist for recommendations on chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. A CT scan of the chest， abdomen and pelvis was done for staging purposes. The scans did not reveal any evidence of metastasis or lymphadenopathy and therefore， no adjuvant therapy was indicated. With the narrow margin of 0.2 cm， a discussion was had regarding re-excision， however， the patient elected for close clinical follow up with the oncologist and surgeon.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】The reason for presentation to a surgical clinic for an EMPNST will either be for cosmetic reasons or because there is associated pain. Generally， a patient will present with a new onset mass. The patient in our case presented with a mass that caused irritation while wearing certain types of clothing.\n\n【14】Diagnosis of an EMPNST is generally done via a tissue biopsy. There are several reports in the literature of cases that successfully diagnosed EMPNST with fine needle aspiration. Whether it is better to arrive at a diagnosis through wide local excision or FNA is not clear. Many of these neoplasms will most likely be diagnosed through wide local excision. Treatment of EMPNST has generally been carried out by wide local excision. Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment for non-locally invasive or metastatic disease. Several papers have\n\n| Table 1： Results， description and common uses of initial immunochemical stains used.  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Stain  | Result  | Description  | Use  |  |\n| S100  | Positive  | Multigenic group of non ubiquitous cytoplasmic EF- hand Ca+-binding proteins.  | S100 is commonly used as a marker of neural tissue and melanomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.  |  |\n| SOX-10  | Positive  | Transcription factor known to be crucial in thespecification of the neural crest and maintenance ofSchwann cells and melanocytes  | Melanoma marker.

Tomohiro et al. presented a case of a 62 year old male without neurofibromatosis with advanced EMPNST showing complete response with combination of wide local excision and chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Their patient presented initially with a large fungating foot lesion. Ten weeks after initial excision the patient presented with lung nodules on computed tomography. The patient was treated with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy using doxorubicin (60 mg/m’) and ifosfamide (7.5 g/m). The patient received two doses as well as surgical resection of remaining lesions in lower lung fields. The lesions were confirmed metastatic EMPNST. Complete response was noted after the patient had completed four rounds of chemotherapy in combination with resection of the pulmonary lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This case highlights the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy for highly aggressive metastatic EMPNST. Since EMPNST is an aggressive lesion with metastasis commonly， chemotherapy should be a considered to provide complete response. Considering that MPNST is a rare tumor and EMPNST is only 5%of these tumors， there is little standardization of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The optimal excision margins have not been standardized as of yet. With our patient， the margins were 0.2 cm. Efficacy of radiation therapy and chemotherapy have yet to be determined as well. It seems that further research and standardization needs to be achieved for this rare condition.\n\n【17】In a review of 63 patients with EMPNST by Jo VY et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， half of the patients had a median follow-up of 36 months after primary resection. Thirteen of the patients received chemotherapy and/or radiation. Twenty-two patients had no evidence of disease at time of follow-up. Nine patients developed local recurrence. Five patients developed distant metastases and four patients died of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. This review emphasizes the aggressive behavior of this neoplasm. Distant metastasis is common and the treating team should be aware. Post-op surveillance should be mandatory. This brings up an important question which tries to identify what screening interval should be used. Also， considering distant metastasis is common， would these patients benefit from interval computed tomography or other imaging modality?\n\nIn an article by Kar M et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>， twenty-four cases of MPNST were reviewed. Ten cases had relapsed. Eight out of the ten cases showed relapse within the first two years of their treatment. Also， the overall survival and disease-free survivals were 58% and 38%， respectively， with median disease-free period of 17 months. EMPNST|删除段之间换行|and MPNST are closely related， and this paper points out that many cases of metastases occurred within two years. Considering the disease tends to metastasize to lungs and other distant organs， it would be pertinent to perform aggressive surveillance early on in both MPNST and EMPNST with computed tomography for screening of recurrence. Regular physical exams at intervals of 3， 6and 12 months of the surgical site as well as lymph node examination of draining sites would be prudent. History including symptoms of new onset shortness of breath or other respiratory symptoms should be performed. New onset abdominal pain would raise suspicions for abdominal metastases. History and physical examinations could be increased to 1-year intervals， and it should be stressed to the patient that loss of follow up could be detrimental. 5-year disease free survival of MPNST is 38% in certain studies and emphasizes the importance of follow-up and surveillance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. CT scan of the chest， abdomen and pelvis could also be completed at regular intervals. Whether this should be done at yearly intervals or more frequent is uncertain. In a study by Kim A et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> the importance of whole-body MRI as surveillance for high grade MPNST is emphasized. Another article by Reilly KM et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> emphasizes a similar concept of whole-body MRI for surveillance of MPNST recurrences. Would whole body MRI be a useful modality for surveillance in EMPNST as well? A review of the literature found very little information， if any， on the matter. Considering the close relationship between the two entities it could be of importance.\n\n【19】Considering the diagnosis and size of our patient’s tumor size and the malignant nature of these neoplasms， follow up would be highly recommended as emphasized above including history and physical exams at increasing intervals. The patient could also benefit from more frequent imaging at 6 months， 12 months， and yearly thereafter. This would be beneficial as most metastases seem to occur before 2years and the 5 year overall disease free survival is low in high risk patients.\n\nPrognosis of patients with these nerve sheath tumors is worse in certain circumstances including patient with concomitant neurofibromatosis， increased tumor size， positive excisional margins， site and increased depth of tumor location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In patients with tumor size >5 cm it seems that tumor recurrence and metastases is increased通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，7\\]</u>. There seems to be no difference in prognosis on the basis of male to female 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-10\\]</u>. Having said all this， biological behavior and prognosis of EMPNST is less clear than that of MPNST. Malignant|删除段之间换行|peripheral nerve sheath tumors are prone to locally recur， are highly malignant and commonly metastasize.\n\n【21】EMPNST will stain diffusely positive for S100 and will generally stain negative for INI-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. This is in contrast to the much more studied MPNST which will stain positive for CD99/013 (86%)，S100， and CD57.MPNST will also stain negative for EMA， Keratin and CD19 in most cases. Histologically， EMPNST will differ in appearance from MPNST. MPNST will show monomorphic serpentine cells， palisading， large gaping vascular spaces， and geographic necrosis with tumor palisading at edges which resembles a glioblastoma multiforme. These will also have glandular differentiation and melanin in the tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】MPNST and EPMNST differ in terms of their origin as well as their histologic and immunochemical staining properties. They are closely related， but the latter is a rarer presentation. EMPNST will stain diffusely positive for S-100 protein and will show loss of INI-1 expression. More research needs to be done on this neoplasm as there is no standardization of management and follow up long term. Generally， they can be treated with wide local excision. However， advanced cases should be treated with a combination of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. If the disease is large preoperatively， neoadjuvant chemo-radiation can be beneficial. Postoperatively， patients should undergo regular follow-up with history， physical exam and imaging studies. Imaging modalities such as computed tomography and whole-body MRI are possible modalities of benefit. Distant metastasis is of concern for EMPNST and tends to present within 2 years of initial treatment. Intervals should be regular and more frequent early on. Very little research has been done on the rare entity of EMPNST. Much standardization needs to be achieved in terms of treatment including minimal margins， indications for chemotherapy and radiation， dosing and timing. Further research and standardization for postoperative surveillance including exact modality and timing would improve the management of this rare condition.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

A cure or recovery from these symptoms is almost impossible to achieve. In this case， the positive results from treatment with Rosa Schmid essential joint oil is described. This is the second， recorded successful treatment against peripheral neuropathic pain in the feet in the Netherlands.\n\n【2】Keywords： Neuropathy； Feet； Rosa Schmid joint oil； Case study； Lyme infection\n\n【3】Introduction\n\nIn his article in the Dutch Journal for Phytotherapy， Gerben Hoogsteen 通用删除7(英):<u>(2017)</u> describes a phytotherapeutic treatment of neuropathic pain in a woman’s right foot 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In this case， Rosa Schmid's essential oil for joints was used. After three months of use， the pain decreased from 9to7on a VAS scale. It proved to be a sustainable form of pain relief. She could care for her feet better， walk more easily and， in addition to attaining an executive position， her social life became more active 1|.\n\n【5】I also suffered from peripheral neuropathy on both feet. I discussed my symptoms with Gerben Hoogsteen. He knew of no other studies into the benefits of this treatment and could not guarantee that the treatment would be suiccessful in my case.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】I was not aware that I had contracted a Lyme infection through a tick bite in Mexico in 2004. While viewing historical sites， I crouched under some bushes to see the sculptures better. A day later， I had two swollen red spots on my right upper arm. I had never heard of Lyme disease. The swelling increased and I squeezed blood out of them every couple of days. The spots became smaller， but remained visible. I ignored them and travelled back to the Netherlands after several weeks， via the US. I could see something black in the red spots. I squeezed much harder whereby they bled profusely and then the black dots were gone. Later one of the red spots also disappeared. Sometimes I squeezed it hard again and then it would bleed lightly for a few days. I stopped squeezing and forgot about it. One red spot remained visible for years. Newspaper articles led me to believe that it could be a case of Lyme disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Diagnosis\n\n【9】My feet gradually became numb， like I was walking on little cushions. They also hurt， walking became more difficult and it caused me to become more unstable on my feet. I regularly felt like I had a fever， the same feeling as when you have the flu. I often felt tired， like I was constantly walking uphill. My fingers also became less sensitive. To numb the pain and to fall asleep， I started drinking more and more white wine. Meanwhile， I had gathered from newspaper articles that there was little I could do to improve my condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Walking became increasingly painful. It became harder to drive a car because I couldn’t find the clutch with my left foot and I had difficulty pushing down hard enough to shift gears. For two years I stopped driving altogether， which limited my social life\n\n【10】Neurological Treatment Plan\n\nI was referred to a hospital in D， to a neurologist whom my family doctor knew and trusted. He recognized my symptoms， particularly the emotional mood swings. Blood tests revealed a Lyme infection. A lumbar puncture showed that the infection was also located there， in the spine， whereby|删除段之间换行|the infection could manifest itself more easily and more frequently. I could take an intensive and lengthy course of antibiotics lasting for months， travelling to the hospital every day， spending an hour there and back， in addition to waiting times in hospital. The neurologist retired and handed my case file over to his successor. Itried to get an out-patient procedure in a Rotterdam Hospital， in the city where I am living， but that proved impossible， and all the tests would have had to be repeated. I was busy and couldn’t free up a whole month. Wim Kohler in the NRC (31 March 2016) convinced me of the limited effectiveness of these courses of antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. I decided to forget about it， and that proved to be fortunate.\n\n【12】The Total Treatment Plan\n\n【13】When consulting my family doctor on a different matter， he saw that I had difficulty walking and asked what the treatment in D. had yielded. I told him that I hadn't followed his advice because I didn't believe in a treatment consisting of a long-term course of antibiotics. After considerable discussion， we were convinced that something had to be done， as my condition was deteriorating all the time. He could determine this by manually inspecting my feet. It was very painful and I couldn’t tell which toe he was touching while blindfolded.\n\n【14】I was referred to the Havenziekenhuis (Harbour Hospital) in Rotterdam. A pro-active female neurologist understood what the problem was. That reassured me. She repeated the blood tests and the lumbar puncture. This confirmed Lyme disease but did not show any infection in the spinal fluid. She tested and discussed with me all the other factors that could influence the neuropathic symptoms： my kidney function was not optimal， my B6 levels were extremely high， I had never had chemotherapy， there were no diabetic issues， and she urged me strenuously to stop drinking， which I did. Later， in a second consultation， it appeared that these factors were all under control. She told me that the symptoms in my feet may lessen at some point， but that they would never disappear completely.\n\n【15】I felt that my Lyme disease was taken seriously for the first time that I had to learn to live with it and that because it had been so long since the initial incident； hardly any treatment was possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. My symptoms did lessen a little， but the floating， instable feeling while walking remained. I explored the therapies in the Expertise Centrum Maastricht (The Netherlands)， the infectious illnesses clinic at Radboud-UMC Nijmegen (The Netherlands)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， and finally also the phytotherapy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Treatm ent with Rosa Schm id Essential Joint Oil\n\n【17】I read the article in the Dutch Magazine for Phytotherapy(NTvFT，2017) about the Rosa Schmid essential jointoil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. I had researched in my carrier Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) earlier in cancer cases. I am sceptical about the healing powers of CAM， certainly with cancer， but I do believe in that CAM can relieve some symptoms， as is also shown through studies. I decided not to rule out the possibility that the essential oil might be able to help me. The oil is prepared from a great many plants and has been used successfully in treating arthrosis (articular degeneration) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\nI decided to set up a sort of experimental study with myself. Because my left foot bothered me the most， I decided to first treat only myleft foot with the essential oil. I did that at night before I went to sleep (wearing a sock in bed) and in the morning too (with a sock as well， obviously). I treated my right foot with Cetaphil， a moisturizing|删除段之间换行|cream (including the socks).\n\n【19】I continued with this therapy for about one year. I felt that there was improvement； my left foot became warmer and more sensitive； it felt less like I was walking on a ‘cushion'with that foot. It became easier to use the clutch while driving. My family doctor tested my feet once again. I had less pain when he touched my feet and I could localize where he pricked my toes. Thus， I personally observed and experienced these improvements. After a year， I started treating both my feet with the Rosa Schmid essential joint oil and I continue to do so every evening.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】Firstly， numb， painful feet seem to be a result of Lyme disease. After a long period of time has passed， very little can be done to correct this 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However， untreated Lyme infection is not the only cause of neuropathic symptoms and complaints.Other causes include an elevated vitamin B6 level， insufficient function of the kidneys， and copious amounts of alcohol， in addition to illness-related factors， such as diabetes and chemotherapy treatments for cancer. Careful neurological testing can trace these factors. Only one of these is Lyme disease. The implications of this insight have not yet been studied sufficiently and thus cannot yet be treated effectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3，5\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Secondly， using the essential joint oil by Rosa Schmid can help in treating peripheral neuropathic pain in the feet. A separate treatment ofthe two feet yielded systematic insights into the effect ofarticulation oil. It is a subsequent study of the case study described by Gerben Hoogsteen， in which I have confirmed his results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. More research is needed into the effect of the oil， also in podiatric pain symptoms as a result of Lyme disease.\n\n【23】In the third place it is of course the question whether the decline in symptoms in the feet and the increased quality of life can solely be attributed to the joint oil. I continue to use the oil in the evening during the day， this has been replaced with a foot cream. The pain and insensibility have decreased drastically； walking is much easier， as is climbing stairs， which is confirmed by others. I can bike again with ease and take long car rides， although I now drive an automatic， which fit better to my still a bit insensitive foot. My subjective quality of life rose from a 6 to an删除4:<u> 8</u>. Undoubtedly， a placebo effect was also present because I was aware of the positive results of the description of the treatment by Gerben Hoogsteen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. At this point， it is still an N=2 study. Perhaps more studies into the benefits of the use of this essential joint oil can be found.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】The history of this treatment of neuropathy due to Lyme disease at the feet shows that the joint oil by Rosa Schmid may decrease the complaints and improve the quality of walking， and by that the quality of life. However， so far it is only a N=2 study. It needs more studies in a strict controlled experimental setting. Although the actual results are promising. It may be concluded too that this experimental treatment is also applicable for neuropathic feet complains caused by diabetes and chemotherapeutical treatment of cancer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Methotrexate-associated Lymphoproliferative Disorder (MTX-LPD) has been reported. Here we report two cases of MTX-LPD in patients with RA treated with MTX and Kampo medicines. Case 1 was a 70-year-old woman who developed MTX-LPD on MTX 8 mg， tacrolimus， and daibofuto. Case 2 was a 50-year-old woman who had had RA for 9 years and been treated with MTX 8 mg per week for 6 years； she developed MTX-LPD while also taking abatacept，bakumondoto， and unkeito. In case 1，MTX-LPD only resolved after discontinuation ofMTX；her RA was subsequently controlled by Minocycline and daibofuto. In case 2，MTX-LPD resolved after treatment with rituximab；her RA was then controlled with prednisolone 3 mg， iguratimod 50 mg， and Negative Nepi or Rio. Some Kampo medicines may have immunoregulatory activity and affect the serum MTX level. These medicines should be used cautiously in patients with RA if they are being treated with MTX.\n\n【2】Keywords： Rheumatoid arthritis； Kampo medicines； Methotrexate； Glycyrrhizae radix； Methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorder\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Kampo (traditional Japanese) medicines were first introduced from China via the Korean Peninsula 1500 years ago and since then have developed in a way unique to Japan. Kampo medicines are integrated into the Japanese national healthcare system. One hundred and forty-eight formulations containing Kampo extracts and 187 crude Kampo formulations are approved by the Ministry of Health， Labor， and Welfare and used under the national health insurance program 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>\n\n【5】Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes joint pain and damage throughout the body. RA was described as early as 1500 BC in the Ebers Papyrus and has been treated with Kampo medicines for hundreds of years. Kogure et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> reported that a Kampo decoction known preparations of carnitine (Gui Zhi Er Yue Bi Yit Tang Jia Zhu Fu Tang； KNEIJB) in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is safe and well tolerated and has clinical and economic benefits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A systematic review by Daily et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> highlighted the usefulness of guizhi-shaoyao-zhimu， which is used as Ignorant tenant for RA in Japan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【6】The guidelines describe MTX as Avery effective treatment for RA. However， it has serious adverse effects， including liver disease， interstitial pneumonia， and myelosuppression. Lymphoma was first reported in a patient treated with MTX for RA in 1991 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Lymphoma in such patients is now known as MTX-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (MTX-LPD). Here we report two cases of MTX-LPD in patients with RA who were treated with Kampo medicines in combination with MTX.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Case 1\n\nShe was a 70-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with RA 16 years earlier. She had been taking MTX 8 mg/week for 6 years， a Kampo decoction known as daibofuto (Da Fang Feng Tang； DBFT) for 2 years， and tacrolimus 1 mg/day for 6 months. Although her RA activity was stable，|删除段之间换行|lymph nades in the neck (white arrow). However， there is na evidence of a tumor in the pharynx.\n\nshe developed a low-grade fever. A month later， she complained of a sore throat， which led to detection of a pharyngeal ulcer. MTX was discontinued and garenoxacin was started. One week later， her sore throat had improvedbut the ulcer had not healed completely. A biopsy of her pharyngeal mucosa revealed an infiltration of lymphoid cells， mainly of the large type， with necrosis beneath normal epithelium. The atypicallymphoid cells were positive for CD20， had a high Ki-67(MIB-1) labeling index， and were positive on EBER in situ hybridization  but were negative for CD3， CD5， and CD10. Her blood test results were as follows： white blood cell count，4，100/pL； hemoglobin， 11.4 mg/dL； platelet count 14.4 × 10\\/pL； serum lactate dehydrogenase， 234 IU/L (normal， 110-210)； aspartate transaminase 22 IU/L (normal， 12-31)； alanine transaminase 25IU/L (normal， 8-40)； serum creatinine 0.64 mg/dL (normal， 0.40-0.80)； C-reactive protein 4.03 mg/dL (normal <0.14)； ferritin 331ng/mL (normal， 12-60)； and solubleinterleukin-2 receptor 2305 U/mL (normal， 122-469). Test results for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens， hepatitis B virus antigen， and hepatitis C virus antibody as well as an interferon-gamma releasing assay for tuberculosis were all negative. Serum antigen tests and an enzyme immunoassay revealed previous Epstein-Barr virus infection (anti-viral-capsid antigen IgG antibody 160 times； anti-viral-capsid antigen IgM <10 times； anti-Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen IgG 40 times； anti-early antigen IgG <10 times). Computed tomography revealed multiple swollen|删除段之间换行|lymph nodes in the patient’s neck . She was diagnosed to have MTX-LPD. Within a few weeks of discontinuing MTX， DBFT， and tacrolimus， her fever resolved， her pharyngeal ulcer healed， her serum C-reactive protein level normalized， and her serum lactate dehydrogenase and soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels returned to their baseline values. In the 3 months following resolution of her pharyngeal ulcer， she was treated with minocycline 100 mg and DBFT. A complete remission of MTX-LPD was achieved. The patient has remained recurrence-free for 1 year， and her RA clinical disease activity has remained in remission.\n\n【11】Case 2\n\n【12】She was a 50-year-old woman who had had RA for 9 years. She was taking various Kampo medicines and had taken MTX 8 mg/week for 6 years. She had also taken abatacept (a fusion protein composed of the Fc region of IgG1 fused to the extracellular domain of CTLA-4) at a dose of 125 mg/week for 1.5 years after 2 years of treatment with etanercept (her treatment was switched because of loss of efficacy) in combination with two Kampo formulations， i.e. bakumondoto(Mai Men Dong Tang， BAK) extract 7.5 g and unkeito (Wen Jing Tang； UKT) extract 7.5 g (both from Tsumura Co.， Tokyo， Japan). Although her RA activity was stable， she developed left-sided cervical lymphadenopathy. Therefore， MTX， abatacept， BAK， and UKT were discontinued. After 2 weeks， there was improvement but not complete resolution of her lymphadenopathy. A lymph node biopsy revealed tumor cells with large， irregular， clear nuclei and multiple nucleoli . The atypical lymphoid cells were positive for CD20 and had a high Ki-67 (MIB-1) labeling index  but were negative for CD3， CD5， cyclin D1， MUM-1， and EBER in situ hybridization . Fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed uptake in the pharynx， right axillary lymph nodes， and the right elbow . We attributed the uptake in the right elbow to arthritis that predated the onset of lymphadenopathy. Her blood test results were as follows： white blood cell count， 4，990/uL； hemoglobin， 13.1 mg/dL； platelet count， 28.1×10/uL； serum lactate dehydrogenase 174 IU/L(normal， 115-245)； aspartate transaminase 19 IU/L (normal 12-31)； alanine transaminase 10 IU/L (normal，8-40)； serum creatinine 0.54mg/dL (normal 0.40-0.80)； C-reactive protein 0.33 mg/dL (normal\n\n【13】<0.14)； ferritin 97 ng/mL (normal 3.6-114)； and soluble interleukin-2receptor 241 U/mL (normal 145-519). Tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antigens， hepatitis B virus antigen， and hepatitis C virus antibody were negative， as was an interferon-gamma releasing assay for tuberculosis. Serum antigen tests with an enzyme immunoassay for Epstein-Barr virus showed previous infection (anti-viral-capsid antigen IgG antibody， 80 times； anti-viral-capsid antigen IgM <10times； anti-Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen IgG 40 times； and anti-early antigen IgG<10 times). She was diagnosed with MTX-LPD. Her right-sided axillary lymph node swelling did not improve in the 8 weeks following cessation of the MTX， abatacept， and Kampo medicines. Therefore， we started rituximab as monotherapy (an injection of 375mg/m²at weekly intervals for 8 weeks). After 8 cycles of treatment， the patient achieved a complete remission and has remained recurrence-free for 1year . Her RA clinical disease activity has remained low while on prednisolone 3 mg， iguratimod 50 mg and the KNEIJB decoction.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】To the best of our knowledge， these are the first reports of MTX-LPD in patients with RA who have been taking Kampo medicines. Kampo medicines have long been used in the treatment of arthritis and in Japan may be used in combination with other agents for various reasons in the treatment of RA. For example， KNEIJB can be used in combination with MTX to increase the therapeutic effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【16】In case 1，DBFT was administered to alleviate joint pain. DBFT is a herbal medicine that contains 15 compounds (i.e. Astragali Radix 6 g， Paeoniae Radix 3 g， Rehmanniae Radix 3 g， Angelicae Radix 3g， Atractylodis Rhizoma 3 g， Glehniae Radix cum Rhizoma 3.0 g Saposhnikoviae Radix 3g， Eucommiae Cortex 3 g， Cnidii Rhizoma 2g， Glycyrrhizae Radix 1.5 g， Notopterygii Rhizoma 1.5 g， Achyranthis Radix 1.5 g， Zizyphi Fructus 1.5 g， Ginseng Radix 1.5 g， Zingiberis Peocessum Rhizoma 1.0 g， and Processi AconitiRadix14g) and is used to treat RA.

However， it is also known that some herbal medicines affect the blood levels of certain drugs， and it is possible that Glycyrrhizae Radix increased the serum MTX level in the two patients described in this report. Although we were not able to monitor the serum MTX level in either of our two patients， Lin et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> reported that Glycyrrhizin and licorice (the root of Glycyrrhizae uralensis) significantly increased the area under the blood concentration-time curve and mean residence time in rats. Therefore， it is possible that concomitant administration of MTX and Kampo herbal medicines containing Glycyrrhizae Radix resulted in an increase in the area under the blood concentration-time curve and mean residence time for MTX in our two patients.\n\n【19】Meta-analyses of epidemiologic studies in RA have identified clinically and statistically significant associations between RA and certain types of malignancy， particularly lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. MTX has been used in the treatment of RA since the 1990s； since then， there have been an increasing number of reports of MTX-LPD. In 1997， Georgescu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> reviewed 25 cases of lymphoma in patients with RA who were treated with MTX and described the following four important features： a predominance of large or polymorphous B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (90%)， a high rate of extranodal involvement (69%)， a high frequency of Epstein-Barr virus infection(41%)， and the possibility of remission only after withdrawal of MTX. Several case series and literature reviews have confirmed their findings. Our first case had all four of the above-mentioned features and the second had polymorphous B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Hashimoto et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> reported that older age and use of MTX and tacrolimus were associated with lymphoma in the NinJa cohort and we believe that Kampo medicines may have immunomodulatory activity that can increase the risk of MTX-LPD in the same way as tacrolimus. Furthermore， the Glycyrrhizae Radix contained in Kampo medicines may increase the serum MTX level， which is also thought to increase the risk of MTX-LPD. MTX-LPD did not recur in either of our patients even when Kampo medicines were restarted after remission. We think it unlikely that Kampo medicines alone cause LPD；however，MTX-LPD may develop when MTXand Kampo medicines are taken at the same time.\n\n【20】We are aware of only these two cases of MTX-LPD so far， and it is not certain if the risk of MTX-LPD is increased when MTX and Kampo medicines are used in combination. However， awareness of MTX-LPD is essential when Kampo medicines are used with MTX. Although research on MTX-LPD is ongoing， there is still no research on the risk of MTX-LTD when MTX is administered concomitantly withLTtraditional Chinese medicines， Kampo medicines， 1Glycyrrhizae Radix. We believe that concomitant use of agents such as Glycyrrhizae Radix may affect the serum MTX level and that this possibility should be investigated in the future.\n\n【21】In conclusion， we have encountered two cases of MTX-LPD in patients with RA treated with a combination of MTX and Kampo medicines. We consider that Kampo medicines should be used with caution in patients with RA who are being treated with MTX because they may have immunoregulatory activity and affect the MTX level.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Currently， approximately 5%-10% of US women use IUDs as their preferred method of contraception. They have been associated with pelvic inflammatory disease when inserted at the time of acute cervicitis. Women with IUDs have been shown to have an increased risk of asymptomatic genitourinary bacterial colonization. In this particular case， a woman with a levonorgestrel IUD presents with nonspecific complaints of abdominal pain and ultimately meets criteria for sepsis. Another source could not be identified and her IUD is removed. The IUD is sent for culture and results are notable for E. coli. An endometrial biopsy notes acute and chronic endometritis as well as E. coli. This case highlights a unique source of sepsis in women with IUDs.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Sepsis is a life-threatening clinical state that can originate from a variety of sources of infection. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) have been associated with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) when inserted in a setting of acute cervicitis， but rarely have IUDs been associated with sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In cases of sepsis without an identified origin， ifthe patient has an IUD， the providers should consider the IUD as a possible source. Providers may be hesitant to consider the IUD as a source when the patient has had the IUD for a number of vears， but in this case the patient had the IUD for four years prior to presenting with signs and symptoms of sepsis. The following case is a report of a previously healthy 47-year-old woman presenting with non-specific symptoms and ultimately developing endometritis and sepsis with her levonorgestrel-IUD being identified as the source.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】Patient is a 47-year-old G5P2032 who presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of rightlower quadrant and back pain， chills， and emesis. Past medical history was non-contributory. She had a Mirena IUD in place for four years and had not been sexually active in three years. She had no history of sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【6】Upon arrival， she was febrile， tachycardic， tachypneic， and intermittently hypotensive with an elevated lactate and bandemia， meeting criteria for SIRS.\n\n【7】An abdominal exam by the ER physician noted tenderness in the RLQ but was otherwise unremarkable. She received fluid resuscitation and acetaminophen for fever relief. Blood cultures were collected and a urinalysis did not reveal for concern for infection. Given concern for appendicitis，an abdominal CT was obtained. The abdominal CT was unremarkable and showed that the IUD was positioned correctly in the uterus. Given that her symptoms were most consistent with gastroenteritis and she was able to tolerate oral intake， the patient was discharged home from the emergency department (ED). The next day the blood cultures were found to be positive for gram-negative bacilli and the patient was called to return to the ED. She was admitted to the internal medicine service and started on IV piperacillin-tazobactam.\n\nA source of infection could not be readily identified and considerations included a diverticular disease， urinary tract infection， pelvic inflammatory disease，tubo-ovarian abscess， or endometritis. Her urine culture was negative， tubo-ovarian abscesses were not evident on her pelvic ultrasound， and CT scan she had obtained in the ED did not reveal diverticular disease. Given that no other source could be identified， the Gynecology service was consulted. The gynecology attending preformed a pelvic exam， which demonstrated no cervical motion tenderness， adnexal tenderness， or uterine tenderness. Based on the rare possibility that the IUD was the source of sepsis and it was removed and sent for culture. An endometrial biopsy (EMB) was obtained and sent for|删除段之间换行|culture. Gonorrhea and chlamydia cultures were collected and found to be negative. The IUD， EMB， and blood cultures grew AmpC-beta lactamase producing E. coli. Antibiotics were narrowed to IV ceftriaxone. The patient improved clinically and was transitioned to oral cefdinir and discharged home. On follow-up， she was afebrile and had no complaints. She did not desire any contraception.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Genitourinary infections and sepsis due to modern IUDs are rare. IUDs commonly used today contain either copper (Cu-IUD) or levonorgestrel (LNG-IUD). The Dalkon Shield， famous in the1980s for its increased spontaneous abortion rate and incidence of PID with rare fatal sepsis， was the last of its kind to produce such an obvious increased risk of infections. Current studies of IUDs and PID specifically show a transient increase in the risk of PID with the risk of PID 6-fold higher in the first month after IUD insertion than it is thereafter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. For women at low risk for STIs like the patient presented here， the risk of PID is comparable for IUD users and nonusers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Asymptomatic Actinomyces has been associated with use ofIUDs. An estimated 7% of women with IUDs in situ have pap smears positive for Actinomyces 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This patient never had Actinomyces reported on a pap smear. Longer duration of IUD use has been correlated with the presence of Actinomyces and this population presenting with symptomatic pelvic masses should produce a higher suspicion of an Actinomyces infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>.\n\n【12】There are other causative agents of sepsis，toxic shock syndrome， hepatic abscesses， and recurrent urinary tract infections associated with IUDs. These include S. pyogenes，N.meningitidis type Y， S. milleri and extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-11\\]</u>. When compared with nonusers， IUD users are found to have increased incidence of asymptomatic genitourinary colonization with pathogens including ESBL E. coli， Klebsiella， and U. urealyticum删除4-1:<u>12，13</u>.\n\nAs a solid structure， IUDs could provide a surface for bacterial and yeast attachment.

This case highlights the need to keep in mind the rare pathogenic potential of IUDs.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\nProviders should consider IUDs as rare sources of sepsis in patients presenting with an IUD in situ.

It is highly aggressive with poor prognosis. Its optimal treatment remains unknown， with little survival benefits on locally advanced or metastatic diseases. We report a case of metastatic primary squamous cell carcinoma in an 83-years-old man with a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy. The diagnosis was confirmed radiologically and histologically. After a treatment of Carboplatin-paclitaxel， a significant tumoral respond was seen at three months follow-up.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Prostate gland carcinoma is the most common cancer of the male population， 95% of which being ofadenocarcinoma histological type. Squamous cell carcinoma of the prostate is a rare entity， representing 0.5% to 1% of all prostate neoplasia. Even though prostatic adenocarcinoma and PSCC clinical manifestations are similar with lower urinary tract symptoms， they differ in their histological and biological aspect， treatment， and hormonal sensitivity. It is known for being of high malignancy with locally advanced or metastatic disease，and poor prognosis. While the vast majority of prostatic carcinoma are of glandular histological features， with defined treatment guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， less than100 cases of PSCC have been reported in literature and optimal management is unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Treatments are ranging from radical surgery to chemotherapy， radiotherapy， or chemo-radiation mostly with little survival benefits on locally advanced or metastatic diseases.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\nIn July 2020， an 83-year-old patient with a history of mainly cardiovascular diseases was referred to our hospital for an acute urinal retention caused by a presumed benign prostatic hypertrophy. The digital rectal examination was normal at the time， with an estimated 200 ml soft and even prostate gland. PSA level was 12.04 ng/ml， correlated to the gland volume. The patient was followed up in urology with several urinal catheter ablation failures and urinary tract infections. A digital prostatic examination was performed again in October 2020，disclosing an uneven swollen gland of stone-hard consistency， with multiples suspicious nodules. PSA level was then 14.62 ng/ml. Prostate MRI revealed an important prostatic hypertrophy (340 ml)， with a postero-superior voluminous and irregular mass of the peripheral zone (70 mm) invading the bladder’s postero-inferior wall， both seminal vesicles and likely the mid-rectum's anterior wall， with multiples iliac and retro-peritoneal enlarged lymph nodes. A Thorax， Abdominal and Pelvis scanner (CT-TAP scan) confirmed the irregular prostate tumor， infiltrating the bladder wall， peri-prostatic and peri-bladder soft tissues， as well as multiples precaval， lateral caval and retroperitoneal enlarged lymph nodes， with a dilated left UVJ likely due to distal obstruction by the advanced prostate tumor. FDG-PET/CT scan confirmed the prostate malignancy(SUV：21.6) and the lymph nodes involvement， with no other evidence of metastatic disease. No bone or cerebral metastases were found on bone scintigraphy and cerebral MRI. The tumor was classified T4N1Mla. Transrectal prostate biopsies were performed. The biopsies revealed a mildly to poorly differentiated non-small cell eosinophil carcinoma with squamous differentiation with no glandular nor neuroendocrine expression on the histology and immunohistochemical analysis. The tumor staining was positive for epidermoid markers 通用删除11(英):<u>(p63， CK5/6)</u> and for urothelial markers (CK7 mainly and CK20 focally，GATA3). Prostatic markers were negative (PSA， EGR，NKX3.1)， as well as keratin expression. The tumor was therefore classified as an invasive squamous cell prostate carcinoma， even though the primitive or secondary prostatic origins could not be clearly determined. However， the blood measurements of NSE， chromogranin A and SCC were within normal range， whereas CYFRA 21-1 was elevated at 53.0 ng/ml. The patient was reviewed at our institution's multidisciplinary tumor board with recommendation of exclusive chemotherapy， considering the number of lymph node metastasis and the patient's comorbidities. The chemotherapy consisted of three cycles of Carboplatin-Paclitaxel every 21 days (Carboplatin AUC 2 and Paclitaxel 80.00 mg/m’ on day 1， 8 and 15). The treatment was well tolerated except|删除段之间换行|for a grade 3 sensitive neuropathy of both hands and feet (CTCAE v5)， motivating the termination of the paclitaxel at day 15 of cycle删除4:<u> 2</u>. At the three months follow up in March 2021， the CT scan showed a significant respond with reduction of the prostate tumor volume(20 mm vs. 70 mm) ， the loss of contact with the rectum’s wall and the disappearance of all metastatic lymph nodes . No new metastasis had appeared. Considering the great treatment outcome at 3-month， chemotherapy was continued with 6 cycles of carboplatin every 21 days (AUC 5 on day 1).\n\n【6】Discussion\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma of the prostate is a rare malignancy， accounting for less than 1% of all prostate tumors. Whereas the adenocarcinoma derivates from the glandular cells of the prostatic acini， PSCC originsare more controversial. Non-neoplastic squamous metaplasia is frequently seen associated with chronic inflammation such as chronic prostatitis or infarction， even though malignancy transformation remains rare. Some have postulated that its loss of PSA secretion and production of keratin reduces its likelihood of androgen blockade response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Secondary squamous metaplasia of common adenocarcinoma has been reported， mainly several years post radiation treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u> or hormonotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Two main hypotheses arise concerning the primary PSCC origin：The basal or reserve cells of prostatic acini 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， or the transitional epithelium lining the urethra， and the major ducts Kahler and Thompson et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It has also been supposed that it could derive from pluripotent stem cells. Mott proposed strict histological criteria for the diagnosis of primitive pure squamous cell carcinoma in 1979：1) clearly malignant features including disorganized growth pattern， cellular anaplasia， invasion； 2) features of squamous differentiation including keratinization， presence of squamous pearls or distinct|删除段之间换行|intercellular bridges； 3) lack of glandular/acinar component； 4) no prior estrogen therapy； 5) the absence of primary squamous cancer elsewhere 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. These criteria could be improved with the use of immunohistochemistry even if no specific markers exist today. Squamous cell differentiation loses reactivity to prostatic specific antibodies such as PSA， PSAP，PSMA，P510S，AMACR通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. SCC blood measurements can also be performed.Our case is a PSCC de novo with multiple metastaticlymph nodes， with no urologic history of prostatic adenocarcinoma， urothelial carcinoma nor hormonal or radiation treatment. The PSA level was elevated but correlated to the benign prostate hyperplasia component. The histological analysis showed no glandular or neuroendocrine component. However， it didn’t show any morphological squamous differentiation， such as keratinization， due to its poorly differentiated nature. From immunohistochemistry， the tumor was marked negative for prostate differentiation (PSA， NKX3.1) and positive for squamous differentiation 通用删除11(英):<u>(p63， CK5/6)</u> and for urothelial markers (CK7/CK20，GATA3). These results combined with an elevated CYFRA 21.1 blood measurement might indicate a possible urethra origin. Huang et al. have highlighted the interest of blood and urine cytokeratin 19 (CYFRA 21.1) measurement in bladder carcinoma in a recent meta-analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.

Several reports have shown a possible long-term disease-free survival with low dose radiation combined with chemotherapy on local to locally advanced diseases， with a cisplatin and 5 fluorouracil combination and 5-year survival for Munoz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， and 21 months survival free for radiation|删除段之间换行|with IV bleomycin an intra arterial cisplatin for Uchibayashi et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> other promising results were found in 2017 by Onoda et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> with great tumoral response to DCF chemotherapy (5 FU， Docetaxel， and cisplatin) with radiotherapy. Few efficient treatments have been reported for PSCC with multiple metastatic lymph nodes， where radiation therapy cannot be performed. To our knowledge the use of combined Paclitaxel and Carboplatin for PSCC with these good response rates has not been previously reported. Carboplatin had been chosen over cisplatin due to our patient's acute obstructive kidney failure and other comorbidities. Our case suggests that this chemotherapy combination may be an effective treatment for the SCC of the prostate. Further investigations on taxane and platine in this indication should be undertaken. If our patient maintains his nodular and tumoral response at the follow up evaluation after the carboplatin chemotherapy， a closure treatment with radiotherapy of the prostate will be discussed， following Onoda et al findings.

Very little has been published in regards to the proper management of this cancer. Here， we present a case of this highly aggressive tumor with a rather benign presentation， as well as an approach to treatment.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 50 year old male of Asian descent with an unremarkable past medical history presented to our outpatient community clinic with complaint of a raised scalp lesion of 8 months duration. The patient reported that the lesion progressively enlarged for the first 4 months but then stabilized in size thereafter. The lesion was asymptomatic with no associated bleeding， ulceration， discharge， or pruritis. He did not recall trauma or an inciting event. Initial examination revealed a round 1.5 cm diameter， well circumcised， immobile， soft mass on the right temporo-parietal scalp. The lesion was minimally tender to deep palpation. There were no overlying skin changes or discharge. No regional lymphadenopathy was noted. A presumptive diagnosis of sebaceous or pilar cyst was established and general surgery was consulted. After obtaining informed consent， the mass was excised in the outpatient setting under local anesthesia. It was noted that the mass was quite adherent to the surrounding tissues which necessitated removal in a piecemeal fashion.\n\n【6】Histopathologicexamination demonstrated a poorly-differentiated carcinoma exten ding beyond the resected margins. The tumor was characterized by nests of epithelial cells with variable cytoplasm ranging from clear to eosinophilic with squamous differentiation. Associated with the tumor was a dense hyalinized stroma， as well as round spaces suggestive of duct lumens. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for cytokeratin 5/6， cytokeratin 7， p63， carcinoembryonic antigen， and epithelial membrane antigen.\n\n【7】These findings were consistent with malignant cutaneous adnexal carcinoma， most likely hidradenocarcinoma. The case was reviewed at a multidisciplinary tumor board. The diagnosis and treatment options were discussed with the patient， and informed consent was obtained for planned re-excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy.\n\n【8】Lymphoscintigraphy was used intraoperatively to identify sentinel lymph nodes along the right neck. The area was further explored using a handheld Geiger counter and 3 small blue sentinel lymph nodes along the posterior border of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle were resected and sent for pathology. Wide local excision around the previous incision was performed with 2\n\n【9】cm margins down to the bregma of the scalp. Total diameter of the excision measured 5.5 cm. A full thickness skin graft with an area of16 cm’ was harvested from tissue just inferior to the right clavicle and secured to the scalp. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications. Histopathologic exam of the tissue margins demonstrated no evidence of tumor and sentinel lymph nodes that were negative for metastasis. Post-operative full body computed tomography revealed no evidence of visceral organ involvement.\n\n【10】The patient has been followed postoperatively on a monthly basis to evaluate graft healing and to assess for signs of tumor recurrence. At 6 months postoperatively， the graft is continuing to heal without complication and there is no suspicion for tumor recurrence.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Hidradenocarcinoma is a rare malignant cutaneous adnexal tumor associated with a high propensity for local recurrence and subclinical metastasis， thus necessitating timely identification and treatment. Hidradenocarcinoma poses a diagnostic challenge given the lack of distinguishing characteristics and indolent nature of presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Previous reports suggest that trauma and/or instrumentation of the lesion may precipitate localized growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Therefore if the lesion is initially biopsied or excised for diagnostic purposes， definitive treatment should be pursued expeditiously to reduce the possibility of recurrence or metastasis. In the present case， the 1.5 cm diameter tumor was initially mistaken for a sebaceous cyst and subsequently excised as such. Fortunately， there was no evidence of recurrence or growth of the lesion when the patient presented for repeat excision 1 month later.\n\nThere is no consensus on hidradenocarcinoma management； however surgery in the form of wide local excision is the most widely reported. More recently Mohs micrographic surgery-with or without|删除段之间换行|wide local excision-has also been utilized， particularly with cases involving the scalp 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. If wide local excision is performed， at least3 cm margins should be obtained 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In our case， tumor location and patient anatomy dictated the use of 2 cm margins.

Tetanus is characterized by muscle spasm of masticatory muscles first. With the progress of the disease， mild stimulation can trigger generalized tonic epileptic activity， which can lead to fatal clinical manifestations， such as autonomic instability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. Tetanus is still an endemic epidemic in developing countries， and its incidence rate often rises after natural disasters such as earthquake and tsunami 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Most physicians in developed countries lack experience in treating such cases. The treatment of tetanus is not standardized either. By consulting journals and scientific literature， we found that there are few literatures related to the diagnosis or treatment of autonomic instability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. Therefore， this case report is of great significance for treating doctors in Emergency Department or Intensive Care Units to learn features of tetanus for early recognition and treatment.\n\nA 50-year-old male building worker presented in our hospital with recent onset of difficulty in opening mouth. The man's right arm was injured at work 10 days before. The local hospital surgeons had already given him surgical debridement and tetanus antitoxin immunotherapy. A 10cm longitudinal incision was seen on the palmar side of his right forearm. The wound seemedhealed well apparently and the stitches had been removed. He represented to our hospital and complained about the difficulty of opening his mouth. He had not received any tetanus vaccinations before. After admission， he was diagnosed tetanus and transferred to a Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) single ward immediately to reduce sound and light stimulation. To neutralize the toxin， 1000 U of|删除段之间换行|human anti-tetanus immunoglobulin was administrated， along with the tetanus toxoid injection. For muscle spasm， diazepam infusion of 1 mg/kg/day was given. Penicillin and metronidazole were given as antibiotic coverage. He developed respiratory failure the following day， these verity of his illness required mechanical ventilation and subsequent tracheostomy. Further surgical debridement was performed the third day after admission and 1000 IU of tetanus immunoglobulin was injected intramuscularly around the wound. It was confirmed that the first debridement was not complete， and residual building cement sands were found in the wound . Clostridium tetanus was identified in wound secretions by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis of etiology . The wound was kept open and then washed with hydrogen peroxide every day for almost 10 days. The wound was sutured 18 dayslater. One week after admission， the man developed autonomic instability symptoms， characterized by high fever， sweating， extreme fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure. Large doses of neuro-blockers， analgesics and sedatives were administrated. His antibiotic regimen altered to intravenous metronidazole and ceftriaxone soon. His gastrointestinal function was weakened and his stomach was seriously reserved. He changed to pyloric feeding later to strengthen nutritional support. We assessed the severity of his tetanus using the Ablett classification通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>； all symptoms were in the very severe category. Recognition of the tetanus pathophysiology， comprehensive treatment in ICU and choice of sedative medications， including dexmedetomidine for 14days with its anti-sympathetic effect， led to successful discharge. The patient was discharged after 28 days in SICU and 15 days more in respiratory ward. Except for a little stiffness in the joints， the man had clear mind， fluent speech and free movement of joints at the time of discharge. After discharge， the family members complained that the man had an involuntary shaking ofleft leg when sleeping at night and then head MRI showed multiple ischemic lesions in his right frontal lobe and bilateral parietal lobes. Within 3 months after discharge，this kind ofleft leg involuntary shaking had always existed.\n\n【3】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【4】In recent years， no relevant literature has reported the incidence of tetanus in China， but it often happens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Diagnosis of tetanus is mainly based on clinical signs and symptoms. The rarity of tetanus and the difficulty of cultivation of Clostridium tetani， which lead to early clinical diagnosis mainly relying on the experience of doctors通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However， it is important to realize that tetanus can occur despite\n\n【5】删除5:<u>6-</u>\n\n【6】删除5:<u>0-</u>\n\n【7】删除5:<u>300</u>\n\nprevious immunization and protective anti-tetanus antibody levels. Recently， NGS has shown an advantage in etiological diagnosis. The NGS technology allows for the detection and identification of(difficult-to culture) microorganisms using a culture-independent strategy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>，especially in the diagnosis of unexplained encephalitis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. We report a case of tetanus confirmed by NGS sequencing. suggesting that there are still many possibilities in the etiological diagnosis of tetanus. After consulting the literature， we used NGS method to diagnose tetanus for the first time. Autonomic instability is one of the most challenging factors in the treatment of severe tetanus and a circulatory disturbance is one of the common causes of death in severe tetanus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This period is extremely labile and is characterized by malignant hypertension and tachycardia， followed by profound hypotension and bradycardia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，11\\]</u>. The optimal treatment for autonomic instability is still unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，12\\]</u>. Sedatives used range from benzodiazepines such as midazolam and diazepam to anesthetics such as propofol and ketamine. Magnesium sulfate， intrathecal baclofen， morphine， bupivacaine， fentanyl and labetalol can also reduce autonomic instability. However， the evidence is limited to case reports and a few case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. To date， there have been no large-scale studies aimed at identifying specific preferences for the treatment of tetanus related autonomic symptoms. Dexmedetomidine is a more selective a2-adrenoreceptor agonist than clonidine. It has combined analgesic and anti-sympathetic effect， make it sensible to consider in this setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Here we present a case of generalized tetanus complicated by autonomic crises managed with dexmedetomidine infusion about for 14 days. The administration of dexmedetomidine reduced the use of sedative drugs to control muscle spasms and cardiovascular instability. There is no upper limit in dose or frequency of sedative agents. This case illustrates that very high doses of all sedatives were required for almost 3 weeks. We still don't know whether the limb shaking in sleep， the denaturation in the head MRI and tetanus toxin were related. Finally， we should not detract from the importance of general ICU management in treating severe tetanus. Appropriate wound care and debridement， antibiotics and the administration of antitoxin are all essential 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，14\\]</u>. Also， as tetanus infection does not lead to development of protective antibodies，|删除段之间换行|immunization with tetanus toxoid is mandatory， as it will reduce the chances of developing tetanus from subsequent wounds 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In summary， this case suggested that early diagnosis and reasonable intervention of severe tetanus could reduce mortality. This case also shows that the comprehensive treatment in ICU is very important for the treatment of severe tetanus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is proven that good self-management levels and healthcare conditions can actively improve the blood glucose control of elderly patients with diabetes.

In China， HbAlc ≤ 7.0% is used as the blood glucose control standard for elderly diabetic patients who are mainly treated with drugs， have the good self-care ability， or have good auxiliary living conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. A study revealed that the outcome of patients with early initial treatment of diabetes (i.e.， the course of the disease is less than 5 years)， blood glucose control levels close to normal (i.e.， HbA1c between 6.5% and 7.0%) and full-day blood glucose control within the target range (3.9~10.0 mmol/L) is better than those with late initial treatment and poor long-term blood glucose control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.

Thus， patients with previous diagnoses of diabetes， regular drug treatment， regular detection of blood glucose， and HbA1c less than 7% were included in the study group.

Those whose previous information were not in accordance with HbA1c were excluded.\n\n【23】Anesthesia\n\n【24】Anesthesia is mainly divided into General Anesthesia (GA) and Intraspinal Anesthesia (IA). The specific choice of anesthesia was determined by the wishes of the patients and the evaluation results of the anesthesiologist.\n\n【25】Total hip arthroplasty\n\n【26】The operation was performed by the same group of experienced doctors. In the healthy lateral position， the skin was cut open by the posterolateral approach of the hip joint and separated layer by layer. After dislocation of the hip joint， the femoral head was removed by osteotomy through the femoral neck. Acetabular file grinding， shaping， mold testing， implantation of the acetabular prosthesis， and fixation. After the opening of the proximal femur， the medulla was reamed step by step and implanted into the biological femoral stem prosthesis. The hip joint was reduced and the range of motion and tightness of the joint were tested. Next， bleeding was stopped， wound rinsed， and then the joint capsule and external rotators reconstructed. the drainage tube was placed and the incision sutured layer by layer.\n\n【27】Postoperative drainage\n\nThe inner orifice of the drainage tube was placed in the hip joint cavity， and the external orifice was pierced and connected to the drainage bag at 2 cm under the lower edge of the incision. The drainage tube was fixed with silk thread. The volume of drainage was measured by the responsible nurse at 24 h and 48 h after the operation. The responsible doctor removed the drainage tube under the following conditions： If the drainage volume is less than 100 ml at48 h， and if the drainage volume is greater than 100 ml at 48 h， after clamping for 8 h|删除段之间换行|Analgesia model： 0.2 g celecoxib was taken orally one day before the operation， once in the morning and evening.

An adequate intravenous drip of a single antibiotic was routinely used half an hour before the operation and 48 h after the operation. Consequently， based on the condition of the incision， the index of inflammation， and the results of bacterial culture of incision secretion， we decided whether to change antibiotic infection prevention treatment to anti-infection treatment.\n\n【30】VAS score： The postoperative pain was evaluated by Visual Analogue Scale (Visual Analogue Scale， VAS). Evaluation score range： 0-10 points， the higher the score， the more severe the pain， with 0 points as painless， and 10 points as unbearable severe pain. The demarcation points of pain degree that does not affect sleep was divided into 3 points. The Reaching Time of VAS 3 score (RTVAS 3) was taken as the number of days required for postoperative pain relief so that sleep was not affected.\n\n【31】Statistical analysis\n\n【32】SPSS26.0 software (IBM， Armonk， USA) was used to analyzed the data. The data collected were tested by Shapiro-Wilks test and Levene's test for normal distribution and homogeneity of variance respectively. The test results in accordance with the normal distribution are expressed as (x±s)， and the results that do not conform to the normal distribution are expressed as (M 通用删除11(英):<u>(P25，P75)</u>). Bivariate normal distribution data were compared by single factor analysis of variance and non-bivariate normal distribution data by Kruskal Wallis test. The counting data were expressed by (n (%))， and the differences between groups were tested by the xtest. P<0.05indicates that the difference is statistically significant.\n\n【33】Results\n\n【34】Baseline data\n\n【35】A total of 184 subjects were enrolled， with an average age of 71.0±6.9 years old， including 109 in the study group and 75 in the control group.\n\n【36】In the study group，the average age was 71.48±7.14 years， and the average Course of Disease (COD)was 5.77±2.46 years. In the control group， the average age was 69.85 ±6.44 years， and the average COD was 6.00 (2.40， 10.50) years. There was a balance between the study group and the control group in terms of age and COD， and there was no significant difference between the two groups (P>0.05). The average HbA1c was 5.60±0.70% in the study group and 8.50±0.80%in the control group， which was significantly higher than that in the study group (P<0.001) .\n\n【37】Perioperative indexes\n\n【38】In the study group， the average Postoperative Drainage (PD) was154.52±94.72 ml， the average RTVAS 3 was 5.90±2.60 days， and the average Length of Stay (LOS) was 13.80 ± 3.20 days. In the control group， the average PD was 224.62±95.36 ml， the average RTVAS 3was 7.90 ±2.00 days， and the average LOS was 16.20 ±2.50 days. The PD， the RTVAS 3，and the LOS in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05).\n\n【39】In the study group， the average Operation Time (OT) was 64.58±10.48 min， the average Intraoperative Blood Loss (IBL) was 237.74±64.95 ml， the average Days of Antibiotic Use (DAU) was 6.80 ±3.10 days， and the average Hospitalization Cost (HC) was 37535.54±10416.46 yuan. In the control group， the average OT was 65.15±8.69min， the average IBL was 276.46±55.49 ml， the average DAU was7.30±2.20 days， and the average HC was 34802.11±7950.89 yuan. There was no significant difference in OT， IBL，DAU and HC between the study group and the control group (P>0.05) .\n\n【40】Discussion\n\nThis study analyzed the perioperative differences between diabetic postmenopausal women who adhere to daily blood|删除段之间换行|glucose management and maintain an ideal level of blood glucose management and those with poor daily blood glucose management during the perioperative period of total hip arthroplasty. We found that the PD， RTVAS 3， and LOS in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group.\n\n【42】In general， long-term hyperglycemia damages the structure and function of blood vessels and corresponding organs and tissues， and sometimes can even lead to organ failure， which is life-threatening. Amongtheelderly diabetic patients with renalinjury causedby diabetic microangiopathy， 1/3 was caused by diabetes alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Notably， severe diabetic microangiopathy often lead to cardiomyopathy， cardiac autonomic neuropathy， arrhythmia， and lack of induction to myocardial ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. However， elderly patients with long COD are often accompanied by multi-vessel coronary artery disease， and serious cardiovascular adverse events such as asymptomatic myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death may occur in clinic. Thus， long-term poor management of blood glucose in patients with diabetes can cause serious damage to the cardiovascular system. In this regard， our results show that there is no significant difference in intraoperative blood loss between postmenopausal women who adhere to daily management and postmenopausal women who are not managed or not managed enough， but the postoperative drainage volume of the former is significantlylower than that of the latter. This implies that long-term and reasonable control of blood glucose can help reduce the damage to vascular structure and function caused by diabetes and reduce blood loss after operation.\n\n【43】Under a certain genetic background， long-term hyperglycemia and related oxidative stress can cause peripheral nerve ischemia， axonal injury or demyelinating changes in the donor area through microvascular damage， resulting in sensory， motor， and autonomic neuronal function weakening and decline. This eventually correspond to pain temperature tactile disappearance， muscle atrophy， and multi-system sympathetic/vagal nerve regulation abnormality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. As the most common chronic complication of diabetes， diabetic peripheral neuropathy mainly affects cranial nerve， spinal nerve， distal nerve， and autonomic nerve， among which Distal Symmetric\n\n【44】Table 1： Comparison of baseline data in diabetic postmenopausal women with ideal daily blood glucose management and those with poor daily blood glucose management.\n\n|  | Control group  | Study group  | Test value  | Pvalue  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age (year)  | 69.85±6.44  | 71.48±7.14  | 0.509  | 0.479  |\n| COD (year)  | 6.00(2.40，10.50)  | 5.77±2.46  | \\-0.061  | 0.543  |\n| HbA1c(%)  | 8.50±0.80  | 5.60±0.70  | 169.157  | <0.001  |\n\n【46】\\Indicates that the statistical value of correlation analysis is the value of Kruskal Wallis test\n\n【47】COD： The Course of Disease\n\n【48】Table 2： Comparison of perioperative indexes of total hip arthroplasty in diabetic postmenopausal women with ideal daily blood glucose management and those with poor daily blood glucose management.\n\n|  | Control group  | Study group  | Test value  | Pvalue  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| OT (min)  | 65.15±8.69  | 64.58±10.48  | 0.03  | 0.863  |\n| IBL(ml)  | 276.46±55.49  | 237.74±64.95  | 3.527  | 0.067  |\n| PD (ml)  | 224.62±95.36  | 154.52±94.72  | 4.997  | 0.031  |\n| DAU (day)  | 7.30±2.20  | 6.80±3.10  | 0.283  | 0.598  |\n| RTVAS3 (day)  | 7.90±2.00  | 5.90±2.60  | 5.708  | 0.021  |\n| LOS (day)  | 16.20±2.50  | 13.80±3.20  | 5.541  | 0.023  |\n| HC (yuan)  | 34802.11±7950.89  | 37535.54±10416.46  | 0.716  | 0.402  |\n\nOT： The Operation Time； IBL： Intraoperative Blood Loss； PD： Postoperative Drainage； DAU： Days of Antibiotic Use； RTVAS3： Reaching Time of VAS 3 Score； LOS：Length of Stay； HC： Hospitalization Cost|删除段之间换行|Polyneuropathy (DSPN) is the most representative. More than half of the elderly patients with diabetes， especially those with a history of more than 10 years， are involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The main clinical manifestations of patients affected by DSPN are bilateral symmetrical distal limb pain， including spontaneous pain， and hyperalgesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Herein， our results indicate that pain relief is faster in the study group than in the control group， suggesting that diabetic patients with the same COD have less neurological damage from hyperglycemia if they maintain a reasonable blood glucose level. Meanwhile， it also suggests that for diabetic patients who fail to properly control their blood sugar for a long time， even in the absence of no typical symptoms of peripheral neuropathy， their ability to relieve pain after trauma c surgery may be declined.\n\n【51】Of note， diabetic patients are prone to a certain degree of heart， brain，kidney， and other important organ damage due to long-term endocrine and metabolic disorders， and inevitably cause drastic changes in blood sugar in the face of surgery， anesthesia， fasting， and other stimuli， thus aggravating the injury of important organs and increasing the incidence of infection， poor wound healing， and prolonged hospitalization. Evidence indicates that the postoperative mortality rate of diabetic patients is 5 times higher than that of non-diabetic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，17\\]</u>. Comparatively， we found that the LOS of the study group with good blood glucose control was significantly shorter than that of the control group with poor blood glucose control. This observation corroborated with previous research 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，19\\]</u>. Therefore， patients with abnormal blood glucose inevitably need blood glucose adjustment and detection. In the case of patients whose blood sugar is significantly elevated and difficult to control， treatment may be executed through a more professional program given by the endocrinology department after consultation. The increased risk of postoperative infection caused by hyperglycemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> and prolonged postoperative pain relief are also factors affecting the length of stay.\n\n【52】Based on the comparison of the event of total hip arthroplasty， we found that the study group had less blood loss， faster pain relief， and earlier discharge than the control group. Of course， brittle fractures are something no one wants to experience， but when it’s a foregone conclusion， this effort has reaped unexpected benefits for postmenopausal women with diabetes who insist on managing their blood sugar on a daily basis and maintaining ideal levels. Therefore， for people with diabetes， the benefits of long-term and reasonable control of blood sugar may go beyond the intuitive items on the health education list.\n\n【53】Limited to the singleness of the research center， our results have the following shortcomings.删除4:<u> 1</u>. China has the largest number of diabetic patients in the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>， but the sample size in this study is small because of the patients with other chronic diseases， severe diabetic complications，respiratory， digestive or genitourinary system infections， and other site injuries.删除4:<u> 2</u>. Considering the traffic， medical convenience， and other reasons， although the wound healed well and the inflammatory index returned to normal after operation， local patients still tend to be discharged after removing stitches.

This is a case report of a 58-year-old middle-aged man diagnosed with early-stage stomach cancer. The previous physical examination of the patient found that the gastric horn was scattered in the ulcer focus. Endoscopic ulcer sampling was performed on the gastric horn mucosa， and the result was adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent accompanying laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for distal gastric cancer. Superficial concave or superficial flat type was seen throughout the tumor area. This case study is about the diagnosis of reptile cancer， which has certain discussion for future research.\n\n【2】Keywords： Early cancer； Creeping type； Gastric cancer\n\n【3】Clinical Data\n\n【4】Patient is a 58-year-old male. Antrum space occupying lesion was found for 2 weeks. Two weeks ago， the patient went to the localhospital for gastroenteroscopy ， indicating the gastric antrum space occupying lesions. Additional immunohistochemical results of the patient's disease examination in other hospitals：CKL+， P53+ 60%，ki-67+80%：HER-2： 1+， negative. MH1+，MSH2+，MSH6+，and PMS2+ indicate that the Microarray is Stable (MSS). Occasionally there is irregular pain in the upper abdomen， no diarrhea， vomiting， abdominal distension， palpitation， chest tightness， low back pain and other discomfort. Since the illness， mental diet can be， sleep well， bowel and stool normal， recent weight has not changed significantly. In the past， she was in good health and had allergic history of penicillin， amoxicillin， levofloxacin， ambroxol and other drugs， occasionally drank alcohol， and had no special medical history or family history.\n\n【5】Physical examination： System check no abnormality.\n\n【6】Abdominal examination： The abdomen was flat and symmetrical， without abdominal varicose veins， gastrointestinal type and peristaltic wave， and the abdomen was soft， without tenderness or rebound pain， and no abnormal mass was touched. The liver and spleen were untouched， and the hepatojugular reflux sign was negative. No positive signs.\n\n【7】Auxiliary examination： Total abdominal male CT spiral scan+ enhanced CT indicated that the gastric wall of the gastric antrum was slightly thickened and strengthened， and further examination was recommended. All tumor markers (C12 protein chips) had no significant changes and were in the normal range.\n\nThe patient was initially diagnosed with gastric malignancy and underwent laparoscopic radical gastrectomy. The results of postoperative examination of the patient were： (stomach) hand-holding cancer/crawling cancer， Japanese convention type： Tub2； Nakamura type： Differentiated type， Lauren type： Intestinal type. WHO classification： Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma； Cell mucous type： intestinal type； The tumor infiltrated into the submucosa， and there was no cancer involvement in the two broken ends. No cancer metastasis was observed in 4 lymph nodes in the adipose tissue around the greater curvature (0/4)， no cancer metastasis was observed in 8lymph nodes in the adipose tissue around the lesser curvature (0/8)， and no cancer involvement was observed in the omentum tissue.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， GC includes five main types of adenocarcinomas， including adenocarcinoma of the form， tubular adenocarcinoma of the kidney， mucinous adenocarcinoma， low viscosity and mixed adenocarcinoma， as well as other rare entities. The most common histopathological subtype is renal tubular adenocarcinoma， which can be divided into two grades of highly differentiated adenocarcinoma or moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. As an important subtype in moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma， CRA hasIreceivedincreasing attention as a specific histological GC subtype due to its unique clinicopathological and molecular manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-6\\]</u>. According to Yasuko Fujita et al.， immunohistochemical staining of GRA showed that TP53 mutation (especially c.529\\546del mutation) and a variety of AI were closely related to CRA carcinogenesis in clinical cases and molecular analysis. In terms of clinicopathological and molecular findings， CRA was an independent entity of GC. Despite the characteristic histology of CRA， little is known about the molecular|删除段之间换行|characteristics ofCRA通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>.It can be seen that immunohistochemistry has certain diagnostic significance， and MUC-2， MUC-5AC， and MUC-6 are usually mixed in immunohistochemistry， or can be expressed in intestinal type alone. The expression of P53 was usually stronger or negative than that of normal tissues. Ki67 showed a high proliferation index. The diagnosis of \"crawling\" gastric cancer is relatively difficult. According to Japanese researchers such as Haruta Y， it is necessary to take multiple endoscopic examinations to obtain sufficient evidence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The problem lies in the fact that these lesions cannot be detected under endoscopy. The patient is indicated as adenocarcinoma by endoscopy for the first time， and biopsy is usually performed to diagnose enterosis or atypical hyperplasia after the discovery. The most common type of gastric cancer can only be followed up by endoscopists. Such cases are actually quite common， but the early diagnosis is too difficult， and most of them are developed to the later stage of mixed component cancer to be clear.\"Creeping gastric cancer is characterized by small cell atypia， which is easy to cause missed or underdiagnosis， especially in biopsies. In addition， although the \"crawling\" gastric cancer has a glandular tubular structure， which is equivalent to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma， it is prone to low adhesion cancer regions， suggesting that this tumor may be more aggressive， although it is a|删除段之间换行|low-atypic adenocarcinoma. Therefore， we should pay more attention to the combination of structure and cell atypia， and strengthen the understanding of this kind of tumor. Pathology， molecular expression profile and related genes are of significance in diagnosing the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-11\\]</u>， and effective treatment plans are specified based on corresponding gene and pathology analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-13\\]</u>. In this case， the patient was diagnosed with early-stage cancer， the tumor invaded the submucosa， stage T1， and the latest postoperative treatment plan was not found for crawling cancer. According to the latest guidelines and treatments， chemotherapy and radiation therapy were not required in the later stage， and follow-up review was conducted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However， it can have different etiologies leading to different treatments， which makes the diagnosis challenging for the clinician.\n\n【2】Methods： Case study.\n\n【3】Results： We report the case of a 71-year-old female who presented a severe painful sensory motor axonal neuropathy. She had an IgM lambda monoclonal gammopathy with bone marrow and pleura lymphoplasmocytic cell infiltration， in favor of WM. The neuropathy worsened despite two lines of hematologic treatment. Nerve biopsy showed diffuse infiltrates of B and T cells with a B cell amplification confirmed on polymerase chain reaction based clonality testing.\n\n【4】Interpretation： Nerve biopsy is a key tool in the diagnosis of WM associated axonal neuropathy， especially for tumoral nerve infiltration since other classical investigations are often negative. The pathogenesis of this infiltration is debated， but our data are in favor of a hematogenic invasion by tumoral cells. Neuropathy secondary to tumoral nerve invasion may worsen in spite of good hematological response to treatment.\n\n【5】Keywords： EMG； Hematologic； Peripheral neuropathy； Nerve tumor； Biopsy\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM) is a distinct B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by IgM monodonal gammopathy and bone marrow infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. WM associated neuropathy can be observed in around 40% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Although anti-MAG neuropathy is the most frequently described form， axonal neuropathy is common and has various etiologies. We report the case of a patient with severe sensory motor neuropathy that worsened despite treatment of WM， and that illustrates the diagnostic challenge of this situation.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\nA 71-year-old female was admitted to our department in December删除4:<u> 2018</u>. Over the past two years， she had presented painful sensory disorders in her feet-progressively extending to the whole leg-and subsequent distal motor weakness. Concomitant 10 kg weight loss prompted systemic investigations in May 2018 that revealed an IgM monoclonal gammopathy with excess lambda free light chains at 200 mg/L. Lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltration into the bone marrow and pleura confirmed the diagnosis of WM with pleural localization and MYD88 mutation. Treatment with rituximab， dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide was initiated then switched to rituximab and bendamustine in October 2018 because of neurological worsening. Despite the decrease in lambda free light chains to 72 mg/L and regression of the pleural mass， sensory disorders extended to both hands and motor weakness reached the proximal part of the lower limbs. Electrophysiological studies revealed a severe progressive asymmetrical sensory motor axonal neuropathy. Complete laboratory tests were performed： Anti-MAG， anti-gangliosides and anti-neuronal antibodies were negative. The patient was positive for type 1 cryoglobulinemia with no evidence of complement|删除段之间换行|consumption. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) analysis was normal and included immunophenotyping and search for clonality. Salivary gland biopsy showed few amyloid deposits that were too small to be typed. Biopsy of abdominal subcutaneous fatty tissue was normal. Nerve Biopsy (NB) was subsequently performed. Nerve fragments were embedded in paraffin for staining， cut in transverse semi-thin and ultra-thin sections for optical and electron microscopy， and frozen for molecular biology. Congo red staining was negative. NB revealed severe axonal loss and nerve degeneration as well as perivascular， perineural and endoneural infiltrates of small mononuclear cells， identified as B and T cells by anti-CD20 and anti-CD3staining， respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based clonality testing showed monoclonal B cell amplification.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\nThis observation demonstrates the relevance of NB in WM-related axonal neuropathy. Once electrophysiological studies and blood tests had ruled out a demyelinating process such as anti-MAG neuropathy， further investigations focused on mechanisms of axonal neuropathy such as amyloidosis， endoneural deposits of immunoglobulin， vasculitis or tumoral infiltration. Although salivary gland biopsy was suggestive of amyloidosis， NB showed no deposits stained by Congo red coloration or detectable in electron microscopy. There were no deposits of immunoglobulin in electron microscopy. The absence of cytomorphological abnormalities of cell infiltrates associated with positivity for type 1 cryoglobulinemia could be evocative of vasculitis|删除段之间换行|but the preservation of the vessel wall ruled out this hypothesis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Ultimately， clonality assessment by PCR was the key test to distinguish tumor lymphoproliferation from nonspecific reactive cell infiltrates. Tumoral nerve infiltration in WM is rarely described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and probably under estimated because explorations such as MRI， PET scans and CSF analysis can be negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In a retrospective study of 40 patients with WM-related neuropathy， 2 out of 25 patients with an axonal neuropathy had tumoral nerve infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In a more recent article， of 15 patients with neurolymphomatosis diagnosed with PCR analysis on NB， only one had WM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Several mechanisms are suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>： Contiguous nerve invasion， meningeal invasion， or hematogenous metastasis， but the exact pathogenesis remains unclear. Our images support the theory of a hematogenic invasion by tumoral cells， illustrating not only their accumulation in perivascular spaces as described in previous studies， but also their diffusion from the vessel to the endoneurium through the blood-nerve barrier and their aggressivity towards the nerve structure. Furthermore， this case highlights the existence of a dissociation between neurological and hematological responses to treatment in WM， in the same manner as there is no correlation between the severity of the hemopathy and the occurrence of a neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Indeed， the neuropathy worsened despite the rise in IgM lambda， and the use of chemotherapy capable of crossing the blood-nerve barrier. This dissociation raises questions about the management of WM， and in particular how and when to evaluate treatment response or to conclude in treatment failure.\n\n【12】Severee progressiveaaxonal neuropathyyin WMdespite hematological response to treatment may be evocative of tumoral nerve invasion.

In this case report， a girl presented with vomiting and acute abdominal pain in the lower right side of her abdomen. Ovarian torsion is a rare diagnosis and is a gynecologic emergency. The clinical findings can vary and are non-specific， making it a diagnostic challenge. Most of the time， ovarian torsion occurs in women during their reproductive years. Transabdominal ultrasound can be of pivotal importance for the diagnosis. Laparoscopic detorsion and recovering the blood flow of the ovary is the initial treatment. A timely surgical intervention should be done to prevent the ovary from ischemia and necrosis for a favorable outcome.\n\n【2】Keywords： Ovarian torsion； Ovarium detorsion； Acute abdominal pain； Transabdominal ultrasound； Laparoscopy\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Ovarian torsion is a very rare gynecologic emergency that can potentially lead to the loss of an ovary due to ischemia and necrosis. Ovarian torsion is estimated to be the cause in 2.7% of all women having acute abdominal pain in gynecology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Non-specific symptoms that can vary often result in delayed or even missed diagnosis. The onset， nature， intensity and location of these symptoms can differ from patient to patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. An ovarian mass is the primary risk factor for the occurrence of ovarian torsion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5\\]</u>. The ovarian mass predisposes an ovary to rotate on its axis， and the risk of a torsion increases with the size of the mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，6\\]</u>. Most women having an ovarian torsion are in their reproductive years， but it can occur in all ages， even in neonates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，7\\]</u>. The diagnosis is for the most part made with transabdominal ultrasound. A Doppler flow of the blood vessels is used to assess the blood flow at the time of the torsion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The initial treatment of ovarian torsion is laparoscopy， especially when the ovary is not yet in a necrotic stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-11\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nA ten-year-old girl came to the emergency department suffering from acute abdominal pain. Previously， she was healthy. The pain had started one day earlier and was getting increasingly worse. The pain was located at the lower right side of her abdomen. She had to vomit once. Her stool had been once a day， and was of standard color and consistency， without blood or mucus. She did not have any urinary tract symptoms (e.g.， dysuria and hematuria). One hour before she came to the emergency department， she visited a general practitioner. Her general practitioner considered the complaints related to obstipation and prescribed 5 mg bisacodyl and 30 ml lactulose 670 mg/ml. After intake of the medication， she had to vomit again. Her general practitioner referred her to the emergency department， suspecting an appendicitis. On physical examination，her heart rate was128bpm， arterial blood pressure 120/80 mmHg， and body temperature 37.5 degrees. She appeared pale and she experienced pain. She preferred to sit still with her knees pulled up. A smooth and slender abdomen was found at the abdominal examination with sparse peristalsis. There were no increased or decreased bowel sounds on auscultation. Mild pressure pain in the epigastrium region was present with evident rebound tenderness in the lower right abdomen with muscular relaxation. Blood tests did not show abnormalities. There was a low CRP. Also， the urine test was without any abnormalities. The next step was an ultrasound of the abdomen . There were no signs ofan appendicitis. There was a little bit of fluid in the pouch of Douglas. Based on the clinical，laboratory， and ultrasound data， an ovarian torsion on the right side was suspected. An emergency laparoscopy was performed. During the laparoscopy， it was clear that the right ovary had an interrupted blood flow . There was a little cyst on the right ovary that was not seen on transabdominal ultrasound. This little cyst was probably causing the torsion. The cyst was not removed during the|删除段之间换行|surgery. The detorsion of the right ovary was successful， the blood flow was recovered， and the ovary was saved . The day after the laparoscopy，she did not complain of pain anymore and she could leave the hospital.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\nAn ovarian torsion is a very rare condition， especially in girls in their premenarchal years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，7\\]</u>. This is one of the reasons it can be challenging to make the diagnosis， and it is therefore often missed. The clinical presentation associated with an ovarian torsion includes acute abdominal pain， nausea and vomiting， and a normal body temperature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. These symptoms can mimic many other diseases associated with abdominal pain and vomiting. However， when an ovarian torsion is present， it is critical to perform surgery as quickly as possible to recover the blood flow and avoid necrosis of the ovary通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The present case was a girl who was not yet menstruating， had acute abdominal pain， and non-specific symptoms. Despite the young age， it is crucial that the diagnosis of ovarian torsion is suspected in all young patients with acute abdominal pain. In most cases， a cyst is the cause of ovarian torsion. Most of these masses are benign tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5\\]</u>. The ovarian cyst predisposes the ovary to rotate on its axis. The bigger the size of the cyst， the bigger the risk of a torsion. When the cyst is too big， there is no space anymore to rotate. Furthermore， a higher rate of right-sided ovarian torsions has been reported， probably due|删除段之间换行|to the relative hypermobility of the right adnexa compared to the left side 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，6\\]</u>. An ovarian cyst seems to be the cause of the torsion in the present case. An abdominal ultrasound is the primary component for children to make the diagnosis for apparent reasons. The ultrasound is performed concurrently with a Doppler flow. The torsed ovary is enlarged on ultrasound and can be up to twelve times bigger than the other side 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. When the ovary is not enlarged， transabdominal ultrasound can be less specific. The Doppler flow shows a good blood flow despite the torsion most ofthe time. Due to the dual blood supply of an ovary the interruption of blood supply can be missed with a Doppler flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The sonographic findings in this present case showed the ovarian torsion，the enlarged ovarian， and the interrupted blood flow. These findings made the diagnosis clear. There was enough reason to perform surgery. The treatment of ovarian torsion depends on age， presence of a menstrual cycle， and wish of fertility in the future. In the past， an oophorectomy was the initial treatment. At present， a laparoscopy is a preferred treatment， especially when the ovarian is not yet completely necrotic. Detorsion of the ovary is done and the blood flow is recovered during laparoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-11\\]</u>. The prognosis for children is good， so the blood flow is recovered， and the ovary is saved in almost all cases. Four to six weeks after laparoscopy， the ovary gets smaller and the blood flow is further improved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】Ovarian torsion should be suspected in a girl with acute abdominal pain， even with no menstrual cycle yet. The diagnosis can be challenging to make due to the non-specific clinical manifestations. A transabdominal ultrasound is a promising imaging technique to make an accurate diagnosis. The treatment with laparoscopic detorsion should be performed as soon as possible to recover the blood flow and save the ovary.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Two cases had trauma around the elbow joint before ankylosis. At the most recent examinations， the average arc of motion was 85 degrees among patients. Two patients satisfied with surgical outcomes， however， one patient complained of residual pain and numbness. There were some reports about TEA of ankylosed elbow，however， there were few reports limited to ankylosed elbow with RA. TEA for ankylotic elbows in patients with RA is a good surgical option to restore adequate function. To gain a good outcome， it should be evaluated other joints in the extremity in order to properly evaluate the mobility and function of the elbowand to prepare a comprehensive plan of pre- and post-operative management that takes into consideration the full motion of the upper extremity.\n\n【2】Keywords： Ankylotic elbow； Rheumatoid arthritis， Total elbow arthroplasty\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a common disease characterized by chronic synovitis and resulting in joint destruction. Recent advancements in the diagnostic process and treatment of RA have decreased joint surgery， including synovectomy or joint replacement， over the last decade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Nevertheless， some patients with severe joint destruction occasionally develop severe contractures or ankylosis which impair the Activities of Daily Living (ADL).\n\n【5】The incidence of elbow joint involvement in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is approximately 50%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Destruction of the elbow joint seriously impairs upper limb function. Moreover， complete ankylosis of the elbow results in severe disability and functional limitations， especially when other joints in the ipsilateral upper extremity also have limited motion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In a previous study not limited to RA patients， the analysis of compensatory movement after arthrodesis of the elbow showed compromised ability， despite a significantly increased dependence on wrist movement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Since the wrist or shoulder joint is occasionally damaged and impaired in patients with RA， ankylosis of the elbow affects ADL more than it would in a patient without RA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Accordingly，an ankylosed elbow， especially in RA patients， generally should be treated.\n\n【6】Elbow contractures are usually treated with arthroscopic surgery or open surgical release and numerous reports have indicated the achievement of good results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-6\\]</u>. However， fewer reports present the results of Total Elbow Arthroplasty (TEA) in ankylosed elbows 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，7-10\\]</u>. Figgie et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> concluded that stiff elbows are difficult to treat and have a high complication rate. The latter study was reported in 1989 and good anatomical implants were not available at that time. Since implant design and surgical techniques have advanced in recent years， TEA could now be a reliable option to restore function to completely ankylosed elbows damaged by RA. There were some reports of TEA on ankylosed elbow； however， there were few reports about TEA ankylosed elbow limited to RA patient. This report is a retrospective review of TEAs performed in our hospital between 2008 and2015 for ankylosed elbows in patients with RA. We examine complete ankylosis in three elbows of three patients with RA who underwent TEA. All of the patients were women and their average age at surgery was 55 years (range， 29 to 72 years). Herein we report these cases.\n\n【7】Anteroposterior and lateral views after total elbow arthroplasty (TEA).\n\n【8】Case Presentation Case 1\n\n【9】A 29-year-old woman had complained of polyarthralgia when she was16 years old， at which time she visited our clinic and was diagnosed with RA. When she was 27 years old she struck her right elbow when she fell to the ground. After the accident， she was referred to the nearby hospital， where she was diagnosed with a right humeral supracondylar fracture and treated conservatively with a cast. Bone union was achieved 3 months after the injury. However， this patient was referred to our department 1 year after the injury because she noticed a reduction in motion and gradual impairment of her right elbow. Radiographs revealed that her right elbow was completely ankylosed and fused at 20 degrees flexed position . There were no symptoms due to ulnar nerve. In the hope that she would be able to regain the mobility needed to be able to wash her face and hair by her， at 29 years of age she underwent a linked TEA (K-NOW snap in； Nakashima Medical， Okayama， Japan). The posterior Campbell approach was used， and the triceps was incised in an inverted V-shape. First， the ulnar nerve was isolated and protected. Second， the extensor carpi ulnaris and anconeus muscles were released from the ulna. Although osseous ankylosis had occurred， it was easy to identify the landmarks of the original humeroulnar joint. After the radial head was resected， the humeroulnar joint line was carefully opened using a bone saw and mini-osteotomes. The rest of the procedure was almost the same as any standard TEA method. Care was taken to release the anterior part of the capsule to improve extension and the triceps muscle was released from the humerus in order to improve flexion. Under general anesthesia， the range of motion of the elbow ranged from 0 to 125 degrees after the implants had settled. The triceps flap was elongated using the V-Y method. The ulnar nerve was replaced anteriorly from its origin. A radiographic examination after the surgery showed the alignment of components was acceptable . The patient's elbow was immobilized with a splint for 1 week. Under the observation of an occupational therapist， the splint was removed and range of motion exercises were begun with a 30 degrees restriction on extension. Three weeks after the operation， the patient was allowed to move her elbow freely. Any elbow brace was not applied. At the most recent examination， or 65 months after surgery， passive motion of the patient's elbow ranged from 30 to 110 degrees and she did not experience any pain or numbness. She was able to wash her face and hair by herself again and she was very satisfied with the surgical outcome.\n\n【10】Case 2\n\nA 64 year old woman was diagnosed with RA at the age of 30. By age 60 she began to feel pain in her left elbow and motion at the|删除段之间换行|joint gradually declined. When she was referred to our clinic at age64， her left elbow was fused at 45 degrees. Radiographs revealed that her elbow was completely ankylosed . She complained of disability in her left elbow during Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and she hoped to regain motion in her left elbow. This patient underwent a linked TEA using The Discovery Elbow System (Biomet， IN， USA). The surgical approach and technique were the same as described for Case 1 and included a triceps flap elongation and ulnar nerve transposition. Under general anesthesia， the range of motion of the elbow ranged from 0 to 140 degrees after the implant settled. The radiographic examination after surgery showed that there was a good alignment of components . Postoperative treatment was also the same as it was for Case删除4:<u> 1</u>. At the most recent examination， or 6 months after surgery， passive motion of this patient's elbow ranged from 20 to 130 degrees and she did not experience any pain or numbness. In addition，her ADL could be performed satisfactorily once again.\n\n【12】Case 3\n\nA 72-year-old woman was diagnosed with RA in a hospital at age 45 and she was treated with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs. She injured her left elbow at age 69 and was diagnosed with a supracondylar fracture of the humerus. Her left elbow was treated conservatively and progressively lost motion. This patient hoped to undergo elbow surgery and was referred to our hospital at age删除4:<u> 71</u>. Her left elbow was fused at 90 degrees and radiographs revealed that it was completely ankylosed . At age 72， she underwent linked TEA using The Discovery Elbow System. The surgical approach and technique were the same as those described for Case 1 and included a triceps flap elongation and ulnar nerve transposition. Because a crack occurred on the lateral condyle of the humerus during bone reaming， Kirchner wires were inserted and the fragment was fixed. Under general anesthesia， the range of motion of the elbow ranged|删除段之间换行|anteroposterior and lateral views. (B) Anteroposterior and lateral views after\n\n【14】TEA.\n\n【15】from 40 to 140 degrees after the implant settled. A radiographic examination after the surgery showed that the alignment of the implants was acceptable . The postoperative treatment was the same was described for Case删除4:<u> 1</u>. The patient complained of continued numbness in her ring and little finger immediately after the surgery. Therefore， she underwent neurolysis of the ulnar nerve7 months after her primary surgery. The symptoms on the ulnar side of her hand gradually improved after the neurolysis； however，hand numbness persisted at her most recent examination. Passive motion at her elbow ranged from 60 to 125 degrees. The increased range of motion at the patient's elbow improved her ADL， so she was satisfied with her surgical outcome to some extent， despite the handnumbness that persisted.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】There have been several reported case series of TEA for ankylosed elbows 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，7-9\\]</u>. Figgies et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> reported a 19-case series of TEA using linked implants for ankylotic elbows in patients with a variety of conditions that have included RA. Of the 19 cases， 4 cases were evaluated as excellent， 11 as good， 3 as fair， and 1 as a failure. The failed case occurred after an infection developed around the surgical site and the implants were removed. The authors stated that the functional limitations of patients should be evaluated at the outset and this should include a concurrent evaluation of other upper extremity joints. Mansat et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported 14 cases， 4 of which were rated as excellent， 4 were good， 1 was fair， and 5 were poor. Peden et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> reported 13 cases： 5 were rated as excellent，3 were good， 4 were fair， and 1 was poor. According to these reports， functional ability restored in most patients postoperatively and was sufficient enough that they could perform ADL normally. In our cases， two of the three patients were very satisfied with the surgical outcome and reported that their ADLs were better than they had been preoperatively.\n\nIn the previous reports， the range of motion achieved at the elbows was mostly good. Figgie at al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> reported that the mean arc of motion improved from 0 degrees preoperatively to 80 degrees(range， 35 to 115 degrees of flexion) at an average 5.75 years after the operation. Mansat et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported that the mean increase in the arc of flexion was 60 degrees (range， 5 to 115 degrees)， with a mean increase of 33 degrees in flexion and 27 degrees in extension. Peden et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> reported that the improvement in range of motion at the elbow measured 1 vear after the operation was maintained for all patients after a 12-year follow-up. In our study， the average arc of motion was 85 degrees (range， 65 to 110 degrees) at the most recent examination. This result is similar to that of the Peden et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> study. Improvement in the range of motion of the elbow improves the ADL for patients with RA. Common complications following TEA are aseptic loosening， infections， ulnar nerve problems， elbow instability， dislocation， subluxation， intraoperative fracture， fracture of the prosthesis， and ectopic bone formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. When performing TEA for an ankylotic elbow， special care should be taken to prevent infection， ulnar nerve problems， instability， and an intraoperative fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，8-10\\]</u>. Infection is not typically frequent， but severe complications can arise if it does occur. In the previous study reported by Figgie et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> the only case to fail was due to a deep infection and the patient was not a suitable candidate for implant arthroplasty because of noncompliance. Mansat et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported that a deep infection developed in one elbow of two patients with posttraumatic stiffness. One patient had two previous operations prior to the arthroplasty， and the other patient had been operated on four times|删除段之间换行|before. Both of these patients required revision surgery. In another previous report， three patients had deep perioperative infections that required an average of four additional operations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Neurogenic symptoms， especially those pertaining to ulnar nerve disorders， were a relatively common complication after TEA. It was reported that some patients with moderate neurogenic symptoms preoperatively had complete relief after ulnar nerve decompression and transposition， while other previously asymptomatic patients developed ulnar nerve symptoms； however， no pain was attributed to the ulnar nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Among our cases， one of the three patients had significant ulnar nerve symptoms after undergoing TEA and required revision surgery(neurolysis). Because kinking or compression of the ulnar nerve can occur after TEA for ankylotic elbows 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， perioperative procedures to manage the ulnar nerve should be employed. In previous reports， linked implants have been recommended in order to maintain the stability of elbows over the full course of the period during which they are observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. Our cases had received linked implants and we did not encounter complaints regarding symptoms caused by elbow instability. Intraoperative fracture is one of the most severe complications to try and avoid during this type of operation. Peden et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> reported that two cases had a fracture of the lateral humeral epicondyle which resolved uneventfully and the ulnar component was malpositioned causing a perforation of the posterior cortex in another case. Mansat et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported that two patients sustained a fracture associated with a loose component. One of our cases had an intraoperative fracture and it was fixed with a Kirchner wire. We noted that the original border between the humerus and ulna was sometimes difficult to identify intraoperatively and this can inadvertently contribute to a fracture when opening up an ankylotic joint.\n\n【19】In conclusion， TEA for ankylotic elbows in patients with RA is a good surgical option to restore adequate function as well as any other spontaneous ankylosis. For the sake of a good outcome， it is necessaryto evaluate other joints in the extremity in order to properly evaluate the mobility and function of the elbow and to prepare a comprehensive plan of pre- and post-operative management that takes into consideration the full motion of the upper extremity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Presently neuroimaging， blood and CSF biomarkers are expensive and invasive to perform and are considered impractical for research purpose. The retinal presents a readily accessible tissue for monitoring the brain and could potentially be used in combination with or as a substitute for current ADand other neurodegenerative disease biomarkers. Data on retinal involvement in AD and neurodegenerative diseases have been controversial and inconsistent. So， we are reporting a case of choroideremia with neuropsychiatric presentations and complications.\n\n【2】Keywords： Choroideremia； Neuropsychiatry； Retina； Vision\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Choroideremia is a x-linked recessive， progressive， degenerative disorder of retina and choroid that mainly affects males. It is caused by loss of function mutations in the choroideremia gene resulting in decreased Rab Escort Protein-1(REP-1) expression which leads to degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium， photoreceptors， and choroid. The first symptom of this condition is usually an impairment of night vision (night blindness)， which can occur in early childhood. A progressive narrowing of the field of vision (tunnel vision) follows， as well as a decrease in the ability to see details (visual acuity) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. These vision problems are due to an ongoing loss of cells (atrophy) in the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (retina) and a nearby network of blood vessels (the choroid). The vision impairment in Choroideremia worsens over time， but the progression varies among affected individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Visual impairments due to Choroideremia are associated with emotional， functional， and economic burden. Prevalence is 1 in 50，000 to 100，000and accounts 4% of all blindness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. There have been some reports of choroideremia patients with neurological complications.

On further enquiry patient reports that he is also having bi-occipital dull aching headache for 1.5 months which gets partially relieved on he turns his head upwards. So， most time of day he would keep his head upward position. He is dependent on family members for daily activities for and unable to handle his finance，laundry， medications for1.5 months. History of frequent head injury due to fall. In premorbid personality he had obsessive compulsive personality traits. On general examination he was conscious， oriented. Neurological examination suggestive of cogwheel rigidity in right upper limb，power， reflexes in all limbs normal. Pill rolling tremors in right hand at rest. For walking he needed assistance and had shuffling gait with stopped posture. Bilateral pupils reacting to light but only perception of light was present. On Mental Status Examination- recent memory impaired， with Mini Mental Status Examination score22/28， copying and writing he could not do due to vision impairment .\n\n【7】Treatment\n\n【8】Considering irritability patient started on tablet Quetiapine 25 mg at night and as per needed.

Then peripheral field loss occurs over the next few decades. The disease presents with patchy areas of depigmentation which spreads from periphery to central part of choroid retinal laver with a characteristic salt and pepper mottling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. In the involved areas， there is diffuse atrophy of the choriocapillaries and retinal pigmented epithelium. The central visual acuity is preserved until the patient's 50s， and retinal blood vessels are not affected. The macular area remains intact until late in the course of disease， with preserved visual acuity. There are case reports of choroideremia with clinically undiagnosed psychiatric syndromes. Some case has presented with isolated symptoms of nyctalopia， progressive visual painlessness， painless and foreign body sensation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-11\\]</u>. In this case report subiect had unreported visual symptoms till the age of 30. He started symptoms of difficult vision in night at his 30’s but he was diagnosed with the condition from ophthalmologist by genetic testing and with optical coherence tomography. Although neuropsychological symptoms are difficult to diagnose and under reported and this case report shows the rarest presentation of choroideremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>. As the disease is x-linked his son has got a risk of developing the condition so the genetic counseling was also conducted. The absolute diagnosis of choroideremia is based on the identification of clinical features combined with additional imaging exams which is done in all the reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-12\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Prognosis\n\n【17】As this a genetic condition with unsatisfactory prognosis symptomss canbDecontrolled withhperiodiccophthalmologic examination especially when central vision is affected， and cystoid macular edema is suspected. The neuropsychiatric sequel can be successfully controlled with early diagnosis and preventive measures.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】Choroideremia is a genetic retinal disease which is rare and causes blindness mainly in middle-aged men. We are yet to know how the biochemical defect that causes the retinal-specific disease and if it has any hidden effects on the rest of the body especially the brain.

Catheter related bloodstream infections are the most serious compilations of parenteral nutrition therapy.\n\n【2】Contamination of the hub of a central line may cause bacteremia and sepsis. We present the case of Leuconostoc mesenteroides bacteremia in a parenteral-fed patient in the home-care setting. To our knowledge， it is the first described case of central line's salvage from this pathogen in an immunocompromised permanently parenterally fed adult patient.\n\n【3】Case Presentation： A 29-year-old man with features of malnutrition due to infection of a central line was admitted to the hospital on emergency. The patient reported abdominal pain， fever and symptoms of dysuria for 3 weeks. Standard tests were performed including blood for culture sampled from the central line and the peripheral vein. Blood cultures detected central line.\n\n【4】Parenteral nutrition administered viatheperipheral venous route was introduced. Firstly，bacteremia was empirically treated with antibiotics such as vancomycin and imipenem+cilastatine， secondly switched to ampicillin according to the antibiogram and with Clindamycin administered to the central line followed by alcohol lock. Control cultures confirmed successful treatment. Parenteral nutrition was administered to the central line and transfusion went uneventful for two days.\n\n【5】Conclusion： Successful treatment of opportunistic CRBSI with catheter salvage can be feasible even in immunocompromised patients. In the central lines treatment it is important to consider risks and benefits resulting from its removal.\n\n【6】Keywords： Central venous catheter； Leuconostoc； Home parenteral nutrition； Sepsis\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】Leuconostoc species are Gram-positive， non-motile bacteria placed within the family of Streptococcacae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Species of this kind are hard to identify in clinical studies； by virtue of similar phenotype they are sometimes incorrectly reported as a.o. Streptococcus， LactococcuS Or Enterococcus species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Leuconostoc spp. is widespread in the natural environment. They were also identified in human's gastrointestinal tract， oral mucosa and reproductive organs. Until recently were considered to be non-pathogenic for humans and animals， whereas they are a rare cause of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. Now they have been recognized as a potential pathogen causing infection mainly in immunocompromised patients， patients with central venous catheters or patients undergoing long-term treatment with antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Infection problem in parenteral nutrition\n\n【10】Parenteral nutrition is an invasive form oftreatment which carries a risk of serious complications. These complications when diagnosed too late or misdiagnosed and treated poorly might lead to the death of a patient. It is estimated that complications of central venous catheters might occur in one patient in ten. Often， the number of catheter-related septic complications is expressed as “catheter days”. Acceptable CRBSI (Catheter-related bloodstream infection) rates have been variably reported as 0.35-2.27 episodes/1000 catheter days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>.\n\n【11】cited.\n\nWhen a significant bacterial or fungal growth occurs， microbes disseminate into the blood|删除段之间换行|stream and clinical symptoms manifested by sub febrile states or fever with chills， tachycardia， shortness of breath and overall deterioration of patient's state occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. When disseminated infection is suspected the culture for fungus， aerobic and anaerobic bacteria is performed from the blood collected from the catheter or from the peripheral vein. Culture is also performed for urine， feces and skin around the exit of the catheter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【13】During the waiting period for blood culture results， empiric antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive (vancomycin) and Gram-negative bacteria (carbapenem) is implemented， which then is modified according to antibiograms. A type of vascular access should also be considered during the course of treatment： in case of non-tunneled catheters the consideration of risks and benefits from catheter removal is advisable. In case of permanent tunneled catheters a local treatment while keeping a catheter is recommended， if the infection is not caused by pathogens from a Staphylococcus aureus， Pseudomonas aeruginosa， Mycobacterium group. Fungal infections， multi-resistant bacteria， opportunistic microorganisms， IS， immunocompromised patients or valved catheters (Groshong) are considered as not suitable for successful salvage. Infection caused by shall also not be treated通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Case Presentation\n\n【15】A 29-year-old male was urgently admitted to the ward because of a 39℃ fever， abdominal pain and symptoms of dysuria persisting for3 weeks. The patient was permanently parenterally-fed via a tunneled catheter in home settings andpresented with features of malnutrition， atrophy of subcutaneous tissue and BMI删除4:<u> 16</u>. Before admission to the hospital a primary physician administered Sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim which led to a partial improvement in the following symptoms： abdominal pain and dysuria symptoms stopped， while fever without chills persisted.\n\n【16】Medical history was as follows： Crohn’s disease， Perianal fistula with chronic colonization of Klebsiella preumoniae MBL (+)， short bowel syndrome due to multiple extended surgical resections， drug induced liver and bone marrow damage after immunosuppressive treatment， hypertension， and prerenal acute kidney injury. At the admission， 100 mg of azathioprine was administered by oral rout to sustain immunosuppression for several months. On the day of the admission patient's temperature was 37.6°C， blood pressure 103/63mmHg， heart rate of 108 beats per minute with regular heart rate. Patient's general condition was good. Laboratory results： WBC： 9，06K/uL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，0 -10，0\\]</u>； RBC： 2，86 M/uL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，3- 5，9\\]</u>； HGB： 8，7 g/dL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，6-17，2\\]</u>； CRP： 61，42 mg/1通用删除6(英):<u>\\[0，00-10，00\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The chest X-rayand abdominal ultrasonography has not revealed any important abnormality. Patient with normal peristalsis and stoma output in the left mid-abdominal region， with two fistulas on the right side and no abdominal signs. A Broviac catheter on the right side of the chest， the area around the exit of the catheter was normal.\n\n【18】Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) was administered into the peripheral venous catheter. Nil per os was recommended. Empiric antibiotic therapy was implemented： vancomycin 2 × 1.0 g i.v.， imipenem+cilastatine 3×0.5 g i.v. On the following day， patient's body temperature was normalized and pain regressed. Blood for culture from permanent catheter revealed Leuconostoc mesenteroides.\n\nDespite the opportunistic character of infection and poor immunological patient's status， an attempt to heal the central line was|删除段之间换行|taken. By the tenth day of hospitalization ampicillin was administered according to the antibiogram 4×0.5 g i.v. (for 7 days). Catheter lock with 1.5 ml of 90% alcohol (for 4 following days) was applied.\n\n【20】On day 13 catheter lock of Clindamycin 150 mg for the following4 days was administered via VCS according to an antibiogram while continuing the previous systemic antibiotic therapy. At the end of the treatment a peripheral blood and central catheter cultures confirmed successful treatment and catheter salvage. A nutrition mixture was administered to the central line wan was uneventful. On the 18h day of hospitalization the patient was discharged. In the control test 8weeks and 3 months later no recurrence of infection was found.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】The reported case comes from the largest parenteral home-feeding centre in Poland， the member of a Polish Network of intestinal insufficiency treatment. Annually about 340-356 patient are fed parenterally. A diligent training program on using a central venous catheter for patients and families resulted in the fixed number of incidence of infections at a rate of 0.45 incidents per 1000 catheter days. The authors in Winkler’s work presented prevalence of blood infections linked with the use of a central line in parenterally-fed patients (CRBSI) at the rate of 0.38-4.58 incidence per 1000 catheter days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Other reports oscillate in the rate of 0.34 and 2.68 incidence per 1000 catheter days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. Average frequency of CRBSI in Europe is 1.5 to 2 incidents per 1000 catheter days. Longer time of catheterization causes a higher risk of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Recommended antibiotics used for treatment of the Leuconostoc spp. infections are B-lactams. Penicillin and ampicillin are more active than cephalosporins and are used as first line therapy. Carbapenems(e.g. imipenem) are effective， although there is a documented incident resistance to this group of antibiotics in case of a patient with postoperative meningitis. Leuconostoc spp. bacteria is also susceptible to Clindamycin， Tobramycin， Erythromycin， Minocycline with variable susceptibility for Quinolones， Cephalosporins and Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，16\\]</u>.\n\n【24】These microbes are characterizedbyself-resistance to glycopeptides such as Vancomycin (VCM) because of modified peptidoglycan precursor’s production. Modifiedprecursors are characterized by reduced affinity for vancomycin.\n\n【25】In the presented case antibiogram suggested susceptibility of Leuconostoc mesenteroides to 3 antibiotics： Ampicillin， Meropenem and Vancomycin. Ampicillin was introduced； because literature suggests that in-vivo resistance for two other antibiotics may appear. During the targeted therapy， when choosing an antibiotic， the penetration capacity of the infection site， proper dose and the route of administration was considered as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【26】There are only a few cases of Lecunostoc spp. bacteremia described in literature. Ho et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> describe the case of female patient with squamous cell carcinoma and sepsis was successfully treated with antibiotic therapy and central line was maintained. Due to initial blood cultures revealing Gram-positive cocci empiric antibiotic therapy was administered (vancomycin and piperacillin with tazobactam). According to antibiogram antibiotics were changed to ampicillin 2 g i.v. every 6 h. After 2-week treatment blood culture results came out negative删除4:<u> 18</u>.\n\nIshiyama et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> presented a case of a female patient with myeloblastic leukemia who developed moderate fever during|删除段之间换行|chemotherapy. In the blood culture Gram-positive cocci were found and vancomycin was implemented. Having proven that it was Leuconostoc bacteria， VCM was ceased. On the basis of medicine susceptibility imipenem/cilastatin and gentamicin were implemented. When treatment was not successful and fever went up， gentamicin was changed to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The therapy proved to be effective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【28】In the other case of 26-year-old male patient in who blood culture found Leuconostoc spp. a result of antibiogram test showed susceptibility to clindamycin， ampicillin， gentamicin and penicillin. He was successfully treated with clindamycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Another publication presents the case of a patient with a 38.8℃fever. Leuconostoc mesentroides bacteria susceptible to penicillin and aminoglycoside were isolated from peripheral blood. For 6 days the treatment included ampicillin (6 g/day i.v.)， then it was switched to amoxicillin (3 g/ per os.). Decrease in fever was reported. Blood control results came out negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【30】In another publication presented by Huber et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> a male with lung mycobacteriosis， parenterally-fed via central line， was diagnosed with Leuconostoc bacteria susceptible to： Penicillin， Ampicillin， Imipenem， Erythromycin， Clindamycin， and Gentamicin and resistant to Vancomycin found in a blood culture from the tip of a catheter. The catheter was removed which led to the reduction of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n\n【32】Although L. mesenteroides is an opportunistic pathogen， it was successfullytreated with catheter salvage. It is feasible to treat catheters even with pathogens considered to be at high risk of treatment failure. To the attempt for treatment with catheter preservation， good condition and close monitoring of the patient is mandatory.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Type 3 CPAMs are characterized by small hyperechogenic cysts (<5 mm). Hydrops often develops secondarily， and the fetal survival rate is approximately 5% in this setting.\n\n【2】Case Report： We present a case of a large type 3 CPAM complicated by fetal hydrops. The lesion was detected at 19 Gestational Weeks (GW) and confirmed by fetal MRI at 29 GW. At 22 GW， a course of maternal steroids was given as a possible treatment of type 3 CPAM. Peritoneal-amniotic shunt was placed twice to reduce fetal ascites， with unsatisfactory results. Similarly，polyhydramnios was relieved by two amnioreductions， but redeveloped soon after. A baby girl was delivered spontaneously at 33 GW， and received a two-stage partial lobectomy in the first three months of life. She now approaches one year of age， with near-to-normal growth and developmental milestones.\n\n【3】Discussion： The survival of this in fant can be attributed toprenatal management， accurate diagnostic imaging， and early postnatal surgical intervention. Her outcome is unexpectedly positive and she may expect a good quality of life. Multidisciplinary vigilance and collaboration with frequent specialist follow ups was the key to success for both mother and child.\n\n【4】Keywords： CPAM；CVR； Peritoneal-amniotic shunt； Polyhydramnios； Fetal hydrops\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformations (CPAMs) are the most common Congenital Lung Malformations (CLMs). With a prevalence of 1/11，000 to 1/33，000 live births， they are rare overall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Twenty-five to 30% of neonates with antenatally-diagnosed CPAMs will present with respiratory distress and infection， and perinatal mortality may reach 50%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Furthermore， the development of fetal hydrops is a devastating complication that is associated with <5% survival通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. With improvements in the quality of fetal Ultrasonography (US)， CPAMs are increasingly detected in the prenatal period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>，leading to the evolution of management strategies that continue to improve peri- and postnatal prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 23-year-old primigravida presented at the clinic in April删除4:<u> 2020</u>. Her routine US at 19Gestational Weeks (GW) revealed a fetus with ascites and a large hyperechogenic， homogenous lesion (5.25 cm x3.58 cm) that occupied the left lung. The contralateral lung was hypoplastic(1.0 cm x 1.5 cm) and extreme cardiac dextroposition was visualized. Fetal US revealed typical features of type 3 CPAM . Routine screening for cytomegalovirus， toxoplasmosis， rubella， and parvovirus B19 was negative. Intrauterine paracentesis was performed and 80 mL of fetal peritoneal fluid was aspirated. Amniocentesis revealed a normal karyotype (46， XX). At 22GW， due to the re-accumulation of peritoneal fluid， 80 mL was drained in a second fetal paracentesis. A course of steroids (Dexamethasone 4 mg x6 mg) was given as a possible treatment of type 3CPAM. The ultrasonographic presentation of CPAM did not change and there were no signs of fetal heart failure. The CPAM-Volume Ratio (CVR) was 3.02. At 25GW， due to increasing ascites， a peritoneal-amniotic shunt was placed twice but was displaced both times， and the effect was thus unsatisfactory. At the same time， polyhydramnios was detected (Amniotic Fluid Index \\[AFI\\]33cm) and amnioreduction (2000 mL) was performed. At 28 GW， the patient was readmitted.\n\n【9】Fetal hydrops was diagnosed at this time with the presence of ascites， mild hydrothorax and subcutaneous edema . There were no signs of fetal heart insufficiency. A second amnioreduction (2000mL) was also performed， but polyhydramnios redeveloped soon after(AFI 36 cm). Fetal MRI was performed at 29 GW to confirm the diagnosis of type 3 CPAM. At 33 GW， soon after premature rupture of membranes， the patient naturally delivered a baby girl (2，814 g， Apgar 2，6，6).\n\nThe baby presented with respiratory distress and was placed immediately on invasive oscillatory ventilation. Generalpoor condition with oxygen delivery 1.0-0.4 necessitated total parenteral nutrition. Later， poor sucking and swallowing - attributed to the displacement of the diaphragm and aberrant thoracic anatomy -justified PEG placement. Plain film radiography and Computed Tomography (CT) were obtained . CT confirmed the absence of arterial systemic feeding vessels and she was qualified for two-stage partial left lobectomy. The first surgery was performed on day 14， removing the lower 45% of the left upper lobe . The baby girl demonstrated significant desaturations， and it was necessary|删除段之间换行|to balance the challenging ventilation of a cystic and noncompliant upper left lobe， an atelectatic lower left lobe， and a hypoplastic right lung. The second surgery was performed after two months to remove necrotic portions of the left upper lobe. Plain films from February 2021 revealed significant anatomic improvement . Histopathology of the excised tissue confirmed CPAM Stocker type 2 (cysts <2 cm). At the time of writing， the baby has achieved her first year of life. Her developmental milestones are delayed by approximately 3 months， attributed to poor abdominal tone， leading to difficulties with crawling and sitting. Tracheostomy and the use of a ventilator have also caused speech delay.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Natural history of CPAMS\n\nTypically， CPAMs peak in size at 28 GW to 30 GW 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Spontaneous prenatal regression occurs in approximately 8% to49% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> during the third trimester. The size of our lesion remained generally stable， measuring 5.25 cmx3.58 cm at 23 GW and 5.84cm x 4.44 cm at 31 GW. Approximately 15% of CPAMs regress after birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，9\\]</u>. Fetal clinical presentation varies according to lesion size， and affected fetuses may suffer from hydrops， polyhydramnios， and fetal death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Large symptomatic lesions are associated with high in|删除段之间换行|utero mortality. Because of the potential for dynamic growth， serial US assessment throughout pregnancy is the standard of care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The CVR was developed as a predictive marker for life-threatening complications， and is determined by ultrasonographic assessment of lesion volume to head circumference. CVR ≥ 1.6 was shown to be highly predictive of fetal hydrops 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>； however， there is no international consensus of CVR thresholds for the prediction of fetal/neonatal outcomes， and its utility should be established in further studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The CVR of 3.02 in our patient suggested a significant risk of respiratory distress within 24 h of birth， and is associated with the need for surgical intervention within 2 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Diagnosis and radiologic imaging\n\n【15】CPAMs occur sporadically， with no known genetic or maternal risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. CPAMs have been reported in the setting of other congenital malformationssuchas diaphragmaticherniaandcongenital heart disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>， and a recent case of CPAM was diagnosed in a fetus with mosaic Kleinfelter syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Traditionally， CPAMs are classified using the Stocker criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Based on radiologic and pathologic data such as cyst size and wall thickness， CPAMs are differentiated into 5 subtypes， with type 1 (large cysts， 2 cm to 10 cm) and type 2 (small cysts， <2 cm) occurring with greater frequency. However it is clinically more useful in the antenatal period to apply ultrasonographic criteria， with Adzick et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> differentiating CPAMs into macrocystic (>5 mm) and microcystic (solid， echogenic masses)lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>. As the number of successful in utero resections increases， alternate classifications have been proposed to address the apparent histologic variability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In fetal US， a CPAM appears as an obstructive lung mass， first suspected in routine imaging at 16 to20GW 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. US is usually sufficient to confirm prenatal diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Furthermore， US is the main modality for the assessment of hydrops， thus also has high prognostic value. However， CPAMs may be hard to distinguish from other CLMs， and many lung lesions on fetal US may cause mediastinal shift， diaphragmatic eversion， and fetal hydrops通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The sensitive detection of systemic feeding vessels is also low 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Prenatal MRI was shown by Pacharn et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> to accurately reflect postnatal imaging and pathological findings in 98% of cases， and thus is increasingly implemented as part of the diagnostic work-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Furthermore， the clarity of MR imaging is not limited by maternal body habitus， amniotic fluid volume， or fetal positioning. Due to the rarity oftype 3 CPAM， a prenatal MRI was obtained from our patient to rule out bronchial atresia. CT has the highest diagnostic specificity and is the gold standard for postnatal detection of CPAMs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. The baby received a CT on day 3 as part of preoperative counseling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>，and a control CT was also performed between the two stages of the partial lobectomy. In a single patient report， Chon et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> successfully utilized fetal tracheobronchoscopy for both CPAM diagnosis and therapeutic disimpaction of bronchial debris. This invasive procedure is not without substantial risks to the fetus， and very few cases utilizing fetal tracheobronchoscopy have been published 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21，24-26\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Treatment strategies\n\nIn CPAM types 1 and 2， treatment can be initiated in utero， and these include the placement of peritoneal-amniotic shunts and cyst aspirations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In contrast， type 3 CPAMs invariably requires surgical resection. Fetal surgery is a high-risk procedure that is attempted in only select institutions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，27\\]</u>； morbidity and mortality are high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， with studies documenting a 50% survival rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.Open fetal surgery is not performed at our specialist center. Type 3 CPAM in our patient led us to take conservative measures. A peritoneal-amniotic shunt was placed twice to reduce fetal ascites， though the|删除段之间换行|results were unsatisfactory. A course of maternal steroids was given at 22 GW. Other than stimulating the growth of the hypoplastic right lung， steroids have been shown to significantly increase fetal survival by reducing the size of microcystic (but not macrocystic) CPAMs(CVR>1.6)， which may lead to the resolution of hydrops 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，28\\]</u>. The pharmacomechanism of steroids on CPAMs is unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> and steroid-prescribing practices among obstetricians vary widely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In our patient， the therapeutic effect of steroids was only minimal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Postnatal care\n\n【19】Surgical resection is the standard of care for symptomatic neonates in order to prevent lung infections， allow for compensatory lung growth and reduce future complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，29\\]</u>. The prognosis after surgery appears to be good 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Ben-Ishay et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> performed life-saving pneumonectomies for a series of giant CPAMs， but lobectomy via thoracoscope (including video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) or thoracotomy remains the most prevalent surgical method通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. In our baby girl， respiratory distress and desaturation prompted immediate surgical qualification for a partial lobectomy. The first surgery was performed on day删除4:<u> 14</u>. Despite the initial plan to remove the tumor in its entirety，during the procedure it became clear that the cystic lobe did contain viable lung tissue； the closure of the left upper lobe bronchi led to significant desaturation. Thus， only the lower 45%of the left upper lobe could be safely removed. The problem of the restricted thoracic volume (for the lungs and heart to grow and return to anatomic position) remained. Ventilation between the two stages was a significant challenge for neonatal intensivists. The only way to avoid severe barotrauma was to place our patient on oscillatory ventilation with deep sedation and use of paralytic agents. There are no neonatological guidelines dictating thelong-term use ofventilation and sedation in such a unique situation. This strategy appeared to be effective， and it was possible to reduce oxygen delivery from 100% to40% during this period. The baby completed her two-stage procedure in 2 months. Because of the large size of the CPAM， the anatomic improvement was immediately appreciable . As a result， her growth and developmental milestones are only slightly delayed. She is followed up frequently in specialist centers including otolaryngology， physiotherapy and speech therapy.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】Type 3 CPAMs complicated by fetal hydrops are associated with high perinatal mortality. Antenatal interventions are typically ineffective. The CVR of 3.02 was a significant predictor of neonatal respiratory distress and prompted the consideration of early surgical intervention. Partial lobectomy allowed for the compensatory growth of healthy lung tissue. Baby's positive outcome can be attributed to prenatal management and early postnatal surgical intervention； furthermore， she may expect a good quality of life. Multidisciplinary vigilance and collaboration with frequent specialist follow ups was the key to success for both mother and child.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Hypercalcemia in RBD is a relatively rare finding， with very few cases reported. Hypercalcemia is likely explained by systemic release of calcium phosphate salts deposited in the muscle following injury. Hypercalcemia can be very severe and symptomatic - as in present case and needs management on an urgent basis-especiallyto prevent arrhythmias and sudden death.

Electrolytes were sequentially followed - except for serum calcium levels， other electrolytes were normal. There was mild hypokalemia during polyuric phase， which was corrected with oral potassium chloride. Initially there was mild hypocalcemia with S. Calcium of 7.7 mg/dl. By day 10， it was within normal limits9.7 mg/dl. As polyuric phase of AKI progressed， patient began to develop hypercalcemia with S. Calcium reaching a level of 15 mg/dl by day 15， urine output at this time was about 3 liters per day. Serum phosphate levels were normal at 3.8 mg/dl. Intact parathormone levels were appropriately suppressed at this time with value of 17 units/ml.25-Hydroxy Vitamin D was mildly low at 25 ng/ml. Both these reports ruled out possibility of primary hyperparathyroidism or hypervitaminosis D- which as such- was also expected to be the case， as calcium levels were mildly low at the beginning. Considering that the event was quite acute， malignancy also seemed less likely a possibility. Still， workup for multiple myeloma was done -which was negative. CT scan of thorax did not reveal prominent lymphadenopathy or mass lesion in thorax. Ultrasound examination of Whole Abdomen was also normal. One cycle of hemodialysis was done again on day 15 in view of severe symptomatic hypercalcemia and subcutaneous calcitonin and loop diuretics were given， which helped bring back calcium to a level of 10.7 mg/dl on discharge.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is seen in 15% to 50% of cases following Rhabdomyolysis (RBD).\n\n【10】Table 1： Various laboratory parameters and their course during indoor stay.\n\n| Parameters  | S.

Physiologically， ionized calcium levels in sarcoplasm are 10，000times lower than serum ionized calcium， and this is maintained by Ca-ATPase pump in sarcoplasmic reticulum and 2 Na/Ca exchanger on sarcolemma. Both these are energy intensive processes needing ATP for Ca mobilization. In RBD - muscle necrosis/ischemia leads to loss of ATP leading to increased cytosolic calcium in muscle， which triggers activation of cytosolic proteases that denatures muscle proteins and cell membrane leading to release of intracellular phosphate， potassium， myoglobin， creatinine and creatinine kinase通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>.\n\n【14】AKI is likely due to release of these myoglobin's that precipitate in glomerular tubules and form casts that obstruct tubular lumen. Myoglobin also causes direct toxic effect on tubular epithelium， causing tubular necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.RBD damages cell membrane of muscles and loss of Na/K ATPase pump-leading to increased permeability to fluids. Shift of large amount of sodium and intravascular fluid leads to muscle edema - which in severe cases can lead to Compartment Syndrome. This further leads to muscle ischemia - worsening the ongoing RBD. Depletion of intravascular volume is another factor leading to AKI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\nAfter RBD， initially there is hypocalcemia during oliguric phase of AKI. This is due to calcium chelation by the released intracellular phosphate. Normally， 85% phosphate is in bones and teeth， 14% is present intracellularly and about 1% is in extracellular fluid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. RBD leads to release of large amount of phosphate which forms chelation salt with calcium and gets deposited locally leading to hypocalcemia. During the recovery phase of AKI， these sequestered salts are released back into the systemic circulation. This probably leads to hypercalcemia during polyuric phase. Case reports by Akmal and Bisop 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> as well as by Zerr and Durand 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> suggests elevated levels of Vitamin D， probably due to its extra renal production， and|删除段之间换行|poor regulation in its synthesis by kidneys， as likely explanation of hypercalcemia.\n\n【16】Overall， very few cases have been reported with hypercalcemia following RBD and AKI. One of the studies by Olazo and Dolores in 2012 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， as well as another study review by Lisa and Ali Sadjadi通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， suggested that only about 60 published cases of hypercalcemia following RBD were found till date since删除4:<u> 1970</u>.

But the present case shows that falling creatinine levels and risingurine output is not the end game. Vigilant monitoring of electrolytes and prompt intervention - especially during polyuric phase - is ofutmost importance. It also shows that - hypercalcemia in such a clinical context - does not need to be over investigated in the initial 8 to 10 days of polyuric phase.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

RS is a congenital condition occurring in approximately1 in 5600-8000 live births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. Recently， an international consensus was achieved regarding the three distinguishing characteristics (micrognathia， glossoptosis， and upper airway obstruction) that should be included in the diagnosis of RS in newborns.

Three patients underwent cardiac surgery， were discharged from hospital and MDO after three months of recuperation. One patient underwent cardiac surgery 20 dayslater， followed by MDO. One patient underwent cardiac surgery， three days later， was given up treatment. Five patients underwent cardiac surgery and mandibular distraction at the same day， cardiac surgery first， mandibular distraction second. The patients with PDA were treated by thoracotomy through median thoracotomy. Repair of foramen ovale and ventricular septal defect by cardiopulmonary bypass and thoracotomy. Twenty III grade RS patients without cardiac anomalies were included\n\n【19】Statistical Analysis\n\n【20】Descriptive statistics are presented as mean ± SD and frequency\n\n【21】Outcome Measures\n\n【22】Identification\n\n【23】Identifications of the patient were as in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. The birth weight， gestational weeks and gender of RS patient were similar with or without cardiac malformations， occur to males. And the number of gestation (2.7±1.6) and parturitions (1.6±0.91) was significantly higher than that of the children without cardiac malformations， gestation (1.7 ± 0.5)， parturitions (1.3±0.3). Pulmonary arterial hypertension was found in all children with cardiac malformation.\n\n【24】Clinical outcome\n\n【25】Hospitalization time and ventilator use time in RS patients without cardiac malformation (33.36 ± 18.71)，(7.18±1.47) was similar as in group of MDO and cardiac surgery at the same time， (27±6.7)，(6±2.19)，respectively.\n\nHospitalization time and ventilator use time for separate|删除段之间换行|operations was significantly longer than that for both operations. Patient 10 was hospitalized for 102 days， which was related to the duration of non-invasive ventilation and postural therapy. Patient 4was difficulty in evacuation of breath machine after heart operation for 20 days， then MDO was operated， the breath machine was withdrawn smoothly after 4 days. Average ventilator-carried time was6.8 days in simultaneous operation group； it is 17.3 days in the other group. After matching the two groups of patients， two patients were select； children underwent both operations at the same time gained more weight.\n\n【27】Discussion\n\n【28】Cardiac anomalies is a difficult problem in neonates with RS， mortality rate is high. The RS patients were dyspnea， feeding difficulties， with cardiac abnormalities caused by cardiac dysfunction， aggravating hypoxia， poor nutrition， increased surgical risk. It is difficult to make the decision which surgery was first. Cardiac surgery was performed first， prolonged ventilatory assist time； even it makes difficulties to evacuate the ventilator. However， if MDO first， the patient is at high risk， because of the unstable circulation. In our hospital， cardiac surgery and MDO were performed in the same day， cardiac surgery first， MDO second， average ventilator-carried time and hospitalization time was shorten， and the patient gained more weight.\n\n【29】Mortality rate was high in children untreated PAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In RS patient， VSD with left ventricular to right atrial shunt， blood enters the right ventricle， increased blood to the lungs leads to increased pulmonary arterial pressure. The ratio of right to left shunt in patients with PAH is not low. The foramen ovale were reopened by most of the intracardiac shunts， and PDA aggravating hypoxia， hypoxia causes pulmonary artery contraction， influence pulmonary gas exchange aggravates PAH and hypoxia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In healthy people exposed to hypoxia， the potential arteriovenous branch in the lungs can be reopened. Therefore， it can be alleviates PAH to compensate for pulmonary vascular resistance， but aggravated hypoxia. RS patient suffered from hypoxia due to upper airway obstruction， potential arteriovenous branch maybe reopened， aggravated hypoxia. 71.4% of RS patients who died had cardiac disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Therefore， attention should be paid to PAH during the treatment.\n\n【30】So breaking hypoxia is the key to treat RS patients with cardiac malformation. In our department， nutritional support and oxygen inhalation were given several days before operation， improves internal environment. Cardiac surgery and MDO operated were performed on the same day， upper airway obstruction and cardiac structural abnormalities due to hypoxia， can simultaneously treated， RS patients gain the more weight， shorten the mechanical ventilation period as well as the hospital length of stay.\n\n【31】It is a safe and feasible way for neonatal RS patients to do cardiac surgeryand MDO on the same day. In the future， we will study this in a larger sample to evaluate safety and explore complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Up to May 7h，2020， the number of globally confirmed cases has reached 3，634，450， and the number of mortality cases has reached删除4:<u> 258，359</u>. Many studies are focusing on COVID-19 and associated morbidity in special populations. Chen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> reported the clinical characteristics of 9 laboratory-confirmed pregnant women with COVID-19 and the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission， which was published in The Lancet. Jin et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> also reported the clinical features of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients after infection with COVID-19. However， there have been few reports of COVID-19 in children.

COVID-19 was confirmed according to the diagnosis and treatment criteria for new coronavirus pneumonia， which was issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (the Fourth Edition， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> the Fifth Edition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>). Based on the quantitative analysis of respiratory tract specimens through Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)， both children with COVID-19 were tested positive for new Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The study was reviewed and approved by the medical ethics committee of Gansu maternal and child health care hospital (approval number 2020GSFY-3)，and the written informed consent was obtained from each patient's legal guardian.\n\n【20】Data collection\n\n【21】Theepidemiological data， medical records，laboratory examinations， and chest CT scans of the two infected children were traced and collected with a pre-designed data collection table. The data were collected independently and were cross-checked by two investigators (YW and JW). Researchers from the third party (LZU) have reviewed the data in case of any discordance. According to the WHO guidelines for qRT-PCR analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>， the throat swab specimens of the 2 children were collected， and SARS-.S} CoV-2 was tested using the kit (BioGerm， Shanghai， China)， which was recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All specimens were processed at the municipal CDC and the provincial CDC at the same time， and COVID-19infection was confirmed when the test results from both laboratories were positive.\n\n【22】Statistical analysis\n\n【23】Since only two children were involved， statistical analyses and software were not utilized in this study. Continuous variables and subtype variables presented the actual data.\n\n【24】Role of the funding source\n\n【25】The sponsors were not involved in research design， data collection， data analysis， and report writing. The corresponding author is responsible for all aspects of the study to ensure the proper investigation and resolution of the research for problems related to accuracy or completeness. The final version was approved by all authors.\n\n【26】Results Epidemiological history\n\n【27】Child 1 was a female patient with 1 year and 8 months of age， who lived in the Wuchang District of Wuhan City， Hubei province. Her father was a COVID-19 infected patient. He lived together with child 1 and her mother before the diagnosis (January 284h). Child 1was diagnosed on January 29h， and her mother was diagnosed on February 84h . On the other hand， child 2 was a female patient with 11 months of age， who lived in Shapingba District of Chongqing city. Her aunt and uncle were infected with COVID-19， who had close contact history with child 2 before diagnosis (February3d and February 7h). Child 2 was diagnosed on February 84， and her mother was diagnosed on February 9h .\n\n【28】Clinical and laboratory characteristics\n\nThe two children had no underlying diseases， and both had a history of contact with infected people. The clinical manifestations were not of the severe type. Child 1 presented with low-grade fever as|删除段之间换行|the main presenting symptom (36.7Cto38.0°C)， while child 2 mainly presented with diarrhea. When admitted to the hospital，both children were in good mental condition， with normal thoracic cage， regular respiratory rhythm， normal intercostal space， and without chest wall tenderness or percussed pain in the sternum. Both children showed symmetric breasts， and no package block was touched. The chest breathings were observed with symmetric respiratory movement. There were no obvious abnormalities in the intercostal spaces. The vocal fremitus was normal， and neither pleural friction nor skin twisting sensation was found by touching. Bilateral lung percussion revealed a clear voice， and the sounds of bilateral lung breathing were clear， without dry or wet rales. The pleural frictions were unheard，and no significant abnormality was found regarding voice conduction. Both abdominal and nervous system examinations were normal. The detection result of laboratory tests showed that child1 had a higher level of AST， suggesting that the liver function might have been affected. The White Blood Cell (WBC) count in child 2was increased， which might be related to viral infection. No abnormal observations were found except for the aforementioned observations. Imaging findings revealed the typical characteristics of pneumonia in the chest CT scans of both children . The lung markings became thickened and distributed disorderly. Patchy and ground glass shadows were observed on the chest wall outside the lower lung.\n\n【30】Therapies and outcomes\n\n【31】Child 11 was evaluated as a mild COVID-19 case. After admission， she was given 2 mL lopinavir/ritonavir orally， twice a day. She also inhaled 250 g atomized interferon twice a day. The enteric microecological preparations were given orally with other symptomatic treatments. Symptoms disappeared after 9 days of treatment， and the results of two successive (February 6h and February 8h) SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests of throat swabs were both negative. On February 104， child 1 was discharged from the hospital for medical observation. No recurrence or sequela occurred during the 14-day observation. Child 2 was assessed as the common type. After admission， she was given 100 mg potassium sodium dehydroandrographolide succinate through an intravenous drip， once a day. She also inhaled 20 ugs atomized interferon twice a day with lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (Kaletra) and intestinal microecological regulation. Symptoms disappeared after 6 days of treatment， and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests of throat swabs were negative for two consecutive times (February 16h and February 164). Eventually， child 2 was discharged from the hospital for medical observation on February 17h. No recurrence or sequela occurred during the 14-day observation.\n\n【32】Discussion\n\nThe clinical data of two cases of COVID-19 pneumonia under2 years of age， who were diagnosed by throat swabs SARS-CoV-2nucleic acid tests， were reported. The symptoms of both children were not typical. Child 1 had a low-grade fever， while child 2presented with diarrhea. The common symptoms in adults such as dyspnea and cough were not found during the disease course in our population. The results of the laboratory examination indicated that the lymphocyte count of both children was normal， which was different from the previous report that a progressive reduction in peripheral blood lymphocytes was found in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. According to a recent report， this may be related to the incomplete development of children's innate immunityand the low level of the adaptive immune|删除段之间换行|response. Thus， most child cases showed mild clinical symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. From the epidemiological data of the two children， it could be seen that children are also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Close contact with infected family members is the main way for children to get infected with COVID-19，which was similar to the main mode oftransmission in cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS) in children， as demonstrated in previous reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>. The report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 points out that the age distribution of COVID-19 ranges from 2 days to 100 years|删除段之间换行|of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， indicating that SARS-CoV-2 has a strong transmission capability in children. However， since the symptoms of children are not obvious， it is easy to cause missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. Therefore， it is necessary to combine epidemiological investigation with the diagnosis. In terms oftreatment， children were administered atomized interferon inhalation， oral treatment of Kaletra， as well as potassium sodium dehydroandrographolide succinate. Currently， no specific and effective antiviral drugs have been available for the new coronavirus infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， and thus， the elimination of the virus depends mainly on the antiviral immune function in human bodies.\n\n【34】Table 1： Clinical and laboratory characteristics.\n\n|  | Child 1  | Child 2  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Clinical characteristics  |  |  |\n| Date of admission  | Jan 29  | Feb 8  |\n| Age (Months)  | 20  | 11  |\n| Epidemiological history  | Yes (contact withinfected person)  | Yes (contact with infected person)  |\n| Other family members affected  | Yes (parents)  | Yes (mother)  |\n| Complications  | None  | None  |\n| Signs and symptoms  |  |  |\n| Fever on admission  | Yes  | No  |\n| Myalgia  | No  | No  |\n| Malaise  | No  | No  |\n| Rigor  | No  | No  |\n| Cough  | No  | No  |\n| Dyspnea  | No  | No  |\n| Sore throat  | No  | No  |\n| Diarrhea  | No  | Yes  |\n| Chest pain  | No  | No  |\n| Laboratory characteristics  |  |  |\n| White blood cell count (x 10° cells per L)  | 6.1  | 9.72  |\n| Low or normal leukocyte count (<9-5x10°cells per L)  | Yes  | No  |\n| Lymphocyte count (x 10° cells per L)  | 3.7  | 7.62  |\n| Lymphopenia (<10° cells per L)  | No  | No  |\n| C-reactive protein concentration (mg/L)  | 4  | 3.5  |\n| Elevated C-reactive protein (>10 mg/L)  | No  | No  |\n| Elevated ALT (>45 U/L) or AST (>35 U/L)  | Yes  | No  |\n| ALT(U/L)  | 10  | 21  |\n| AST(U/L)  | 44  | 35  |\n| Confirmatory test done (SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR)  | Yes  | Yes  |\n| CT evidence of pneumonia  |  |  |\n| Typical signs of viral infection  | Yes  | Yes  |\n\n【36】Typical signs of viral infection\n\nALT： Alanine Transaminase； AST： Aspartate Transaminase；COVID-19：2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease.

According to the diagnosis and treatment plan of COVID-19 通用删除1(英):<u>(trial version 6)</u>， which was issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， Kaletra was recommended for COVID-19 therapy.

Some treatment recommendations and guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17-20\\]</u> suggested that pediatric patients should mainly receive symptomatic treatment for upper respiratory tract infection， together with strengthened nursing care. This study described theepidemiological history，clinical characteristics， therapeutic management， and treatment outcomes of children with COVID-19 in detail. This study adds a significant reference value for the prevention and treatment of infected children with COVID-19. However， the findings of our study are significantly limited by the|删除段之间换行|small number of recruited children， and thus， it was difficult to reflect the overall situation of children patients with COVID-19. The detailed epidemiology， clinical features， treatment regimens， and the transmission of asymptomatic and mild infectious patients in different age groups should be further studied and recognized.\n\n【38】Conclusion\n\n【39】Children are susceptible group to SARS-CoV-2. Close contact with family members is the main route for infection in children. The symptoms of COVID-19 children under two years of age might be not as typical as those in adults. No reduction in lymphocyte count was observed. Although this conclusion is limited by the small sample size， it provides a significant reference value for understanding the clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19 as well as preventing and controlling COVID-19.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In this case study we describe two men， case1 and case 2， working in three office rooms close to base stations. After the deployment of 5G， both men developed symptoms typical for the microwave syndrome， e.g.， headache， tinnitus， dizziness， balance disorder， concentration and attention deficiency， and fatigue. Radiofrequency Radiation(RFR) after the 5G deployment was measured in the three offices. In office one maximum (peak) RFR during one minute varied from 463 to 1，180，000 uW/m， in office two from 6，230 to 501，000and in office three from 13，700 to 613，000uW/m. The symptoms disappeared in both men within a couple of weeks (case 1) or immediately (case 2) after leaving the office for other offices with much lower maximum peak RFR emissions， maximum for case 1 =16 and for case 2=2，920uW/m. This case report may be regarded as a provocation study on health from 5G RFR. The clinical picture in both men was clearly related to the exposure， although the exposures were well below the guidelines recommended by ICNIRP that are claimed to protect against all health effects. We conclude that the guidelines for RFR exposure based only on tissue heating by ICNIRP are inadequate to protect human health and that 5G appears to provoke symptoms of microwave syndrome in previously healthy people.\n\n【2】Keywords： Base station； 5G； Radiofrequency radiation； Electromagnetic hypersensitivity； Microwave syndrome； Health\n\n【3】Introduction\n\nGuidelines for exposure to Radiofrequency Radiation (RFR)， also called microwaves， from ICNIRP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and the FCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> are based on outdated assumptions that ignore current scientific evidence on health effects. Tissue heating within very short exposure time is the only accepted basis for these guidelines. Thereby these guidelines do not protect against numerous non-thermal health effects observed for RFR exposure at non-thermal levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Microwaves are frequencies in the range of 300 MHz to 300 GHz and it is within this range of frequencies that modern wireless technologies for instance 3G， 4G， 5G and Wi-Fi operate. People may react to RFR with e.g.， insomnia， heart palpitations，tinnitus，skin disorders，headache，and neurologicalsymptoms at exposure levels clearly below the guidelines suggested by ICNIRP and FCC. The terms microwave syndrome， microwave illness，radiofrequency sickness or Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EHS) have been attributed to these health effects. The symptoms develop at levels of RFR exposure well below the guidelines from ICNIRP，and are alleviated by elimination of or reduced exposure， but may in some cases persist to some degree. Individuals suffering from EHS react with health symptoms already at very low non- tVehermal exposure levels to RF-radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The symptoms of microwave syndrome or illness were described already in the 1960's by researchers in East European Countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> as a consequence of long-term occupational exposure to microwaves/RFR. These non-thermal effects depend primarily on the modulation and/or pulsation of the signal and also on the peak and average intensity of the RFR. The symptoms decline and may disappear completely after exposure has ceased and may after a few days to several weeks have disappeared completely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Recently we published a case report on two persons， who developed the microwave syndrome after installation of base station for 5G on the roof just above their apartment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Due to the severity of the symptoms caused bythe sharp increase in non-thermal levels of microwaves from the 5G base station， the couple had to move to|删除段之间换行|another accommodation with low radiation whereby most of their symptoms quickly alleviated. This was a clear case of the microwave syndrome or illness. In this article we describe two cases with a similar medical history after installation of 5G base stations on the roof above their office. They were asked to evaluate prevalence and severity of microwave syndrome symptoms experienced at different places. The list of symptoms is adapted after Belpomme et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Historv\n\n【6】Two men aged 57 and 42 years， respectively， developed symptoms typical of the microwave syndrome shortly after start of exposure to a 5G-base station that was installed and activated in November， 2021on the roof of their office. All symptoms were self-assessed.\n\n【7】Man aged 57， case 1\n\n【8】The man is a director of a small company and an IT and management consultant like the other two men in this case study.He hired the office and used it from May删除4:<u> 2019</u>. At that time a base station for 3G and 4G was already at the same spot on the roof of the building where the new 5G base station was installed in November删除4:<u> 2021</u>. The man worked in the office below the base station without any health issues from May 2019 until November删除4:<u> 2021</u>. His own office room was placed right below the base station， see Figure 1， room number删除4:<u> 1</u>. The man spent verylittle time in this office during the first period after the5G deployment， from November 2021 until end of April 2022， due to his work in other areas. However， from the end of April 2022 he worked full time in the office located below the 5G base station. He also slept overnight in the conference room within the office space next to his own office from May to the end of July 2022， see Figure1， room no删除4:<u> 2</u>. In consequence， during the months of May， June and July 2022， he spent both days and nights close to the 5G base station. Within a couple of weeks， during May， he developed headache. He noticed that the headache disappeared when he left the building but reappeared when he returned.\n\nThe list of symptoms the man experienced over time during his stay in the office room and the conference room below the 5G base station is presented in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. The grading of the symptoms was grade 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (unbearable pain and/or discomfort). As shown in Table 1 the most severe symptoms were headache 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>， arthralgia 通用删除7(英):<u>(10)</u>， tinnitus 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>， concentration and attention deficiency通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>， fatigue 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>， early wake-up 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>， and skin burning 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>. Apart from|删除段之间换行|the symptoms listed in table 1 the man experienced sudden and very sharp pain in the elbows while working and living below the 5G antennas and also pain upon touching the skin with his own hand. The man left the office on August 15，删除4:<u> 2022</u>. Most of his symptoms disappeared after a couple ofweeks after moving to another combined office and apartment in another small town with no 5G base station antenna in proximity. All symptoms had completely disappeared by September 15h， 2022 one and a half month after he left the office. However， arthralgia and headache reappear rather quickly whenever he visits places with high radiation such as in Stockholm city 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-13\\]</u>. He estimates that his sensitivity to RFR has increased after the period when he staved in the office below the 5G base station.\n\n【10】Man aged 42， case 2\n\n【11】The man worked and slept since February 2021 in a combined office/apartment， se Figure 1， room no删除4:<u> 3</u>. Soon after the deployment of the 5G-base station several symptoms appeared that he did not have previously. The list of symptoms he experienced during his stay in the office are presented in Table删除4:<u> 2</u>. He experienced worsened insomnia 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>，tendency of depression 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>，anxiety/panic 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>， emotivity通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>， headache 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>， concentration/attention deficiency 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> and to a lesser extent irritability 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>， tinnitus 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>， dizziness 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>， balance disorder 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>， confusion 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>， and hair loss 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>. Toothache was a major problem (not in list of symptoms). He had a history of very healthy teeth， no amalgam fillings， or any other problems. Further， the man experienced during his stay in the office a light pressure around the whole head. He describes himself as a previously very healthy person who has never had any problems with either his teeth or with headaches. The toothache， the head-pressure， and the tinnitus disappeared immediately when he left the office on December删除4:<u> 204，2021</u>. He moved to a house on the countryside with no 5G or other telecommunication masts in the near vicinity. All symptoms that he had experienced in the office disappeared rapidly. In November 2022he declared himself completely symptom free.\n\n【12】Exposure to radiofrequency radiation (RFR)\n\n【13】All measurements of RFR exposure in the office below the 5G base station were made daytime on June 104， 2022 with the device Safe and Sound and Pro II. It has a true response detection range between 400 MHz and 7.2 GHz. It was calibrated by the manufacturer and has an accuracy of ±6 dB.

They appeared after the deployment of a 5G base station on the roof right above the office and disappeared after the reduction of microwave exposure when the men left the office. The 57-year-old man’s brother visited the office in May 2022 and was invited to stay overnight in the small apartment within the office space  The brother went to bed in the evening but woke up in the middle of the night with a heavy headache. He took an aspirin but the severe headache persisted. He therefore left the office space in the middle of the night and drove out of the town with his car. The headache disappeared within a couple of hours.\n\nThe headache returned when the brother again tried to stay overnight in the apartment one month later in June删除4:<u> 2022</u>. Also， this|删除段之间换行|secondtimehe woke up in the middle ofthe night with severeheadache and also slight nausea. Again， he therefore left the apartment like the first time in the middle of the night and drove out to the countryside. The headache and nausea disappeared after some hours this second time as well. This case study may be regarded as a provocation study of real-life exposure to 5G.\n\n【37】Measurements of microwave radiation were made in the office and the living space of the men after the installation of the 5G base station on the roof. This investigation shows that the 5G base station emitted very high pulses of exposure to microwaves/RFR(maximum1，180，000pW/m) and that 5G seems to be able to massively increase microwave/RFR exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Within short time typical symptoms of the microwave syndrome are triggered， such as headache， sleep disturbances and tinnitus although the levels are well below the guidelines recommended by ICNIRP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. No health issues had appeared with the previous 3G and 4G equipment’s at the same place. Previous measurements showed that deployment of 5G base station in addition to 3G and 4G increased microwaves/RFR peak exposure from 9，000 to 2，500，000 uW/m²通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Nevertheless， the guidelines for exposure to microwaves applied in most countries today are based only on thermal (heating) effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> that allow exposure to be as high as 10，000，000 uW/maveraged over 30 min and 40，000，000 uW/m²local exposure averaged over 6 min 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The limits allow exposure to short peak exposure to be yet much higher， or 1000×10，000，000uW/m. These thermal effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> occur at much higher intensities than those measured in the office that caused ill health effects within a short period of time.\n\n【38】Thus， humans are completely unprotected against all non-thermal effects of real-life exposure to microwaves/RFR from modern technology such as 3G， 4G， 5G. The harmful effects include cancer， DNA damage， oxidative stress， neurological， and other biological effects that may impair health 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The International Commission on the Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Fields 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> concluded that “the assumptions underlying the FCC’s and ICNIRP's exposure limits are invalid and continue to present a public health harm.\"The Commission further points to the fact that 5G is being rolled out without any previous studies on health effects and that 5G creates radiation pulses from “extremely fast data transmission rates”that“have the potential to generate bursts of energy. This case study illustrates these intense bursts of energy. The maximum peak levels varied considerably over time， see Tables删除4:<u> 3-5</u>.\n\n【39】The BioInitative Report suggested already in 2012， a limit for RFR of30uW/m² to 60 uW/m， and even lower for sensitive persons and children， 3 uW/m’to 6uW/m²通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> in order to protect against all known health effects based on the available evidence ten years ago. The EUROPAEM EMF guidelines proposed in 2016 maximum exposure to be 10 pW/m² to 1，000 pW/m’， and lower at nighttime 1uW/m²to 100uW/m， and yet lower for sensitive persons 0.1 uW/m²to 10 pW/m²通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\nIn addition， hundreds of scientists， medical doctors and organizations have called for a revision of the limits for better protection ofhumans and the environment . This study shows that 5G leads to very high microwave exposure with sharp peak pulses， which confirms previous measurements performed after the roll-out of 5G通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Several years before the roll out of 5G， scientists and medical doctors called for a moratorium on the 5G deployment due to the “massive increase of mandatory exposure” to microwaves and the|删除段之间换行|fact that the health hazards of this new technology had not been investigated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>， . In a presentation at the ITU Workshop on 5G， EMF & Health Warsaw， December 5h， 2017， an employee of Ericsson， one of the world's leading 5G infrastructure providers， illustrated that 5G will lead to a substantial increase in RF radiation exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. If 100 times lower limits than ICNIRP's were to be used， i.e.，those applied in countries such as Switzerland，5G roll out would be a “major problem or impossible\". Exclusion zone could be 35 meters below a base station on the roof of a building in cities.\n\n【41】Conclusion\n\n【42】5G is being rolled out without any studies showing that 5G is safe for humans and wildlife. To our knowledge， this is among the first studies of health outcomes in persons exposed to real life 5G microwave radiation. Within few weeks，a new 5G base station caused typical symptoms of the microwave syndrome or radiofrequency sickness in two men working and living in the office below the base station. The deployment of 5G also caused very high maximum(peak) microwave/RFR radiation non-thermal exposure， however far below the ICNIRP guidelines. The symptoms disappeared completely within some weeks after the men moved from the office to dwellings with much lower exposure. This case is in line with scientific findings reported over the last years on effects of exposure to microwave/RFR radiation at non-thermal levels. It also confirms previous findings that most symptoms disappear when the exposure is reduced or discontinued. This study adds to previously available studies that show that the microwave syndrome or illness appears at levels much below the current guidelines recommended by the ICNIRP.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The fenestration of the SVC-RA patch played a role in decompression of SVC to reduce Central Venous Pressure (CVP). Meanwhile， it could be an entrance for stent placement， avoiding needle acupuncture and laser burning. The fenestration of the RA-IVC patch not only introduced the blood flow from the IVC into the RA， but also supported the fixation of the stent.\n\n【3】Results： During the hospitalization， the postoperative blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) of both children maintained above 85% and the CVP remained at 15 mmHg and 14 mmHg， respectively. Long-term follow-up after discharge， these two children were with a good quality of life.\n\n【4】Conclusion： We modified the traditional Glenn treatment.

In order to avoid trauma accumulation， postoperative adhesions， long Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) time and other issues caused by repeated surgeries， the second stage of Total Cavo-Pulmonary Connection (TCPC) is often finished by the use of minimally invasive intervention通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-6\\]</u>. Although Hybrid Fontan surgery holds many advantages， in fact， this method has not been widely adopted yet. This is partly due to the high threshold of intervention. Therefore， we modified the traditional Glenn procedure and carried out two clinical cases successfully.\n\n【9】Surgical Techniques\n\nThe first child was 2 years old and diagnosed with “tricuspid valve atresia， atrial septal defect， ventricular septal defect\". The second child was 2 years old and diagnosed with “pulmonary atresia， ventricular septal defect， patent ductus arteriosus， atrial septal defect\". They were admitted into our|删除段之间换行|hospital in November，2015 and December，2017， respectively.\n\n【11】After obtaining approvals from Shanghai Children’s Medical Center Research Advisory Committee and the consents of parents， we performed the modified Bidirectional Glenn procedure (BDG) on November 10， 2015 and December 11，删除4:<u> 2017</u>. The schematic diagram was shown in Figure 1A， the intubation between ascending aorta and RA was established for CPB after heparinization. The azygos vein was ligated and the aorta was blocked. A small incision in RA was made to expose the SVC-RA and RA-IVC junction. Stitch off SVC-RA junction and RA-IVC junction with two Gore-Tex patches with a thickness of 0.1 mm and a diameter of 20 mm (SVC-RA Gore-Tex patch and RA-IVC Gore-Tex patch). There was a fenestration in the middle of the patch . The fenestration of SVC-RA patch was 2 mm while the fenestrations of RA-IVC patch was 15 mm. Cut off the SVC and anastomose the distal end of SVC in an open fashion to RPA. Disconnect the Main Pulmonary Artery (MPA) and suture both ends.\n\n【12】Results\n\n【13】The postoperative signs were stable and these two children discharged at half a month after surgery. After a long-term follow-up， they have lived very well so far and are preparing for intervention.\n\n【14】The preoperative SaO， were 69% and 71%， respectively. During the hospitalization， the postoperative SaO. were both above 85% and the CVP maintained at 15 mmHg and 14 mmHg， respectively. The cardiac ultrasound examination confirmed the fenestration of SVC-\n\n【15】RA Gore-Tex patch was about 2 mm and the flow velocity across the hole was about 1.4 m/s. During the follow-up， there were no severe complications occurred apart from some restrictive physical activities. The postoperative angiogram was shown in Figure删除4:<u> 2</u>.\n\n【16】Comments\n\n【17】In this study， we modified the traditional BDG and carried out two clinical cases. This modification would not only reduce the threshold of intervention. More importantly， it could also avoid the SVC syndrome to an extent after Glenn procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Since the first introduction in 1971 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， Fontan surgery has led to an overall improvement in postoperative mortality. With a deeper understanding， staged procedures with a transitional BDG can ensure young children to survive through the period with high risks. However， the classically repeated surgical procedure means multiple traumatic injuries， severe postoperative adhesion and prolonged CPB time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. Therefore， with the rapid developments of catheter technology， the combination of intervention and surgical procedures becomes attractive， which is called the hybrid Fontan surgery. In 1995， Konertz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> implemented it in clinical firstly. After 20 years of developments， three styles of hybrid Fontan procedure are gradually established： RA lateral tunnel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>， extra-cardiac conduit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> and hemi-TCPC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5，6，16，17\\]</u>. The postoperative complications of RA lateral tunnel are more than the other two methods due to its larger RA incision. Meanwhile， surgeons have to use a new suitable conduit to replace the original in order to meet the growth of children when adopt extra-cardiac conduit. Therefore， the hemi-TCPC becomes the most popular due to its relatively few complications and simple surgical procedures.\n\n【19】Unlike the previously reported hemi-TCPC， we sew two Gore-Tex patches in the RA to “close”the SVC-RA and RA-IVC junction. The Gore-Tex is composed of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene(ePTFE)， making it hard for cells to adhere， which will relieve the late calcification. At the same time， the Gore-Tex patch with a thickness of0.1 mm owns excellent flexibility. So it can also be easily compressed when the stent is expanded. Laser burning or needle puncturing was required to accomplish the guide of wire or catheter in intervention， both of which had the risks of accidental injury to vascular or atrial wall. Therefore， we set aside a 2 mm fenestration in the SVC-RA Gore-Tex patch. It can not only serve as the entrance for guiding wire or catheter， but also can play a role in decompression to avoid the occurrence of SVC syndrome. In fact， the function of the hole is equivalent to fenestration. Although sacrificing part of SaO。 there is a wealth of evidence that fenestration is beneficial for children over the long term 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18-21\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Previously， it was often necessary to fix the IVC with a ring externally in order to avoid the separation of the stent and IVC \\[221， which would cause the distortion and damage to the venous wall we think. So in this modification， we sutured a Gore-Tex patch with a diameter of 20 mm to the RA-IVC junction. This Gore-Tex patch would act as a fixation during the stent implantation. Meanwhile， the reserved 15 mm opening in the middle of the patch could also facilitate the venous blood to return.\n\n【21】In addition， with regard to the fenestration size of the SVC-RA patch， we set it at 2 mm. This was because we were worried that if the fenestration was too large， it would sacrifice excessive oxygen saturation， resulting in unnecessary cyanosis. It turned out that the postoperative oxygen saturation of both children remained above 85%， which was a satisfactory result 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Theoretically， the reserved fenestration created a right-to-left blood shunt， so there must be a certain correlation between the fenestration size and the decline of oxygen saturation. However， it is regrettable that there is no specific formula for such relation. Currently， we are carrying out hemodynamic analysis to perform precise Glenn fenestration according to different children.\n\n【22】Preserve the antegrade blood can compensate for the negative effect on oxygen saturation of the SVC-RA fenestration. The keep of antegrade blood can significantly increase the blood volume involved in oxygenation， thereby boosting the oxygen saturation. Meanwhile， the antegrade pulmonary blood flow contains some hepatic biochemical agents， which helps prevent the occurrence of small arteriovenous fistula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24，25\\]</u>. Besides， pulsating blood flow also increases the shear force-mediated NO release， thereby reducing the long-term Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26-32\\]</u>. However， fully reserved antegrade bloodstream might increase the PAP and CVP in the short-term， eventually causing severe circulatory disturbance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Therefore， and we plan to keep partial antegrade blood in some favorable cases in the future .\n\n【23】Limitation\n\n【24】Limited to a variety of issues， this modification was only applied to two patients. More cases are needed to provide sufficient clinical data. Secondly， the specific impact of fenestration size of SVC-RA patch and the oxygen saturation should be illustrated by deep hemodynamic analysis. Thirdly， an overall effect on the oxygen saturation of the SVC-RA patch fenestration and the MPA patch fenestration is also needed to analyze to conduct safer and more effective Glenn fenestration.\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\n【26】Through our clinical practice， we modified the traditional Glenn treatment. We believe it is suitable for some favorable patients especially for those with high CVP and can reduce the technical threshold of the intervention.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Most commonly，amebiasis can seed through the portal tract and result in the formation of a liver abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Initial presentation is significant for abdominal pain and hepatomegaly. Diagnosis is made with negative blood cultures but positive amebic serology. On the contrary， pyogenic hepatic abscess (PHA) is a result of bacterial infection stemming from the bloodstream， biliary tract， abdominal cavity， or portal system. It commonly presents as fever， chills， nausea， vomiting， and often， jaundice. Diagnosis is made with positive blood and/or abscess cultures. We report a unique case of a patient with a massive ALA initially presenting as PHA.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 66-year-old Hispanic man was well until he presented with three days of malaise， productive cough， and right flank pain. Initial examination was notable for fever (temperature 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit)， tachycardia， tachypnea， tender hepatomegaly， encephalopathy and jaundice. Blood work was remarkable (sodium 114 mmol/L， bicarbonate 17 mmol/L， alkaline phosphatase 488 U/L， albumin 2.4 g/dL， aspartate amino transferase (AST) 241 U/L， alanine transaminase 208 U/L， total bilirubin 5.1 mg/dL， direct bilirubin 4.0 mg/dL， lactate 5.5 mmol/L， white blood cell count 57.7 x10 with 97% neutrophils， hemoglobin 11.1 g/dL， platelets 65 x 10，INR 1.62). Upon presentation， he was intubated， admitted to the intensive care unit， and initiated on intravenous antibiotics with vancomycin， cefepime， and metronidazole.\n\n【9】删除5:<u>1050.</u>\n\n【10】Initial Chest CT revealed two large non-arterially enhancing， ill-defined， hypo attenuating lesions within the right hepatic lobe， the largest measuring up to 11.7 cm . A follow-up abdominal ultrasound revealed two hypoechoic lesions with hyperechoic rims； the first lesion measured 10x 9.3 x 9.2 cm while the second measured 11.2x8.2x 10.7 cm .\n\nInfectious Disease was consulted and antibiotics were switched to vancomycin， meropenem and metronidazole to cover for other etiologies of hepatic abscesses. Initial blood cultures wer negative. Stool analysis was negative for infection. A percutaneous drain of the inferior lobe abscess emptied 600 milliliters ofthick anchovy paste-like material . Gram stain and culture of this|删除段之间换行|aspirate were negative. He had another drain placed into the superior lobe abscess， which appeared to rupture into the pleural space； both drains were subsequently extracted after adequate drainage. He was extubated after clinical improvement on antibiotics. Eventually， E. histolytica IgG serology returned positive， and metronidazole alone was continued. The right-sided pleural effusion secondary to a rupture of the abscess was managed successfully with serial drain placements. He was maintained on metronidazole for 10 days with the addition of diiodohydroxyquin for adjuvant luminal therapy for a total of 21 days.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\nWhile ALA is predominant in males， it is usually a disease of younger adults when compared to PHA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Several case series have reported that those in their fifth decade or older were more consistent with PHA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Our patient was a male in his sixth decade of life. PHA is associated with variable complaints， such as cough or chest pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Our patient did have complaints of a productive cough. Lab abnormalities are more noteworthy in PHA， particularly hyperbilirubinemia， which is rare in ALA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.Otherlab abnormalities more typical of PHA include elevated lactic dehydrogenase， low albumin， increased AST， and leukocytosis with a marked shift to|删除段之间换行|the left (>89% neutrophils) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. However， as illustrated in our case， the distinction between ALA and PHA can be very challenging and aspiration of the abscess is needed both for diagnosis and for prevention of rupture of strategically located abscess.\n\n【14】Definitive diagnosis of ALA is by demonstrating amebic trophozoites in the aspirate of the liver abscess. Due to the cellular response to invading trophozoites occurring mostly in the periphery of the lesion， a microscopic evaluation may be low yield due to imprecise sampling. Aspirate evaluation has higher yield in PHA where microorganisms and polymorphonuclear cells are more evident. The fluid aspirate in this case was not tested for trophozoites but rather for gram stain and cultures in order to definitively rule out PHA. Given the low yield of fluid aspirate analysis， serologies for E. histolytica remain instrumental in the diagnosis and differentiation of ALA from PHA. The ELISA remains the most sensitive assay in detecting circulating antibodies specific for E. histolytica. It is important to note that serology may not be apparent in the first 7-10days of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Although treatment is distinctive for each individual disease， it is prudent to initiate treatment for both， especially in the early management of severe illness until the diagnosis is confirmed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The mechanism of perforation is thought to be a combination of inflammation and direct pressure necrosis. The most common sites of perforation are the three anatomic constrictions：The cricopharyngeus， the crossing of the left main stem bronchus or aortic arch， and the gastroesophageal junction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Patients may be immediately symptomatic or present weeks after the esophageal perforation， few cases may be asymptomatic for longer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【10】home.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Esophageal perforation is still a life-threatening condition with an overall mortality of approximately 22%. Literature review on esophageal perforation showed that foreign bodies were the cause of7% of the perforations， with fish and chicken bones being the most common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3\\]</u>. Foreign body ingestion is more common in children and in high-risk groups of adults such as those with underlying esophageal disease， neurological pathology， prisoners， the mentally retarded， and those with psychiatric illnesses， and has also been reported with greater frequency in edentulous patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【13】There are numerous causes of esophageal perforation with iatrogenic being the most common. This case presents one of the uncommon complications of foreign body ingestion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. We present a case of foreign body ingestion with migration sequel exhibiting no evidence of wall perforation， in which a 3 cm chicken bone led to asymptomatic esophageal perforation and migration into the pleural space.\n\nPerforation of the esophagus due to an ingested foreign body is uncommon as a majority of ingested foreign bodies pass through|删除段之间换行|In our case， the patient could not remember ingesting a foreign body， he presented with a clinical picture showing a mixture of thoracic and abdominal symptoms. The initial chest roentgenogram showed a loculated right-sided pleural effusion and computer tomography showed presence of a hyper dense foreign body above the diaphragm and loculated right-sided fluid collection， there was nU|删除段之间换行|evidence of pneumothorax or soft tissue emphysema.\n\n【15】The diagnosis was confirmed upon removal ofa 3 cm chicken bone from the pleural cavity. The removed bone was surrounded by thick adhesions indicating the presentation was not acute in nature and the pleural fluid although purulent did not show microbial growth. The most common symptom of esophageal perforation is acute chest pain； other common symptoms include the development of pleural effusion， pneumothorax and emphysema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. We suspect the delayed presentation in our patient was due to the local containment of inflammation as evident by the extensive fibrosis surrounding the foreign body.\n\n【16】The gold standard for diagnosis if perforation is suspected initially is via water-soluble contrast swallow as this patient presented atypically with no obvious risk factors for perforation； it was performed after removing the foreign body and was normal. Rigid endoscopy can also provide clues on extra luminal migration such as the presence of a hematoma， edema， mucosal laceration， punctuate hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5-7，9，10\\]</u>. The use of the computed tomographic scan for unusual presentations is valuable to diagnose migration of foreign bodies as was described in our report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5-7，9，10\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Although this case did not show evidence of perforation， and patient showed clinical improvement after removal of the foreign body， the primary goal of treatment of an esophageal perforation should be that the defect be repaired as soon as possible， with the gold standard being Primary repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Migration of a foreign body to tissues outside the esophagus is rare especially when here is no evidence of perforation. Migration of esophageal foreign bodies has been most reported in the neck， this is thought to be due to the anatomic constriction of the cricopharyngeus， and due to the fact that these muscles are circular in arrangement， thus when contracted tend to push a foreign body outward increasing the chance of perforation. There are only a few published reports of foreign body migration： Migration to the lung通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>， the subcutaneous tissues of the neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> thyroid gland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>， the inferior pulmonary ligament， and a major blood vessel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， and in the pericardium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> posterior mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，14\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\nThe absence of a clear history of foreign body ingestion and the inability to identify an ingested foreign body on clinical examination， water-soluble contrast swallow or endoscopy does not rule out its presence. The persistence of symptoms and the presence of ominous signs should raise the suspicion of a migrating foreign body； migrated foreign bodies may remain undetected leading to incorrect diagnosis of disease. The reason for diagnostic delay in patients is due to neglecting the importance of detailing the remote history of|删除段之间换行|foreign body ingestion， absence of initial symptoms and the fact that patients may have multiple co-morbid conditions， which add to the confusion.

In this case report we describe a 43-years-old man affected by this kind of tumor with atypical sites of relapse： Stomach， peritoneum， left axillary， right and left supraclavicular lymph node and finally LMC. The treatment for LMC from solid tumors is not established， but Intrathecal Therapy (IT)， radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy according to primary tumor are usually administered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. In literature there are not many metastatic presentations like this， as well as few descriptions of treatment based on systemic immunotherapy and IT for LMC.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】In February 2019， a 43-years-old Caucasian man， presented hematuria. He had no concomitant diseases. His familiar history was positive for breast cancer (grandmother and sister). An abdominal ultrasound scan identified right hydronephrosis of grade II-III and pelvic expansion of right ureter. A contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) of chest and abdomen confirmed the presence of right hydronephrosis and a mass of 2 cm ofureter， the bladder had irregular walls，retroperitoneal lymph nodes were enlarged， the major of them of 2 cm × 1.2 cm. A Cystoscopy revealed normal mucous membrane without macroscopic alterations with thickening of the right walls. In March2019， a right nephroureterectomy and retroperitoneal lymph nodes dissection were performed. A macroscopic examination showed 5 cm mass of right ureter. Histological examination found a papillary and not papillary urothelial carcinoma of right ureter， G3， and metastatic involvement of only one of three lymph nodes.

His blood examination was normal， in particular serum creatinine was 1.24 mg/dl with estimation Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) >60 ml/min. He was fit for cisplatin-based chemotherapy； in particular he had no cardiovascular， audiometric and neurological|删除段之间换行|alterations. From April to July 2019， our patients received 4 cycles of first line intravenous chemotherapy with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m’on days 1-8 q21 plus cisplatin 70 mg/m’ on day 1-q21 without significant adverse events， except Grade (G) 1 nausea from day 1 to day 3 of chemotherapy and G1 fatigue according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event version5.0 (CTCAE v5.0). There was no relapse of disease at abdominal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and a chest CT scan performed in August删除4:<u> 2019</u>. He underwent observation with blood examination， urinary cytology， abdominal ultrasound/MRI and chest CT scan， all of these were negative.\n\n【8】Thirteen months later (September 2020)， patient complained G1left armpit pain， G2 abdominal pain， G2 nausea and G2 vomit.ECOG performance status score was删除4:<u> 0</u>. He showed weight loss of 7% in last6 months and reduced oral intake (50%) in past 7 days. An axillary ultrasound showed 5 cm ×1.7 cm ×3 cm mass of left armpit. Urinary cytology was negative for atypical cells. Abdomen ultrasound revealed6 mm mass of posterior portion of bladder. For gastrointestinal symptoms， patient received Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) and underwent Esophageal-Gastro-Duodenoscopy (EGDS) with biopsy that found diffusely edematous， hyperemic and hypertrophic mucosa from fundus to antral region of stomach； duodenal mucosa was edematous andhyperemicwith some superficialerosions. Histological examination revealed neoplastic cells positive for GATA3， CK7，p63at Immunohistochemistry analysis， with a possible urothelial origin. There was no alteration of mismatch repair proteins (MLH1，PMS2，\n\n【9】MSH2，MSH6).\n\n【10】A (18F) Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in Combination with CT (PET-CT) showed elevated uptake of stomach (SUVmax 10.9) ， left armpit(SUVmax 6.4) ， right and left superclavear lymph nodes(SUVmax 5.5 and 5.6， respectively)  and peritoneum(SUVmax 3.8). Based on the long progression free survival after first line chemotherapy treatment， the good tolerance of first line of chemotherapy， the good clinical condition and young age of patient， between October and December 2020， were administered 4 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m’ on days1-8 q21 plus cisplatin 70 mg/m’ on day 1-q删除4-1:<u>21</u>. Then， FDG-PET-CT revealed a partial metabolic response， in particular， there were no uptake in stomach and peritoneum and there was uptake reduction ofleft armpit (SUVmax 2.5)， right and left superclavear lymph nodes(both with SUVmax 3). A Cystoscopy of control was negative. For the disappearance of abdominal symptoms and the recovery of normal weight (/increase of weight)， TPN was interrupted with a gradually intake of oral food. On January 20h， 2021 was administered， the patient was in good clinical conditions， he accused only G1 nausea and G1 vomiting from day 1 to day 3 of chemotherapy and G1 fatigue.\n\nTen days later after the fifth cycle of chemotherapy， for the onset of frontal headache， diplopia and visual blurring， the patient underwent ophthalmological evaluation showing bilateral hyperemic and edematous papillae with flame hemorrhages and peripapillary exudates. A brain CT scan described intracranial hypertension without brain metastaticlesions. There was mild tortuosity ofthe optic nerves and mild ectasia of perioptic sheaths， and a slight appearance detected of both optic papillae. There were no neurological alterations at clinical examination. So， he was admitted in the Neurology department. Neurological evaluation found diplopia with a deficit of left VI cranial nerve， mild anisocoria major on the left than right. A brain MRI confirmed intracranial hypertension and contrast enhancement involving of leptomeninges. A lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) was colorless， transparent， glucose and protein levels were normal (57 mg/dl and 46 mg/dl， respectively)， chloride was 131 mEq/l； cells count was increased(50 cells/uL) with lymphocytes and atypic cells. Cytological CSF examination revealed atypic cells positive for GATA 3 and negative for p63 and TTF1， with a possible metastatic localization ofurothelial carcinoma. Microbiological examination and CSF antibodies research|删除段之间换行|were negative.\n\n【12】Frontal headache was stopped after pharmacological treatment with acetazolamide but there was no benefit in left visual loss and appeared vomiting. The patient was transferred to the Oncology Department， for other evaluation and treatment. He received steroid， anti-emesis and anti-edema therapy. For leptomeningeal carcinomatosis， we decided tOadministeerrIntrathecaal(IT) methotrexate 12 mg weekly and concomitant second line of systemic treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab at flat dose of 200 mg intravenous on day 1 q21n (a total of four cycles were administered). Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) evaluation of DNA and RNA was performed in CSF of the first IT infusion， identifying uncommon alteration of exon 11 of BRAF gene (G466V)(missense) and of exon 3 of AKT1 gene (E17K) (missense)， did not found alteration of BRCA1 gene. NGS examination performed to the following IT infusion did not identify gene alterations.\n\n【13】After 4 doses of IT chemotherapy， CSF was colorless， transparent， glucose level was normal (54 mg/dl)， protein was 68 mg/dl (elevated)， chloride was 123 mEq/l(normal)， cells count was decreased (1 cells/uL) but cytological CSF examination was still positive for atypical cells， so this treatment was interrupted after five IT methotrexate infusions.\n\n【14】At the beginning of April， he was admitted in the Oncology department because of sepsis from Pseudomonas aeruginosa； during the hospitalization he underwent a brain RMI which showed stable intracranial hypertension without contrast enhancement in leptomeninges. From the middle of April， his clinical condition became worse and worse because of the onset of epileptic seizures and progressive postural instability. He passed away at the beginning of May， three months after the diagnosis of LMC.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Urothelialcarcinoma ofureterandrenalpelvis is rare，representing respectively 1% and 5% of all urothelial cancers. On the contrary， the most common histology of Bladder Cancer (BC) is urothelial one. More often these tumors metastasize to lymph nodes， liver， bone and lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Our patient showed atypical sites of metastasis， such as stomach， peritoneum， left axillary， right and left supraclavicular lymph nodes. Moreover， he had Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis(LMC)， which is absolutely an atypical site of metastasis of this kind of tumor.\n\n【17】Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis (LMC) consists in cancer cell localization in pia mater， arachnoid and in the space between them， called subarachnoid space. It is also called leptomeningeal disease and leptomeningeal metastasis. The percentage of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies that metastasize to leptomeninges is about5% to 8% and 5% to 15%. More often， lung cancer (9% to 25%)， breast cancer (5%to8%)and melanoma (6%to 18%) could show this particular metastatic site， with major incidence in some histological subtypes such as lobular histology and triple-negative molecular subtype for breast cancer and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-mutant disease.\n\n【18】In general， the incidence of LMC has increased because of new detection instruments for diagnosis. Most therapeutic arms are developing to control this kind of disease.\n\n【19】About 1.2 to 2 years occur from diagnosis of systemic solid cancer to LMC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Specifically， our patient developed LMC after 2\n\n【20】years. Onset symptoms were headache and blurred vision. When LMC started， FDG PET/TC showed partial response of the other metastasis sites. To our best knowledge， only two cases of metastatic urothelial cancer of upper urinary tract and LMC were reported in literature. Imamura et al. describe a case report where otologic symptoms (facial nerve paralysis and bilateral hearing loss) were the first clinical presentation of LMC from transitional carcinoma of renal pelvis： these symptoms were connected to the infiltration of malignant cells in temporal bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In Matsushita et al. case report it is described a transitional carcinoma of bladder and ureter， where LMC symptoms developed sixteenth month after radical cystectomy and right nephroureterectomy， and then patient died six days after LMC diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Actually LMC therapy consists in Intrathecal Therapy (IT)， systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Our patient was treated with five administrations of intrathecal methotrexate 12 mg once weekly. Moreover， in February 2021 he started second-line therapy with Pembrolizumab 200 mg flat dose every three weeks for four cycles.\n\n【22】Umezawa et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> collected 33 cases of LMC and metastatic BC； the majority of them were urothelial carcinoma， except for two cases with different histologies (adenocarcinoma and small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma).\n\n【23】As in most cases described in this review， our patient has developed LMC during the first-line chemotherapy， after the histological diagnosis of gastric relapse. Umezawa et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> reported that twenty-four patients were treated， while nine patients did not receive any treatment because their clinical conditions quickly became worse. 14 of 24 treated patients (58.3%) received IT chemotherapy (methotrexate alone in 13 pts， unknown in 1 pt). Seven patients (29.2%) underwent a radiotherapy treatment (in 1craniospinal radiotherapy，spinal radiotherapy in 1， and whole-brain radiotherapy in 5). Finally， two patients (8.3%) received systemic medical treatment， based on MVAC or Gemcitabina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【24】In the present case， it was administered a combined treatment (IT and systemic immune-checkpoint inhibitor). If we analyze the review just mentioned， we can observe that seven patients， who underwent IT， received another therapy： Six patients also radiotherapy and one also systemic chemotherapy.\n\n【25】A recent case report describes LMC in a bladder cancer and its treatment： After the clinical and radiological manifestation of LMC， patient received whole-brain radiotherapy (30 Gy) and then immunotherapy， Pembrolizumab 200 mg， but he died of bladder cancer one month after the diagnosis of LMC通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Therefore in literature there is not a description of a treatment similar to our case： IT with MTX 12 mg weekly and Pembrolizumab200 mgq删除4-1:<u>21</u>.\n\n【27】According to the prognosis， our patients passed away 3 months after the diagnosis of LMC. Umezawa et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> confirm the poor prognosis： 35 days (interquartile range： 16 to 134 days) was the median survival time from the diagnosis of LMC， except for rare cases.\n\n【28】In conclusion， advanced urothelial cancer of upper urinary tract has low survival rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>； if we add LMC’s median survival time， the final prognosis becomes really adverse， like in our case report.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

More and more studies showed that long non-coding RNAs(lncRNAs) performed essential roles in OA. This study is aimed at investigating the effect oflncRNA SNHG1 on IL-1B-stimulated chondrocytes inflammatory injury in mice.\n\n【2】Materials and Method： As the latest studies indicated， the mouse chondrocytes， stimulated by IL-1B， were used for constructing a model of inflammatory injury. The functions of SNHG1overexpression or inhibition in regulating apoptosis， inflammation and Extracellular Matrix (ECM) in IL-1B injured chondrocytes were evaluated. Then， bioinformatics methods were used to screen possible targets of SNHG1， and the relationships among SNHG1， miRNA-143-3p， and Kruppel Like Factor 2 (KLF2) were verified by qRT-PCR and luciferase reporter gene assays. Furthermore， the functional mechanism of SNHG1 was explored through miR-143-3p overexpressed or the knockdown of KLF2 as recovery experiments.\n\n【3】Results：SNHG1 was reduced in mousechondrocytes stimulated by IL-1B. Moreover， overexpression of SNHG1 reduced apoptosis inhibited the inflammatory response and the degradation of ECM. Mechanistically， SNHG1， which functions as a sponger， directly bound to miRNA-143-3p. Additionally，transfection of miRNA-143-3p mimics reversed the inhibition of apoptosis and ECM degradation exerted by SNHG1 overexpression.SNHG1 exerted its function by in directly regulating KLF2， a downstream target of miRNA-143-3p.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Our study demonstrated that lncRNA SNHG1 protected chondrocytes against IL-1B-stimulated inflammatory injury bytargeting miRNA-143-3p/KLF2 axis. It is suggested that SNHG1might be a potential therapeutic target in OA.\n\n【5】Keywords： MicroRNAs；Osteoarthritis； Long non-coding； SNHG1\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Osteoarthritis (OA) belongs to a common degenerative joint illness， which is caused by various factors. Its main features are cartilage degeneration and destruction， and bone hyperplasia. Epidemiological statistics suggested that the incidence of people over 55 years of age is 44% to 70%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However， there are no effective treatments to prevent the occurrence and delay the progression of OA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. The pathogenic factors of OA generally lie in trauma， age， menopause， and endocrine imbalances. These factors change the biochemical pathway of chondrocytes， leading to increased inflammatory cytokines and the degradation of the Extracellular Matrix (ECM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. It was reported that abnormal gene expression in chondrocytes is related to chondrocytes inflammatory response and ECM synthesis and degradation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Therefore， it is needful to explore the mechanisms affecting chondrocytes inflammation and matrix degradation， which may provide new targets for treating OA.\n\nLong non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are a group of RNAs in eukaryotic cells that are longer than200 nucleotides， and they do not have the function of encoding proteins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Recently， increasing|删除段之间换行|studies showed that lncRNAs participated in the regulation of gene expression in many diseases， including OA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>. For example， lncRNA HULC， which was highly up-regulated in liver cancer， reduced the inflammatory damage of ATDC5 cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Tang et al. reported that lncRNA TUG1 promoted the degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. These studies have proved LncRNAs fulfilled significant functions in OA.\n\n【9】MicroRNAs (miRNAs)， generally 18 to 22 nucleotides long， are small non-coding RNAs molecules that could mediate the transcription and degradation of mRNA via their complementary3'-Untranslated Region (3-UTR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. As some reports went， miRNAs took part in inflammation-related diseases like OA and promoted or inhibited OA development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12-14\\]</u>. According to the latest researches， it was demonstrated that lncRNAs performed their functions by the interaction with miRNAs or mRNAs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15-17\\]</u>. SNHG1 helped cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by the negative regulation of miR-137 in colorectal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Cao et al. revealed that SNHG1 regulated neuroinflammation by sponging the miR-7/NLRP3 axis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. However， the function of SNHG1 in OA has not been illustrated. Therefore， it's needful to explore SNHG1's role in OA further.\n\n【10】Our study was aimed at determining SNHG1s potential mechanisms in OA chondrocytes. Moreover， we used bioinformatics software (Starbase) and various experimental methods to reveal that SNHG1 positively regulated KLF2 through sponging miR-143-3p， and mediated the apoptosis， the inflammatory response and the degradation of ECM in OA chondrocytes.\n\n【11】Materials and Methods Primary chondrocyte isolation and culture\n\n【12】The Ethics Committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University agreed with our research. The Animal Center of Nanchang University provided male BALB/c mice (1 week old). Mouse primary chondrocytes were isolated like the previous study reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The obtained chondrocytes were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM； Gibco， USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS， Gibco， USA) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Solarbio， China) at 37°C with 5% CO2. The chondrocytes from passages 2 to 3 were only used in the following experiments to avoid changes in phenotype.\n\n【13】The chondrocytes at 60% to 70% confluency were induced with different concentrations of IL-1B (0， 1， 5， 10 ng/ml， Sangon Biotech， China). Moreover， we determined that the appropriate concentration of IL-1β was 10n g/ml for subsequent experiments.\n\n【14】MTT assay\n\n【15】The cell viability of the treated chondrocytes was detected by Cell Proliferation Reagent Kit (MTT， Solarbio， China) and referring to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly， 96-well plates were used for culturing cells (4×10). After various treatments in the control group and the inflammation group (3 repeated holes in each group)， MTT solution (20 uL) was put to each well. After 4 h， adding DMSO to dissolve them. Finally， cell viability was tested by the microplate spectrometer (Bio-Rad，USA).\n\n【16】Apoptosis assay\n\n【17】The apoptotic rate of the treated chondrocytes was evaluated by flow cytometry (BD， USA) and Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection Kit (Keygen， China) with the guidance of the supplier’s\n\n【18】protocol. In short， the chondrocytes were first washed by using Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS). Next， the cells were resuspended in500 ul binding buffer， and then incubated with 5 uL Annexin V-FITC and 5 uL PI in the dark at room temperature for 15 min. Finally， apoptosis was evaluated by the flow cytometry and analyzed by the FlowJo software. In general， the experimental grouping is the same as the MTT assay.\n\n【19】Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)\n\n【20】TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen，USA) helped to extract the total RNA of chondrocytes. Next， the PrimeScript\" RT Reagent kit (Takara， Japan)， according to the manufacturer's instructions， was used for reversely transcribing the RNA into cDNA. Moreover， the Real-time PCR system (BioRad) and the SYBR Premix (Takara， Japan) were utilized for performing qRT-PCR. For effectively analyzing all data， our study adopted the 2-4act method 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. As for the related primer sequences， Table 1 showed all the details.\n\n【21】Cell transfection\n\n【22】The overexpression plasmids of SNHG1 were synthesized by GenePharma (China) (pcDNA3.1 vector (pc-DNA) as a negative control). And all of the siRNAs (si-SNHG1， si-KLF2， si-NC)， and the miRNAs mimics (miRNA-143-3p mimics， mimics-NC) were purchased from GenePharma. Plasmids or oligonucleotides were respectively transfected into chondrocytes by using Lipofectamine2000(Life Technologies， USA) with the protocol of the manufacturer. After 48-h transfection， 10 ng/ml of IL-1B was utilized to induce the cells for 24 h.\n\n【23】Dual-luciferase reporter assay\n\n【24】GenePharma (China) was applied to construct the synthesized 3'-UTR sequences， which were added to the pmirGLO vectors. Similarly， the pMIR-reporter plasmids of the wild-type SNHG1 (SNHG1-Wt)， the mutated SNHG1 (SNHG1-Mut)， the wild-type KLF2 (KLF2-Wt)， and the mutated KLF2 (KLF2-Mut) were constructed as the above. These plasmids and miR-143-3p mimics or the control were transfected into the 293T cells by Lipofectamine删除4:<u> 2000</u>. After transfection for 48 h， the relative luciferase activity was detected by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega， USA).\n\n【25】Western blot\n\n【26】The chondrocytes were dissolved in 200 ul of the RIPA protein lysis buffer and then centrifuged at 12500 g for 10 min. The supernatant was then collected for further experiments or storage at- 80°C. The protein extracts were isolated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore， USA). Next， the membrane was blocked by 5% fat-free milk for 1 h. Subsequently， the PVDF membranes were respectively incubated in the specificprimary antibodies (Abcam， UK) at 4°C overnight and washed in PBST. Then， the secondary antibody (Proteintech， China) was used to incubate for1 h. After washed 3 times with PBST， the membrane was developed with the ECL chemiluminescence Kit (Solarbio， China).\n\n【27】Statistical analysis\n\n【28】All data were expressed by mean ±SD. Statistical significance was detected by using SPSS 17.0 software. P-value <0.05 was indicated statistical significance. All results were collected from at least 3independent experiments.\n\n【29】Results\n\n【30】SNHG1 expression Was down-regulated in IL-1B-stimulated chondrocytes injury\n\n【31】We analyzed the data in the GEO database (https：//www.ncbi.\n\n| Gene  | Sequence  |\n| --- | --- |\n| SNHG1-F  | CCGCTCGAGCTCATTTITCCTTGTTCG  |\n| SNHG1-R  | CGCGGATCCGCAAAGAATTATITCATC  |\n| KLF2-F  | ACAGACTGCTATTTATTGGACCTTAG  |\n| KLF2-R  | CAGAACTGGTGGCAGAGTCATTT  |\n| collagenlI-F  | ACGAAGCGGCTGGCAACCTCA  |\n| collagen II-R  | CCCTCGGCCCTCATCTCTACATCA  |\n| aggrecan-F  | CTGTCTTTGTCACCCACACATG  |\n| aggrecan-R  | GAAGACGACATCACCATCCAG  |\n| MMP3-F  | AGGGATGATGATGCTGGTATGG  |\n| MMP3-R  | CCATGTTCTCCAACTGCAAAGG  |\n| MMP13-F  | CCCTGATGTITCCCATCTATACC  |\n| MMP13-R  | TTCATCGCCTGGACCATAAAG  |\n| ADAMTS4-F  | GAGCTGTGCTATTGTGGAAGA  |\n| ADAMTS4-R  | CCCTGCCCATTCAAGTTAGT  |\n| ADAMTS5-F  | CTCGATCCCTAGCTGTCTTTG  |\n| ADAMTS5-R  | CAGGAGTGGCTTTAGAGTGTAG  |\n| TNF-0-F  | CCCTCACACTCAGATCATCTTCT  |\n| TNF-0-R  | GCTACGACGTGGGCTACAG  |\n| IL-1B-F  | TGCTGATGTACCAGTTGGGG  |\n| IL-1B-R  | CTCCATGAGCTTTGTACAAG  |\n| IL-6-F  | CCAGAGTCCTTCAGAGAGATACA  |\n| IL-6-R  | CCTTCTGTGACTCCAGCTTATC  |\n| GAPDH-F  | TGGTGAAGCAGGCATCTGAG  |\n| GAPDH-R  | TGAAGTCGCAGGAGACAACC  |\n\n【33】F： Forward； R： Reverse\n\nnlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE104793)tTCOEexplorethe clinical significance of lncRNA SNHG1 in OA. Compared with|删除段之间换行|uninjured chondrocytes， the expression of SNHG1 in arthritic chondrocytes was down-regulated . IL-1B was employed to induce the inflammation injury of chondrocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. For determining the proper concentration of IL-1B， chondrocytes were processed by different doses of IL-1B， and then we evaluated cell viability. Compared with untreated cells， the 10 ng/mL and 5 ng/mL IL-1β treatment significantly reduced cell viability . The results showed that the stimulation of IL-1B exerted an evident inhibitory influence on chondrocytes. Therefore， the concentration of IL-1B was 10ng/mL for further experiments. After the treatment with IL-1B， we observed the mRNA expression levels of IL-1B， IL-6 and TNF-a also enhanced obviously ， and the apoptosis rate increased significantly . The above results confirmed that IL-1B could successfully construct OA injury model in chondrocytes. Finally， qRT-PCR verified that SNHG1 was significantly down-regulated in IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes .\n\n【35】The function of SNHG1 in OA chondrocytes\n\nFor investigating the regulatory role of SNHG1 in chondrocytes， si-SNHG1 or SNHG1 overexpression vector was transfected into chondrocytes. And we employed qRT-PCR to corroborate the transfection efficiency . The MTT assays suggested that the overexpression of SNHG1 could improve cell viability. To further explore the function of SNHG1 in IL-1B-induced chondrocytes， apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines were examined again after transfection. The results revealed that SNHG1overexpression significantly reduced apoptosis  and inhibited IL-1B， IL-6 and TNF-a expression levels . Furthermore，the mRNA and protein levels of major cartilage matrix-degrading enzymes(ADAMTS-4，ADAMTS-5，MMP-3，andMMP13) were increased after the IL-1B treatment， and the overexpression of SNHG1 could inhibit these degradation enzyme expressions. The mRNA and protein levels of type II collagen and aggrecan， the significant components of cartilage extracellular matrix proteins， were improved after the overexpression of SNHG1|删除段之间换行|and western blot.\\： P<0.05；\\\\：P<0.01； ww\\： P<0.001.\n\n【37】in IL-1β-induced chondrocytes . However， the effect of transfection with si-SNHG1 was contrary to that overexpression of SNHG1 (Figures 2B-2J. In summary， we suggested that SNHG1regulated the progression of OA by inhibiting inflammatory responses， chondrocyte apoptosis， and the degradation of ECM.\n\n【38】SNHG1 regulated cell viability and ECM degradation via sponging miR-143-3p in OA chondrocytes\n\nIt's worth noting that the underlying mechanism of SNHG1 in OA remains uncleared. Recent researches revealed SNHG1 could combine directly with miRNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，23\\]</u>. Therefore， we utilized the online bioinformatics software Starbase  to search SNHG1's target miRNA. It is predicted that miR-143-3p might be one of the possible targets of SNHG1 . The relationship between SNHG1 and miR-143-3p was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assays， which verified the surmise that SNHG1 was directly targeted by miR-143-3p in the 293T cells . And according to the results of qRT-PCR， the expression of SNHG1 reduced after transfecting miR-143-3p mimics . Functionally， the up-regulation of cell viability， induced by SNHG1， was also restored by miR-143-3p . Moreover， miR-143-3p inhibited the mRNA and protein expression levels of type II collagen and aggrecan on chondrocytes . The above results|删除段之间换行|showed that miR-143-3p might be a downstream target of SNHG1and affected chondrocytes viability and ECM expression.\n\n【40】SNHG1 indirectly promoted the expression of KLF2 by sponging miR-143-3p\n\n【41】The database of Star base was used to explore the downstream target of miR-143-3p. The result suggested that KLF2 might be a potential target gene of miR-143-3p . The dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-143-3p mimics reduced KLF2-Wt luciferase activity， but not KLF2-Mut . Also， we gained the following findings： miR-143-3p mimics reduced KLF2 expression， SNHG1 could up-regulate KLF2 expression， and miR-143-3p mimics restored the up-regulation of KLF2 by SNHG1 . The results indicated miR-143-3p directly targets at KLF2. Therefore， we determined that SNHG1 indirectly promoted KLF2 expression through miR-143-3p.\n\nSNHG1 inhibited cell apoptosis， inflammatory response， ECMdegradation， and promoted cell viability by regulating KLF2 expression in OA chondrocytes|删除段之间换行|Finally， the SNHG1 overexpression vector and si-KLF2 were transfected into chondrocytes to explain their interaction further.

Also， after the knockdown of KLF2， the expression of inflammatory cytokines， suppressed by the overexpression of SNHG1 in chondrocytes， was partially reversed. Similarly， the reverse effects of si-KLF2 on the ECM were also identified in chondrocytes with the SNHG1 vector . In conclusion， the above data suggested that KLF2 might be involved in the progression of arthritis by affecting the SNHG1/miR-143-3p axis.\n\n【44】Discussion\n\nOA is emerging as a major public health problem. At present， the treatments ofOA mainly focus on relieving symptoms. However， the underlying mechanism of its occurrence and development has not been fully elucidated， which would cause most of terminal OA patients need joint arthroplasty at last. Therefore， many studies on OA have focused on the epigenetic regulation of its pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets， especially non-coding RNA， including lncRNA and miRNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.Previous studies have reported that lncRNAs play a pivotal role in the development of bone and cartilage tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>， which indicates that lncRNAs may affect the balance between the anabolism and catabolism of articular cartilage， and that lncRNAs may be used for the diagnosis and prognosis of|删除段之间换行|OA. Moreover， studies have shown that lncRNAs， as personalized therapeutic biomarkers， can prevent， stop or even reverse the progress of OA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16，26，27\\]</u>. These lncRNAs may help explain the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with cartilage damage， and may also be beneficial to the development of the new treatments for OA. However， there is no related research on the influence of lncRNA SNHG1 on osteoarthritis. In this study， we found that the expression oflncRNA SNHG1 in inflammatory injured chondrocytes reduced. In addition， after exploring the function of SNHG1 in chondrocytes， we found that the overexpression of SNHG1 mitigated cells’ inflammatory damage caused by IL-1B， and that knocking down SNHG1 aggravated cells inflammatory damage. Further experiments show that miR-143-3p can inhibit the expression of SNHG1， and that the overexpression of miR-143-3p can reverse the protective effectof SNHG1 on the injured ch S C2ondrocytes caused by IL-1B. Finally， we found that KLF2 is the downstream target gene of miR-143-3p，and that lncRNA SNHG1 indirectly regulates the expression of KLF2through directly targeting at and combining with miR-143-3p， so as to exert its protective effect on the inflammatory injured chondrocytes.\n\nA large amount of evidence indicate that the development of OA is related to local inflammatory response and the abnormal condition of metabolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28，29\\]</u>. Moreover， it is proved that IL-1B， as a pro-inflammatory cytokine， plays a vital role in OA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Many|删除段之间换行|chondrocytes. (A) The cell viability was detected by MTT assay. Transfected chondracytes were treated with IL-13， and then (B) the apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry， and (C，D) the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytakines， type ll collagen， and aggrecan were analyzed by qRT-PCR. (E) The protein levels of type ll collagen and aggrecan were examined by western blat. \\：P<0.05；\\\\：P<0.01； \\\\\\：P<0.001.\n\nstudies have shown that IL-1B reduces the synthesis of extracellular matrix components such as collagen II and aggrecan by disrupting the metabolic balance of chondrocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Moreover， IL-1B could promote the production of the Main Matrix Degrading Enzymes(MMPs)and (ADAMTS) in chondrocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. Therefore， inhibiting the expression of IL-1B and IL-1B-induced inflammatory mediators may be a potential therapeutic approach to reduce the progression of OA. In recent years， IL-1B-induced chondrocytes have been widely used to construct inflammatory injury models. For example， Tu et al. used IL-1β to treat rat chondrocytes in order to study the|删除段之间换行|effects of schizandrin and cell viability， inflammatory response and cartilage degradation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Hu et al. found that lncRNA HOTAIR can reduce the IL-1B-induced inflammation of mouse chondrocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Therefore， in this study， we chose IL-1B to be an in vitro stimulator in order to construct a model of chondrocyte inflammation. At the same time， we also tested the viability， apoptosis， and inflammatory factor expression of the chondrocytes treated by IL-1B.\n\nAfter IL-1B treatment of mouse chondrocytes， we found that the expression of lncRNA SNHG1 down-regulated. In order to further clarify the relationship between lncRNA SNHG1 and extracellular|删除段之间换行|cartilage matrix and inflammatory factors， we used small interfering RNA(si-SNHG1) and overexpressed SNHG1 plasmids to respectively transfect chondrocyvtes. We found that overexpression of lncRNA SNHG1 can promote chondrocyte proliferation， inhibit the high expression of MMP3，MMP13，ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 under the actionofIL-1B，and increasetheexpression of collagen II and aggrecan. In addition， compared with the control group under the intervention of IL-1B， the expression of the inflammatory factors IL-1B， IL-6 and TNF-a obviously reduced， and the apoptosis rate of chondrocytes were also reduced. The transfection of si-SNHG1 reduced the expression of lncRNA SNHG1 in chondrocytes and increased the inflammatory damage induced by IL-1B， which is the opposite of the results obtained by the overexpression oflncRNA SNHG1.These results indicate that IncRNA SNHG1 plays an important role in chondrocytes. Up-regulating the expression of lncRNA SNHG1 can alleviate the degradation of chondrocyte extracellular matrix， inhibit inflammatory reaction and reduce apoptosis.\n\n【49】The ceRNA pathway was widely reported as a classic mechanism of the action of lncRNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. For instance， a study， carried out by Hu et al. indicated that HOTAIR promoted osteoarthritis progression by regulating the expression of miR-17-5p/FUT2/B-catenin axis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. LncRNA PVT1 mediated inflammatory injury by targeting the miR-27b-3p/TRAF3 in chondrocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. Concerning SNHG1， plenty of researches authenticated that SNHG1 could perform its function by antagonizing the miRNAs and up-regulating miRNAs downstream targetsSexpression. And SNHG1/miRNA101-3p/ROCK1 axis promoted cell growth， migration and invasion in osteosarcoma通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. SNHG1 also adjusted PDCD4 expression by interacting miR-195-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. Many reports indicate that miRNAs have attracted more and more attention due to their important regulatory functions in bone and cartilage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. In this regard， we predicted that the potential target of lncRNA SNHG1 is miRNAs through the public database Starbase， and then we selected the most relevant miRNA， namely miR-143-3p. Studies have shown that with the differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)into chondrocytes， the expression of miR-143-3p significantly reduced， and miR-143-3p reduced the level of cartilage marker protein by negatively regulating Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 (BMPR2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. However， the regulatory role of miR-143-3p in inflammatory injured chondrocytes has not been elucidated. To verify the relationship between lncRNA SNHG1 and miR-143-3p， we indirectly verified that miR-143-3p can directly bind to SNHG1 through the luciferase reporter gene experiment， and that the transfection of miR-143-3p mimic can inhibit the expression of SNHG1 in chondrocytes. In addition， miR-143-3p can also reverse the effects of SNHG1 on the viability， apoptosis and ECM degradation of inflammatory injured chondrocytes.\n\nKLF2， a transcriptional activator， belongs to the zinc finger family. Recently， some researchers reported that KLF2 played a significant regulatory role in various inflammatory diseases. Das et al. suggested that KLF2 regulated K/BxN serum-induced arthritis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. Manoharan et al. demonstrated that KLF2 promoted skeletal muscle regeneration by regulating innate immune response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. Gao et al. reported that KLF2 can relieve chondrocyte degradation and apoptosis to protect rats from being damaged by experimental OA by inhibiting the oxidation reaction and reducing the expression of MMPs (MMP3， MMP9，and MMP13) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. And the suppression of miR-150 can lead to the up-regulation of KLF2， which helps to protect ATDC5 cells from being damaged by IL-1通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>. Based on the|删除段之间换行|previous studies， we explored the effects of SNHG1 and miR-143-3p on the expression of KLF2. In our study， it was found that KLF2 is a downstream target of miR-143-3p， and that changing SNHG1 and miR-143-3p helps to regulate KLF2 expression. In addition， SNHG1can inhibit inflammation， apoptosis and ECM degradation by indirectly up-regulating KLF2 expression. However， this effect can be reversed by knocking down KLF2. Our results indicate that LncRNA SNHG1 can regulate IL-1B-induced damage through the miR-143-3p/KLF2 axis.\n\n【51】Conclusion\n\n【52】Collectively， this study demonstrated that LncRNA SNHG1alleviated the IL-1B-induced chondrocytes inflammatory injury via targeting miR-143-3p/KLF2 axis， which may highlight new insights regarding the roles of LncRNAs in OA.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "9f6d056d-7276-4a37-99a5-1bdeae6aabc8", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Solitary Fibrous Tumor (SFT) is a rare spindle cell soft tissue tumor. The combination of clinical， biochemical， and radiological features may help in lesion characterization， but only histology can provide the definitive diagnosis. Recurrence and/or metastases have been reported in up to 10%to 15% of cases. Although no clear evidence-based treatment guidelines exist， it is widely accepted that renal SFT need to be removed surgically to avoid the potential of malignant degeneration and metastases. A longer follow-up period might be necessary to definitively evaluate the clinical outcome of a renal SFT. A 36-year-old male， without comorbidities， underwent laparoscopic excision of a 7 cm left juxta-hilar pararenal mass in October删除4:<u> 2018</u>. Preoperative abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) was compatible with a renal cell carcinoma. The pathological study revealed an SFT. An abdominal CT scan， in May 2021，identified a new suspicious left kidney nodule. Thereafter， the patient had done a Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) in June 2021 that confirmed a mesorrenal nodule suspicious of renal cell carcinoma (24 mmx21 mm×21 mm) in the left kidney. He was submitted to open excision of two left juxta-hilar pararenal lesions. Histology provided the definitive diagnosis of metachronous Solitary Fibrous Tumors (SFTs). This is a very rare case of metachronous SFTs in the same kidney of the first resection in a young patient.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Solitary Fibrous Tumor (SFT) is a rare entity， representing 2% of all soft tissue tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It was first described in 1931 by Klemperer and Rabin as a distinct mesothelial tumor arising from the pleura. SFT was reported later in almost any extrapleural site. It is now distinguished into two entities， pleural and extrapleural. Extrapleural SFTs are observed in middle aged adults (mean age 50 years) and affect both genders equally. Urogenital system localizations are very rare. SFTs are usually asymptomatic when they have a small size， so the diagnosis is often delayed. Imaging features are not specific of SFT which are diagnosed as Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) and treated as such. Histologically， is usually a well circumscribed mass， with ill-defined fascicles of ovoid to fusiform cells and hemangiopericytoma-like vasculature， displays immunohistochemical staining for CD34 and STAT-6. Further investigation is needed to assess the clinical behavior of SFT， as well as to establish the appropriate duration and schedule of follow-up. Much of the research on this neoplasm is based on case reports that highlight its potential for clinical aggressiveness. With this same objective， we describe a very rare case of metachronous SFTs in the same kidney of the primary diagnosis.\n\nIn October 2018， a 36-year-old man was referred to our center because of a left pararenal neoplasm measuring approximately 7 cm near the renal hilum. Patient had no comorbidities or usual medication. Due to complaints of nonspecific abdominal pain， an abdominal ultrasound was performed， which detected a solid nodule in theleft kidney. Consequently， an abdominal CT scan was performed，which confirmed the presence of a left renal nodule suspected of RCC. He was submitted to laparoscopic excision ofpararenal mass. Histological and immunohistochemical aspects fit into a6.5 cm SFT of the left kidney. It was observed a multinodular neoplasm with well-defined borders. It was constituted by the proliferation of spindle cells without cytological atypia or only with mild atypia. Cells had round or elongated nuclei， with a thin chromatin， without prominent nucleoli， and mitotic figures were rare. There were no areas of necrosis. The cells were arranged in bundles that intersect a predominantly fibrous stroma. The neoplasm showed intense and diffuse positivity for|删除段之间换行|metachranous solitary fibrous tumors.\n\n【5】vimentin， CD34 and Bcl删除4-1:<u>-2</u>. There was very slight positivity for CD99. It was verified absence of positivity for c-kit， DOG1，smooth muscle actin， desmin， protein S100， and p-catenin. The expression of Ki67， the proliferative index， was around 5%.\n\n【6】The patient underwent imaging control every 6 1 months(abdominal ultrasound or CT). On May 2021， in an abdominal CT scan it was identified a new 26 mm left kidney nodule， with low uptake of contrast， not present in the previous exam. Consequently， the patient performed a renal MRI in June 2021 that revealed in the middle third of the left kidney， in an anterior location， a cortical nodule measuring 24 mm x21mm×x21 mm compatible with RCC. In September the patient underwent open mass excision. Intraoperatively， two suspicious hilar nodules were identified， a 2.4cm lesion identified in the CT and MRI scans and a 1 cm independent lesion. The resections were macroscopically complete.\n\nBoth nodular lesions had overlapping I morphological characteristics， with expansive growth and low cellularity. It was|删除段之间换行|observed a neoplasm formed mainly by monotonous spindle cells， but cells with a vaguely histiocytic morphology with oval nuclei were also identified. No areas of necrosis， mitotic figures or cytological atypia were identified . Immunohistochemical techniques revealed strong and diffuse positivity for CD34  and nuclear staining with weak to moderate intensity for STAT-6 . The definitive diagnosis was metachronous SFTs (two lesions) with1.2 and 2.4 cm in the left kidney hilum， with apparently complete excision.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\nSFT clinical symptoms could be a palpable mass， a flank pain or hematuria but SFT is usually asymptomatic when it has a small size. Although， imaging is useful for the evaluation of renal tumors， ultrasonography， CT， and MRI features are not specific for the diagnosis of SFT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Usually， the differential diagnosis of SFT is difficult， and in most cases the renal mass is interpreted as suspected of RCC and patients undergo surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Diagnosis of kidney SFT is mainly based on the histopathological and immunohistochemical findings. SFT is a neoplasm characterized by the proliferation of spindle cells originating from fibroblasts and mesenchymal cells. On gross examination， tumors are usually tan-gray， homogenous， lobulated， well-circumscribed， and most often involve the renal capsule. Microscopically， spindle cells are surrounded by thick， keloid-like collagen bands with patternless arrangements， sometimes with predominant myxoid changes. It is currently recognized to originate from CD34-positive dendritic interstitial cells and therefore show staining for this immunohistochemical marker (90% to 95%of cases). Immunohistochemical staining with Bcl-2， vimentin， and CD99 can also aid in the diagnosis of SFT. Focal and limited reactivity for S100 protein， cytokeratins and/or desmin had also occasionally been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The STAT-6 immunohistochemistry constitutes nowadays the most useful diagnostic tool in daily practice， since it is|删除段之间换行|a surrogate marker for the NAB2-STAT6 gene fusion， present in the vast majority of SFT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【10】It is estimated that 10% of extrapleural SFTs will recur and/or metastasize 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. SFT are categorized as having intermediate biological behavior， locally aggressive and rarely metastasizing according to the 2020 WHO classification. The diagnostic criteria for malignant SFT were proposed by England in 1989： Mitotic count >4/10 high-power fields； diversity of shapes of cells； many focal points in cells； and necrosis of some cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In the latest classification of SFTs formulatedby WHO，the above criteria were still used for the diagnosis of extrapleural malignant SFT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Malignant transformation of SFT may result from 2 physiopathologic mechanisms according to literature： De novo occurrence and dedifferentiation from preexisting benign SFT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. With malignant transformation， SFT may lose CD34expression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【11】New studies proposed multiple prognostic factors for SFT's， but the lack of large-scale studies worldwide fall short to assess their significance. A recent study in a multicenter cohort from the French Sarcoma Group database developed a risk stratification model (prognostic groups for overall survival and recurrence)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The core idea of risk assessment models is the standardization of the treatment protocol by allocating patients in different subgroups in which therapeutic lines depend on the calculated risk for local and metastatic recurrences.\n\n【12】There are very few series of patients with SFT and much of the literature only describes case reports. Fu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> retrospectively analyzed 10 adult patients with renal SFT. Pathological diagnosis revealed that the tumors in 8 patients were benign， while those in the other 2 patients were malignant. No recurrence occurred in a mean follow-up of 47.3±21.5 months. Cheung et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> described a 49-year-old female with a left renal SFT (16 cm x 11 cm x9 cm) who after undergoing a nephrectomy， presented 8 years later with a metachronous contralateral kidney SFT (exophytic nodule， 4.3 cm，in the lower pole submitted to partial nephrectomy). Sfoungaristos et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> report a case of a 72-year-old male with a large retroperitoneal SFT recurrence (12 cm x11 cm) 3 years after nephrectomy to excise the primary tumor. The pathologic diagnosis of the nephrectomy specimen was SFT with negative surgical margins. The patient follows a strict surveillance， being well without evidence of recurrence or metastasis 9 months after the re-operation. Sammoud et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> described a case of SFT with two local recurrences in a 53-year-old man. In the second time of local recurrence the patient had lung metastasis. As in the cases described in the literature， in our case there was a recurrence of the disease even though the first resection specimen had negative margins.\n\n【13】The follow-up time for patients with SFT is not defined. Salas et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> concluded that recurrence increased between 10 and 20years， suggesting that long-term monitoring is useful. In our case， the recurrence was after 3 years of the primary tumor diagnosis. The patient will maintain imaging control， but there is no defined protocol.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】In our case report we describe a young man with diagnosis of a very rare case of metachronous SFTs in the same kidney of the first resection. Diagnosis was based on the histopathological and immunohistochemical findings. The evaluation of SFT mainly comes from case reports. Future large population studies are required to enrich our understanding of this tumor type and its behavior and to improve its diagnosis， treatment，and follow-up.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is more frequently found in women. Duplication can be complete or incomplete with incomplete duplication being three times more common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Duplication can be associated with other abnormalities such as ureteral ectopia， vesicoureteral reflux， ureterocele and megaureter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Ectopic ureter draining the upper-pole moiety of the kidney frequently ends in ureterocele，and can be dilated and tortuous(megaureter)， which is associated with parenchymal atrophy， particularly of upper-pole renal moiety. Furthermore， vesicoureteral reflux into the lower-pole renal moiety often leads to chronic inflammatoryparenchymal changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. A quarter of all upper urinary tract urothelial tumors oCCLI in ureters， with 60% to 75% located in the lower third 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Urothelial carcinoma is relatively rarely reported in patients with duplicated collecting system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-17\\]</u>. Three cases of urothelial carcinoma in megaureter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18-20\\]</u>，and bifid ureter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21，22\\]</u> are found in the literature， respectively. Multiphasic Multislice Computed Tomographic Urography (MSCTU) is the method of choice in the assessment ofupper urinary tract in patients with hematuria， the most common presenting symptom of ureteral tumor. The method is superior especially in patients with concomitant urinary tract anomalies or impaired renal function， and offers the best possibility oftumor staging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Material and methods\n\nA 63-year-old male was admitted to the Urology emergency department due to intermittent painless gross hematuria. Physical examination and blood tests were unremarkable. The patient had been previously diagnosed with left sided ureterocele and megaureter demonstrated with ultrasound. Ureterocele was treated with endoscopic procedure 5 years ago in other institution. Cystoscopy was performed revealing a normal bladder and bleeding from intravesically dilated left ureteral orifice. Urine cytology suggested poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma. MSCTU was performed including non-enhanced scans， postcontrast arterial， venous and excretory phase scans with additional delayed scan 4 h after the injection of contrast medium. Irregularly shaped shrunken left kidney with duplicated collecting system and considerable parenchymal atrophy， particularly in the upper moiety， was seen. Distal part of upper moiety ureter was tortuous and largely dilated(megaureter)， crossing lower moiety ureter at the level of iliac crest . Two centimeters caudally from that point， within megaureter， a slightly hyperdense 3 cm x 5 cm irregularly shaped tumor， showing early postcontrast enhancement， was suspected. Dilated ureteral lumen was not completely filled with tumor . Arterialphasescans also revealed duplicated renalarteryon|删除段之间换行|theleft side， with lower-pole artery emerging from the wall of partially thrombosed aortic aneurysm . Standard excretory phase scans after 10 min showed incomplete opacification of lower moiety pelvicalyceal system， with signs of chronic obstructive uropathy， while atrophic upper moiety unit was not opacified . Complete opacification of lower moiety collecting system， at delayed excretory scans after 4 h， revealed compression of lower-moiety ureter between megaureter and the psoas muscle 2 cm proximal to the tumor. No signs of periureteric fat infiltration were seen . The density of megaureter content (20 HU) suggested bloody urine， without any increase even on delayed excretory phase scans，|删除段之间换行|due to non functional upper moiety unit. Urinary bladder wall was thickened and trabeculated， with intraluminal orthotopic ureterocele at the orifice of the left upper-moiety ureter . No enlarged lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum were detected. The preoperative diagnosis was defined as ureteral tumor staged T1M0N0. Left total nephroureterectomy was performed as the definitive surgical treatment. A dysplastic upper pole ureter with soft tissue mass within its distal portion was shown at surgery. After left Gibson incision the urinary bladder was opened， and both ureteral orifices on the left side were excised. The left kidney and both ureters were sent to pathology for analysis. The gross appearance of the surgical specimen revealed a dilated dysplastic upper-moiety ureter 35 mm in diameter； containing 3 cmx 6 cm friable papillary tumorlocated 2 cm from the distal end of ureter . The tumor was histologically (WHO2004) described as high-grade invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma(T1NxMxG3)，which invaded lamina propria， but remained confined to the ureteral wall. Adjacent to upper-pole ureter within the fat， the lower-pole ureter of normal structure， slightly dilated， but not invaded by the tumor， was seen. Renal parenchyma showed focal sclerotic changes of glomeruli with normal appearance of tubuli .\n\n【8】The postoperative convalescence was uneventful and the patient showed good recovery. At 2-year follow-up there were no signs of local and distal recurrence or metachronous urothelial tumors.\n\n【9】Results and Discussion\n\nBladder cancers are the most common tumors of the urinary tract， and transitional cell tumors are the most common type. Renal and ureteral transitional cell tumors are relatively rare，accounting for only 5% of tumors. Of this percentage， more than 90% of tumors are located within the renal pelvis， while ureteral tumors are extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23-25\\]</u>. The distal ureter is the most common location of tumors but multifocal implants may also occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. As urinary collecting system duplication is found in 0.8% of the population， the coexistence of the two entities is expected to be very rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2，10\\]</u>. Duplicated collecting system very often remains undiagnosed as a large number of patients are asymptomatic， so diagnosing cancer in this situation is challenging. There is a small number of reports of ureteral cancer in duplicated collecting system in English literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，8-17，22\\]</u>. Three reports of ureteral cancer in megaureter were found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18-20\\]</u>， written in Japanese and abstracted in English. Urinary duplication is frequently associated with other malformations， such as ureterocele in our case. Etiologic relationship between urinary duplication and ureteral cancers is not proven， but preferential development of cancer in the lower part of the duplicated ureters might suggest that recurrent infections，urinary stasis and reflux， and lithogenesis maybeoncogenic通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Chronic irritation of ureteral mucosa caused by prolonged vesicoureteric reflux or urinary stasis due to ureterocele， could make ureter more susceptible to dysplasia and malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，15，27\\]</u>. Similarly， increased frequency of neoplastic lesions was observed in patients with horseshoe kidneys， ureteral pseudodiverticulosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u> and bladder diverticula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27-29\\]</u>. Development of ureteral tumor in megaureter associated with ureterocele in our patient corroborates the hypothesis. Hydronephrosis is a common imaging finding in ureteric tumors， and hydroureter is often seen proximal to the point of obstruction with the lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30，31\\]</u>. In our patient， however， megaureter which contained the neoplasm did not show proximal|删除段之间换行|dilatation， as the tumor growth did not obliterate the relatively wide lumen. Even if complete occlusion had occurred， the proximal dilation would not have developed， because the atrophic upper pole of the kidney did not produce urine. It is not fully clear whether moderate dilatation and impaired secretory function oflower moiety unit reflects reflux uropathy， which can be presumed in this type of anomaly， or is caused by compression with megaureter. The tumor is less probable cause of obstruction， as the tumor was located 2cm apart from the point where the ureters crossed each other， and extraureteral infiltration was excluded both by imaging and histology. In the diagnostic work-up MSCTU was done as only imaging method after the tumor was suspected at cytology. In addition to the standard MSCTU protocol， the delayed excretory phase scan after4 h was done to completely depict lower moiety collecting system， and finally exclude macroscopic lower moiety ureter infiltration. Although arterial phase scans might be omitted in the interest of decreasing radiation exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31，32\\]</u>， in our case these scans were useful to demonstrate renal vascular anatomy and relationship of duplicated renal vascularization and concomitant abdominal aortic aneurysm， the information helpful in planning surgery. Early contrast enhancement helped in detection of the tumor， which was nearly isodense to bloody content of megaureter on precontrast scans. As the upper moiety of the kidney is non-functioning， the megaureter was not opacified with contrast urine， and the tumor Was not outlined as contrast filling defect， neither on standard nor on delayed excretory scans. As a consequence， multifocality could not be consistently excluded by use of MSCTU， but this was of little concern because the radical surgery was done. Considering that the tumor was histologically described as high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma， the lack of periureteral fat infiltration and distant metastases are favourable for the patient prognosis. As the tumor was presumed as early-stage cancer confined to the collecting system wall， the total left nephroureterectomy with excision of both ipsilateral ureteral orifices and a contiguous cuff of bladder tissue was definitive treatment option. Considering that high-grade tumors of upper urinary tract can be associated with greater incidence of metachronous bladder recurrencies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>， strict follow-up after radical nephroureterectomy is mandatory in our patient. Generally， ultrasound， intravenous urography， antegrade and retrograde ureteropyelography are used in detecting collecting system tumors. In our patient， previously performed ultrasound could not show cancer due to growth in the distal third of the ureter which was obscured by meteorism，whereas there was no hydronephrosis in the kidney itself due to partial renal parenchyma atrophy and poor urine production. Conventional excretory urography would not be a valuable initial imaging method in our case because of impaired function of the duplicated kidney. On the contrary， MSCTU with delayed excretory phase scans readily detected the tumor， enabled staging by exclusion of periureteral infiltration， lymph nodes enlargement and metastatic involvement of parenchymal organs and offered good depiction of complex left urinary system anatomy and concomitant aortic aneurysm.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】In summary， we presented a case of high-grade urothelial cancer confined to megaureter associated with ureteral duplication， ureterocele， double renal arterial supply and aortic aneurysm. The patient was successfully diagnosed with MSCTU with delayed excretory scans in spite of impaired function of the left kidney and uncommon pattern of ureteral dilatation. The postoperative outcome was beneficial for the patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Endorectal ultrasound can be used safely during pregnancy for local staging of CRC， tumor infiltration into the vagina. The preference method in pregnancy is MRI. Based on the recommendations of the American Radiological Society in 2013， the use of MRI is safe in all three trimesters of pregnancy. The use of a contrast agent is not recommended during pregnancy. Thoracic CT can be used for detecting pulmonary metastases. CRC may be diagnosed by endoscopy and confirmed with a biopsy.

However， because of the rare presentation， little is known about the pre-operative management. This case report describes a 72-year-old patient presenting with a swelling in the neck. The relevant literature is also reviewed.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Carotid Body Tumors (CBT) are rare neoplasms originating from neural crest cells， referred to as paragangliomas (extra-adrenal). They are not to be confused with pheochromocytomas， which are intra-adrenal neoplasms， due to the different implications for associated neoplasms， malignancy risk and genetic testing. They can be divided in sympathetic and parasympathetic paragangliomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Most CBTs are parasympathetic and non-functional. Only four to five percent of them are sympathetic and have catecholamine production 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. These extra-adrenal parasympathetic paragangliomas are found near arteries and cranial nerves of the branchial arches， with a cervicocephalic distribution. Paragangliomas are named after their site of origin.\n\n【4】They most commonly occur at the carotid bifurcation where they are known as carotid body tumors. The tumor is typically mobile in the lateral plane with restricted mobility in the cephalocaudal direction (Fontaine sign) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Additional sites of origin include the jugular bulb(jugular paraganglioma)， around the vagus nerve (vagal paraganglioma) and within the middle ear mucosa (tympanic paraganglioma).\n\n【5】If the tumors produce catecholamines， patients may complain of symptoms such as episodic headache， fluctuating hypertension and palpitations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Because of its close proximity to the carotid vessels and cranial nerves (X-XII)， enlargement of the tumor may cause progressive neurologic symptoms such as odynophagia， dysphagia or hoarseness of voice. Compression or erosion of surrounding tissue alone is not an acceptable proof of malignancy. Evidence of malignancy is only accepted when there is metastasis to non-neuroendocrine tissue， such as cervical lymph nodes， lung， liver and skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Local recurrence or lymph node metastasis after total resection of the primary mass， or by the detection of distant metastasis is also seen in malignant CBTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【7】For long time whether malignancy in CBTs can be seen on histologic characteristics. One study stated that the following histologic characteristics are suspicious for malignancy： central necrosis of the clusters， invasion of the vascular spaces，and mitoses \\[71.\n\n【8】However， others have considered that histology alone is unreliable to differentiate between benign and malignant CBTs. Only the presence of metastasis in lymph nodes or distant organs is acceptable proof of malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. If CBT metastasize， there is a very high rate of regional confinement (94%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Bone and lung metastasis are the most frequently reported distant metastases.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\nA 72-year-old female presented to the otolaryngology clinic with disturbing pain in the right|删除段之间换行|side of the neck for about six months. She also complained of a sore throat and general fatigue. Physical examination showed a 2 cm to cm swelling situated just below the mandibular angle， lateral to anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle. Fontaine sign， in which the swelling is more mobile in the horizontal plan compared to the vertical plane， was positive. The mass was non-tender， non-pulsatile with no increase in size with act of coughing or straining. No murmur was noticed on auscultation. Examination of all cranial nerves was normal.\n\nDue to the swelling and her general malaise an ultrasound was preformed demonstrating a solid mass at the region of carotid bifurcation. Further imaging evaluation with computed tomography angiography  and magnetic resonance imaging angiography showed a homogenously enhancing mass in the crotch|删除段之间换行|of the left carotid artery bifurcation. The mass causes splaying of the internal carotid and external carotid arteries， in keeping with the diagnosis of a carotid body tumor. On imaging the tumor was classified as Shamblin type II. Referral to the vascular surgeon for removal of the carotid body tumor was made.\n\n【12】Hormonal check-up showed no abnormalities in catecholamines.\n\n【13】Computed Tomography Angiography  and Magnetic Resonance Imaging angiography showed a homogenously enhancing mass in the crotch of the left carotid artery bifurcation. There is splaying of internal carotid and external carotid arteries， in keeping with the diagnosis of a carotid body tumor. On imaging the tumor was classified as a Shamblin type II .\n\n【14】After all this pre-operative investigations， the patient underwent surgery under general anesthesia. An incision was made along the anterior border of Sternocleidomastoid Muscle (SCM) and after careful incision of the platysma and the carotid sheath； the tumor was found .\n\n【15】The tumor was highly vascularized and therefore removed with the use of bipolar coagulation. Repeated nerve stimulator tests were essential and performed to ensure nerve preservation. Complete removal was obtained and no vascular reconstruction was needed. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a glomangioma， the histological equivalent of a Carotid Body Tumor(CBT). The postoperative period was uneventful， and the patient was discharged with no neurological deficits except some mild complaints of hypoesthesia on the right side ofher neck.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Therapy strategies\n\nIt is important to distinguish between secreting and non-|删除段之间换行|secreting tumors. A hormonal check-up for catecholamine should be under taken to avoid precipitating a catecholamine crisis. All patients should have negative biochemical results for catecholamine hypersecretion or undergo alpha blockade before older ionic contrast agents are administered for a CT scan. Current nonionic low-osmolality contrast agents are safe in patients with catecholamine secreting tumors， even without adrenergic blockade.\n\n【19】The majorities of CBT appear to be sporadic or can be hereditary(one-third to one-half of the cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. They have been linked to mutations in the genes encoding subunits of the Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme and are also seen in syndromes such as MEN2， Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) and neurofibromatosis type I通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Genetics will not be further discussed in this article， but germline mutation testing is advised for all patients with paragangliomas in the currentliterature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Surgical removal\n\n【22】Surgical excision has been the standard approach for removal of CBTs， especially when the CBTs are symptomatic. The standard surgical principles for carotid body tumor excision include wide surgical exposure，proximal and distal vascular control， identification and preservation of the neurovascular structures， careful tumor dissection from the external and internal carotid arteries， ligation of the external carotid arteries when necessary， and vascular shunting and grafting wherever necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【23】However， a high incidence of postoperative cranial nerve deficits has remained over the years. This raises the question whether the high rate of postoperative cranial nerve dysfunction favors observation rather than resection for asymptomatic tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Therefore， a conservative approach in an asymptomatic CBT is justifiable， although they eventually cause symptoms in nearly 75% of patients due to local growth， which makes removal more challenging.\n\n【25】Radiation therapy\n\n【26】Another option is radiation therapy. It is commonly performed in patients whoarepoor candidates for surgical excision or embolization， secondary to their age or co-morbid conditions. Complications of radiotherapy include inflammation of the external auditory canal and middle ear， osteoradionecrosis， cranial nerve neuropathies， carotid stenosis and direct injury to the brain tissue. Radiotherapy also makes subsequent head and neck surgeries highly challenging.\n\n【27】Despite limited experience， radiotherapy for paragangliomas appears to be helpful in cases with unresectable lesions， in high-risk patients，and as an adjunct to surgery for incompletely excised tumors or metastases. Earlier reports even have opted for the use of radiation therapy as the first choice of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，17\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Pre-operative techniques\n\n【29】Fine needle aspiration or an incisional biopsy is of little value an： for paragangliomas. Aspirates can easily be mistaken for many other neoplasms， and the procedure itselfbrings a high risk for hemorrhage at the operative site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Imaging\n\nHistorically Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) has been the golden diagnostic standard. With the advent of high resolution angiographic ComputedTomography (CTA) aniddMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) DSA has been replaced as the imaging|删除段之间换行|modalities of choice for detection of the carotid body tumors. However， preoperative angiography provides useful information about the vascular anatomy and its collateral circulation. This allows for careful planning if sacrifice of a major blood vessel is deemed necessary during surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Furthermore pre-operative tumor embolization has been used to shrink the tumor size and disconnect the tumor from its feeding vessels， decreasing complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【33】When patients are referred for atypical neck swelling， ultrasound is often the first acquired imaging modality. Carotid body tumors appear as a hypoechoic mass at carotid artery bifurcation and display prominent vascularization when examined with color Doppler. Displacement of the Internal (ICA) and External Carotid Arteries(ECA) is an important clue and should prompt further image evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Both CTA and MRA appearances are diagnostic. On CT， after intravenous contrast administration， carotid body tumors present as a solid homogenous intensely enhancing mass， located within the carotid bifurcation  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Seldomly heterogeneous pattern of enhancement can be seen due thrombi or hemorrhage in larger tumors. As a result of their hyper-vascularity， contrast enhancement is rapid and contrary to the gradual enhancement of nerve sheath tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Larger CBT will displace the internal and external carotid arteries with splaying of the vessels， the so-called lyre sign 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. While CT has a better special resolution， MRI better depicts the soft tissue components.\n\n【35】On T1-weighted images (T1WI) CBT are hypo- to isointense compared to muscle  and hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. A characteristic finding is the so called “salt and pepperappearance in larger lesions (>2 cm) on T1-weighted images. The “salt”phenomenon， although uncommon， is due to multiple punctuating hemorrhages inside the lesion. These subacute hemorrhages present as high signal intensity spots. The low signal intensity “pepper”component  is a result of multiple flow voids from intratumoral blood vessels. Similar to CT， there is vivid enhancement after contrast administration  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Classification sy stem s\n\n【37】The first classification system based on invasion of the carotid vessels was proposed in 1971 by Shamblin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【38】Because this classification does not predict neurological damage but only prognosticate surgical time and perioperative bleeding the modified Shamlin’s classification proposed by Luna-Ortiz is a more detailed classification system . According this classification， group I tumors are relatively small tumors minimally attached to carotid vessels. The group II tumors are more adherent to the adventitia but still removable without reconstruction of the vessels. The group III tumors encase the carotid vessels and often require arterial resection and grafting. Frequently type III tumors are larger， but this does not mean there is a direct relation between these two specifications. A smaller tumor can be classified as type II or III according to vessel involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，24\\]</u>. Luna et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> suggest that aCBT of any size， if intimately adherent to the vessels， should be classified as modified Shamblin class IIIb， whereas IIIa represents the original III as described by Shamblin. In many studies a cut-off size of four centimeters to classify between type I and type II or III tumors， because a correlation is known to exist between larger tumors， and neurologic damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【39】Arya et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> proposed pre-operative criteria to predict the Shamblin classification of CBTs on imaging by measuring the angle of contact from the center of the ICA to tumoral-edge as an assessment of vascular encasement. They defined type I：less than or equal to 180°； type II： greater than 180° and less than 270； and type III： greater than or equal to 270°. The degree of circumference of contact of the tumor with the external carotid artery or common carotid artery was not incorporated in this classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Recently in 2017， a new article stated that distance to the base of the skull is more predictive for cranial nerve lesion and the amount of perioperative blood loss than tumor volume， whereas tumor volume is significant correlated with blood loss alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24，26\\]</u>.\n\n【41】Conclusion\n\n【42】A carotid body tumor is a rare neuroendocrine tumor located at the carotid bifurcation. They are mostly benign but are often linked with a genetic syndrome. Therefore， genetic testing is advised in every patient presenting with a CBT. Malignancy cannot be confirmed by histopathological investigation， but can only be proven by metastasis into other tissue organs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Bony metastasis is a rare yet well-established occurrence in esophageal cancer； this literary search procured nine other published case reports ofisolated ring finger metastases from esophageal cancer. In addition to the patient's hospital course，report will discuss the diagnostic and prognostic implications of his unusual clinical finding， deliberate upon the proposed mechanisms of metastasis in the current medical literature， and via analysis of other published cases， this case report highlight a predilection of esophageal cancer metastasis to the ring finger.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】The incidence of esophageal cancer in the US remains relatively low， ranking as the 184 most common cancer diagnosis (1%)， however often portending a very poor prognosis when diagnosed， with the overall 5-year survival estimated only at 19.2%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. While many risk factors contribute to developing esophageal cancer， the ingestion of tobacco， especially of nitrosamines， is believed to have the highest correlated risk of esophageal cancer， both in the number and the duration of cigarettes smoked 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Esophageal cancer metastasis of the bone particularly that of acrometastasis； is presumed to be the rarest of their kind 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. As such， the pathophysiology of esophageal cancer and its presentation in the phalanges is limited in the medical literature， and warrants further explanation. These unexpected metastases to the hand and phalanges are more commonly from lung tumors and less likely to originate from the gastrointestinal system.\n\n【5】These lesions can masquerade in a variety of clinical presentations， from fungating masses， cystic lesions， to herpetic whitlow. And their clinical significance can vary anywhere from firm to soft， tender or non-tender， asymptomatic to functionally debilitating. As a result， acrometastases lend themselves to diagnostic puzzles. X-ray findings have shown completely dissolved bone， which may be a hallmark of this type of metastasis. Here we present a case where esophageal metastasis to the right ring finger was found on exam as firm， non-tender and erythematous mass around the proximal interphalangeal joint.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A middle-aged man with a past medical history of 10 pack-years of cigarette use was evaluated for dysphagia of two month's duration. CT scan of his chest showed a right subcarinal and paraesophageal mass measuring 6.5 cm x2.9 cm × 5.4 cm which was biopsied via bronchoscopy. His lymph node excisional biopsy showed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and his right endobronchial mucosal biopsy showed rare focal atypical cells.\n\n【8】Squamous cell esophageal carcinoma was initially diagnosed as cT4bN2M0， but due to his calf and ring finger erythema and swelling which were later confirmed to be metastases， he was actually cT4bN2M1-stage IV-B at diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Figures 1 and 2 shows the radiographs displaying expansile； destructive mass lesions within the right fibula and right fourth middle phalanx.\n\n【9】In addition， he had two bronchoesophageal fistulas which required esophageal stenting via esophagogastroduodenoscopy， which showed two ulcerated mucosal defects noted at 27 cm and33 cm from the incisors， as well as mucous seen oozing from these sites which confirmed the fistula locations. A non-obstructing Schatzki ring was also present during the examination.\n\n【10】His case was discussed with our multidisciplinarytumorboard and was recommended for treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. His oncologist planned to start treatment， however the patient soon developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation and was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. Emergent bronchoscopy demonstrated near-complete neoplastic occlusion of the distal right mainstem bronchus which caused a post-obstructive pneumonia. A second tracheobronchoscopy was performed to dilate the right mainstem bronchus as well as debulk some of the invading tumor. Figure 3 depicts a patent right mainstem bronchus status-post airway dilation and tumor debulking.\n\n【11】He was extubated， treated for the pneumonia， and discharged home. His family was eager to start chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin， however， due to the rapid progression of his disease and subsequent loss of airway anatomy， hospice was recommended.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Metastases to the hand are uncommon in all cancers. It is estimated that only 0.1% of metastatic disease originating from any type of neoplasm reveals itself in the hand 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. This is likely because the hand bones are distally located， contain little red marrow， have minimal capillary networks， and sluggish blood flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Esophageal carcinoma most commonlymetastasizes toliver，bones，lungs，adrenal glands， and brain. In one review of unexpected esophageal cancer metastases by Shaheen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>，approximately 9% of published cases had metastases to the extremities. The 60% of extremity metastas cases were squamous cell carcinomas， and tended to be later stage cancers with 80% at stage III or IV at time of diagnosis.\n\n【14】The pathophysiology of bone metastasis in esophageal cancer warrants further elucidation. In a 2013 review of 221 reported cases of metastases to the hand by Afshar et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， 72 originated from the lungs and 55 originated from gastrointestinal tumors (esophageal， stomach， or colorectal). In 30% of reported cases， hand metastasis was present at the time of diagnosis. The occurrence of unexpected metastasis to distal anatomy like the fingers is not fully explained by lymphatic or venous routes alone. Although tumors almost always metastasize via veins rather than arteries， the unexpected presentation of these metastases may be explained by an arterial route. The esophagus is supplied by three groups of arteries， the inferior thyroid artery， thoracic aortic branches， and the gastric artery， which offer several metastatic routes. Another proposed mechanism of metastasis to the hand is from pre-existing lung involvement with the primary esophageal tumor. Compared to other organs， the lungs VSt contain the most extensive access to the systemic arterial supply， whereas in non-pulmonary cancers， hepatic and pulmonary capillary beds usually prevent the hematogenous spread of cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Thus， our patient's lung involvement may have been a major contributor to his acrometastasis. Another interesting proposed mechanism of acrometastasis is the predilection of distal anatomic structures to trauma， especially the hand. Trauma releases chemotactic factors and prostaglandins which may make the digits more hospitable to metastasis.\n\n【15】Considering these pathways helps one understand the way in which acrometastasis from esophageal cancer can occur in the fingers and hand. After review of established case reports， there appears to be a peculiar， preferential pattern of esophageal metastasis to the ring finger， as shown in Figure删除4:<u> 4</u>. This is observed in our patient as well as in nine other case reports删除4:<u> 3，6，8</u>.\n\n【16】have both diagnostic and prognostic implications. It may serve as a diagnostic sign for esophageal cancer in patients who present with other red flag symptoms， such as unintentional weight loss， symptomaticanemia，hematemesis， dysphagia， orpersistent vomiting. Unfortunately， acrometastasis signifies a more disseminated disease process and is a major cause of treatment failure in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. And because bone metastasis is believed to portend a poor prognosis in comparison to other metastatic sites， the therapeutic goal of palliation is warranted， which may include analgesia， radiation or even amputation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although further validation is needed， the clinical presentation of digital metastasis， particularly to the fourth metacarpal， may be an indicator of esophageal cancer with lung inyolvement.\n\n【17】1.Noone AM， HowladerN，Krapcho M， Miller D， Brest A， Yu M， et al.

It was first described in 1948 by Rose 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is characterized by the presence of inflammation of the appendicular remnant， which should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain and with a history of appendectomy in order to avoid complications that can compromise the patient's life， there is evidence of some factors that can favor an incomplete appendicectomy， from a complicated appendicitis， an inadequate exposure， surgical technique in which a remnant >5 mm is left and a long appendix 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【7】The clinical picture can be acute or chronic， presenting from 2 months to 50 years post-appendectomy， sometimes the history of appendectomy can delay the diagnosis allowing the progression of complications such as perforation， abscess or peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>.\n\n【8】The recommended imaging tests are ultrasound and CT of the abdomen and it is important that radiologists become familiar with this pathology，taking into account the most common entities that can be confused with stump appendicitis such as an epiploic appendix， terminal ileitis， inflammatory colitis， CT findings are generally those of a typical appendicitis， thickening of the cecal wall， striation of the pericecal fat， free pericecal fluid and in some cases the appendicular remnant can be visualized as a tubular structure with or without adjacent collection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，5，6\\]</u> the definitive diagnosis is made during the surgical procedure， when observing the appen dicular remnant.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 36-year-oldmale with a history of laparoscopic appendectomy 18 years ago came to the emergency department with abdominal pain of three days of evolution， cramping， located in the epigastrium and radiating to the right iliac fossa accompanied by abdominal distension and hyporexia， during the physical examination a painful abdomen was palpated， with muscular resistance， rebound positivo and McBurney positivo， abdominal tomography was requested in which inflammatory changes compatible with acute appendicitis were reported， he underwent laparoscopic surgery finding a plastron in the right iliac fossa with an appendicular stump which was released and resected with endoloops draining collection in the pelvic hollow ， the patient had a favorable postoperative course and was discharged from the hospital 24 h later without complications.

This study aimed to compare the results of trimodality therapy with CRT alone in patients with locally advanced resectable SCC.\n\n【2】Patients and Methods： Patients with locally advanced resectable SCC of esophagus were eligible. For trimodality， patients received surgery and preoperative/postoperative chemoradiation. In CRT alone group， patients only received radiation and chemotherapy. Local tumor control，3-year survival and treatment-related mortality were assessed.\n\n【3】Results： 184 consecutive patients were analyzed. 109 were treated with trimodality therapy， 75received CRT alone depended on patients'willing. 17.4% of the resected patients in trimodality group had locoreginal recurrent disease versus 30.7% in the CRT alone group (P=0.036). The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 53.8% versus 33.5% (P= 0.019)， and the overall survival (OS) was 51.2% versus 39.8% (P= 0.011)， for patients received trimodality and CRT alone， respectively. Treatment-related mortality was 3.7% in trimodality group compared with 1.3% in definitive CRT group (P=0.650). There was no significant difference in the 3-year OS in patients receiving a 50.4Gy radiation dose compared with >50.4 Gy radiation dose in CRT alone group (45.3% vs. 36.4%， P=0.927).\n\n【4】Conclusions： Compared with CRT alone， trimodality therapy appeared to have superior local control， PFS and OS， with similar treatment-related mortality for the treatment of patients with SCC of esophagus. The role of surgery could not be replaced by CRT alone， even with increased radiation dose.\n\n【5】Keywords： Oesophageal squamouscell carcinoma；TTrimodality therapy； Preoperative chemoradiotherapy； Postoperative chemoradiotherapy； Definitive chemoradiotherapy\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Esophageal cancer is the sixth most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide and is more common in the developing nations通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Esophageal cancers are histologically classified as Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma. SCC is the major histology in Eastern Europe and Asia， and 95% of esophageal cancer is pathologically diagnosed as SCC in China通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Radiochemotherapy and surgical resection are standard therapies for patients with locally advanced resectable SCC of the esophagus.\n\nNumerous randomized trials have investigated the impact of radiotherapy dose modifications， combined-modality therapy， and preoperative/postoperative administration of adjuvant therapy in an effort to improve effectiveness without compromising safety， reducing the incidence of local recurrence， and prolonging survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-7\\]</u>. For example， results from the multicenter phase III randomized trial (CROSS study)， the largest trial in its class， showed that preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with carboplatin and paclitaxel significantly improved overall survival(OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) compared to surgery alone in patients with resectable (T2-3， N0-1， M0) esophageal or esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancers通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Similarly， the results of|删除段之间换行|two meta-analyses have shown that preoperative CRT combined with surgery significantly reduced 3-year mortality and locoregional recurrence when compared with surgery alone通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. On the other hand， the efficacy of postoperative CRT compared to surgery alone has not been demonstrated in a randomized trial in patients with esophageal cancer. However， in retrospective analyses， the addition of postoperative CRT has been associated with survival benefit in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer， such as those that are lymph node-positive and with deeper primary tumor invasion(pT3， pT4)， compared with surgery alone通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-13\\]</u>. Finaly， two randomized trials comparing trimodality therapy with definitive CRT demonstrated no OS benefit with the addition of esophagectomy to CRT通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>， especially in patients with locally advanced SCC of the esophagus who experience response to initial CRT通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Therefore， the optimal multimodality therapy for locally advanced SCC of the esophagus is still unclear.\n\n【9】This retrospective study was designed to determine the best approach to administer multimodality therapyto patients with locally advanced SCC of the esophagus. The primary aim was to determine if the addition of surgical resection to CRT decreases local recurrence and prolongs in survival compared with CRT alone. Furthermore， we sought to assess the factors that may affect survival and recurrence in patients with locally advanced SCC ofthe esophagus.\n\n【10】Materials and Methods\n\n【11】Patient population\n\n【12】Patients with locally advanced resectable (cT3， potentially resectable cT4 or N+) SCC of the esophagus who were treated with preoperative CRT or postoperative CRT plus esophagectomy(trimodality therapy group)， or only radiation with chemotherapy(CRT alone group)， between April 2011 and November 2015 were included. Patients were included if they were aged 18 to 75 years， with an ECOG/WHO performance score <2， and showed<10% weightloss. Patients were excluded if their esophageal cancer was located in the cervical esophagus， if this was their second malignancy， if they were identified as receiving irradiation to a site other than the esophagus， or if they received radiotherapy without concurrent chemotherapy. The patient population consisted partially of patients enrolled in the ZTOG1201 trial， a randomized controlled trial in which eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive preoperative CRT plus surgery or surgery plus postoperative CRT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Chemoradiotherapy\n\n【14】Chemotherapy consisted of concurrent paclitaxel (50 mg/m’of body-surface area) and carboplatin (intravenous carboplatin \\[AUC 2mg/ml per min\\]) targeted at an area under the curve of two， starting on days 1， 8， 15， 22， 29， and 36 during the first and sixth weeks of radiotherapy in the preoperative CRT group and the CRT alone group. Patients in the postoperative CRT group mostly underwent postoperative CRT at 4-6 weeks after surgery. Chemotherapy in the postoperative CRT group consisted of two cycles of sequential paclitaxel (150 mg/m’ of body-surface area) and carboplatin(intravenous carboplatin \\[AUC 5 mg/mL per min\\]) targeted at an area under the curve of five， starting on week 3， and week 6 after radiotherapy.\n\nAll patients were treated with external-beam radiation using an intensity-modulated radiation therapy technique. Gross tumor volume was drawn on each relevant slice of the planning CT and was defined by the primary tumor and any enlarged regional lymph|删除段之间换行|nodes. The planning target volume (PTV) provided a proximal and distal margin of 4 cm and a radial margin of 1.3 cm around the gross tumor volume. Individually shaped beams were used in each field by multileaf collimators to ensure optimal sparing of normal tissue. The daily prescription dose of 1.8 to 2.0 Gy was specified by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurement50/62 reference point， and the 95% isodose had to encompass the entire PTV. The maximum dose to the PTV was not to exceed the prescription dose by <7%. Tissue density inhomogeneity correction was used.\n\n【16】Patients were required to have complete information regarding the total radiation planning， as well as the chemotherapy regimen. We limited our analysis to patients who received radiation doses of41.4 to 50.4 Gy in the preoperative CRT group， 45 to 50.4 Gy in the postoperative CRT group， and 50 to 64.8 Gy in the definitive CRT group， as these represent the expected ranges for preoperative/postoperative to definitive radiation doses. All patients received the same chemotherapy regimen with paclitaxel and carboplatin. The delivery of concurrent CRT was determined by only including patients who were identified as receiving their chemotherapy within a1-week window before or after the initiation of radiotherapy.\n\n【17】Surgery\n\n【18】Patients in the trimodality therapy group preferably underwent surgery at 4-6 weeks after completion of preoperative CRT， or as soon as possible after randomization in postoperative subgroup. The final choice of surgical procedure including minimally invasive oesophagectomy (MIE) or open oesophagectomy (OE) with a intrathoracic gastric tube reconstruction (Ivor Lewis procedure) or neck anastomosis (Mckeown procedure) was at the surgeon's discretion， depending on tumor localization， patient characteristics. Gastric-tube reconstruction with a cervical anastomosis was the preferred technique. A wide local excision of the N1 lymph nodes， including standard excision of the celiac nodes， was carried out.\n\n【19】Assessment of recurrence\n\n【20】Relapses were classified as locoregional or distant. Locoregional relapses were defined as recurrences at the site of the primary tumor or locoregional lymph nodes. Lymph node recurrences at the celiac trunk or in the supraclavicular region were also considered to be locoregional. Distant recurrences were defined as non-regional lymph node recurrences， systemic metastases， malignant pleural effusions， or peritoneal metastases. Most patients suspected of experiencing recurrence underwent a CT scan of the thorax and abdomen or an endoscopy. If necessary， cytology or histology was obtained. Ifa second recurrence was detected within 4 weeks after the first occurrence， it was considered to be synchronous. Localization and date of identification of all locoregional and distant recurrences were recorded.\n\n【21】Statistical analysis\n\n【22】Demographic details were compared between patients who received trimodality treatment or CRT alone using the x2 test， the Fisher exact test， and the Mann-Whitney test， where appropriate. Multivariate Cox regression of OS and tumor recurrence was performed to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using these same covariates， excluding age， gender， WHO/ECOG score， tumor location， tumor length， T staging， N staging， radiation dose， and treatment approach. Kaplan-Meier analyses of OS were performed comparing patients who received\n\n【23】Table 1： Patient Characteristics (n=184).\n\n| Characteristic  | Trimodality therapy (n=109)  |  | CRT alone (n=75)  |  | Pvalue  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Characteristic  | No.  | %  | No.  |  |  |\n| Age， years  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Median  | 59  |  | 61  |  | 0.010  |\n| Range  | 42-74  |  | 41-75  |  |  |\n| Gender  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Male  | 104  | 95.4  | 62  | 82.7  | 0.004  |\n| Female  | 5  | 4.6  | 13  | 17.3  |  |\n| WHO performance status score  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 0  | 5  | 4.6  | 6  | 8  | 0.672  |\n| 1  | 104  | 95.4  | 69  | 92.0  |  |\n| Tumor location  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Proximal thire  | 4  | 3.7  | 20  | 26.7  | 0.037  |\n| Middle third  | 58  | 53.2  | 34  | 45.3  | (Proximal and Middle vs. Distal)  |\n| Distal third  | 47  | 43.1  | 21  | 28.0  |  |\n| Tumor length (cm)  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| c5  | 36  | 33  | 47  | 62.7  | <0.001  |\n| 25  | 73  | 67.0  | 28  | 37.3  |  |\n| Clinical T category  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| T1 or T2  | 25  | 22.9  | 13  | 17.3  | 0.356  |\n| T3 or T4  | 84  | 77.1  | 62  | 82.7  |  |\n| Clinical N category  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| NO  | 20  | 18.3  | 8  | 10.7  | 0.154  |\n| N1  | 89  | 81.7  | 67  | 89.3  |  |\n| Radiation dose (Gy)  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| <50.4  | 30  | 27.5  |  |  |  |\n| 50.4  | 79  | 72.5  |  |  |  |\n| 50-50.4  |  |  | 28  | 37.3  |  |\n| \\>50.4  |  |  | 47  | 62.7  |  |\n\nCRT - Chemoradiation Therapy； WHO - World Health Organization|删除段之间换行|definitive radiation to a dose of 50 to 50.4 Gy with those who received>50.4 Gy.

The median age was 60 years old(range， 41 to 75 years). Patients undergoing trimodality therapy were more likely to be younger， male gender， have a longer tumor length， and a tumorlocation in the distal third of the esophagus. Additional details on patient characteristics are listed in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n【29】Analysis of recurrence\n\n【30】After a median follow-up of 36 months (range， 6 to 53 months) and a median survival time of 31 months (95% CI： 20.2-41.8\n\n【31】months)， 33.9% (37/109) of the resected patients in the trimodality therapy group had recurrent disease versus 50.7% (38/75) in the CRT alone group. There was a significant difference between the two treatment groups in terms of tumor recurrence (P= 0.023). Only17.4%(19/109) of the resected patients in the trimodality arm had locoregional recurrent disease versus 30.7%(23/75) in the definitive CRT arm (P =0.036). Moreover， fewer patients (16.5%， 18/109) in the trimodality arm had distant failure compared to those in the CRT alone arm (18.7%，14/75)， although this difference was not significant(P=0.705).\n\n【32】Table 2 lists the univariate and multivariate Cox Regression Analyses for tumor recurrence.

In the trimodality treatment group， the 3-year OS rate was51.2%(95% CI： 36.1-66.3%) and the median survival time was not reached； while in the CRT alone group， the 3-year OS rate was 39.8%\n\n【43】(95% CI： 26.7-52.9%) with a median survival time of 22.0 months(95%： CI 17.1 to 26.9 months； P= 0.011， ).

These who received 50 to 50.4 Gy had a median OS of 26.0 months (95% CI： not reached) and a 3-year OS of 45.3%(95% CI： 24.7-65.9%). However， the survival was not significantly|删除段之间换行|different (P=0.927) to those receiving radiation doses >50.4 Gy， who had a median survival of 22.0 months (95% CI： 20.2-23.8 months) and a 3-year OS of 36.4% (95% CI： 19.4-53.1%). Figure 3 depicts the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for patients who received CRT alone by doses. In multivariate analysis， an increased radiation dose was not associated with OS： only younger age was associated with inferior survival (HR= 2.941； 95% CI： 1.441-5.988； P=0.003). Further details of the multivariate analysis are shown in Table删除4:<u> 3</u>.\n\n【45】Discussion\n\n【46】The present study indicated that adding surgery to CRT for the treatment of clinical resectable，locally advanced SCC ofthe esophagus significantly decreased the local recurrence rates， prolonged PFS and OS， with similar treatment-related mortality for the treatment compared with CRT alone. In the trimodality treatment group， the 3-year OS was 51.2% (95% CI： 36.1-66.3%) similar to the result achieved for preoperative CRT in the CROSS trial (51%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， which were better than that achieved in the CRT alone group (39.8%，95%CI： 26.7-52.9%).\n\nSurgery is a major component of treatment for resectable disease. Based on data from the National Cancer Database of America， trimodality therapy was associated with improved OS (P<0.001)， with a median OS of 35.6 months and 3-year OS of 49.6%，compared|删除段之间换行|to patients receiving CRT (median and 3-year OS were 16.8 months and 26.8%， respectively)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The effect of adding surgery to CRT in patients with locally advanced SCC of esophagus has also been evaluated in two randomized trials通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>. Stahl et al. randomized172 patients to either induction chemotherapy followed by CRT and surgery or induction chemotherapy followed by CRT通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The 2-year PFS rate was better in the surgery group (64.3%) than in the CRT group (40.7%)， without significantly affecting 3-year OS (31% vs. 24%， respectively).However， this study was prematurely terminated due to lack of accrual. On the other hand， Bedenne et al. (FFCD 9102 trial) showed that adding surgery to CRT provided no benefit compared with treatment with additional CRT， especially in patients with locally advanced SCC of the esophagus who responded to initial CRT通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However， this trial suffered from suboptimal study design， indeed，the results of non-randomized patients in the FFCD 9102 phase III trial indicated that OS did not differ between responders to induction CRT and patients having salvage surgery after clinical failure of CRT通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Moreover， in a recent prospective study that compared the outcomes of surveillance versus surgical resection in patients with esophageal cancer achieving complete clinical response after preoperative CRT， surgical resection was independently associated with less recurrence(32.7% vs. 50.8%；P=0.021) and better median survival (83 months vs. 31 months； P= 0.001)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Similarly， Patients who completed TMT ( chemoradiotherapy \\[CRT\\] and surgery)had the best local control in a Single-Institution Experience conducted by 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>Sio TT et al. 5-year local control was 82% for TMT， while 60% for CRT and40% for PTMT patients who began treatment with trimodality intent but did not undergo surgery groups (P<0.001).\n\n【48】Regarding if the role of adding surgery could be replaced by escalated radiation dose in the CRT alone group. The current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommended ranges for preoperative， postoperative and definitive radiation are41.4 to 50.4 Gy， 45 to 50.4 Gy， and 50 to 50.4 Gy， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Despite the lack of significant evidence supporting radiation dose escalation， we found that radiation doses exceeding 50.4 Gy were used in 58.7% of patients in the CRT alone group in this retrospective study due to the historical situation in China. However， we found no survival benefit to a dose escalation of >50.4 Gy compared with those receiving a 50 to 50.4 Gy radiation dose. A previous study on the use of definitive CRT (the RTOG 8501 trial) showed that the 5-year OS was 26% in patients receiving chemotherapy with radiotherapy (to a total dose of 50 Gy) and 0% when radiotherapy (to total dose of 64Gy) was used alone通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Owing to the low OS and high local failure rate with definitive CRT， the Intergroup 0123 trial subsequently randomized patients to receiving the same chemotherapy with either50.4 Gy or 64.8 Gy of radiation通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However， the trial was stopped early after an interim analysis showed the 2-year median survival (13vs. 18.1 months) and locoregional failure rates (56% vs. 52%) were not significantly different between the high-dose and standard-dose arms. Similarly， our multivariate analysis indicated no differences in OS and recurrence based on the radiation dose delivered in both the trimodality and CRT alone groups. As no subsequent studies have revealed a significant benefit to dose escalation exceeding 50.4 Gy in CRT alone group， our study indicated that the role of surgery could not be replaced by CRT alone， even with increased radiation dose for locally advanced SCC of the esophagus.\n\nThe current study does have some limitations. For example， as this was a retrospective study and only esophageal SCC patients in China were recruited， we may have introduced selection bias and we lack a|删除段之间换行|proper intent-to-treat analysis. Furthermore， while the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is dramatically increasing in Western countries， the results of our study should not be generalized to apply to North American and European patients until a randomized study including esophageal adenocarcinoma patients confirms our results. Moreover，based on our study， its unclear what is the potential value of additional locoregional therapy with surgery in patients with clinical complete response to CRT.We also had no idea about the timing and necessity of oesophagectomy in (all) patients. In the future， molecular biology techniques probably may enable to improve prognostic stratification， thereby allowing us to determine the types of patients who benefit from surgical therapy and show improved OS通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22-25\\]</u>. In addition， we did not analyze whether patients received salvage therapies， such as salvage esophagectomy， in the CRT alone group， which may have affected survival outcomes. Further investigation of the innovative multidisciplinary management (i.e.，preoperative CRT followed by salvage esophagectomy) for patients withlocallyadvanced esophageal cancer is warranted. Indeed， this approach is currently being explored in Netherlands by investigators of the preSANO trial， clinical response evaluation after neoadjuvantchemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer (NTR4834)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【50】In conclusion， adding surgery to CRT appears to have superior local control， PFS and OS， with similar treatment-related mortality for the treatment of patients with SCC of esophagus. The role of surgery could not be replaced by CRT alone， even with increased radiation dose.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

One gram of acetaminophen was self-administered with short lasting relief. He complained oftransient bilateral visual loss lasting several minutes at the beginning of the headache. He denied any history of recent or remotetrauma， as well as previous headache or migraine diagnosis. The patient suffered from a stable chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy in treatment with prednisolone 20 mg daily for the last 2 years. Upon admission his blood pressure was 125/84 mmHg， heart rate 72 bpm， respiratory rate 18 pm， afebrile and a general physical examination within normal limits. On neurological examination he was awake， orientated with normal cognitive function. His neuro-ophthalmologic examination was within normal limits， including visual acuity. Cranial nerves showed no deficit.\n\n【10】Axial cut showing a left occipital sulcal linear hyperdensity (red arrow).\n\n【11】A： MRI FLAIR sequence showing a left occipital sulcal linear hyperintensity(Red arrow).

His sensory examination revealed no abnormalities and cerebellar signs were absent. There was no evidence of meningeal signs or neck stiffness.\n\n【13】A non-contrast brain Computed Tomography (CT) (Siemens128-channel CT) was performed showing a linear hyperdensity in the left calcarine sulcus . Laboratory work up including platelets， prothrombin time， and activated partial thromboplastin time were within normal limits. A nasopharyngeal swap smear for SARS-CoV-2 virus was negative. Further work up with a contrast enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI Phillips 1.5Tesla) showed hyperintensity on FLAIR 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery)</u> sequences and hypointensity on GRE (Gradient echo) sequences in the left calcarine sulcus with no overlying images of CCM or Arterio-Venous Malformation (AVM) . Contrast enhanced arterial and venous brain MRI angiography(Phillips 1.5 tesla) showed hypoplasia of the left anterior cerebral artery and a fetal origin of the right posterior cerebral artery without evidence of an arterial-venous malformation or fistula (Image 3A). The venous phase revealed hypoplasia of the right lateral sinus and an image compatible with a DVA in the left subcortical occipital region.

Oral acetaminophen 1 gr TD was initiated with headache resolution within 48 h. On day 5 after admission， an arterial and venous brain conventional angiography was performed at another institution showing the same results as in the initial MRIs(Images not available). The patient remained without headache or visual symptoms and was discharged home with acetaminophen1 g orally in case of headache， prednisolone 20 mg 8 am for his underlying disease and neurological outpatient follow up. The patient was lost to follow-up， but there was no record of new admissions to the emergency room in our institution.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】The patient presented a headache syndrome with red flags： acute new onset headache with neurologic symptoms. Initial neuroimaging studies showed left occipital calcarine sulcus SAH. Further work up led to the conclusion of a secondary headache syndrome： An occipital sulcus SAH due to an isolated DVA. Sudden or acute severe headache and transient focal symptoms are not unusual in sulcus or convexity SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. What is unusual in this case is its cause， the location of the DVA and the presumed pathophysiological mechanism of bleeding.\n\nIn a study of 23 patients in Argentina， the clinical manifestations of convexity SAH due to diverse etiologies included headache(60%)， sensory and/or motor symptoms (47%)， and epileptic seizures (30%). Six (26%) patients had thunderclap headache. Khurram et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> described a series of 41 patients with convexity SAH transient neurological symptoms in 63% and the etiologies included： Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) (39%)， Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS)(17%)，cerebral venous thrombosis (10%)， intracranial atherosclerotic disease (10%) and posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (5%). The cause was not identified in 20% of the cases. Kumar et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> reported in|删除段之间换行|29 patients with convexity SAH abrupt onset severe headache as the main manifestation in patients <60 years of age and in relation to SCVR. In patients >60 years of age the main cause was CAA with transient sensory and motor symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【21】DVAs are usually asymptomatic but have been associated with ICH. The vast majority of ICH are intraparenchymal and the few SAH reported in the literature have been associated with venous infarctions， intraparenchymal hemorrhages， other brain vascular abnormalities and one case of basal cisterns SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3，4，7-9，14\\]</u>. Although DVAs are almost exclusively supratentorial， their most frequent location is the frontal lobe， only a few of them have been reported in the occipital lobe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3\\]</u>.\n\n【22】There are three described pathophysiological mechanism which could explain bleeding of a DVA： Imbalances of blood inflow/outflow， venous thrombosis/stenosis and cryptogenic/idiopathic. The latter being the less commonly reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. An imbalance with increased blood inflow and/or decreased outflow in the DVA can cause increased pressure and rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20-22\\]</u>. The increased inflow maybe due to an Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) that drains into the DVA or micro shunts within it 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20-23\\]</u>. The decreased outflow can be due to a remote increase of pressure in the brain's venous system， as it occurs in AVMs or arteriovenous fistulas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，24\\]</u>. Obstruction of the venous channel of the anomaly， as in cases of thrombosis or stenosis of the DVA or the cerebral vein into which it drains， can cause increase venous pressure or rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20-27\\]</u>. Lastly， a small percentage of DVAs bleed and extensive neuroimaging work up do not reveal any additional abnormality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20-27\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Our patient underwent extensive neuroimaging diagnostic work up. A non-contrast CT， contrast enhanced MRI， contrast enhanced brain arterial/venous MRI and brain arterial/venous conventional digital substraction angiography showed only an occipital DVA with an overlying sulcus SAH. The final diagnosis made was a secondary headache syndrome due to a sulcus SAH with an isolated symptomatic occipital DVA with an idiopathic bleeding mechanism.\n\n【24】The management ofICH or SAH associated with a DVA depends on the symptoms， size，location， and pathophysiological mechanism of the bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，28\\]</u>. As the patient presented with occipital sulcus SAH， with mild symptoms that rapidly resolved， with an idiopathic bleeding mechanism， a low probability of recurrence was entertained. Symptomatic management with oral simple analgesics and outpatient follow-up was prescribed.\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\n【26】To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of a sulcus SAH due to an isolated occipital DVA with an idiopathic mechanism of bleeding. Sulcus/convexity SAH is in the differential diagnosis of sudden or severe headache with transient neurological symptoms. DVAs could be a rare cause of sulcus or convexity SAH. Finally， in the presence of a symptomatic DVA with ICH， it is important to understand the bleeding mechanism to guide treatment decisions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

CNS metastases often cause significant morbidity and survival after diagnosis is dismal. Though stereotactic radio surgery has improved the outlook for some ofthese patients， there remains a need to develop additional therapies to control brain disease， especially with recent advancements in control of extra-CNS tumor. Systemic chemotherapy with Bevacizumab， an angiogenesis inhibitor， has shown promising activity in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Studies have shown that initial concern for excessive risk of CNS bleeding was unfounded and bevacizumab is now approved as second line treatment for glioblastoma. Here we present a case of metastatic lung cancer to the brain treated with multiple local and systemic therapies including Bevacizumab with over 4 years of control of his CNS disease. We also review the evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of Bevacizumab in this setting.\n\n【2】Keywords： Bevacizumab； CNS metastasis； NSCLC； Vascular endothelial growth factor\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Central nervous system metastases are one of the most common complications of cancer. The exact incidence of this complication is unknown but population-based studies have estimated the incidence of clinically detectable metastatic brain tumors as between 7 and 14 persons per 100，000populations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Based on these calculations Fox et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> estimated that over 43，000 patients were diagnosed with brain metastases in the United States in 2010， and autopsy studies suggest that the actual incidence may have exceeded 250，000 when patients with sub-clinical disease are included. This represents a significant burden of disease that is expected to rise as better therapies to control systemic disease result in improved overall survival.\n\n【5】Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and Central Nervous System(CNS) metastasis is common in advanced lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Approximately 20% to 25% of patients with advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) have brain metastases at diagnosis. A recent study showed a median survival of 10 months with use of radio surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Current therapeutic options available for CNS metastasis include whole brain radiation， surgical resection， radio surgery and stereotactic radiation depending upon the number， location and size of brain metastases. However， in spite of the increasing number of therapeutic options for brain metastases，long term survivors are rare， with five year Overall Survival (OS) for stage IV disease less than five percent， the number is even less with patient with brain metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Systemic chemotherapy traditionally has a limited role in the treatment of brain metastasis. The Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) is widely considered to limit chemotherapypenetration into CNS though the mechanism for this is not clear and some studies have questioned the role of BBB in this setting. Most chemotherapy agents have limited brain penetration due to their large molecular size， and agents with good brain penetration such as temozolomide have poor activity against primary lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this report， we present a patient with adenocarcinoma of the lung and multiple CNS metastases who enjoved an extended interval free of CNS recurrence while treated with systemic chemotherapy and bevacizumab.\n\n【7】Lobe\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 47-year-old African American non-smoker male with no past medical history presented with right side weakness and headache. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed a homogeneously enhancing intra-axial lesion within the posterior right frontal lobe nearthe falx with extensive vasogenic edema  and effacement of the overlying cortical sulci and a second 2 mm enhancing lesion centered within the cortex of the left frontal lobe was also noted. CT scan of chest showed a 3.7 cm ×2.5 cm lung lesion and an incidental finding of Pulmonary Embolism (PE). No other sites of disease were present on FDG PET/CT. He was started on anticoagulation， and biopsy of the lung lesion showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma oflung. Fluorescent in situ hybridization for EGFR and KRAS was negative and the specimen was insufficient for ALK analysis. His brain metastases were treated with stereotactic radiation therapy， 20 gray in one fraction to the left frontal lobe lesion and 35Gray in five fractions to the right frontal lobe lesion. He then began chemotherapy with Cisplatin and Docetaxel for treatment of his primary tumor.\n\n【10】MRI of the brain 3 months following radio surgery showed decreased size of the treated lesions but a new 2 mm left posterior temporal lesion， which was treated with 20 Gy in 1 fraction. PET/CT scan after 4 cycles of chemotherapy showed decreased size of his lung primary. A brain MRI done 5 month after diagnosis showed a response of his treated metastases with no new lesions . However， a brain MRI done 4 months later showed multiple (>6) new lesions， and he was treated with 37.5 gray of whole brain radiation in 15 fractions， followed by a radiosurgery boost to 3 lesions that persisted on follow-up imaging.\n\n【11】A subsequent brain MRI done 4 months later (17 months after diagnosis) showed 10 newenhancing lesions， all of which were treated with radio surgery. PET/CT at that time showed increased disease burden in the chest as well as new metastatic foci in the left anterior chest wall，left shoulder， acetabuli， and left adrenal gland.\n\n【12】He was started on carboplatin， pemetrexed and Bevacizumab with good tolerance. After completion of four cycles of chemotherapy(22 months from diagnosis) CT/PET showed resolution of increased FDG uptake in the mediastinum， left chest wall， left axilla， left adrenal gland， bilateral acetabula， and decreased activity in the lung. He received two more cycles of combination chemotherapy and then was placed on maintenance therapy with Bevacizumab and pemetrexed. Pemetrexed was discontinued due to insurance issues after 6 additional cycles and he continued Bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg every three weeks for 10 additional cycles.\n\n【13】Pemetrexed was added again (six month after it was dropped for insurance issue and 36 month after the original diagnosis) due to progression of systemic disease. He received 15 additional cycles of Pemetrexed along with Bevacizumab with good control of disease until further progression in lung disease and he underwent stereotactic radio surgery to his primary lung tumor. His systemic therapy was held in anticipation of his lung radio surgery to lung lesion. Brain MRI before chest radiotherapy continued to show stable disease however another brain MRI at about 48 months after initial presentation showed new enhancing lesion in high right parietal lobe and abnormal asymmetric enhancement within the superior right orbit， which encases the superior and lateral rectus muscles. Throughout the time between the MRI brain at about 16 months after initial presentation and 48 months after presentation he was maintained on Bevacizumab treatment for the most part and none of the eight MRI brains obtained during this time period show any progression in CNS disease. He maintained excellent functional life with full time work and family life .\n\nHe had another 18 Gray stereotactic radiotherapy to parietal lobe lesion and another follow up MRI showed worsening findings in the orbit and he received radiotherapy to orbit too. He had clinical decline with worsening chest findings including new pleural effusion， Genomic analysis showed ROS1 mutation and he was started on Crizotinib with clinical response and symptom control for several weeks， unfortunately he had further progression with new adrenal|删除段之间换行|metastasis and progressive brain disease on repeat MRI 4 months later. He decided to enroll on hospice care and died after about 60months of original diagnosis.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Patients who fail initial local therapy or are not candidates for local therapy (resection， stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiation treatment) for their CNS metastasis of adenocarcinoma of lung have a very poor prognosis due to limited number of salvage treatment options. Finding an effective modality to treat or prevent brain metastases for these patients is an important challenge facing lung cancer researchers， especially with the emergence of better therapies to control systemic disease， resulting in improved overall suirvival.\n\n【17】Our patient experienced multiple episodes of CNS metastasis， which occurred even when systemic disease was under control. However， long-term control of his brain disease was observed coincidental with the start of Bevacizumab， pemetrexedand carboplatin given to treat his progressive systemic disease. It is possible that the combination of carboplatin and pemetrexed controlled not only the systemic relapse but also further progression of CNS disease. Some recent studies using platinum and Pemetrexed suggested that systemic chemotherapy could result in objective response to brain metastasis from lung cancer and radiotherapy can be delayed in some patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. However， we believe Bevacizumab may have played a prominent role in the prevention of new CNS metastases as this was the only drug our patient consistently received during his prolonged CNS disease-free interval， and his CNS disease relapsed soon after discontinuation of Bevacizumab and pemetrexed at the time of his systemic progression.\n\n【18】Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds tOVascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) receptor and inhibits angiogenesis. Angiogenesis plays significant role in growth and metastasis of cancer cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. Studies have shown that when metastatic tumors grow beyond a few millimeters， angiogenesis is triggered resulting in the formation of abnormal capillaries that lack tight junctions facilitating fenestrations. The blood brain barrier is disrupted， allowing variable passage of water-soluble agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. VEGF also increase vascular permeability of the blood-brain barrier andproduces vasogenicedema. Bevacizumab binds VEGF and prevents the interaction of VEGF with target receptors on the surface of endothelial cells causing reduced tumor angiogenesis and inhibits tumor growth. Binding to the endothelial cell surface receptors helps to bypass the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) and have effect on the CNS12，13\n\n【19】FDA approves Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic lung cancer however its effectiveness in controlling brain metastasis is largely unknown 14\\].\n\n【20】The first phase 1 clinical trial evaluating Bevacizumab for metastatic cancer had one fatal cerebral hemorrhage in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， and due to this event， patients with CNS metastasis were excluded in subsequent clinical trials. However， more recent trials have shown no excess risk of Bevacizumab in patients with brain metastases. The PASSPORT (AVF3752 g) trial treated patients with brain metastases Bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks with platinum-based doublet therapy or erlotinib， continuing until disease progression or death. In 106 evaluable patients， no episodes of grade ≥2 CNS hemorrhage were noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【21】De Braganca et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> reported safe administration of Bevacizamab in six patients with active CNS metastases， applying RECIST criteria2 patients achieved partial response， three patient had stable disease one patient had progression. Median progression-free survival was7.8 months and median overall survival was 14.1 months following initiation of bevacizumab\\[171. Five prospective studies-PASSPORT， ATLAS，BeTa，ERACLE and PRONOUNCE trials showed a low rate of CNS hemorrhage in patients with Brain metastasis treated with Bevacizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，18-21\\]</u>. A retrospective analysis of the AVAIL trial通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>， showed lower rate of brain metastasis as first site of recurrence in the patients who received bevacizumab compared to the control group receiving standard chemotherapy (2.6% vs. 5.8%； P=0.01)， also with a lower risk of brain metastasis development over time(HR=0.36，P=0.001).Furthermore， the median time to development ofbrain metastasis was shorter in the control group 4.5 vs. 7.8 months with bevacizumab， P<0.01 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【22】In our patient， new CNS disease appeared despite the systemic disease being controlled and he also had relapse of his systemic disease despite his CNS disease being controlled. Although there could be other possible explanation for this phenomenon， we believe that the combination of these clinical findings argues metastatic diseases can behave independently. As for systemic relapse， there is a good evidence for continuing maintenance treatment in adenocarcinoma to prevent a recurrence of systemic disease. There are almost no studies exist to guide any systemic treatment for CNS metastatic lung disease. There is dire need to design more prospective studies to test the efficacy of Bevacizumab in this setting.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】Although there is enough evidence from several case reports and retrospective analysis that Bevacizumab is safe to administer in patients with active or treated brain metastasis its efficacy in this setting is not well established. Our case demonstrates a prolonged period of freedom from new brain metastases coinciding with the administration of systemic chemotherapy and Bevacizumab. The case also showed that of Bevacizumab may have role in preventing development or progression of CNS metastasis. Bevacizumab should be evaluated for prevention and treatment of CNS metastasis for advance lung cancer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

A rare entity， it was first proposed by Antonia Garcia Tapia， a Spanish otolaryngologist in 1904， in a bull fighter who had vagal and hypoglossal palsy following neck injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It classically presents as dysphonia， dysphagia and deviation of tongue. This eponym signifies ipsilateral weakness of larynx and tongue while sparing function of the soft palate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. What is also notable is its causal association with orotracheal intubation and unpredictability of occiirrence.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 28-year-oldhomemaker with gradually progressive bilateral blurred vision was diagnosed as Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) with bilateral transverse sinus stenosis in December删除4-1:<u>2020</u>. She had CSF opening pressure of 400 mm of water and did not have desirable improvement with medical management. She was planned for venous sinus manometry and stenting. Orotracheal intubation with laryngoscope with Macintosh blade size 3 was done， tube fixed at 22 mm mark and the cuff was inflated at normal pressure. The intubation lasted two and half hours without undue flexion or lateral rotation. Venous sinus manometry showed gradient of 13 mm and 12 mm across narrowing in right and left transverse sinus， respectively . The right internal jugular vein access was taken and balloon angioplasty was done at the level of narrowing bilaterally. However， there was no significant improvement in the pressure gradient. Thereafter， a self-expanding stent (8mmx40 mm) was deployed across the narrowing in right transverse sinus. Pressure gradient post stenting showed significant improvement and good flow was achieved across the stent . After wearing off of anesthesia， patient complained of change in voice with nasal intonation and difficulty in swallowing. There was flattening of the right palatal arch with deviation of uvula to left side， deviation of tongue to right and ipsilateral weakness of the tongue . No other cranial nerve or focal neurological deficits were observed. In view of the preceding stenting procedure， a brain imaging was performed to rule out medullary involvement. MRI brain and MR angiogram were normal. Right sided vocal cord palsy was confirmed by direct laryngoscopy. Patient was put on nasogastric feeds and was given injectable steroids for 5 days followed by oral steroids.

At 30 days after onset， nasal intonation was persistent but patient was able to swallow without difficulty. At 6 months， patient had completely improved.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\nTapia syndrome has been noted following procedures like septorhinoplasty， shoulder surgery， cervical spine surgeries and with transient intubations where cardiorespiratory instability required intubation  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-7\\]</u>. Bilateral Tapia syndrome has also been described following orotracheal intubation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. The proposed mechanisms following intubation include compression of nerves by pressure of the inflated laryngeal cuff across the lateral laryngeal wall and alternatively stretching of nerves due to undue head movements通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，5-7\\]</u>. Tapia syndrome occurring after an intracranial procedure is unique due to the possible topographical association of intracranial lesions in relation to the procedure. Posterior fossa hemorrhage after stenting due to stent thrombosis has been noted and was ruled out in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. A similar presentation could be explained by the involvement of the nucleus ambiguous and hypoglossal nucleus or intramedullary fibers of the twelfth cranial nerve which was also|删除段之间换行|excluded by neuroimaging. Another notable finding in our patient was the involvement of soft palate suggesting involvement of the pharyngeal nerve， branch of vagus nerve， which carries the motor impulses to the soft palate. Most of the described cases of Tapia syndrome involved hypoglossal and recurrent laryngeal branch of vagus nerve as compression is believed to occur at the crossing of these two nerves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-9\\]</u>. Therefore， palatal involvement in our patient makes it a triad of pharyngeal， laryngeal and glossal involvement. One possible explanation for this can be the short neck length in our patient (midline neck length- 6cm)； making it more likely that neurapraxia also involved the pharyngeal branch exiting proximally . This rarest entity can therefore be referred to as Triad of Tapia Plus syndrome’. Tapia syndrome has been found to resolve progressively in 6 to 12 months with steroids and dysphagia rehabilitation as in our patient \\[3，51.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\nTapia syndrome， especially Tapia syndrome plus is a rare unpredictable situation occurring after orotracheal intubation Through this case， the authors would like to emphasize the need for|删除段之间换行|high clinical suspicion by intensivists， neurologists and surgeons spanning all fields of medicine as timely clinical suspicion can help avoid unnecessary investigations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Two normally configured T13 and T14 supernumerary thoracic vertebrae were also noticed. The right hemithorax presented 15 ribs and the left one 14， respectively. CT， 3D-CT， and MRI exams showed a butterfly T11 vertebra and confirmed the supernumerary T11 segmented and L2hemisegmented hemivertebrae. The 2 supernumerary hemivertebrae represented the apexes of the scoliotic curves . There were no occult malformations of the spine or medulla.\n\nPreoperatively， 4 possibilities of surgical treatment were taken into account： 2 VEPTR devices， growing rods， hemivertebrae resection with minimal synthesis or supernumerary hemivertebrae resection with the implant of a growth guiding device. A posterior approach with posterior hemivertebral spongious enucleation of the supernumerary T11 and L2 hemivertebrae， blocking the growth in 3 segments， was performed： Right T10-T11 and left T9-T12；T13-T14， corresponding to the supernumerary vertebrae， and L1-L2 segment. The spinal exposure was done only at the hemivertebral spongious enucleation and screw insertion sites. This allowed us to correct the|删除段之间换行|scoliotic curves. The rods were placed subfascial， to avoid long segmental spinal arthrodesis. During the follow-up of 2.6 years， the presence of a lordotic deformity at T13-T14 and the rod cutting in|删除段之间换行|this area were looked up in order to unlock the vertebral growth there. No presence of such altering was noticed. Moreover， the Cobb and Fergusson angles are both 20 degrees . The vomero-coccigeo-pubic line and the positioning of the proximal screws highlight the tensions of the biomechanical spinal chains in order to preserve the pelvic， shoulder， and cephalic balances.

Because of the rarity of these lesions， the clinical and radiologic features are often mistaken for other， more common processes until the vascular nature of the disease is confirmed by histologic examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Pulmonary angiosarcoma has a high rate of recurrence and is frequently disseminated at the time of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，9\\]</u>\n\n【4】In our review， we were able to find atleast 60 cases of primary pulmonaryangiosarcoma reported in the English literature. Most likely there are more cases that were not reported. We report a 26year-old previously healthy gentleman who was found to have primary pulmonary angiosarcoma with pleural metastasis.\n\n【5】A previously healthy 26 year-old gentleman presented with 3 months history of left sided pleuritic chest pain. He gave history of dry cough and mild shortness of breath with exertion. During his illness he developed fever and weight loss ofaround 6 Kg. He is a lifelong non-smoke. He works as a pharmacist and has no significant exposures. His Family history was positive for different kinds of malignancies. Review of systems was unremarkable. On examination he was tachypneic but his oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. He was febrile with a temperature of 39°C and tachycardic.His chest examination showed an area of dullness at the left lower zone with decrease breath sounds at the same area with bronchial breathing. He had no palpable lymph nodes. The rest of his examination was unremarkable.\n\n【6】He was investigated in a different hospital (prior to being referred to our center) and was found to have a left pleural effusion and nodules on the right side. He had left sided thoracocentesis more than once which was repeatedly hemorrhagic. Cytology from the effusion was inconclusive. PPD testing was negative. In our hospital，his chest X-ray showed leftlowerlobe opacity with obliteration of the left CP angle and nodules on the right lung. A chest ultrasound showed hyperechogenicity in the left pleural space but no fluid to be tapped. His chest CT showed multiple bilateral nodules and nodularity of the left pleura with dense material in the pleura suggestive of a hematoma.

A CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of peripheral metastasis and a bone scan showed no evidence of bone metastasis. He underwent VATS and evacuation of the hematoma as it was thought that it was the source of his sepsis. Despite the evacuation of the hematoma， the fever did not subside. It was then assumed that his fever was mostly secondary to his underlying illness， as his cultures were repeatedly negative. After recovery he was transferred to The Medical Oncology team for palliative chemotherapy.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Angiosarcomas representless than 1% ofall sarcomas and develop most often in the skin， soft tissue， or liver. They may be associated with previous radiation treatment； environmental carcinogens like vinyl chloride，thorotrast， or phenylethyl hydrazine， foreign body material or lymphedema.

There have been reported cases of pulmonary hemorrhage as a presenting symptom. Radiologically， pulmonary angiosarcomas usually present with lung nodules on chest CT scan. The CT scan of pulmonaryangiosarcoma has a distinctive appearance|删除段之间换行|of soft tissue attenuation surrounded by ground glass attenuation which is also known as the halo sign 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23，29\\]</u>.

Basically， the two types of treatment -towards the primary process and also later - influencing the recurrences in order to gain success in the forms of treatment and survival -in general.\n\n【27】We studied 49 patients， treated for recurrences in hypopharyngeal carcinoma during the period 2010-2020- at ENT-Clinic， UMBAL“St. George “-Plovdiv. Thus， we examined the efficiency and results from the helpful deeds in different curing programs， especially in recurrent cases， being already primary treated .\n\n【28】The mean time for declaring a recurrence from the beginning of the treatment is 10.3 months. The total capacity of the recurrent-helpful deeds is 45%-local-85%，local-regional-100%，regional-23%， distant-19%.\n\n【29】We established reasonable cumulative survival with non - activity tumors in patients with performed before surgical and chemo-radio-therapy， as well as a lack of 3 years survival in patients with chemoradiotherapy， only .\n\n【30】The 1-year survival for people， operated and then- chemo-radio-therapy is 86%， while for the same， but 3 years survival is69%. We did not fell upon a person with 3 years survival， only on a chemoradiotherapy. So， there are restricted possibilities for treatment after certain helpful surgical performances in recurrent cases. The surgical deeds， themselves， are possible only at the very beginning of the recurrences. That is why the objective follow-up of such people is very important， to detect such recurrences.\n\n【31】What about the type of the neck dissection - a large， or selective oner\n\nWe analyzed retrospectively T 51 patients with advanced|删除段之间换行|hypopharyngeal carcinoma in Complex Oncological Centre-Plovdiv， during the period删除4:<u> 2010-2020</u>. There has been a histological verification for everyone. The metastases have been localized on levels II， III， IV， V. During the next follow-up， with performed large or selective neck dissection， we checked recurrences in 4 men (7.8%). So， the neck dissection comes to be an effective way of therapy for meta-recurrent tumors， even in cases with performed before chemo-radio-therapy.\n\n【33】We analyzed in a program and retrospective way 53 patients in a stage of advanced hypopharyngeal carcinoma， suitable for a total laryngectomy， treated before that by Doxetacel， Cisplatina and5-Fluorouracil， in order to save the larynx.

The induced chemotherapy， followed by radiotherapy， do form the therapeutical effect in such patients.\n\n【36】In conclusion - a greater part of the patients with advanced carcinomas could not be able to be treated successfully by larynx-saving methods. Clinical stage IV has a bad prognosis in accordance results. If we insist on a larynx-saving procedure， then the radio-therapy with constantly enlarging doses plays an important role.\n\n【37】In our study we checked 55 patients withadvancedhypopharyngeal carcinoma. First， they were treated by 40 Gy radiotherapy， some of them then 30 more -so， it comes totally 70 Gy per person，regarding them as radiosensitive. The rest 28 people were declared as radio-non sensitive. We found out 3 years survival in 77% from the first group.\n\n【38】In conclusion- we may declare， that this is a new model for treatingadvanced1上hypopharyngeal carcinoma， i.e.，using the advantages of the concomitant chemoradiotherapy instead of surgical methods. We examined retrospectively 58 patients， being operated at ENT-Clinic-UMBAL “St. George\"-Plovdiv， during the period删除4:<u> 2010-2020</u>. All of them were treated by selective bilateral neck dissection. Also， they were followed-up， as time goes by， for any micrometastases and isolated tumor cells，as well. So，according to the immunohistochemical results and analyses， the people were grouped precisely and coordinating.\n\n【39】It is obvious， that people with lymph nodular micrometastases and isolated tumor cells， do have a worse prognosis and less survival rate， so the next coming surgical treatment may gain a certain success.

His aunt was diagnosed with \"hyperthyroidism\" in the outer hospital and has been treated with antithyroid drugs.\n\n【21】Methods\n\n【22】Extraction of genomic DNA from peripheral blood\n\n【23】Venous blood (5 mL) was drawn from the proband and his kindreds， centrifuged at 3000 rpm for7 min，and separated white blood cells. Peripheral blood leukocyte DNA was extracted according to the standard phenol-chloroform method. The purity and concentration ofeach DNA sample were determined by a UV spectrophotometer.\n\n【24】Amplification and sequencing of THRB gene\n\n【25】High-throughput sequencing and Sanger verification are used for detection. The primer synthesis， PCR reaction， and sequencing process were all completed by MyGenostic company (Beijing).\n\n【26】Results\n\n【27】We sequenced the THRB gene for the proband and found a heterozygous C>T missense mutation at nucleotide position 1012 in Exon 9，which changed the trinucleotide codon and led to a transition from Arginine to Tryptophan at position 338 of the gene-coding product. We also sequenced Exon 9 for the other kindreds and found that the proband's mother shared the same mutation， whereas the rest ofthe family did not harbor it .\n\n【28】Discussion\n\n【29】Thyroid hormone resistance syndrome is a rare genetic disease， inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive manner， with elevated levels of Free Triiodothyronine (FT3) and serum-Free Thyroxine (FT4)，accompanied by stimulating Unsuppressed elevated or normal thyroxine (TSH) is the basic feature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. According to the distribution of tissues that are not sensitive to thyroid hormones， it can be divided into systemic hormone resistance， pituitary sex hormone resistance， and peripheral sex hormone resistance. About80% of the cases belong to pituitary hormone resistance.\n\nTHRa and B have the function of encoding thyroid hormone receptors， and their mutations could cause a decrease in the affinity of triiodothyronine and the receptor， which results in a decrease in transcriptional activity and a compensatory increase in thyroid hormones， which ultimately causing thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. At present， there have been many reports on the two forms of gene mutations， it seems that different mutation forms can lead to different clinical phenotypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>. 85% of RTH is caused by mutations in the gene encoding THRB in clinical practice， which|删除段之间换行|is considered to be the most important cause of RTH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The THRB gene includes 10 exons， of which the 7-10\" exons encode amino acids178-461 which constitute the ligand-binding domain and part of the hinge region at the carboxyl end of THRB that bind to ligands and co-modulators. The hotspot mutation regions rich in CG sequences are concentrated here 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Although most of the patients are heterozygous， but also case reports of homozygous mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\nThe proband in this family is a 26-year-old male with typical clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism such as palpitations， irritability， hunger， polyphagia， heat tolerance， and sweating， without exophthalmos and anterior tibial mucoedema. Multiple thyroid functions showed that FT3 and FT4 are higher and TSH level is in the normal range， which could exclude hyperthyroidism caused by thyroid function. In addition， the pituitary gland scan of MRI showed no abnormality. The patient’s mother also had similar thyroid hormone results. Meanwhile， his aunt had been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism that was treated with medication. To sum up， it is considered that the patient may have pituitary thyroid resistance syndrome. In addition， gene sequencing analysis revealed that both the proband and his mother had heterozygous missense point mutation R338W in exon 9 of the THRB gene， while other members|删除段之间换行|of the family had neither clinical symptom of hyperthyroidism nor mutations in the THRB gene. It is further confirmed that the patient meets the diagnosis of thyroid hormone resistance syndrome.\n\n【32】R338W is one of the hotspot mutations reported in western countries so far. The following R338W， A317T，R438H，R243Q，and P453T are the five most reported mutation sites abroad， respectively通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>. The mutation sites reported so far in China are P453A， H435L， V458A，P453S，A317T，I1276L and so on 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19-23\\]</u>.\n\nAt present， two cases of R338W mutant thyroid hormone resistance syndrome have been reported in China 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>， one case is Generalized Resistance to Thyroid Hormone (GRTH) and another is Pituitary Resistance to Thyroid Hormone (PRTH). Both patients were female and both were diagnosed in adolescence. Although they all have goiters， the clinical manifestations are not the same. One patient mainly showed hyperactivity and learning disabilities， and the other mainly showed heart palpitations and weight loss. But the male patient we reported onset in adulthood， not only has a goiter， but also has palpitations， irritability， hunger， polyphagia， fear ofheat， hyperhidrosis， insomnia， fatigue， headache， weight loss symptoms， and poor performance. After genetic testing revealed that all these|删除段之间换行|three cases had heterozygous missense point mutation R338W in exon 9 of the THRB gene， which led to a transition from Arginine to Tryptophan at position 338 of the gene-coding product.\n\n【34】Qian Yanying et al. searched the literature published in China from 1989 to 2017， retrospectively analyzed the family characteristics of thyroid hormone resistance syndrome caused by mutation of thyroid hormone receptor β gene， and found that adults often seek medical treatment due to thyrotoxicosis-related symptoms or the discovery of thyroid enlargement， while children due to hyperactivity and learning disabilities， and some patients may be asymptomatic通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. It is showed that the clinical manifestations of the disease are heterogeneous， and this feature is similar to that of our family. The proband of this family has second-degree thyroid intumescence， but his mother has no such clinical manifestations. Different members of the same family could have different clinical manifestations even if the mutation site is the same， which may be due to differences in receptor expression and function among different individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.In addition， it has also been reported that the same gene locus mutation could also lead to resistance of different phenotypes， which may be related to the distribution of receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Currently， there is no radical treatment for RTH， and it needs to be judged based on symptoms. Most patients could increase endogenous thyroid hormones to compensate for the resistance of tissues and organs. Generally， treatment is not required because inappropriate drug intervention may break the balance. When there is obvious tachycardia， beta-blockers could be considered to combat the tachycardia caused by hyperthyroidism.\n\n【36】In summary， the current pathogenic mechanism of RTH is not yet clear， and the clinical manifestations are not specific. It is easy to be missed and misdiagnosed. THRB gene detection plays an important role in the diagnosis which is used for suspected thyroid hormone resistance syndrome patients and their close relatives. Detection could confirm the diagnosis as soon as possible and reduce the occurrence of adverse outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

A 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm firearm entry wound was found on posterior aspect of left side of chest below the scapula with blood oozing from the wound. Exit wound was over 3 and 4h intercostal space on left side of chest lateral to the sternum.

Investigated and planned for urgent exploratory laparotomy with interesting intraoperative findings. A quick literature review was done， and a conclusion was made.\n\n【2】Keywords： Splenic cyst； Abdominal pain； Rupture； Traua； Laparotomy\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Splenic cysts are considerably rare findings， and if present they are mostly asymptomatic. However， if symptoms present they may include epigastric pain， nausea， vomiting， and abdominal distention relative to the size of the cyst. Splenic cysts might be attributed to many causes which include congenital， neoplastic， infectious， vascular， and inflammatory causes. Moreover， congenital splenic cysts include epidermoid cyst which is characterized by inner endothelial cells， which is a collection of mesothelium cells present at the splenic sulci at the time of birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Furthermore， the inflammatory splenic cyst can be subdivided into a pyogenic abscess， fungal abscess， and Echinococcus cyst which are also known as hydatid cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A pyogenic abscess can be caused by infection， penetrating trauma， or a previous thromboembolic event affecting the spleen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. On the other hand， a hydatid cyst is caused by a parasitic infestation by a tapeworm known as Echinococcus genus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Differentiating between those subtypes of the splenic cyst by imagining and clinical presentation alone is challenging. Therefore， Tissue sampling is required to establish a definitive. Here， we are reporting a case of a ruptured epidermoid splenic cyst diagnosed initially as a hydatid cyst.\n\nSeventeen years old male was brought to Prince Sultan Military Medical Center ER with the main complaint of severe sudden abdominal pain， stabbing in nature， more pronounced on the epigastric area. The patient stated that this abdominal pain is associated with nausea， right shoulder pain， and decreased oral intake. He added that those symptoms don’t seem to be aggravated or relieved by anything. The patient denies any fever， previous trauma， animal contact， or ingestion of raw milk or meat. He has no history of hematological disease or similar attack. Upon further questioning， he said that he felt a left abdominal swelling a year before his presentation， but it was asymptomatic， and did not seek medical counsel for that swelling. On examination， he was alert， oriented， saturating well on room air， afebrile， vitally， and clinically stable. His abdominal examination revealed guarding， tender， and mildly distended abdomen， with no mass palpated. The systematic examination was unremarkable. Along with abdominal and pelvis computed tomography with intravenous contrast， routine laboratory blood tests including CBC， renal， and liver functions were ordered. Other than elevated white blood cells 通用删除7(英):<u>(13)</u>， his labs were unremarkable. Ct scan showed a large cystic lesion on the spleen measuring 15 cm x9 cm × 8.5 cm in craniocaudal， transverse， and anterior-posterior dimensions respectively. Moreover， there were multiple peripheral small cysts and small peripheral calcifications. Additionally， there was a moderate amount of abdominopelvic free fluids and peritoneal nodularity， implying secondary cyst rupture . The differential diagnosis at that time included a hydatid cyst， epidermoid cyst， and pyogenic abscess. Based on the endemic|删除段之间换行|prevalence and clinical presentation our impression at that time was ruptured hydatid cyst. The decision was made to take the patient to the operating room and do an exploratory laparotomy. Upon skin incision， there was a large amount of anchovy sauce ， so6 L irrigation was done. The spleen was enlarged with a sizable cyst arising from the medial aspect of the spleen . Splenectomy was performed， and the spleen was sent to the pathology lab . Two drains were inserted in the splenic bed and pelvis. The fascia was closed with PDS， and the skin was closed with clips. The operation lasted 3.5 h. It was uneventful，and the patient experienced minimal blood loss. Postoperatively， he was started on Albendazole and Tazocin. The preventive medicine consulting physician informed us that the patient will not receive any vaccine during his admission and that they will follow up with him after discharge. The patient experienced an increased level of platelets reaching up to 634 on day4， so the Hematology consulting physician was contacted regarding post-splenectomy reactive thrombocytosis， and he recommended a low dose of aspirin or enoxaparin 4 to 6 weeks. On day 5postoperatively he was doing well， vitally and clinically stable. He was mobilizing， voiding freely， and passing bowel motions. His surgical incision was closely assessed； there was no sign of infection， seroma，|删除段之间换行|or hematoma. He was discharged home on day 5 with outpatient follow-up， to review the pathology report and to reassess the patient. After two weeks the patient was seen in the clinic， the pathology report showed a multilocular cyst lined by benign squamous epithelium consistent with epidermoid cyst . The cyst wall showed marked fibrosis with focal old hemorrhage and calcification . So， the antibiotics were ceased immediately， and the patient was informed of the cytology report and given a follow-up appointment.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\nSplenic cysts are classified as either primary (parasitic or non-parasitic) or secondary (traumatic/pseudocyst) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Primary Non-parasitic cysts are mainly epidermoid cysts (90%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and 10% of all non-parasitic cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The parasitic cyst is usually caused by Echinococcus granulosus (referred to as hydatid cyst) that most commonly affect the liver followed by the spleen than the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The incidence of splenic cyst is known to be low and the parasitic type is the most common worldwide while the primary non-parasitic congenital cyst is the predominant type in the western world and predominantly affects young and middle-aged adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The clinical presentation may vary from incidental findings to acute abdomen|删除段之间换行|presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Mild symptoms include fullness， early satiety， or abdominal pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The mass effect may produce a more prominent picture like obstruction or shortness of breath. Rupture of the splenic cyst will produce more severe sudden onset signs and symptoms such as abdominal pain， vomiting， and peritonitis with tachycardia as in our case report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. These acute symptoms like rupture hemorrhage and infection are considered rare presentations for such entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. CA 19-9 has been strongly associated with epidermoid cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. US and CT scans play important role in identifying the presence of splenic cyst but with difficulty to differentiate the parasitic (hydatid) from epidermoid cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The presence of septation and intramural calcification as in our case will favor the diagnosis of Hydatid cyst|删除段之间换行|as the epidermoid cyst usually present as well-circumscribed unilocular cystic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. But radiological features alone cannot role in or role out parasitic cyst without serological testing (ELISA). Biopsy or aspiration will carry a risk for anaphylaxis or dissemination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Management of splenic cyst depends on the pathology， size， and patient presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Open total splenectomy is the standard of care for large and symptomatic cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，6，7\\]</u>. Also， the partial splenectomy option is feasible to preserve the splenic parenchyma to reduce the post-operative complication通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，6\\]</u>. Additionally laparoscopic is also considered for those cases with smaller cyst size and benign presentations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，8\\]</u>. On the other hand， our patient was initialy suspected to be ruptured hydatid cyst measuring 15 cm presenting with peritonitis and tachycardia which limited our options to open total splenectomy.\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】Splenic cyst is a rare entity with the majority diagnosed incidentally or with mild symptoms. Splenic cyst presenting with rupture and acute abdomen is an extremely rare presentation with only a few cases has been reported in the literature. In our case， it was initially misdiagnosed as hydatid cyst as reported in the imaging in addition to the presence of peritonitis along with tachycardia which directed our management for open total splenectomy which was uneventful， and the patient recovered well post-operatively.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

They are important for long-term therapy requiring continuous vascular access. The use of central catheters may also be extremely helpful in the therapy of children with chronic kidney diseases， such as atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS). In the past， the treatment of this syndrome required regular supplementation of fresh frozen plasma in the chronic phase of the disease， or substitution of red blood cells during relapse and plasmapheresis application. Eculizumab registered worldwide for the treatment of aHUS is injected intravenously every 2 weeks.\n\n【2】The manuscript presents a retrospective evaluation of the use of TIVAPs in 4 children treated due to aHUS. A total number of 6 ports was used， each 4.3 ± 1.7 years of duration on average. Ten complications were reported， 30% of which included staphylococcal infections. Infections with encapsulated organisms were not recorded.\n\n【3】Conclusion： The use of vascular ports in children with aHUS seems to be safe provided that close monitoring and early detection of complications are carried out， allows to maintain repeated painless long-term access to the venous system， make available vascular preservation in patients with a significant risk for end-stage kidney disease.\n\n【4】Keywords： Totally Implanted Vascular Access devices (ports； TIVAPs)； Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome； TIVAPs complications； Eculizumab\n\n【5】Introduction\n\nTotally Implantable Venous Access devices (ports； TIVAPs) are subcutaneous systems that provide permanent， easily accessible and long-term access to central veins. They are the most convenient and safest way of intravenous therapies for chronic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. TIVAP consists of two basic elements： a catheter， which is inserted into one of the central veins， usually in the area of the clavicle， neck or arm， and whose tip is placed close to the opening of the superior vena cava to the atrium. The second element is the ventricle， connected to the catheter， placed under the skin通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The ventricle is equipped with the silicone membrane， which enables multiple punctures while maintaining the system tightness. It is estimated that the membrane strength ranges from 1000 to over 2000 punctures depending on the needles used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Contraindications for TIVAP implantation include generalized infection，local skin lesions/inflammation， active vein thrombosis at the site of planned implantation， treatment with acetylsalicylic acid derivatives， clotting inhibitors and oral anticoagulants (when the treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin is necessary， its last dose should be administered at least 12 h before the planned procedure)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The implantation should take place in the operating room with surgical sterility conditions. The procedure takes 30 min to 40 min on average. In children， the procedure is performed under general anesthesia. After implantation， chest X-ray is obligatory to assess the ventricular position， catheter path， position of the catheter tip and presence of possible hematoma or pneumothorax created during the complicated procedure. In most cases pneumothorax does not require drainage. The optimal position of the catheter tip (at the borderline of the superior vena cava and right atrium) reduces the risk of complications such as thrombosis or catheter occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The care of central access is the factor determining the|删除段之间换行|incidence of infections. Although the use of fully implantable systems reduces the risk of complications compared to external catheters， septic complications are still a serious clinical problem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>.\n\n【7】With proper care， the TIVAP can perform its function for many years and bring an unquestionable convenience for patients. In addition to reducing the pain associated with frequent punctures， it also reduces the risk of local inflammation and the risk of the drug being vascularized. It enables the patient to move freely without the risk of accidental catheter damage， which is particularly important in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Permanent intravenousaCCesss is widely used， suchas administration of chemotherapy， blood products， liquids， antibiotics， parenteral nutrition. The necessity of frequent and repeated long-term administration of the drug is the main indication of port implantation. For this reason， TIVAPs are used in oncological patients， patients with cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as in palliative medicine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In pediatrics， TIVAPs have been used in children with cancer and hemophilia requiring continuous administration of blood coagulation factors formulas.\n\n【9】The use of TIVAPs may also be extremely helpful in the therapy of patients with chronic kidney diseases， e.g. atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS). aHUS usually has a serious prognosis and multi-organ clinical symptoms may differ depending on the mutation found in a given patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In the past， the treatment of this syndrome required regular， long-term supply of fresh frozen plasma during the chronic phase of the disease or transfusion of red blood cell concentrate during relapse and plasmapheresis. In2011 worldwide， and in 2018 in Poland， eculizumab， a humanized， monoclonal antibody directed against the C5 component of the complement system， which is also injected intravenously every 2weeks， was registered for the treatment of aHUS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>.\n\n【10】This manuscript describes the course of aHUS treatment in four children using TIVAPs . All the parents have given informed written consent for TIVAPs placement and usage. According to the Polish law the Ethical Committee approval for this procedure was not necessary.\n\n【11】Case Series\n\n【12】Case 1\n\n【13】Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome was diagnosed in a boy at 5 months of life. From the beginning the boy required renal replacement therapy (peritoneal dialysis continued further for 7months) and repeated infusions of fresh frozen plasma. On day 215during pneumonia， the disease was blown again with the need for ICU treatment and mechanical ventilation. On day 33r the first TIVAP was established (size 4.5 Fr). On day 6\" after insertion， the needle was accidentaly punctured out from the port with edema of skin layers and hematoma formation. The condition was treated conservatively while maintaining the port’s patency.\n\n【14】On the 41s day of hospitalization， again the child's condition deteriorated. After a double incident of cyanosis with saturation decrease to 70% and an increase in body temperature， as well as after finding elevated inflammatory markers the antibiotic ceftriaxone was applied empirically. A culture was taken from the TIVAP's blood sample and peritoneal fluid. Due to a positive result of the culture from the port - the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis Methicillin-Resistant Strain (MRSE)-vancomycin was implemented.\n\n【15】Two weeks later (55h day of hospitalization)， the boy underwent acute post-transfusion lung damage (TRALI) requiring another ICU treatment. The MRSE strain was cultured in the port blood sample collected on day 61 of hospitalization - therapy with teicoplanin followed by linezolid was implemented. The patient was discharged in good condition. A month later a third MRSE infection occurred， which was manifested by an increase in temperature， pale skin and chills. Due to the colonization of the TIVAP with MRSE， it was planned to remove the port in the antibiotic cover (vancomycin). A week later the patient was discharged home in a good general condition.\n\n【16】After three months (patient at the age of 14 months) it was decided to establish a new port due to the necessity of transfusion of plasma every 1 to 2 weeks. The procedure underwent without complications.\n\n【17】At the age of 2.5 years the patient was admitted to hospital due to fever up to 38.3 and vomiting. Similar symptoms occurred in the boy's brother the previous week. After performing additional tests， consecutive relapse of the underlying disease was diagnosed. A control blood culture from the port showed growth of MRSE and Staphylococcus hominis strains. After the application of vancomycin and topically urokinase， a sterile blood culture was obtained. The patient could return to standard aHUS treatment with plasma infusions every 2 weeks.\n\n【18】In December 2017 (age 2 years 8 months) the patient was qualified for treatment with eculizumab. The boy has been taking the preparation through the port regularly since December 215，2017， which resulted in the lack of subsequent symptomatic relapses of aHUS and improvement of his health. There were no TIVAP inflammatory complications on eculizumab.\n\n【19】Case 2\n\n【20】Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome was diagnosed in a girl at the age of 4. She did not require renal replacement therapy.\n\n【21】Initially treatment with plasma transfusions was undertaken. In the absence of remission plasmapheresis was implemented-5sessions were performed. After two months in remission after TPE， the girl was admitted to the ward due to aHUS recurrence.\n\n【22】The treatment with fresh frozen plasma infusions was started.17 days later it was decided to establish the TIVAP. During the procedure the artery was punctured， which resulted in the formation of a hematoma in the area of venous confluence on the cannulated side. The patient did not report any complaints and the control chest X-ray taken after the surgery did not show any abnormalities.\n\n【23】The therapy was continued with regular plasma infusions for the next 2 years until the girl was qualified for treatment with eculizumab(at the age of 6 years)， which is still administered through the TIVAP. The child remains in aHUS remission. There were no TIVAP inflammatory complications on eculizumab.\n\n【24】Case 3\n\n【25】A 22-month-old girl was admitted with suspicion of typical HUS in the oligo-anuria phase. The child on admission was in a medium general condition， fatigue， pale and apathetic. The Tenckhoff catheter was inserted and peritoneal dialysis was started urgently and continued for 17 days.

On the following days， therapeutic plasma infusions and hemodialysis procedures were continued.

Plasma infusions were administered at the rate of 2 transfusions/24 h， intravenous antibiotic therapy， antiemetics， analgesics and diuretics. The child's medium-heavy condition was recorded despite adequate diuresis. From day 5， the biochemical parameters were gradually improved， followed by the stabilization of clinical condition.\n\n【35】On February 2018 the patient was qualified for treatment with eculizumab (at the age of 6 years)， which is still administered through the TIVAP. The child remains in remission of aHUS. There were no TIVAP inflammatory complications on eculizumab.\n\n【36】Case 4\n\n【37】Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome was diagnosed in a boy at the age of 5 months - admitted at that time in the anuria phase. Three days earlier he had a fever up to 39°C， weakness， lack of appetite， aversion to drink and symptoms of gastroenteritis. Peritoneal dialysis (conducted during the first 5 days of hospitalization)， symptomatic treatment and plasma infusions were initiated. Due to peritoneal dialysis catheter dysfunction and lack of effective dialysis fluid outflows， the renal replacement therapy had to be changed to hemodiafiltration. The course of disease was complicated by severe hypertension and pulmonary edema. In the following days， the clinical condition was systematically improved， which allowed to finish dialysis after 19 days of hospitalization. On day 36， the boy in good condition was discharged home.\n\n【38】Two years after the first hospitalization， the boy was urgently admitted to the hospital due to aHUS relapse. The week before the hospitalization weakness， rhinitis， coughing， fever and vomiting were present. Due to the need of TPE a central venous catheter was inserted under general anesthesia. After the procedure， breathing disorders occurred and the boy was transferred to the ICU.\n\n【39】To confirm the diagnosis percutaneous kidney biopsy was performed. The biopsy showed lesions corresponding to diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis without features of microangiopathy.\n\nThree months later the boy was admitted because of proteinuria to 3.9 g/l， diuresis limitation and thrombocytopenia during upper respiratory tract infection. Treatment with plasma infusions was started， without initiating steroid therapy -proteinuria was reduced，|删除段之间换行|platelet count was normalized. To ensure adequate venous access TIVAP was established. Due to the satisfactory clinical effect of plasma therapy， continuation of infusions every 21 days was planned.\n\n【41】Two and a half years later， antihistamines were recommended before the next transfusions due to an allergic reaction during the plasma infusion. Periodically， chest X-rays were taken to assess the position of the vascular port which did not show any abnormalities.\n\n【42】Four years and 11 months after the TIVAP was established， within the operating block， the TIVAP was replaced with a larger one with a diameter of 6.5 FR (to the right subclavian vein).\n\n【43】Three months later 通用删除7(英):<u>(2018)</u>， due to a remission of the underlying disease lasting more than 4 years， the boy was qualified for treatment with eculizumab only in the case of aHUS relapse and plasma infusions were also interrupted.\n\n【44】After another 10 months TIVAPwas removed. The child currently remains in remission of aHUS.\n\n【45】Discussion\n\n【46】In the chronic treatment of aHUS， eculizumab is currently used， administered intravenously every two weeks in infusion lasting 25min to 45 min in adults and 1 h to 4 h in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Therefore， the use of central access in this therapy seems to be justified. Repeated necessity of venous access is burdensome for children due to their narrow veins， lower willingness to cooperate with the medical personnel and relatively easy possibility to damage the vein integrity通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. This is particularly important in the youngest children and infants. Also in patients with a significant risk for ESKD， including patients with aHUS， vascular preservation would be very important， actually highlighted as the new “Save the Vein” initiative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The TIVAPs increase patient’s well-being during long-term treatment. They permit to avoid regular， frequent and painful punctures into the peripheral veins and related complications. They also facilitate the infusion itself. A single TIVAP can serve for many years.\n\nIn the assessment of the presented patients， it should be noted that all of them remained in aHUS remission after introduction of eculizumab. TIVAPs have been successfully used in current and previous plasma infusions therapies. This type of catheters is of great importance in the treatment of patients with diseases requiring chronic therapy such as aHUS or hemophilia， as it does not limit daily activity. aHUS patients might be at increased risk of infection vs. other patient populations using TIVAPs， mainly linked to applied complement inhibition. However， catheter infections including encapsulated organisms were not recorded during eculizumab|删除段之间换行|application in described patients.\n\n【48】Despite its high utility， the usage of TIVAPs is not free of complications. The cases in which the central venous catheter should be removed include TIVAP displacement， blood clotting without the possibility to be unblocked with the application of fibrinolytic drugs， improper size or colonization by bacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，13-15\\]</u>.\n\n【49】Ten complications directly and indirectly related to the use of TIVAPs were observed in described by us children with aHUS. The commonest complication observed was hematoma formation. Hematoma in the subcutaneous pocket area is also the most comrion complication described in literature， occurring after port implantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. To reduce the risk of hematoma formation directly after the procedure， ice packs are used. Analgesics and topical formulas containing heparin are used in the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【50】All elements of the TIVAP are placed under the skin； no part is in contact with the external environment. This reduces the risk of infection spreading along the catheter， which is often a big problem with traditional methods of access to both central and peripheral veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，13\\]</u>. Despite this， the incidence of infections may be even4.1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Catheter-related infections may be directly related to patients non-compliance or improper skin disinfection by patients and/or personnel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. They may be the reason for TIVAP removal. Catheter reimplantation may be performed no earlier than 7 days after the symptoms of infection have subsided and negative results of blood cultures have been obtained 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Beck et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> evaluated the incidence of catheter infections at 7.4% in the cohort of 296pediatric oncology patients (of which 128 ports were implanted). The most frequently isolated pathogens in blood cultures of oncological patients with catheter infections are Gram-positive bacteria， particularly coagulase-negative Staphylococci. The author's stress that these complications can be successfully treated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Shim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> noted that 2.3% of ports were removed due to infections.\n\n【51】In patient 1， the TIVAP was colonized with Staphylococcus epidermidis strain， which involved additional hospitalization and antibiotic treatment burden， and finally removal of the TIVAP. The infections with this strain are the most common as it can migrate from the skin surface during injection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【52】One of the complications during catheter insertion was an arterial puncture with hematoma formation (patient 2). The use of ultrasound imaging during catheter insertion largely prevents such complications. They are relatively rare (frequency 0.2% in the retrospective cohort study of 500 cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. During catheter placement， patient 4 developed respiratory disturbances after general anesthesia. This may have been influenced by the patient\\`s age -3years， general condition， underlying disease or previous infection. The incidence of airway complications under pediatric anesthesia is7.87% and increases in children after recent airway infections and in children below 6 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\nOne case of mechanical displacement of the TIVAP catheter tip after 3 years and 321 days of use was observed during insertion of the hemodialysis catheter， resulting in its immediate removal. The defective position of the TIVAP is not a frequently reported complication. The complication may occur in 1.3% to 5.4% of cases within 5 months of TIVAP insertion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It may also occur after the time of use and be associated with patient growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. It has been observed that TIVAP made of silicone and those of smaller sizes show greater flexibility， which may be associated with higher risk of|删除段之间换行|migration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【54】The use of TIVAP as a tool for quick and easy access to central veins of patients with aHUS for many years undoubtedly improves the comfort of their lives and facilitates chronic therapy. Pediatric patients and their caregivers should be given special care by the staff， ensuring that antiseptic agents and methods are used and the TIVAP is properly filled with anticoagulant. In addition， it is also very important to educate patients，their families and staff how to carry out procedures properlytoprevent complications： Infections，clotting and mechanical injuries among them. Methods that can be used to reduce the number of adverse events， especially during port implantation， are radiological assessment of the chest immediately after surgery and imaging before its completion， or cardiac echocardiography for intravascular catheter tip observation.\n\n【55】Conclusion\n\n【56】The usage of vascular ports in children with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome seems to be safe provided that close monitoring and early detection of complications are carried out， allows to maintain repeated long-term access to the venous system， makes available vascular preservation in patients with a significant risk for end-stage kidney disease and minimizes pain associated with repeated punctures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Occurrence of dystrophic calcification in the cystic wall of the odontogenic keratocyst is a very rare entity with only few of significance， quoted in the literature. This article describes a case report of a 20 year old male patient treated for odontogenic keratocyst in the right mandible. It also provides an overview of the occurrence of dystrophic calcification in the cystic wall of odontogenic keratocyst and the various theories of etiopathogenesis of these dystrophic calcifications.\n\n【2】Keywords： Cyst； Odontogenic keratocyst； Calcifying odontogenic keratocyst； Dystrophic calcifications\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The term Odontogenic Keratocyst’(OKC) perplexes clinicians and pathologist a like consequent of its changing conduct with regards to its aggressiveness. Evolution of this enigmatic entity has been affiliated with many terminologies over the ages. In literature， the keratocyst was earlier described as a cholesteatoma (Hauer， 1926； Kostecka， 1929) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Robinson referred to this entity as a primordial cyst owing to its pathogenesis which is developmental in origin， arising from odontogenic epithelium. The term OKC was introduced by Philipsen in 1956. World Health Organization (WHO) accepted this terminology in 1992. In 2005， WHO christened OKC as Keratocystic Odontogenic Tumor (KCOT) owing to its aggressive behaviour，high recurrence rates and specific histological characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In 2017， WHO rechristened KCOT back into the cystic category citing that true neoplasm does not regress spontaneously on decompression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】OKC is described as “a benign uni or multi cystic intraosseous tumor of odontogenic origin， with a potentially aggressive infiltrative behaviour. It may present as a single/multiple lesion(s). The latter is usually associated with an inherited nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【6】OKC generally has a docile clinical presentation， often asymptomatic， unless secondarily infected or， if the affected teeth turn symptomatic. Large lesions can cause paraesthesia owing to pressure effects.\n\n【7】Histological diversity is a known feature of OKC which includes variations in the epithelial lining， basal layer and malignant transformation to name a few.\n\n【8】Hard tissue deposits， namely dystrophic calcifications， cartilage， dentinoid are uncommon in the connective tissue wall of the primary OKC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Browne 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> reported a prevalence of 16.9%dystrophic calcifications， in primary OKC and 33.3% in syndromic OKC.\n\n【9】The incidence and implications of these calcifications on recurrence are unclear， either due to its rarity or due to lack of reporting. Hence， it is of paramount importance to report and follow these entities long term， to evaluate their true nature. This could aid us in formulating an ideal treatment protocol.\n\n【10】The following is a case report describing a 20 year old male patient treated for odontogenic keratocyst of right mandible demonstrating calcifications in the epithelial lining which is a rare histopathological appearance.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\nA 20 year old male patient presented with a chief complaint of swelling on the right lower side|删除段之间换行|of his jaw present since 6 months. The swelling was initially small in size which gradually increased. No complaints of pain discharge or paresthesia of inferior alveolar nerve was elicited.\n\n【13】On examination， a diffuse swelling was seen on the right lower side of the face approximately 2 cm in greatest dimension extending anteroposteriorly about 3 cm posterior to the corner of the lip. Superoinferiorly extending about 2 cm below the line joining corner of the mouth to the inferior border of the mandible. On palpation a bony hard swelling，non-tender，non-compressible and non-reducible was evident. Skin over the swelling appeared uninvolved. Intra-oral examination revealed bony hard swelling indicative of buccal cortical expansion in relation to 45， 46 region， retained 85，84 was present with missing 43， 44 .\n\n【14】The orthopantomography (OPG) revealed1 a welldefined multilocular radiolucent lesion extending from distal of 42 to distal of48 anteroposteriorly and superoinferiorly extending from the height of the alveolar bone on the right quadrant to the base of the mandible with the displacement of the inferior alveolar canal towards the lower border of the mandible. The border of the mandible was intact. Deep vertically impacted 43， 44 were present along with a supernumerary tooth (bucco-version) between the retained deciduous molars and impacted permanent teeth. No root resorption was evident. The OPG also confirmed the presence of a supernumerary tooth between the upper first and second premolars bilaterally .\n\n【15】Cone beam computed tomography of right mandible confirmed the extensions of the radiolucent lesion along with the presence of vertically impacted 43， 44 and supernumerary tooth. Thinned out buccal and lingual cortex with associated expansion of the buccal cortical plate was present. With a well-defined breach in the buccal cortex noted at level distal to the tooth删除4:<u> 45</u>. This breach could be correlated to the site of biopsy which was done prior to the patient’s consultation with us. A breach was also evident on the lingual cortex of 47 .\n\n【16】The lesion was provisionally diagnosed as odontogenic keratocyst ofthe right mandible； with the differential diagnosis of ameloblastoma， aneurysmal bone cyst and central giant cell granuloma. Aspiration cytology and incisional biopsy of the cystic lesion was performed at the thinned out buccal cortical region between 45 and删除4:<u> 46</u>.\n\n【17】Aspiration fluid was smeared and revealed the presence of scattered abundant hematoxyphilic calcifications .\n\n【18】Incisional biopsy revealed cystic lining comprising of 5 layers to7 layers thick parakeratinized stratified squamous epithelium with surface corrugations. Basal cells are prominent and show palisading arrangement of nuclei. The unique finding in the cystic wall was the presence of hematoxyphilic； dystrophic calcifications resembling calcospherites . The histopathological features confirmed the diagnosis of OKC.\n\n【19】Enucleation of the cyst along with extraction of impacted 43， 44and the supernumerary tooth was done followed with treatment of bony cavity with carnoy’s solution and packing the same with BIPP(Bismuth Iodoform Paraffin Paste) soaked gauze.\n\n【20】Microscopic6examination of the excisional specimen revealed similar features as described in incisional biopsy and the histopathological diagnosis ofOKC was consistent with the incisional biopsy diagnosis. On follow up of 2 years， there was no recurrence.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】OKC has been recognized as a separate entity of benign cystic lesion of the jaws. This entity was also referred to as cholesteatoma， epidermoid cyst， sebaceous cyst， or primordial cyst of the jaw. In1971， the WHO simplified the classification of jaw cysts and made the terms \"primordial cyst\"and “keratocyst\" synonymous 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. OKC was categorized by thelatest WHO classification as a developmental， non-inflammatory odontogenic cyst that arises from cell rests of dental lamina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>.\n\nThe KCOTs (now renamed as OKC) are lined by a regular parakeratinized stratified squamous epithelium， usually about 5-8cell layers thick and without rete ridges. There is a well-defined， often palisaded， basal layer of columnar or cuboidal cells. The nuclei of the columnar basal cells tend to be oriented away from the basement membrane and are often intensely basophilic. This is an important feature in distinguishing KCOT from jaw cysts with|删除段之间换行|keratinization. The parakeratotic layers often have a corrugated surface. Desquamated keratin is present in many of the cavities. Mitotic figures are found frequently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Separation of the epithelium from the supporting connective tissue of the cyst is common and is caused by metalloproteinases-mediated degradation of collagen in the juxta-epithelial regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Browne et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> found a high incidence of crystalline calcium phosphates，hydroxyapatite and whitlockite， and inorganic phosphates in the aspirated fluid ofthe odontogenic keratocysts. This may be responsible for the increased frequency of calcific deposits in the walls of these cysts.\n\n【25】Primary non-recurrent odontogenic keratocyst (which is a primary keratocyst without recurrence within 5 years) shows a slightly higher prevalence for dystrophic calcifications than primary odontogenic keratocyst that recurred (which is a primary keratocyst with recurrence within 5 years). However， in recurrent odontogenic keratocyst (a keratocyst that occurs in the exact area of a previously removed keratocyst or where there is a reliable history of cyst removal in the same location)， dystrophic calcification is comparatively uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【26】The most common calcification in solitary KCOT is dystrophic calcifications， reported to be 4.5% to 16.8% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，13，14\\]</u>. These are usually caused by degeneration and degeneration can be the result of necrobiosis or a foreign-body reaction. Additionally， injured tissue of any kind is predisposed to dystrophic calcification. High incidence of crystalline calcium phosphates， hydroxyapatite， and whitlockite， and inorganic phosphates were found in the aspirated fluid of the KCOT. This may be responsible for the higher frequency calcium deposits in the walls of these lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\nThere are limited reports of presence of chondroid material in capsules of odontogenic keratocyst. There are several possible explanations for the presence of cartilage in the cyst wall which included the presence of a chondroma； persistence and displacement of vestigial remains of the Meckel’s cartilage and nasal septal cartilage；|删除段之间换行|a possible metaplastic change of the fibrous connective tissue in response to chronic irritation； a possible induction of the cyst wall by the epithelial lining； and/or increased presence of “trapped”glycosaminoglycans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16-20\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Exceedingly rare is the presence of dentinoid which can occur as irregular eosinophilic masses with tubule formation or calcospherite-like mineralization. The possible pathogenesis could be the inductive changes which mesenchymal cells， can undergo， leading to calcium deposits. Bone Sialoprotein (BSP) is synthesized and secreted by bone， dentine and cementum-forming cells and has been implicated in de novo bone formation and mineralization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The other alternative explanation is that the formation of dentin or dentinoid may represent a metaplastic change in the connective tissue 4\\].\n\n【29】Andrade Santos et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> conducted a comparative study evaluating the immune-histochemical expression of nucear factor Kappa B， matrix metalloproteinase 9， and endoglin (CD105) in OKC， Dentigerous cysts (DC) and Radicular cysts (RC). The results suggest that the more aggressive biologic behaviour of OKCs compared with RCs and DCs is related to the higher expression of MMP-9 and NF-Kappa B in these lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Few of the histopathological criteria predicting recurrence of an OKC includes， subepithelial hyalinisation， basal layer budding(increased basal layer mitotic figures)， separation of the epithelial lining from the capsule and the presence of odontogenic epithelial rests and/or satellite cysts within the capsule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Therapeuticapproaches varyin differentstudies from marsupialization and enucleation， which may be combined with adjuvant therapy such as cryotherapy or Carnoy’s solution， to marginal or radical resection. The recurrent rate varies from approximately 20% to 62%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23-26\\]</u>. The recurrence of OKC is affected by 1) enucleation with or without rupture of the cystic capsule； 2) the surgical approach used (conservative approaches such as enucleation andmarsupialization vs. aggressiveapproaches such as total resection)； and 3) the use of adjunct therapy (e.g.， Carnoy's solution， cryotherapy，peripheral ostectomy)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27，28\\]</u>.\n\n【32】A review study conducted by Chirapathomsakul and colleagues通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u> revealed that all types of treatment， except marginal resection， gave rise to recurrence. The recurrent lesions occurred more frequently in parakeratinized OKCs， symphysis-body region， and patients who had lesions associated with the remaining teeth and were treated by enucleation and enucleation with curettage.\n\nLong term studies on the significance of the presence of dystrophic calcifications in the cystic walls of OKC have yet to be evaluated. Prompt reporting of these rare entities will enrich our understanding in terms of their pathogenesis， behaviour of growth|删除段之间换行|and their aggressiveness.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Blood test revealed that thyroid stimulating hormone， free triiodothyronine， and free thyroxine level were 200.93pU/ml， 0.88pg/ml， and below 0.1ng/dl， respectively. We strongly suspected that hypothyroidism caused the chronic pericardial effusion without apparent hemodynamic relevance. To get a definite diagnosis of the effusion， we drained the effusion through the left antero-lateral thoracotomy， considering a subsequent pericardial fenestration to the left pleural cavity. Then， we confirmed that the pericardial effusion was caused by chronic hypothyroidism because of a yellowish and transparent fluid. Treatment for hypothyroidism was initiated postoperatively. The patient was doing well， without pericardial effusion and aortic enlargement， under a euthyroid condition10 months after the surgery. In conclusion， getting his past history help we choose an adequate treatment in a type B dissection case associated with a massive pericardial effusion.\n\n【2】Keywords： Hypothyroidism； Pericardial effusion； Aortic dissection； Thyroid stimulating hormone； Free triiodothyronine； Free thyroxine\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Pericardial effusion appears followed by cardiac， aortic， pericardial， and other systemic diseases. Acute accumulation can cause cardiac tamponade associated with hemodynamic instability. By contrast， chronic fluid accumulation typically presents with limited clinical symptoms. Herein， we report a case of massive pericardial effusion associated with type B acute aortic dissection.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 73-year-old man was transferred to our emergency room with a sudden onset of severe back pain. The patient could not get us his medical history， as he was under mechanical ventilation for the intractable pain. However， his family told us that he had a history of hypothyroidism， but he decided to stop taking medicine several years prior by his own judgment. No other past and family histories were informed. Physical examination revealed normal heart sounds with no murmurs， and normal breathing sounds. His heart rate was regular and blood pressure was 166/96 mmHg. Electrocardiogram revealed a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 48 beats per minute. A chest computed tomographic scan revealed a massive pericardial effusion and type B aortic dissection with a small amount of pleural effusion . No intimal flap was observed in the ascending aorta and aortic arch. Dissection between the descending aorta and the bilateral common iliac arteries was observed. Echocardiographic findings revealed a massive pericardial effusion without paradoxical movements of the right heart showing cardiac tamponade and valve diseases.\n\nLaboratory tests showed a c-reactive protein of 0.45mg/dl and a white blood cell count of 4，100/ug. Other blood tests revealed creatine phosphokinase of 1038U/L， total cholesterol of 187mg/dl， and triglyceride of 117mg/dl. In addition， thyroid stimulating hormone， free triiodothyronine， and free thyroxine level were 200.93pU/ml，0.88pg/ml， and below 0.1ng/dl， respectively. His stable hemodynamic condition with the massive pericardial effusion prevented us from performing a median sternotomy for drainage of the effusion. We chose a small left anterolateral thoracotomy for drainage considering a subsequent pericardial fenestration to the left pleural cavity. The effusion was yellowish and transparent. Then， we confirmed a chronic pericardial effusion induced by a long-|删除段之间换行|standing hypothyroidism\n\n【8】Treatment for systemic hypertension and hypothyroidism was started postoperatively. The aortic dissection remained unchanged in diameter and longitudinal range for two weeks. The patient was transferred to another hospital for continued treatments for both diseases. He was doing well， without pericardial effusion and aortic enlargement， under a euthyroid condition 10 months after the surgery.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Heart failure， type A aortic dissection， and pericarditis can produce accumulation of pericardial effusion， which can result in hemodynamic deterioration because of its rapid progress. Systemic diseases such as hypothyroidism， systemic lupus erythematosus， and renal failure are also associated with pericardial effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Slowly developing pericardial effusion is seldom associated with clinical symptoms. By contrast， rapid accumulation of the effusion can result in cardiac tamponade even in a systemic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Pericardial effusion is a common clinical manifestation in patients with hypothyroidism， although it is often unrelated to disease severity通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Dattilo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> reported a case of subclinical hypothyroidism with a ubiquitous pericardial effusion. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by elevated serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone， with normal levels of free thyroid hormones. Before surgery， our case had a high level of creatine phosphokinase， but no clinical symptoms， indicating hypothyroidism.\n\n【12】Acuteaortiicc dissectionn can caiisepericardialeffusion particularly in type A dissection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Takagi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> reported a case of hemopericardium in type B aortic dissection， with bloody fluid collected via pericardiocentesis， suggestive of an intramural hemorrhage that was unable to be detected by computed tomography， as previously reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. A chest computed tomographic scan of our case showed type B aortic dissection with massive pericardial effusion. Although his hemodynamic condition was stable， we drained the effusion to provide a definitve cause of the fluid accumulation.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】A 73-year-old man with a history of medical treatment for hypothyroidism presented with a sudden onset of severe back pain. A chest computed tomographic scan revealed a massive pericardial effusion and type B aortic dissection. Blood test for thyroid functions with his past medical history and the macroscopic findings of the effusion provided that the pericardial effusion was independent of the type B acute aortic dissection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is widely recognized that its comorbidities include Mycotic Aneurysms (MA). We describe the case of a patient with IE whose initial symptom was a ruptured hepatic pseudoaneurysm. This led to a delayed diagnosis and the rupturing of a deep femoral pseudoaneurysm. Visceral aneurysmal rupture of unknown etiology should be suspected of being related to IE. In addition to examining for intracranial MA， examinations for extracranial MA may also be considered in left-sided IE with diagnostic delay. Clinicians must be aware that multiple MA can occur simultaneously in patients with IE.\n\n【2】Keywords： Mycotic aneurysm； Infective endocarditis； CT； CRP\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Infective Endocarditis (IE) presents with various systemic symptoms， including fever， which is seen in almost all patients with the condition. The comorbidities of IE include Mycotic Aneurysms(MA)， which often affect the intracranial arteries. Therefore，the current guidelines recommend that examinations for Intracranial MA (ICMA) should be routinely performed in all patients with left-sided IE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However， there is limited evidence about screening for Extracranial MAs (ECMAs) associated with IE. We report a case of an afebrile IE patient without elevated inflammatory marker levels， who's initial symptom was a ruptured hepatic MA. The patient subsequently suffered the delayed rupture of a femoral MA.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】The patient was a 48-year-old male without any relevant medical history other than gout. He had felt general fatigue and had a slight nocturnal fever for two weeks before admission， which was diagnosed as a gout attack. Although no antibiotics had been prescribed， he had occasionally taken antipyretics. Although he had a dental cavity， he had not undergone any dental or acupuncture treatmentbefore the onset ofhis condition. He also stated that he was not abusing intravenous drugs. On the day of admission， he suddenly felt abdominal pain when he was driving a car and stopped to call an ambulance. On examination， his vital signs were as follows： blood pressure： 199/102 mmHg， pulse rate： 79 bpm， respiratory rate： 30/min，SpO。 98% in room air， body temperature： 36.2°C， and Glasgow Coma Scale： E3V5M6. He was experiencing a cold sweat and complained of severe pain. Bedside echography revealed swirling blood flow in the liver， and contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) showed hepatic hemorrhaging with extravasation . No abnormalities were detected in blood tests： C-Reactive Protein (CRP)： 1.12 mg/dL，procalcitonin： 0.09 ng/mL，and white blood cell count： 12200/uL. Since the patient presented with non-responsive hemorrhagic shock right after the CT examination， we conducted Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) and emergent surgery. After stabilization， transarterial embolization was performed for extravasation from the middle hepatic artery， which was considered to have caused the hemorrhaging . The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Cefazolin was only prescribed for two days in the perioperative period.\n\nAlthough the patient was febrile， and his CRP level increased after surgery， such findings are frequently encountered after invasive operations； therefore， blood cultures were taken， but no antibiotic therapy was administered. The patient was moved out of the ICU on the 8h day. Treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam was started on the 9h day because the patient's CRP level was elevated， which was considered to have been caused by a urinary tract infection， and the regimen was|删除段之间换行|changed to ampicillin/sulbactam on the 22nd day. A CT scan， which was performed to follow-up the hepatic hemorrhaging， revealed a left-sided renal infarction， which was the first time the patient was suspected of having IE . Transthoracic Echocardiography(TTE) showed a tricuspid aortic valve with a hyperechoic lesion on its uncrowned leaflet， which was considered to be a vegetative lesion. Thus， we diagnosed the patient with possible IE based on the presence of one each of the major and minor modified Duke criteria. Cranial MRI was performed， and no emboli or MA were found. However， the patient suddenly complained of severe pain and swelling of his left leg on the 27h day. He was newly diagnosed|删除段之间换行|with a ruptured left deep femoral artery aneurysm and was treated with interventional radiology . Additional exploration by CT angiography of the whole body revealed no additional MA. The patient was discharged on the 64 day after the completion of 6 weeks’antibiotic treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam. Although multiple blood cultures were taken during the patient’s clinical course， no microorganisms were found.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Two important lessons can be addressed from the present case. First， IE should be considered when visceral aneurysms of unknown origin are found， especially for the ruptured cases， and blood cultures should be taken before the administration of antibiotics in such cases. Second， examinations for both ICMA and extracranial MA (ECMA) may be considered in cases of left-sided IE with diagnostic delay.\n\nIE should be considered when visceral aneurysms of unknown origin are found， especially for the ruptured cases， and blood cultures should be taken before the administration of antibiotics in such cases. It is widely known that MA can occur as a vascular phenomenon of IE. Whereas ICMA， which are found in 1.2% to 5%of IE cases， are said to be the predominant form of MA found in IE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-6\\]</u>， ECMA are relatively rare. A retrospective study including922 cases of definitively diagnosed IE reported that peripheral MA was observed in 18 (1.9%) cases. Of these， 12 (66%) involved ICMA， and 6 (34%) involved ECMA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However， the incidence of MA accompanied by IE might be underestimated because it sometimes presents with no obvious symptoms or diminishes after antibiotic|删除段之间换行|therapy is started； this is why we should take into account the possibility of IE as an etiology of a visceral aneurysm. On the other hand， from the perspective of visceral aneurysm， the Hepatic Artery Aneurysms (HAA) was considered to be closely related to IE before the antibiotics era. Recently； however， the number of HAA caused by IE has decreased， and atherosclerosis has become the main cause of HAA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. A retrospective chart review of 306 patients with visceral aneurysms reported that 36 (12%) of the 306 aneurysms were HAA， whereas only one (0.3%) of them was a MA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Besides the low incidence of the HAA accompanied with IE， the patient in our case did not show any signs of IE， such as fever or inflammatory responses during laboratory tests at presentation； therefore， no blood cultures were taken in the emergency department， and initial TTE was performed very late. Several blood cultures obtained after surgery revealed negative results. It might be due to the influence of cefazolin， which was administered perioperatively. The detection of positive blood cultures or the earlier TTE might have resulted in the early diagnosis and treatment of IE. Notably， the previous study also revealed that all 5 ruptured HAA were finally diagnosed as having non-atherosclerotic etiologies， including fibromuscular dysplasia， polyarteritis nodosa， and MA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Even though the incidence of MA is decreasing， if the origin of visceral aneurysms is unknown it is truly important to exclude the possibility of IE-related MAs， especially for the ruptured cases.\n\nExaminations for both ICMA and ECMA may be considered in cases of left-sided IE with diagnostic delay. Although IE-associated MA is rare， the mortality rate of IE patients with ICMA is extremely high. The overall mortality rate of IE-related ICMA is 60%. The mortality rate of unruptured ICMA is 30%， while it reaches 80%in cases of ruptured ICMA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，11\\]</u>. Therefore， the current AHA(American Heart Association) guidelines recommend that all left-sided IE patients should undergo imaging examinations to exclude ICMA， even if they are asymptomatic (Class 2b； level of evidence C)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. On the contrary， there are no descriptions about the necessity of examinations for ECMA. This case report showed multiple ECMAs. Although there have been a few case reports about cases addressing multiple MA in a patient with IE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>， the frequency of these cases has not been determined. A previous study stated that multiple ICMA were seen in 20% of left-sided IE patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， whereas another study found that only one of 922 IE patients (0.1%) had multiple ICMA通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The same study also found those diagnostic-delay ≥ 30 days was statistically significant to the presence of MA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In patients with LO left-sided IE that are not treated properly， multiple MA might occur more frequently. Considering the high mortality and morbidity rates of ruptured MA， clinicians should not disregard the potential danger of these lesions and should make an effort to detect them earlier. The vessel walls ofMAhavebecome fragile because ofinflammation； thus， the risk of rupture is higher regardless of the size of the aneurysm. In contrast， the risk of atherosclerotic aneurysms rupturing depends on the size of the aneurysm. In our case， we did not take account of the possibility of the presence of multiple MA， and we only performed cranial screening for ICMA. As a result， the patient experienced two ruptured MA. To avoid such situations， patients with left-sided IE may undergo examinations for both ICMA and ECMA， especially when the diagnosis was delayed. As screening modalities， the AHA guidelines recommend that CT angiography， magnetic resonance angiography， or digital subtraction angiography should be performed to detect ICMA (Class 2a； level of evidence B)， and contrast-enhanced|删除段之间换行|CT or CT angiography with 3D reconstruction (Class 1； level of evidence B) should be used to search for ECMA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【12】IE should be considered when visceral aneurysms of unknown origin are found， especially for the ruptured cases. Examinations for both ICMA and ECMA may be considered in patients of left-sided IE with diagnostic delay. Although our patient was eventually saved， the detection of the underlying IE occurred very late because of the lack of typical symptoms and history. If blood cultures had been taken at an appropriate time， IE could have been diagnosed earlier， which might have led to the early initiation of appropriate antibiotics and the prevention of the delayed rupturing of the femoral MA. Since IE patients with diagnostic delay may be classified as being at high risk of developing MA and subsequently experiencing a ruptured MA， they may undergo examinations for both ICMA and ECMA.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Patients suffering from ruptured visceral aneurysms present with sudden and severe abdominal pain. The rupturing of such aneurysms can be the initial symptom of IE， since MA is considered to be more vulnerable and to be ruptured more easily than aneurysms caused by atherosclerosis. Clinicians should consider IE in these situations. Patients of left-sided IE with diagnostic delay may be examined for both ICMA and ECMA. Clinicians must be aware that multiple MA can occur simultaneously in patients with IE.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for disease diagnosis but also Computed Tomography (CT)， thanks to its high sensitivity， plays a critical role. The major CT pattern of COVID-19 is bilateral ground glass opacities (50.2%)， mixed ground glass opacities plus consolidation (44.4%)， consolidations (24.2%)， and reticular pattern (9.9%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Nevertheless cough，fever， dyspnea， and hypoxemia are also clinical manifestations of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)， a reported complication of treatment with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI). ILD is usually diagnosed by exclusion of other causes oflung damage and， during TKI treatment，its incidence ranges between 0.35 to 1% with a mortality rate of 20% to 50%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Computed tomography can help oncologists to ILD diagnosis but imaging findings are nonspecific； the major CT patterns of ILD are area with ground-glass attenuation， a multifocal area of airspace consolidations， patchy distribution of ground-glass attenuation accompanied by interlobar septal thickening， and extensive bilateral ground-glass attenuation or airspace consolidations with traction bronchiectasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Among TKI， pazopanib targets Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor(VEGF)andplatelet-derived growth factor； it has demonstrated efficacy as first line treatment in metastatic clear cell Renal Cell Cancer (RCC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and after failure of standard chemotherapy in metastatic non-adipocytic soft-tissue sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Unlike other TKI， the association of ILD and pazopanib is not well defined and no cases of pazopanib induced ILD are reported in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【10】Since COVID-19PpneumoniaaanddTKI-induced ILDhave similar clinical course and CT findings， we reported a clinical case of interstitial lung damage in a patient treated with pazopanib for metastatic RCC during the peak of COVID-19 in Italy.\n\n【11】Case and Methods\n\n【12】A 70-years old man， with a history of clear cell RCC， was transferred to our hospital for fever and dyspnea. He was a curren smoker of 13 pack years， in good clinical conditions with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of删除4-1:<u>0</u>. No significant comorbidities were present except for a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation treated with flecainide. In December 2014，he underwent a left nephrectomy for a clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Fuhrman grade 2) with infiltration of perirenal adipose tissue； the Tumor Node Metastasis stage was pT3N0. During his regular follow-up， in November 2019， an abdomen magnetic resonance revealed six nodular metastases of the right kidney and a chest CT showed a lung nodular metastasis of 12 mm above the left diaphragm. In December2019， he started oral therapy with pazopanib 800 mg daily. In March2020 after 12 weeks oftreatment， a total body CT scan was performed and showed stable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.\n\n【13】However， ten days after the CT scan， he complained of dyspnea， cough， and fever. On clinical examination， body temperature was38.4°C， blood pressure 130/65 mmHg， heart rate 77 bpm， and oxygen saturation 95%. Blood and urine cultures were negative for eIl bacterial and fungal infections.

Despite its biological mechanism similar to other TKI that caused ILD， it is a rare complication during treatment with pazopanib. A previous case of interstitial pneumonia correlated to pazopanib was reported in a man with leiomyosarcoma suffering from chronic lung disease. He was treated with high-dose methylprednisolone and immunosuppressant tacrolimus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. More recently， another case of organizing pneumonia in a patient treated with pazopanib for a leiomyosarcoma was published. The histological specimen from the bronchoscopy revealed intraluminal fibrosis alveolar spaces and confirmed the diagnosis of pazopanib-related organizing pneumonia. A gradual improvement was obtained after treatment with oral prednisolone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Similarly to our case， time to onset of symptoms in these reports was respectively two and four months after the start of pazopanib treatment. No previous data exist about pulmonary|删除段之间换行|complications induced by pazopanib in patients with renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【26】COVID-19 breaks out after an incubation of 2 to 7 days with fever and dry cough. In 10% to 20% of cases after 3 to 7 days， there is a respiratory worsening with dyspnea and hypoxemia. Around3% develop SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.

The Wide variety of symptoms by which this condition presents makes the clinical diagnosis of IPT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u> extremely difficult and hence mainly reliant on radiological investigations. The evidence provided by CT scan is invaluable and serves two important purposes. Firstly， CT assists in making the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> of this rare tumor with clinically indistinguishable characteristics. Secondly， CT determines whether the tumor has ruptured or not. Differential diagnoses of anterior mediastinal mass include-thymoma， thymic carcinoma， thymic lipoma， thymic cyst， Hodgkin's lymphoma， Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma， Germ cell tumors/teratoma， thyroid/sub-sternal goitre.\n\n【6】Conclusion\n\n【7】In this case report， we present a rare case of a benign intrapulmonary teratoma in an 18 year-old male involving the Right Middle and Lower mediastinum of the lung.

We report a case of fine needle cytology of atypical medullary carcinoma. It was diagnosed in 43-years-old woman 18years ago. She alsosuffered from Morbus Hashimoto and hypothireosis. The tumour was detected by mammography in the upper part of the left breast. Fine needle aspiration cytology with ultrasound guidance of the tumour was performed. Cytological diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma of the breast was put. The patient was operated on (mastectomy) and histological diagnosis of atypical medullary carcinoma was put. The tumour was oestrogen and progesterone receptor negative. It was hyper dyploid with high proliferative activity by flow cytometric DNA analysis. The patient was without any sign of the tumour 15 years after the operation when she died because of the heart failure.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\nMedullary carcinoma of the breast is a rare tumour (4%-7% patients). Atypical medullary carcinoma is more rare (less than 4% patients). It is considered as distinctive subtype with a more favourable prognosis than invasive ductal carcinomas and other histologic subtypes despite it's an aplastic morphology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. There is no specific pathological reason for this name of the tumour. It is named according its appearance which resembles the tissue of the medulla oblongata region of the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. This term medulla derives from the Latin root “medulla” that means \"marrow”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Atypical medullary carcinoma of the breast has similar prognostic factors as medullary carcinoma but survival is better 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，6\\]</u>. It is usually diagnosed in younger female patients (age of 35 or younger) without family history .It differs from typical medullary carcinoma in terms of pathologic figures with an infiltrative margin， mild mononuclear infiltration， a low nuclear grade and presence of an intraductal component 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，6\\]</u>. Cystic type is diagnosed in premenopausal women or menopausal women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. It can be detected in men as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It is not hereditary as ductal breast carcinoma，but according to some authors the atypical medullary carcinoma has the same clinical and pathological characteristics and outcomes with those of the invasive ductal carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The tumour tends to be smaller than 3 cm with circumscribed margins and firm consistency. Therefore it can be mistaken clinically and radiologically for benign lesion. Axillary lymph nodes are often enlarged and they are not metastatic but reactive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The prognosis is poor because 90% of the tumours are oestrogen and progesterone receptor negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Histological criteria for typical medullary carcinoma by Ridolfi are： predominantly syncytial growth pattern in more than 75% tumour area， circumscription with a pushing margin， moderate to marked lymphoplasmacytic infiltration， poorly differentiated nuclear grade with a high mitotic rate， scant stroma and absence of an intraductal component 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Although atypical medullary carcinoma has some morphological characteristics similar as typical medullary carcinoma， it is different because it has： infiltrative margin， mild mononuclear infiltration， a low nuclear grade and presence of an intraductal component， mild or negligible mononuclear infiltrate or infiltrate at margins only； nuclear grade 3 (higher than for medullary carcinoma) and presence of microglandular features (opposite to medullary carcinoma)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. Oestrogen and progesterone receptor negative tumours are 90 % 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Genetically medullary breast carcinoma is often associated|删除段之间换行|with BRCA-1 oncogene mutations and TP53 alterations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. They are usualy aneuploid or tetraploid with disputable S-phase fraction value because of high intra-tumour heterogeneity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\nA 43-year-old woman， a mother of 22-years old daughter， presented with fibrocystic disease 18 years ago. Besides she suffered of Morbus Hashimoto and hypothireosis and therefore was cured with Vobenol (100 mg per day for 4 years). Mammography showed uniformly dense， non-calcified， round， well-circumscribed mass in the upper outer quadrant ofthe left breast .Ultrasonography showed indistinct lesion with inhomogeneous， hypoechoic texture in cystic tissue . Fine needle aspiration cytology with ultrasound guidance was performed using 23 gauge needle and 20ml disposable syringe. Cytological diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma was put. The patient has undergone surgery (mastectomy) and histological diagnosis of atypical medullary carcinoma was|删除段之间换行|put. Flow cytometric DNA analysis was performed from few parts of the tumour tissue. It showed aneuploidy-hyperdiploidy (DI=1，3； three peaks in G -G phase) and high proliferative activity (PI=33， 6%； S-phase fraction =12，8 %) . We did not perform detection of BRCA 1 gene in that time. The patient was treated with postoperative chemotherapy (CMF protocol) and radiotherapy. She remained free oftumour 15 years after surgery when she died because of the heart failure.\n\n【6】Results and Discussion\n\n【7】Cytology\n\n【8】We had to be very cautious in cytological analysis of the smears because Vobenol can cause morphological changes to the benign epithelial cells and they can be very similar to malignant cells. The smears were hyper cellular. Groups of benign rather small epithelial cells with scant cytoplasm were intermixed with large， moderately to poorly differentiated malignant epithelial cells distributed individually or in loose syncytial groupings and clusters .\n\n【9】Malignant cells were rather large (more than 25 um in diameter)， slightly anisokaryotic and pleomorphic . The nuclei had irregular nuclear membrane and chromatin was dense and fine，often granuloreticular. Nucleoli were prominent， enlarged and usually multiple with irregular shapes and the cytoplasm was greyish-blue， often ill-defined， and scant to abundant . Apparent vacuolation was not true： aspect was caused by scattered fat droplets. Large naked tumour nuclei， some bizarre， with rare mitosis， few lymphocytes and stromal cells could occasionally be seen. Therefore we put the cytological diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma.\n\n【10】The fact that it is impossible to put the accurate cytological diagnosis of atypical medullary carcinoma is perhaps the reason why I could not find any cytological paper about it but the author have found only rare papers about cytology of medullary carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，10-12\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Pathology\n\n【12】Well-circumscribed soft tumour mass with bulging surface measured 2 cm ×1.5 cm. Seventeen axillary lymph nodes were free of tumour. Tumour had predominantly syncytial growth pattern (over75 % of the tumour). There were large sheets of malignant epithelial cells with syncytial growth pattern and dense fibrous stroma infiltrated by lymphocytes . Malignant cells have vesicular pleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleoli . Tumour was oestrogen and progesterone receptor negative and katepsin D slightly positive.\n\n【13】DNA Analysis\n\nDNA analysis was made by flow cytometry using program PARA l by EPICS-C flow-cytometer. Cytological material is adequate for DNA flow cytometric analyses (DNA content can be performed on 10000-2000 cells and regular fine needle sampling contains|删除段之间换行|approximately 100000 cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Despite that， we have prepared suspension of single nuceli prepared from paraffin wax embedded blocks of the tumour because the results are better than from the fresh tissue because of intra-tumour heterogeneity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Therefore we prepared cells from six slices for each paraffin block. The suspension of single nuclei was prepared from paraffin wax embedded blocks of the tumour because the results are better than from the fresh tissue because of intra-tumour heterogeneity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. We prepared six slices for each paraffin block-a 30 micron section was cut， washed in xylene to remove the paraffin. After that it was rehydrated by repeat treatment with decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Mechanical disaggregation with metal mesh was performed and followed by enzymatic dispersion with pepsin. Then the samples were filtered through nylon mesh and stained with propidium iodide containing ribonuclease. Cellular DNA content was measured using program PARA I by EPICS-C flow-cytometer. Tumour was aneuploid-hyperdiploid with high proliferative activity (DNA index was 1，3； there were three peaks in G.-G. phase， P index was 33，6%； S phase fraction was 12，8%) .\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Ultrasound guided FNAC of impalpable lesions of the breast is very useful in searching and diagnosing of breast carcinoma. It is difficult to put the exact cytological diagnosis of atypical medullary carcinoma of the breast because the lymphocytes are not present in the smears or if there are only few lymphocytesin the smears Therefore pathohistological analysis was required for the definitive accurate diagnosis of atypical medullary carcinoma of breast in our patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Patient went through multiple paracentesis procedures to remove fluid. Once Streptococcus and Bacteroides fragilis were found positive in the cultures obtained from the paracentesis， exploratory laparotomy was done to determine source infection however yielded no new additional findings. Post-operation， patient was found to have fecal matter draining in her pigtail catheter and right Jackson-Pratt drain from her abdomen， possibly due to enteric fistula formation. Patient continued to have ascites and fecal matter drainage despite interventions and antibiotics， leading to a diagnosis of chronic peritonitis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Chronic peritonitis； Peritonitis； Cryptogenic cirrhosis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Chronic peritonitis is a disease manifested by chronic toxemia that may be infectious or chemical. It has been shown to be prevalent in about 10% ofpatients with cirrhotic ascites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> similar to our patient with cirrhosis. Clinically，patients with chronic peritonitis will present with bouts of colic due to an accumulation of exudate. This may cause a visible distension of the stomach.\n\n【5】Chronic peritonitis increases risk and can also be caused by infection. Infection can be from Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP)， defined as an infection of ascitic fluid (PMN>250/mm²in ascitic fluid and positive bacterial cultures in blood， urine or sputum). The presence of SBP is typically linked to patients with cirrhosis and ascites who develop symptoms of fever， abdominal tenderness and hepatic encephalopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Our patient of interest presented with signs， symptoms， and evidence that eventually led the diagnosis of chronic peritonitis.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】The patient is a 78-year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis with ascites， congestive heart failure， atrial fibrillation， chronic respiratory failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented to the emergency department on with abdominal pain after a fall. The patient was walking on the stairs 6 days prior and fell off the second stair after a bout of dizziness，striking the left side of her body. There was no head trauma or loss of consciousness， shortness of breath or palpitations. The patient also denied any chest pain prior to the fall. Nevertheless， subsequent lower left quadrant pain ensued and worsened on Valsalva maneuver. Patient was on Lasix and Spironolactone with last paracentesis two weeks before presentation at the emergency department.\n\n【8】Patient's review of systems was unremarkable except for abdominal pain， her chief complaint. The patient denied any allergies and had a previous surgical history of a cesarean section. She occasionally used tobacco but denied drug and alcohol usage.\n\n【9】On physical examination， the patient was tachycardic with mild increased work of breathing at rest. The patient had a non-tender， distended abdomen with trace bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. All other physical exams were unremarkable.\n\n【10】Initial X-ray of the patient's chest showed no significant changes indicating no acute events. Following initial work up， Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the patient’s abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed cirrhotic morphology of the liver with evidence of portal hypertension and moderate diffuse ascites. There was no evidence of acute intra-abdominal hemorrhage or organ damage and an indeterminate 7 mm hypodense lesion in the right lower lobe.\n\n【11】Based on the patient's presentation and workup， we began to consider a diagnosis of recurrent ascites secondary to cryptogenic cirrhosis or hepatorenal syndrome.\n\n【12】The following day， patient had a paracentesis procedure which drained 900 cc of cloudy fluid. Patient still reported continued abdominal pain. The clinical picture remained the same as she was still able to ambulate on her own. We considered other causes of her pain upon initial management of the patient however they were lower on our differentials. Patient's electrolytes continued to remain imbalanced during this time， likely due to her having AKI. Three days later a paracentesis was performed draining 1500 cc of fluid and as she continued to be distended other procedures were done to drain1080 and 800 cc of fluid. Bacterial cultures were drawn from the ascitic fluid which yielded positive for Streptococcus anginosus and Bacteroides fragilis.\n\n【13】After bacterial cultures tested positive， this shifted our reasoning to SBP. Patients with SBP typically present with severe constant pain； this pain in our patient could have been originally masked with the heavy ascitic fluid burden. Upon admission， patient was originally on Rocephin， however was switched to Zosyn for added Pseudomonas coverage. This was supported by the infectious disease physician on the case. Her condition did not improve despite prolonged antibiotic therapy and her pain continued to fluctuate. This led us move away from the SBP differential.\n\n【14】Another differential that was considered because of the patient's age and inconclusive imaging was peritoneal carcinomatosis. We ordered CA-19-9， CA-125， and CEA to gain a better clinical picture. CA-125 was found to be elevated in this patient. However， this tumor marker is not specific enough to lead to a conclusive diagnosis. This was supported the oncologist on the case.\n\n【15】During this time general surgery was consulted as the patient reported an increase in her baselineabdominal pain as well as a general decline in her overall health. Surgery was considered as patient had an acute abdomen. Exploratory laparotomy revealed many adhesions along with localized inflammations however no evidence of bowel perforations. Two Jackson-Pratt drains were placed on the right and left side of her abdomen. After surgery， the patient’s symptoms however did not improve.\n\n【16】We continued to monitor her laboratory values and her vital signs however they showed no improvement. Patient showed no overall improvement leading us to a final diagnosis of chronic peritonitis. Patient was switched from Intravenous Zosyn to Augmentin PO and was transferred to hospice.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis， has mortality rate of 40% at 1 year and 50% at 2 years， indicating a poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. There are many causes of cirrhosis and ascites， including cryptogenic cirrhosis.\n\nCirrhosis affects more than 600，000 people in US； cryptogenic cirrhosis likely accounts for 5% to 30% of these cases删除4:<u> 1</u>. The word“Cryptogenic”originates from the Greek word “kryptos\"meaning something hidden or secret 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Its name describes that cryptogenic cirrhosis is rare and a diagnosis of exclusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Cryptogenic cirrhosis and NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) have a high correlation. Cryptogenic cirrhosis and NASH are predominantly seen in women between 55 to 60 years of age that are obese (45% to 48%) and have diabetes (40% to 50%). Similar to our patient， who also had diabetes and obesity (BMI 30.73). Once cryptogenic cirrhosis is diagnosed， prognosis is often poor； in study by Rinaldi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> the median|删除段之间换行|survival was 60 months.\n\n【20】Peritoneal carcinomatosis can also be a cause for ascites. Malignant ascites is a grave prognostic sign and is associated with ovarian， colorectal， pancreatic and uterine cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a type of malignancy that allows other tumors to spread into the peritoneal tissue. Common symptoms typically seen in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis is abdominal distension， abdominal pain， fatigue， and weight gain due to fluid overload. We initially considered this differential diagnosis as primary imaging studies did not reveal a localized source of infection. The patient also had worsening abdominal distension even after numerous paracentesis. Ultimately， our team moved away from this differential when bacterial cultures came back positive for S. anginosus and B. fragilis in the ascitic fluid.\n\n【21】SBP is another risk associated with ascites. It is one of the leading causes of death in patients with cirrhosis. SBP is a primary cause of peritonitis； other causes include iatrogenic contamination without macro defect in the GI tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This iatrogenic contamination was also seen in our patient postlaparoscopic surgery because of persistent fecal material drainage present in only one oftwo Jackson-Pratt drains and pigtail catheter. We had SBP high on our differential list because of our patient's past medical history of cirrhosis and abrupt onset of clinical symptoms. After our patient's paracentesis procedure， bacterial cultures were drawn from the ascitic fluid. Cultures were positive for Staphylococcus anginosus， which is not commonly isolated from patients who have SBP. The patient had an elevated WBC count during this time as well as being hemodynamically unstable. Treatment was initiated with IV antibiotics for SBP. The patient however did not respond to the antibiotic treatment and remained distended with diffuse abdominal pain throughout hospital course \\[8-91.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】After working through our differentials of cryptogenic cirrhosis， malignancy， and SBP， the patient was deemed to have chronic peritonitis with persistent ascites. This was a diagnosis of exclusion. Patient was stabilized and transferred to hospice care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Generally MODY affects 1%to 2% of diabetes. The defect in glucose sensing mechanism in MODY-2 results in higher set point for maintenance of glucose homeostasis. Treatment is not recommended outside the pregnancy however in pregnancy fetal abdominal circumference helps to decide about the insulin requirement. We are presenting a case in which MODY 2 was diagnosed for the first time after her first pregnancy， there were controversies around the first pregnancy and the second one was uneventful. Genetic testing is mandatory to establish the diagnosis. In addition to it， implications of MODY and its subtypes along with pattern of inheritance and management aspects have been discussed in detail.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Gestational diabetes is the one of the most common medical disorder in pregnancy apart from anemia and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. It’s defined as glucose intolerance of varying severity either with its first onset or recognition during pregnancy. It is not uncommon for type II or even type I diabetes recognised for the first time in pregnancy. Rarely， Glucokinase gene mutation related hyperglycaemia-Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (GCK-MODY) may get detected for the first time in pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> . If the diagnosis is known the management is straight forward. However during pregnancy it is not uncommon to misdiagnose it as Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and they may not respond to usual treatment modalities of gestational diabetes. We are presenting a case of pregnant woman with glucokinase mutation with the clinical dilemma in management during her first pregnancy before its recognition and successful management of the same once the genetic mutation is identified.\n\n【4】The pregnant lady presented to us at 24 weeks with known case of genetic mutation. She was G2L1 with previous caesarean section that had high fasting blood sugar values at the time of presentation. Her previous pregnancy was managed at different hospital. She was diagnosed to have GDM at 28 weeks in her previous pregnancy and which required treatment with insulin apart from Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT). In spite of 80 units of insulin per day  it was difficult to achieve optimal control of blood sugar throughout the pregnancy. Since there was a lag in the growth of the fetus pregnancy was terminated at 36 completed weeks. An elective caesarean section was done in view of Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) and the neonatal outcome was good. Her blood sugar level did not come down as in cases of GDM and hence she was evaluated for MODY. It was found to be that the mutation in hexokinase enzyme which was responsible for the marginal fasting hyperglycaemia and her medications were stopped. She was on follow up. After 4 years， the present pregnancy was after the diagnosis of hexokinase mutation. Even though she had high fasting blood sugar values and mild post prandial hyperglycaemia she was not on any medications. In discussion with endocrinologist， it was decided to start insulin only if post prandial blood sugar is more than200 mg % and the abdominal circumference of the growing fetus was also used as a guide to decide\n\n【5】Table 1： Diagnostic criteria for glucokinase gene mutation related hyperglycaemia in pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，12\\]</u>.

With minimal physical activity and diet her blood sugar levels were always between 140 to160 mmHg. She did not develop any other complications and the target ultrasound was normal. Fetal biometry at appropriate intervals did not show any evidence of macrosomia. It was decided to allow her for Trial of Labour after Caesarean Section (TOLAC) after assessing the risks and explaining the pros and cons of it. Epidural analgesia was offered as labour analgesia in discussion with anaesthesiologist. She came with Rupture of Membranes (PROM) at 37 week and the labour was induced with oxytocin and had successful Vaginal Birth after Caesarean Section (VBAC). The baby weighed 3.2 kg and had shoulder dystocia which required Mc Robert’s manoeuvre. Baby had mild Erb’s palsy and recovered completely over the period of 6 weeks.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\nGlucokinase is the key regulatory enzyme in regulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. Mutation in this enzyme can lead to either hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. There are about195 mutations have been detected. Heterogeneous mutation in this enzyme usually presents as MODY and it is detected in later part of life and is called as MODY-2. Since there is a defect in glucose sensing mechanism the glucose homeostasis is maintained at a higher set point|删除段之间换行|resulting in mild， asymptomatic fasting hyperglycaemia. They don’t develop microvascular complications usually and the prevalence of macro vascular complications is similar to general population.\n\n【10】This monogenic diabetes， caused by single gene mutation was first described by Tatersall et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. There is paucity on specific data about monogenic diabetes in pregnancy. The GCK-MODY is unique and it differs from others sub groups. GCK-MODY usually presents with mild hyperglycaemia and has distinct pathology unlike other subtypes. Other types of MODY are usually born normoglycaemic and they develop diabetes in adolescents or in young adults and it progresses over the period of time. Such individuals require treatment outside the pregnancy too as there is increased risk of diabetic related complications.\n\n【11】It affects 1% to 3% of all GDM population.

If fetus is inherited with GCK mutation and insulin treatment is initiated in such women， it will result in fetal growth restriction which happened in her first pregnancy (inappropriate high dose of insulin to optimize glucose homeostasis resulted in baby weight of 2.25 kg). Generally the treatment is not initiated before 32 weeks. There is 50% chance that the offspring is affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Knowledge of fetal genotyping is not usually not mandatory to determine the need for initiation of insulin treatment and regular monitoring of abdominal circumference would suffice. Whenever the fetus is unaffected， the AC usually goes beyond75h percentile. In such situations， an intensive insulin treatment is required and large doses of insulin may be required which may be difficult sometimes to reduce the blood sugar values to near normal range of pregnancy.\n\nThe birth weight was more than 90h percentile in 55% of babies who were not inherited with hexokinase enzyme compared to only9% when the inheritance was present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. It was also found that there was reduction in birth weight of around 400 gm in those babies who were inherited and the mother was not. There is no increased risk of congenital anomalies reported so far in women with hexokinase|删除段之间换行|mutation. In spite of having an impact on fetal growth in GCK mutation， the evidence is lacking for the development of any long term complications in the off spring 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【18】There is a data of metformin outside the pregnancy and it shows that there is no effect on lowering blood glucose in women with hexokinase mutation. There is no place for OHA in women with hexokinase mutation in pregnancy.\n\n【19】If the fetal growth is unaffected， pregnancy can be continued till term and the pregnancy is terminated at 38 weeks if there is any evidence of macrosomia. The pregnancy implication in different types of common forms of MODY is described in Table 2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Postpartum evaluation of the mother and genetic screening is needed if the condition is not diagnosed earlier. There is no need for routine follow up of women with glucokinase mutation. Medical nutrition therapy has little impact on blood glucose level in women with hexokinase mutation. At present there is no evidence to initiate treatment outside the pregnancy as these individuals are not at risk of developing any vascular complications. If the women is already on treatment and if subsequently diagnosed as glucokinase mutation the treatment can be stopped. There was a longitudinal study in which there were about 799 GCK-MODY patients were compared. The HbA1C levels of those who received treatment was not different from those who were not on treatment (6.5% vs. 6.4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The risk of developing type I and type II DM in future is similar to general population.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\nThe heterozygous mutation of hexokinase enzyme results in mild fasting hyperglycaemia. They don’t require treatment outside the|删除段之间换行|pregnancy. They are not at risk of developing long term complications and they don’t respond to oral hypoglycaemic agents. If the baby does not inherit the enzyme and there is an evidence of macrosomia insulin treatment is required. Uncontrolled fasting hyperglycaemia in spite of high doses of insulin during pregnancy should always raise the suspicion of this simple condition. However other subtypes of MODY requires multidisciplinary management which involve other specialities like endocrinologist， geneticist and neonatologist.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

VFSS involves the use of X-rays， and there is increasing concern about patient radiation doses in VFSS diagnostic. A few studies have evaluated the dose of radiation a patient receives during VFSS； however， in these studies， the patient exposure dose was determined using a calculation from dose area product.\n\nTherefore， we investigated patients' actual Entrance Skin Dose (ESD) during VFSS using a fiber-optic sensor attached to the patient's skin for direct reading of the patient's ESD.

VFSS involves the use of X-rays， and there is increasing concern about radiation doses in VFSS diagnostic and interventional procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. The Food and Drug Administration and the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommend that the dose of radiation that each patient receives should be measured and recorded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-10\\]</u>.\n\n【8】VFSS can be useful to characterize swallowing abnormalities affecting patients with dysphagia； however， some patients may undergo multiple VFSS procedures， further increasing the risk of radiation-related side effects. Previous reports in interventional radiology have measured patients'radiation exposure dose using Dose-Area-Product (DAP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>， which is a calculation. To the best of our knowledge， a few studies concerning the dose of radiation a patient receives during VFSS have used DAP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. DAP is a calculation of a patient's exposure dose. In contrast， in this study， we used a scintillation fiber-optic sensor dosimeter can be attached directly to the patient’s skin for direct reading of the Entrance Skin Dose (ESD).\n\n【9】this study. We measured the patient's entrance skin dose using a scintillation fiber optic dosimeter sensor (A).\n\n【10】In this study， we clarify the ESD during VFSS in-clinic.\n\n【11】Materials and Methods\n\n【12】Facilities\n\n【13】All examinations were performed using a ZEXIRA digital fluororadiography system (Canon Medical Systems， Tokyo， Japan). The control system for this equipment sets the X-ray exposurekV and mA automatically (67kV to 97kVand 0.9 mA to 2.5 mA). Consecutive fluoroscopy was used and the permanent filtration was 1.2 mmAl. The filter is attached to the fluororadiography system in the clinical setting. Image intensifier size was 10 inches. The entrance exposure area was the same as the actual diameter setting of the image intensifier. The X-ray exposure factors for all systems were as follows： The source to image intensifier distance was 148 cm， and the distance between the source and the patient entrance surface was approximately 90 cm to100 cm . Collimation was routinely performed to exclude patients eyes from the primary beam. However， the irradiated area included the cervical spine， thyroid， submandibular gland， parotid gland， and mandible . X-ray technicians were routinely present， in addition to the consulting physician.\n\n【14】Methods of VFSS procedure\n\n【15】The technique used in our VFSS procedure differs from that used in the usual VFSS procedure. Patients eat and drink in the following order： A jelly， agar， thickened water， water， and cookies containing barium. However， depending on the patient’s swallowing ability， eating was stopped on the instructions of the attending physician. Patients were assessed in a seated posture， on a chair or wheelchair. When using a variable-angle wheelchair (“VFSS chair)， VFSS was performed at an angle the patient would normally be in when eating； screened in the lateral and frontal positions.\n\n【16】Participants\n\n【17】VFSS procedures were performed in 20 adult patients at Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University Hospital (Sendai， Japan) between October 2016 and April删除4:<u> 2017</u>.\n\n【18】Dosimeter\n\n【19】We used the MIDSOF sensor 通用删除1(英):<u>(measuring range： 10 pGy to 1000Gy： Figure 3)</u> to each patient's neck. The MIDSOF dosimeter adheres directly to a patient's skin and displays the patient's ESD and dose rate in real time during radiological examination. The position of the dosimeter was also changed when the patient was moved from lateral to front. Direct readings are possible without energy correction. Thus， MIDSOF measurements included backscatter from patient low-energy dependence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Calculation software\n\n【21】From these results， we also investigated the Effective Dose (ED) using the PCXMC. It calculates ED to patients undergoing any type of medical radiographic X-ray examination. The ED is defined for an adult person andhas been used as an indicator of risk for late effects of radiation. We use an average patient model with PCXMC. It is using patient anatomical data， in the form of mathematical hermaphrodite phantom models， with Monte Carlo techniques.\n\n【22】Results\n\n【23】The data for the included 20 patients are shown in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. Five of the 20 patients were evaluated in the lateral plane， only. Figure 4shows the relationship between the fluoroscopy time and the ESD. The correlation coefficient between fluoroscopy time and ESD was R=0.39(p<0.01). Table 2 shows patients individual data， namely age， sex， body weight， exposure time (lateral， front)， exposure dose\n\n【24】Table 1： Patients measurement data (n=20).\n\n| Male/Female ratio  | 11：09  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Average body weight (kg)  | 51.1±15.9  |\n| Average age (y)  | 80.6±10.8  |\n| Average fluorascopy time (min) lateral  | 4.3±1.4  |\n| Average Entrance skin Dase (mGy) lateral  | 18.6±8.7  |\n| Average Effective dose (mSv)  | 0.9±0.4  |\n\n【26】(lateral， front)， ED. No additional time was needed to perform the clinical measurements compared with normal exams from patient entry to exit.\n\n【27】Discussion\n\n【28】In this study， we measured the ESD received by patients undergoing VFSS. Previous studies evaluated fluoroscopy time and ED in videofluoroscopy. For example， Zammit Maempel et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> reported a mean screening time of 181s and mean ED of 0.2 mSv； Kim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， reported a mean screening time of 4.82 min and mean ED of 1.23 mSv； Wright et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， reported a mean screening time of 286s and mean ED of 0.4 mSv； while Chau et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>， showed a mean screening time of 4.23 min and mean ED of 0.31 mSv. The mean screening time in our study of 4.3 min and mean ED of 0.9 mSv. Compared to the previous study， both fluoroscopy time and ED ware within the range of the previous studies. Our study uses consecutive fluoroscopy， but using pulsed fluoroscopy and additional filter may reduce the exposure dose 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\nTo our knowledge， ours is the first study to report the actual ESD dose received by a patient during VFSS and not a calculation. Figure|删除段之间换行|4 shows the relationship between fluoroscopy time and ESD with correlation coefficient of R²=0.39 (p<0.01)， which was not a strong correlation as in previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Because fluoroscopy uses an automatic brightness control system， if the cervical spine is included in the region of interest， the exposure dose may increase even with short-duration fluoroscopy.\n\n【30】The average ESD in our study was 18.6 ± 8.7 mGyper VFSS procedure， which was somewhat higher than the skin dose value(12.79 mGy) estimated in our phantom study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The reason for this is that the distance to the X-ray tube and phantom surface was 110 cm， whereas in the current clinical study， the distance between the X-ray tube and the patient's skin surface was approximately 90 cm to 100cm. Furthermore， while the tube voltage and tube current were 70kV to 71 kV and 1.0 mA to 1.1 mA， respectively， in the phantom study，\n\n【31】Table 2： Individual data for the 20 included patients.\n\n| SI.No  | Age  | M/F  | Body Weight (kg)  | Exposure time(min)  | Exposure time (min)  | Entrance skin dose (mGy)  | Entrance skin dose (mGy)  | Effective dose(mSv)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SI.No  | Age  | M/F  | Body Weight (kg)  | Lateral  | Front  | Lateral  | Front  | Effective dose(mSv)  |\n| 1  | 89  | M  | 52  | 3  | 0.8  | 7.2  | 1.4  | 0.4  |\n| 2  | 97  | M  | 41.7  | 8.1  | 一  | 23.7  | 一  | 1.13  |\n| 3  | 71  | M  | 47.7  | 5  | \\-一  | 21.2  | \\-  | 1.01  |\n| 4  | 59  | F  | 40  | 2  | 0.8  | 5.8  | 1.2  | 0.33  |\n| 5  | 79  | M  | 44.9  | 3.5  | 0.6  | 17.3  | 2.9  | 0.97  |\n| 6  | 94  | F  | 43.9  | 4.8  | 0.4  | 10  | 1.8  | 0.56  |\n| 7  | 72  | M  | 71  | 2.1  | 0.3  | 11.7  | 2.9  | 0.7  |\n| 8  | 75  | F  | 36.8  | 5.1  | 1  | 17.7  | 7.4  | 1.2  |\n| 9  | 77  | M  | 62  | 2.7  | 0.3  | 11  | 3  | 0.67  |\n| 10  | 91  | F  | 49.5  | 1.9  |  | 9.5  |  | 0.45  |\n| 11  | 83  | F  | 33.3  | 2.7  |  | 9.7  |  | 0.46  |\n| 12  | 86  | M  | 33.7  | 3.6  | 1.2  | 10.5  | 8.5  | 0.91  |\n| 13  | 91  | M  | 51.1  | 4.6  | 0.5  | 16.7  | 5.2  | 1.05  |\n| 14  | 78  | F  | 40.3  | 3.9  | 0.4  | 14.7  | 3.3  | 0.86  |\n| 15  | 54  | M  | 84.8  | 4  | 0.7  | 31.6  | 8.9  | 1.94  |\n| 16  | 83  | F  | 52.5  | 4.9  | 0.7  | 25.5  | 6.1  | 1.51  |\n| 17  | 80  | M  | 60  | 3.7  | 0.5  | 21.3  | 6.3  | 1.32  |\n| 18  | 81  | F  | 63  | 3.7  | 一  | 23.6  | 一  | 1.13  |\n| 19  | 85  | F  | 66  | 3.1  | 1.4  | 11.7  | 4.7  | 0.78  |\n| 20  | 86  | M  | 47  | 2.2  | 1  | 4.5  | 4  | 0.4  |\n\n【33】M： Male， F： Female\n\n【34】the tube voltage and tube current in the current study were 67 kV to97 kV and 0.9 mA to 2.5 mA， respectively， and it is conceivable that the radiation dose was higher in the actual clinic than in the phantom study. However， this dose is significantly lower compared with doses received during many other common radiological procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> and barium swallows 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. However， because some patients undergo VFSS multiple times， and the age range is wide， each patient’s dose should be monitored carefully 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，23\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Screening time in this study depended on the patient’s condition通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Table 2 summaries the comparisons between Patients 2 and删除4:<u> 3</u>. Patient 2 had an additional 3 minutes of exposure time compared to patient 3，with X-raytube voltages of 73 kV for Patient 2 and80kV for patient删除4:<u> 3</u>. Patient 3 may have had a higher exposure when the cervical spine constituted the majority of the region of interest in the lateral position vs. patient 2， resulting in increased fluoroscopic conditions. Similar findings were found when comparing patients 1 and删除4:<u> 13</u>.\n\n【36】Our results showed that VFSS can be performed using minimal radiation doses. Our findings also showed that the potential risk from radiation exposure in VFSS is lower compared with other common radiological investigative methods. However， in accordance with the principle of ALARA， every effort should be made to reduce radiation exposure.\n\n【37】To our knowledge， this is the first study reporting ESD in patients undergoing VFSS， and our technique helps evaluate the more efficiently. We showed that the dose received by patients was significantly lower； therefore， we propose that VFSS can be used as a low-risk diagnostic method.\n\n【38】In conclusion， instead of estimating a patient’s dose in VFSS，we used a dosimeter directly attached to the patient's skin to measure the ESD. From these results， we estimated the ED， in this study. Using our method， it was possible to measure the exposure dose more accurately than in previous studies.\n\n【39】The main limitations of our study are that we analyzed data from a single hospital， and the small sample size of 20 patients may not reflect exposure in all patients. Further studies with a larger population are needed to evaluate the influence of the radiation exposure risk. The measured ESD in this study were very low， and it may be that small differences in exposure dose could havelarge effects on statistical results.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Pain started after a large meal and it was associated to nausea and vomiting. He had history of arterial hypertension， obesity and cholelitiasis. Exams revealed increase of C-reactive protein (CPR)， mild Neutrophila Leucocytosis and moderate hyperamylasemia. Abdomen ultrasound was difficult due to gut air interference and abundant adipose tissue. Cardiac and the remaining objective physical examination were within normal limits. Acute biliary pancreatitis was hypothesized， so patient was submitted to fasting and intravenous hydro saline solutions.\n\n【9】After few days， clinical conditions worsened with increase of abdominal pain and stupor of new onset.

Conservative management is sufficient is more than 50% of the cases and rest of the cases require surgical drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

A thorough knowledge of the structure and function of the parotid region is essential in management of these injuries. We report a case of an 18-year old malewitha discharging sinus and swelling in the left parotid region with ipsilater allower motor neuron facial palsy who failed to respond to conservative management.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】We report a case of an18 year old male patient who presented to our outpatient department with a history oftrauma to the left side of face six weeks back，which he sustained after a wooden log fell from a height of about 10 feet. At that time patient had a small laceration over the left parotid region. A small piece of wood was removed from the wound site by a physician at a primary care Centre and started on oral antibiotics. Two weeks later patient started having purulent discharge from the wound . Patient developed delayed onset weakness over the lower part of face after three weeks of trauma for which a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered by the physician and subsequently referred to our Centre. Clinical examination revealed purulent discharge from the sinus with diffuse induration over left parotid region， which was extending into left side neck as well. Patient had House-Brackmann Grade III lower motor neuron facial palsy involving the buccal and marginal mandibular division of facial nerve on the left side . Oral cavity， neck and otological examination were unremarkable. MRI revealed a linear fluid distended sinus tract in left intra parotid region involving the deep and superficial lobe of parotid reaching up to skin surface. A contrast enhanced computed tomography scan (CT) was done after discussing MRI with the radiologist. CT scan revealed the possibility of a foreign body within the sinus tract .\n\n【8】Patient was then taken up for surgical exploration under general anesthesia. Modified Blair’s incision was made including the sinus tract.Intra-operatively， a piece of wood was found embedded in the parotid parenchyma and was removed into . Cavity was thoroughly irrigated with diluted antibiotic solution and wound was closed over a corrgated rubber drain. Patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged on oral antibiotics after five days . At four week follow up facial palsy had recovered completely (House Brackmann Grade I) .\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Injuries to salivary glands remain uncommon， with the number one cause being penetrating trauma. Other causes of acute injuries include blunt trauma and blast injuries. Salivary gland injuries are relatively uncommon， only a few large series exist.

Valuable information can be gathered by determining if the patient has been able to eat|删除段之间换行|after sustaining the injury and the effect this has on the salivary tissue. Additionally， if there has been drainage from the wound， the character of this drainage can be suggestive. Examination requires inspection of the gland and surrounding structures while comparing it with the contralateral side for symmetry. Surrounding structures include overlying skin， oral mucosa， and dental structures and complete otological examination is indicated. Electroneurography and electromyography represent a more sophisticated means of|删除段之间换行|evaluation of facial nerve trauma. If degeneration of the facial nerve exceeds 90% on electroneurography and it is within a period of three weeks after the injury，surgical exploration may be indicated.

Both CT coronal and axial provide the best evaluation of the bony structure. Additionally， CT can give excellent soft tissue delineation.\n\n【13】Penetrating injury to the parotid gland， in addition to involving the parenchyma of the gland， also can involve Stensen's duct or the facial nerve. The anterior border of the master muscle is an important land- mark because lacerations posterior to this can injure the duct. Although a superficial or total parotidectomy would eliminate the salivary source， the morbidity in such a compromised bed may outweigh its benefits. When identified， injuries to Stensen's duct should be primarily repaired. Missing a duct injury may lead to the development of a posttraumatic fistula or sialocele.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Post traumatic chronic discharging sinus along with facial palsy should be evaluated with a high index of suspicion for retained foreign body.

The preoperative diagnosis of intrathyroid PC can be difficult and made at later stages， especially in the absence of hypercalcemia. We share our experience on an unusual case of metastatic intrathyroid PC， with normal serum calcium level， revealed during venous thrombosis investigation.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 53 year-old female， with no medical history， presented to the emergency room with 5 days of painful swelling of the right limb. A deep venous thrombosis was confirmed by color Doppler ultrasonography and the patient was referred to the cardiology department. During investigation， the patient reported bone pain and progressive deterioration of general status. A chest-abdomen-pelvis Computed Tomography (CT) scan was performed revealing left thyroid nodule and multiple osteolytic lesions suggesting bone metastasis.\n\n【6】Neck examination showed firm left thyroid nodule. Neck ultrasonography demonstrated a 3cm mildly hypoechoic left thyroid nodule with an oval shape and regular margins， classified EU-TIRADS 4 . Laboratory examination revealed normal levels of thyroid hormones. Serum calcium was at the high limit of normal range (2.5 mmol/l) with normal serum phosphorus and normal renal function. There were no signs or symptoms of hypercalcemic crisis such as nausea， vomiting or confusion.\n\n【7】The patient underwent surgery. During neck exploration， a firm mass was distinctly part of the left thyroid without a plane between the tumor and the thyroid lobe. Three normal-sized parathyroid glands were identified. En-bloc resection of the left thyroid lobe was performed. The intraoperative rapid pathology demonstrated malignancy features suggesting follicular thyroid carcinoma； a total thyroidectomy was then performed. There were no lymph nodes during exploration.\n\n【8】Final histopathological examination showed neoplastic epithelial cells， predominantly chief cells associated to oxyhil ones in solid arrangement with mitotic figures (<5 mitoses/10 high-power fields) . Capsular invasion was observed. Immunohistological staining of tumoral cells showed strong positive chromogranin expression ， while thyroglobulin  and calcitonin  were negative； thus confirming that the tumor cells were parathyroid in origin. Osteolytic lesions on CT scan were thought to be related to bone metastasis and initial venous thrombosis to paraneoplastic syndrome.\n\nPostoperatively， the patient presented hypocalcemia. A supplementation with intravenous and oral calcium as well as calcitriol and levothyroxine was started. The patient was discharged on the7h postoperative day with an appointment for 99mT sestamibi scintigraphy. Unfortunately， the|删除段之间换行|patient was not compliant and she refused any further exploration or treatment.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】PC is a rare malignant endocrine neoplasm. Less than 1000cases of PC have been reported in the English Medical Literature通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and only 25 cases with intrathyroidal localization. To the best of our knowledge， our patient is the first reported intrathyroidal PC revealed by paraneoplastic syndrome and the second reported one with normal serum calcium2\\].\n\n【12】Parathyroid glands can be located in ectopic sites in some individuals. This event is due to faulty migration from the third and fourth branchial pouches， during embryogenesis， leading to the formation of mediastinal， pharyngeal or intrathyroidal parathyroid glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The latter is considered the most uncommon site of ectopic gland (0.2%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\nPatients with PC are usually severely symptomatic at the time of presentation with severe hypercalcemia， while patients with normal level of serum calcium are extremely rare (2%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4\\]</u>. This may lead to diagnosis at later stages and thus a poorer prognosis. In|删除段之间换行|our case， there were no symptoms related to hyperparathyroidism； serum calcium was at the high limit of normal range and venous thrombosis， related to paraneoplastic syndrome， revealed metastatic disease. A palpable mass can be found， as in our case， in 30% to 75%of patients with PC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Most cases of intrathyroidal PC reported palpable thyroidal nodule at presentation， making confusion with a thyroidal tumor， especially in the absence of clinical or biological signs ofhyperparathyroidism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The diagnosis of PC is suspected in the presence of biological and imaging criteria. However， the final diagnosis is based on histological analysis. Preoperative localization of parathyroid lesions is mainly based on neck ultrasound and especially 99mT sestamibi scintigraphy. The combined use of ultrasonography with sestamibi scintigraphy has a sensitivity of 95% vs. 80% for sonography alone and87% for scintigraphy alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Recently， 11C-methionine PET/CT or18F-fluorocholine PET/CT have been shown as useful second-line imaging tools in patients with negative or discordant conventional imaging modalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Unfortunately， to distinguish PC from adenomasSis still challenging. Architecturally， the PC shows a solid to trabecular growth pattern. Histopathologically， it can show islands of tumor cells separated by thick fibrous bands， tumor cell necrosis， capsular， vascular and perineural invasions. Moreover， increased mitotic activity， high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio， irregular nucleoli and perinuclear halos indicate malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，8\\]</u>. Furthermore， adjacent tissues invasion， lymph or distal metastases are suggestive of carcinoma删除4:<u> 2，4，8</u>.\n\n【16】The other challenge for the pathologist is to distinguish thyroid (follicular and medullary thyroid carcinomas)from parathyroid malignancies. As in our case， immunostaining for PTH， chromogranin， thyroglobulin and calcitonin can be successfully used. Indeed， PC malignancies are immunoreactive for PTH and chromogranin and not for thyroglobulin and calcitonin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Surgery is currently the only effective treatment modality of PC. It requires an “en-bloc\" resection of the tumor and an ipsilateral thyroid lobectomy with gross clear margins as well as remove of involved structures or local metastatic lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3，10\\]</u>. PC is usually radio-resistant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In the absence of effective chemotherapy regimen， adjuvant chemo-radiation is useless 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【18】After surgery， long term surveillance is required to detect persistent or recurrent PC. Besides， PTH andcalcium levels monitoring， imaging follow-up is based mainly on 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT. Recently， the role of 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT has been demonstrated， particularly in early stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】Intrathyroidal parathyroid carcinoma is an extremely rare entity. In the presence of thyroidal nodule， clinical and biological signs of hyperparathyroidism should be routinely assessed. Localization of ectopic parathyroid gland is mainly based on ultrasonography and 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy. Surgery is the mainstay of the management of this pathology. Close clinical， biological and radiological follow-up is mandatory because of the high risk of reciirrence.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In this study， the aim was to report a patient with intellectual disability and refractory focal epilepsy who participated in HD-tDCS intervention for his seizure control and assessing the quality of cognitive function variation. Five days LTM evaluation results show that there was a distinct focal epileptogenic lesion in the C4. We recorded EEG and used IVA+test in three steps； before the HD-tDCS sessions (10 sessions)， at the end of the last stimulation and one month after. Attention performance showed little improvement in scores with regard to the IVA+test. The EEG studies showed a short-term benefit in reducing the generalized epilepsy severity. However， this effect did not last up to a one-month evaluation. More studies needed to be done in this area.\n\n【2】Keywords： HD-tDCS； Intellectual disability； Focal epilepsy； Attention performance\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The tDCS induces cortical plasticity non-invasively with the way of sub threshold neuronal membrane polarization with constant weak direct currents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Anodal stimulation results in excitability enhancement， while cathodal tDCS decreases it. When tDCS is applied for a sufficient duration， cortical function could remain altered beyond the stimulation period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In many ways， the effects resemble long-term depression. Consequently， directly targeting seizure foci with parameters of stimulation that induce long-term depression such as phenomena might reverse (or at least counteract) the hyperexcitable state in the focal epilepsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. High-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) is a new non-invasive technique that improves current focality and intensity of stimulation通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In this article， the aim is to report a patient with intellectual disability and refractory epilepsy that participated in HD-tDCS intervention study for probability of his seizure control.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Mr. MA is a 30-year-old left-handed male. His first seizure occurred when he was only 6months old without any provocation. The patient is the product ofa normal gestation and his early development was normal. The patient had learning disabilities and difficulty with concentration. There is no history of CNS infection or CNS trauma with loss of consciousness. There is no history of epilepsy in the family. He lives with his parents and at the moment he has no job and no history of tobacco， alcohol， or illicit drug use. The latest MRI showed a few nonspecific high signal areas in the subcortical white matter of both centrum semiovale. Moreover， left sided hippocampal malformation was reported. Current medications are Valproate 1，500 mg/d； Lamotrigine 300 mg/d；300 mg/d and Carbamazepine 1，200 mg/d. Five day LTM and sleep records demonstrated sharp and slow waves coming from the right central leads (C4，P4). These findings suggested that the patient suffered from a generalized epileptic disorder and a discrete epileptogenic focus which is most probably located in C4 region.\n\n【7】Procedure\n\n【8】Firstly， the process for the patient and his family was explained and their consents were gotten. The patient and his parents weretaught how to make epilepsy dairy. The baseline EEG was recorded. Then patient's attention elements were assessed by IVA+test. The stimulations started the next day with 4×1 electrode connected to a tDCS device (Activa dose II). Ag/AgCl ring electrodes were held in plastic casings that were filled with a conductive gel that embedded in a modular EEG recording cap. The center electrode (cathode) over C4 has been positioned based on the International 10/20\n\n【9】Table 1： IVA+Test findings\n\n| IVA+Test  | Before stimulation  | After last stimulation  | 4th weeks afterlast stimulation  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| visual focus attention quotient score  | 19  | 50  |  |  |\n| Visual Response Control  |  | 23  |  |  |\n| Visual Attention  |  | 4  |  |  |\n| Consistency Visual  | 0  | 66  |  |  |\n| stamina Visual  | 81  | 85  |  |  |\n| Vigilance visual  |  | 0  |  |  |\n| Speed Visual  | 64  | 64  |  |  |\n\n【11】Table 2： EEG fndings.\n\n| EEG  |  | Step 1  | Step 2  | Step 3  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Generalized spike slow (s/hr)  |  | 56  | 40  | 127  |\n| focal right central spike-slow (s/hr)  |  | 17  | 19  | 14  |\n\n【13】EEG System， and the other on F4， P4， Cz and T4 (anode). During each session (10 day stimulation with 2 day off in between)，DC was gradually ramped up over a period of 15 seconds until it reached to 2.0 mA， which was delivered for 20 minutes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. After the last stimulation， neuropsychological tests and EEG were repeated. The patient was followed for a month after the last stimulation.\n\n【14】Outcomes\n\n【15】IA+test findings\n\n【16】This patient did not validly respond to auditory test stimuli of IVA+. Only the Primary Visual quotient scale scores could be validly interpreted .\n\n【17】EEG findings\n\n【18】According to the patient’s EEGs， he had a reactive 8 HZ PDR and two types of epileptiform discharges； the frequent generalized slow spike-slow waves (2.5 Hz) maximum bifrontal and the focal sharp waves in the right hemisphere .\n\n【19】After assessment of the three recordings， it was found that the focal epileptiform discharges had no significant changes. Although the generalized epileptiform discharges were reduced immediately after the stimulation sessions， they were increased after one month to more than twice the baseline rate.\n\n【20】After the stimulation the patient’s physical and neurological reexamination had no change. The patient did not suffer from any adverse reaction， like a headache， vomiting， paresthesia， mood change， aggression or insomnia . As the findings reveal， the patient’s focal seizure frequency and duration increased during and after our stimulation totally. Albeit， there seemed to be a decline in the generalized seizure frequency and duration during the intervention， this effect was reversed immediately after the stimulations and backed to the baseline in the following weeks.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\nThe tDCS modifies the synaptic microenvironment， for example， by modifying synaptic strength NMDA receptor in a dependent way or altering GABAergic activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. The impacts of tDCS may be similar to those observed in a Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)， as shown by a recent animal study that applied anodal motor cortex stimulation and showed a lasting increase in postsynaptic excitatory potentials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Learning ability in people with intellectual disability is very low and thus neuronal connections and the ability to remain are|删除段之间换行|Table 3： Seizure frequency and severity.\n\n|  | Before stimulation  | During stimulation  | First weekAfter stimulation  | 2nd to 4th weeks afterstimulation  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Number ot seizures/week  | 1-3  | 6  | 5  | 5  |\n| Generalized atonicseizure frequency/ week  | 1  | 0.5  | 3  | 1  |\n| Focal right clonicseizure frequency/ week  | 2  | 5.5  | 2  | 4  |\n| mean seizure duration  | 1.7 min  | 1.16min  | 2.2 min  | 2 min  |\n\n【24】limited. These characteristics are the result of the loss of nerve cells， reducing the number and quality of synaptic connections occurs， causing an inability to create LTP and LTD in this patients.\n\n【25】Regarding the patient， the baseline cognitive tests showed severe impairment ofcognitive function that intervention hadlow improved the scores with regard to the attention test. The EEG studies showed a short term benefit in reducing the generalized epilepsy severity(seizure frequency & epileptiform discharges). However， this effect did not last up to the one month evaluation. On the other hand， the focal seizure severity (seizure frequency， epileptiform discharges) was increased dramatically even if temporarily. There was no other significant adverse event with this intervention and the patient could tolerate it well and found it feasible.\n\n【26】These findings showed that tDCS may decrease the generalized epileptic activity during the stimulation period， although this effect reversed after the stimulation is withdrawn. There is a possibility of exacerbation of the focal epileptic activity during the stimulation sessions which is also temporary and reversible. It is noteworthy that the observed changes may be coincidental and due to natural clustering of the epileptic activity. This can be assessed by more frequent sampling of EEG during a certain period of time.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】Can this method also be useful for people with intellectual disability?Dueto the consequences ofuncontrolled seizures refractory to medication in these patients， which leads to a weak performance in creating new connections to the cerebral cortex， for selection of patients for HD-tDCS， it is important to consider the quality of their performance on IQ tests. All the same， the lack of significant adverse events or deterioration of cognitive functions and decrease of generalized epileptic activities implies that this intervention did not convey serious harmful effects and in short-term， the patient may benefit from a mild temporary reduction in generalized epileptic discharges. As expected， dramatic changes like seizure reduction and cognitive performance improvement were not achieved with common stimulation methods and more studies needed to be done in this area.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

After treatment with potassium supplementation for \"hypokalemia and hypernatremia，\" he was discharged with a nominal blood potassium level. Three days later， he presented to our emergency department with numbness in both lower limbs， generalized weakness， presence of severe hypokalemia， and metabolic acidosis. A blood and urine metabolic screen reported elevated 5-oxoproline. High-throughput genetic sequencing revealed the presence of the c.491G>A and c.809A>G missense mutations in exons 5 and 9 respectively of the glutathione synthetase gene. A diagnosis of glutathione synthetase deficiency was made， and the boy was treated symptomatically and followed for more than three months. The acidosis was difficult to correct， but the hypokalemia did not recur. Glutathione synthetase deficiency is rare in clinical practice， and severe hypokalemia from damage to the renal tubules caused by organic acid accumulation as the presenting symptom - such as in the case described here -has not previously been reported either nationally or internationally.\n\n【2】Keywords： Glutathione Synthetase Deficiency； Hypokalemia； Metabolic acidosis；5-Oxoprolinuria\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Glutathione Synthetase Deficiency (GSD) is a rare disorder of glutathione metabolism with a heterogeneous clinicalpresentation. More than 80 cases have been reported worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>； nine have been reported in China， all with onset in the neonatal period or infancy， and with first presentations involving shortness of breath， dyspnea with varying degrees of respiratory involvement， poor milk intake， poor mental development， and other symptoms associated with metabolic acidosis and anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-6\\]</u>. In this clinically rare disease， the onset of severe hypokalemia because of injury to the renal tubules caused by the accumulation of organic acids has not so far been reported in China or abroad as a presenting symptom. Here， we report exactly such a case in a 10-year-old boy.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】In July 2022， a 10-year-old boy presented to a hospital pediatric department with intermittent limb weakness for 10 days， aggravated during the preceding 12 h. Upon a diagnosis of\"hypokalemia and hypernatremia， he was treated with potassium supplementation and discharged with a blood potassium measurement of 3.7 mmol/L. Ten days after that diagnosis and three days after his discharge， the boy again developed generalized weakness with shortness of breath and was seen in our emergency department.\n\n【7】Electrocardiography demonstrated sinus tachycardia with low flat inversions of leads II， III， and aVF. Blood tests revealed elevated leukocytes， neutrophils， and ultrasensitive C-reactive protein， and liver function tests found elevated transaminases. The child was in poor spirits， but was not experiencing vomiting， diarrhea， or dizziness. He was admitted to the hospital on an emergent basis for hypokalemia， cause to be investigated.\n\n【8】The boy had been delivered at full term. Any history of intrauterine distress or postnatal asphyxia was denied. The boy's speech and intelligence were within the norms for his age. He had a history of hypokalemia (blood potassium 2.2 mmol/L) with hypernatremia six months in the past， which improved after treatment with potassium supplementation.\n\nOn physical examination， temperature was 36.5°C； respiration，35/min； blood pressure， 153/84mmHg； and heart rate， 158 bpm with rhythmical，strong heart sounds， and no murmur in the valve|删除段之间换行|auscultation area. The boy's nutritional status was good， and he had no facial deformities. His height was 150 cm； weight， 60 kg； and body mass index， 26.67. His consciousness was clear， but his mental health was poor. No yellowing of the skin， rash， bleeding or petechiae， congested pharynx， enlarged tonsils， or shortness of breath was evident. His abdomen was flat， with no pain or muscle tension. Liver and spleen were not palpable under the ribs. No swelling in the lower limbs was observed. The muscle strength of both upper limbs was|删除段之间换行|assessed as grade III， and the muscle strength of both lower limbs， as grade I-II. Muscle tone was low， and bilaterally，the biceps and triceps reflexes and Achilles tendon reflexes could not be elicited. Bilaterally， the Bartholomew and Gram signs were negative.\n\nAncillary testing revealed ketones， 0.7 mmol/L； procalcitonin，0.11 ng/dL；pH，7.088； PaCO。 12.7 mmHg； potassium， 2.17 mmol/L； sodium， 151.6mmol/L；bicarbonate，3.7mmol/L；BE，-23.9；glutamate，|删除段之间换行|10.0 mmol/L； lactate， 1.34 mmol/L； and total body hemoglobin， 13.9g/dL. Results from complete thyroid function tests revealed third-generation thyroid-stimulating hormone， 0.032 mIU/L (reference：0.55-4.78 mIU/L)； total triiodothyronine， 3.01 nmol/L (0.92-2.79nmol/L)； free triiodothyronine， 6.95 pmol/L(3.50-6.50pmol/L)； total thyroxine， 90.30 nmol/L (58.1-140.6 nmol/L)； and free thyroxine，12.80 pmol/L (11.50-22.70 pmol/L). Urine tests revealed protein，2+； occult blood， 1+； specific gravity， 1.022； and 24-h protein， 1.36g(0.00-0.15g). Morning pro-adrenocorticotropic hormone and serum cortisol were 260.00 pg/mL (10.00-63.00 pg/mL) and 54.69 ug/dL(5.27-22.45 ug/dL) respectively. Measurement of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (recumbent) revealed no significant abnormality， with renin 3.52 pg/mL (4-24 pg/mL)； angiotensin II 67.33 pg/mL (25-129pg/mL)； aldosterone 201.61 pg/mL (10-160 pg/mL)； plasma renin activity 0.36 ng/mL/h (0.41-2.44 ng/mL/h)； and aldosterone/renin57.28 通用删除7(英):<u>(0-37)</u>. Autoantibodies， complement tests， troponin， B-type natriuretic peptide precursors， routine disseminated intravascular coagulation， tumor tetralogy， and 17a-hydroxyprogesterone were not significantly abnormal. Cranial computed tomography suggested a slightly enlarged occipital pool. Chest computed tomography suggested scattered exudative lesions in the upper lobe of the right lung and both lower lobes of the lung， with possible inflammation. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary and bilateral adrenal glands (plain and enhanced) did not demonstrate any significant abnormalities.\n\n【11】The boy was initially diagnosed with hypokalemia， hepatic impairment， metabolic acidosis， hypernatremia， upper respiratory tract infection， and obesity. He was urgently treated with high-concentration potassium pump and sodium bicarbonate to correct acidity. Extended-release nifedipine was administered to lower blood pressure. The boy's condition stabilized. Blood and urine metabolic screening returned results of glutamate 412.52 mmol/L(45.00-280.00mmol/L) and urinary5-oxoproline 445.2 mmol/L(0.0-10.0 mmol/L). A retest to clarify the cause demonstrated that 5-oxoproline was still elevated， suggesting 5-oxoprolinuria. A urinary organic acids analysis revealed a slight increase in lactate， 3-hydroxypropionic acid， 4-hydroxyphenyllactate， and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate， and a significant increase in 5-oxoproline， but no other abnormal metabolites ， raising suspicion of pyroglutamaturia. A clinical diagnosis of GSD was made， and high doses of oral vitamins C and E were administered； intravenous alkaline supplementation was gradually reduced and then stopped， being replaced with oral sodium bicarbonate； potassium supplementation was stopped； and oxidizing drugs such as phenobarbital，aspirin， and sulfonamides were avoided.\n\n【12】Genetic Testing\n\n【13】With the consent of the boy and his family， whole-exome sequencing of peripheral blood was performed， and high-throughput sequencing detected the c.491G>A variant in exon 5 of the glutathione synthetase gene， which resulted in a change from tyrosine to cysteine at position 270 . This variant was assessed as pathogenic based on the interpretation guidelines published by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Furthermore， the variant c.809A>G  was detected in exon 9， which resulted in a change from arginine to glutamine at position删除4:<u> 164</u>. This variant was classified as a suspected pathogenic variant based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines.\n\nSanger validation of the two detected missense mutations is|删除段之间换行|shown in Figure删除4:<u> 2</u>. The origin of the mutation could not be verified because the boy's family consisted of adoptive parents， and parental samples could not be obtained.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Patients with GSD can present with 5-oxoprolinuria， isolated hemolytic anemia， and/or high anion gap metabolic acidosis and central nervous system damage. Urinary stones， mental retardation， neonatal hypoglycemiad。1unilateral femoral hypoplasia， and microcephaly have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>. The diagnosis is made based on clinical presentation and detection of elevated urinary5-oxoproline and of reduced glutathione synthetase activity in red blood cells or cultured skin fibroblasts. It can be confirmed by genetic testing. Treatment includes correction ofacidosis， blood transfusions， and antioxidant supplementation. The most important determinants of prognosis and survival in patients with GSD are early diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【17】The impaired glutathione synthesis that underlies GSD is catalyzed by glutathione synthetase through the addition of glycine to dipeptides， with the final step being catalysis through the c-glutamyl cycle. The lack of glutathione synthetase impairs that cycle， leading to an accumulation of c-glutamylcysteine， which is converted to5-oxoproline via the c-glutamyl cyclotransferase pathway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， producing the elevated urinary 5-oxoproline observed in patients.\n\n【18】Glutathione is one of the most important antioxidants in eukaryotes； it is involved in a variety of essential physiologic processes such as maintenance of cell membrane integrity， defense against oxidative stress， and coenzyme functions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Lack of glutathione can lead to oxidative damage in various tissues， neuronal cell death， and neurologic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Simultaneously， the accumulation of 5-oxoproline induces oxidative stress， which impairs energy metabolism in neuronal cells.\n\n【19】As a metabolic disorder， GSD is the result of a variety of genetic variants， such as missense/nonsense， splice， and deletion/insertion mutations. The disease is autosomal recessive， and patients with the disorder can be divided into three groups based on their clinical phenotype. Patients with mild GSD have mutations that affect enzyme stability and lead to compensatory hemolytic anemia； patients with moderate GSD also have metabolic acidosis； and patients with severe GSD also develop neurologic defects and show increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. Early supplementation with vitamins C and E can improve long-term patient outcomes.\n\n【20】Metabolic acidosis is the characteristic pathophysiologic process of GSD. Oxidative respiratory chain complex I causes abnormal mitochondrial respiratory capacity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>， which in turn leads to metabolic acidosis as a result of reduced renal tubular resorption of bicarbonate， impaired hydrogen ion secretion， reduced ability to acidify urine， reduced ammonia secretion， and reduced production and excretion ofurinary titratable acid and ammonia.\n\nMost (90%) of the potassium ions filtered into the glomerular capsule are absorbed by the proximal tubule and the ascending crude segment of the medullary collaterals. The accumulation of organic acids triggers a decrease in tubule function， which in turn affects potassium resorption in the proximal tubule， leading to hypokalemia. This vicious cycle continues until the clinical signs of severe hypokalemia， such as limb weakness， are noticed by parents， who subsequently seek medical attention. Acidosis also increases aldosterone secretion， which explains why aldosterone was elevated|删除段之间换行|at the beginning of our patient’s illness and then normalized on its OWI.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】In this case， with the accumulation of organic acids， renal tubular function decreased. With the decline of renal tubular function， more acid will accumulate， leading to more serious renal injury. This vicious cycle made the renal tubular function of the child worse， and then the clinical manifestations of severe hypokalemia， such as limb weakness， were found by the parents and then went to hospital. Intravenous bicarbonate normalizes blood pH to a physiologic range and improves tubule function， thus explaining the normalization and stabilization of potassium in our patient after the metabolic acidosis was corrected. Early correction of metabolic acidosis can effectively restore the function of the renal tubules and prevent the recurrence of severe hypokalemia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Clinical proteomics is the application of proteomics for clinical samples， such as blood， urine， serum and other. Since protein is the basic， fundamental unit of cell functions， its characteristics and pathways， study of clinical proteomics is of practical interest， relevance， and importance. Clinical proteomics is mostly applied in cancer samples and studies on cardiac， COVID-19， and other disease are also on the way， leading to the identification of novel biomarkers and targets， enabling better clinical treatment to the patients. Clinical proteomics also enables personalized/precision medicinebystudyingthe characteristic attributes ofthe patient under concern. Of course， application of proteomics to clinical practice also comes with its challenges on standardization of the sample collection (such as amount， time duration， etc.)， validation of the results， and other. In this mini-review， the various clinical applications of proteomics are discussed， to illustrate the potential of this powerful technique. The challenges and potential future needs are also indicated.\n\n【2】Keywords： Clinical proteomics； Cancer； Biomarker； Mass spectrometry\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】cited.\n\nProteomics is the fast， powerful study of the whole proteome (sum of all protein profiles) of a cell， biofluid， tissue， organ or a part of these. The results provide an information-rich landscape of differentially expressed (up and down regulated) proteins and their modulations of two or more samples of interest， under specific conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-5\\]</u>. Proteomics could be used to identify Posttranslational Modifications (PTMs)， expression levels， metabolites， metabolic flux， enzymatic activity， targeted biomarkers， discovery analysis， differentiate heterogeneous mixture， serial analysis of patient samples， pharmacokinetics， and therapeutic monitoring of proteins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. High throughput LC-MS/MS Proteomics technology has the speed， throughput， robustness， and sensitivity than other technologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Clinical applications of proteomics are a powerful tool to unravel the molecular mechanisms of clinical samples including blood， serum， urine and tissues of various diseases， such as cancer， cardiovascular disorders， COVID-19，and other. High-throughput molecular spectrometry analysis of human plasma/serum proteomes is emerging as a promising technique for identifying distinct protein profiles in cancer patients. Proteomic patterning of serum was recently developed for the early detection of ovarian cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Label-free， quantitative， high throughput Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics enables system-level analysis of thousands of proteins in complex biological samples 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. Bioinformatic analysis of the expressed proteins and their known and predicted molecular interactions can be used to determine functional roles of each expressed protein. Modern proteomics provides us opportunity to discover new proteins and pathways involved in the cellular signaling network， as ultimately cells are the basic fundamental building blocks of our bodies. Biological systems have to be explained in terms of the activity， regulation， and modifications of proteins， and the ubiquitous occurrence of PTM. It is immensely useful to identify proteins involved in the diseases and could be used for tailoring the treatment(s). It also offers identification of novel biomarkers and targets due to proteins altered by the disease. Proteomics involves study and analysis of 1000s of proteins at one time， allowing to the specific proteins expressed as a function of diseases cellular functions or interactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The biomarkers identified as a result of proteomics studies will have higher sensitivity and specificity， due to the multiplexed panels of altered proteins of clinical samples， highly suitable for multifactorial disease， like cancer. Many of these molecules， including essential proteins and most transcription factors among the abundance of proteins， ranging from <50 to>10° molecules per cell， are present at such lowlevels that are not readily detectable by other techniques. The diverse chemical nature of proteins makes the development of globally applicable proteomic assays very challenging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Proteomics enables not only the study of 1000s of proteins， but also their cellular components，such as protein|删除段之间换行|containing complexes， cell parts， organelle， and etc. Gene ontology enrichment of these proteins and their pathways furnish biological processes， molecular functions， and cellular components，subcellular components， that throw light on regulation，transcription， molecular transduction， receptor，translational and transport activities and more通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. In this review， the various clinical applications of proteomics are discussed， to illustrate the potential of this powerful technique. The challenges and potential future needs are also indicated.\n\n【6】Cancer Applications\n\nTissue-based proteomic strategies have been applied to the study of many cancer types， including prostate， breast， melanoma， lung， ovarian， and oropharyngeal carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Tissue global proteomic studies can be further extended to the investigation of PTMs. Yang et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> studied six primary lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SqCC) and eleven Adenocarcinoma (ADC) tumor tissue samples of non-small cell lung cancer， using MS-proteomics (and glycoproteomics). They identified over 6000 global proteins. The up and down regulated proteins revealed several critical pathways that were activated in SqCC and ADC tumor tissues. Using 96 frozen breast cancer samples of the conventional five types， Bouchalet al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> performed SWATH-MS. Their results indicated over 4，400 proteins， of which， 2，842 had consistent quantification， the majority of which were involved in well-established breast cancer pathways. These were obtained by performing proteomic analysis using an extensive spectral library containing the reference spectra for 28，233 prototypic peptides and their modified variants. Mittal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> identified thousands of proteins using the state-of-the-art bioinformatics techniques in their label-free， quantitative， high throughput LC-MS/MS， tandem mass spectroscopy-based proteomics studies of MDA-MB-231， human triple negative breast cancer cells treated with 1200 V/cm， 100 us， 8pulses at 1 HZ and cisplatin， curcumin and turmeric nanoparticle respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. The curcumin proteomics results indicated the presence of 1，456 proteins， of which 453 proteins were modulated(up/down regulated). These included kinases， heat shock proteins， transcription factors， structural proteins， and metabolic enzymes. Similar results were also obtained in the case of cisplatin and turmeric nanoparticles. These in vitro studies show the promise and potential of future preclinical and clinical studies， leading to every day clinical practices. Protein kinases are critical players in signal transduction pathways， and the dysregulation of these pathways is an intriguing area of study in cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Latest MS instruments and phosphopeptide enrichment methods enable the large-scale detection and quantification of thousands of phosphorylation sites. Phosphoproteomic studies in clinical samples allow the identification of aberrantly activated kinases and their downstream substrates， serving as potential therapeutic targets. Many studies have shown important roles in understanding the molecular mechanism of cancers governed by phosphorylation-mediated pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>. Zagorac et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> performed label-free quantitative analysis of the Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) phosphoproteome and compared relapsed and non-relapsed patients. In total， 34 patient samples were lysed， digested and enriched for phosphopeptides. Label free single shot runs resulted in the detection of more than 10，000 phosphosites， corresponding to 2，643 phosphoproteins. The analysis showed159 phosphosites to have increased phosphorylation status. Thus， proteomics studies are useful to treat TNBC， the unmet need among the various breast cancer subtypes. MS-based proteomics analysis was also used to demonstrate the inter-tumor heterogeneity across different breast cancer subtypes compared to healthy controls， which|删除段之间换行|enhanced the precision and accuracy in discovery and validation of candidate protein markers \\[171. Protein expression of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients using serum auto-antibodies indicated cross-reactivity with proteins from the patient’s tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Three proteins-HSP70，peroxidoxin， and Manganese-Superoxide Dismutase(Mn-SOD) were identified to be overexpressed. These could serve as potential markers for HCC. Proteomics analysis of lung cancer patients had shown that Napsin A protein was only expressed in patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This has been used as a potential biomarker to differentiate the primary form of lung adenocarcinoma from its metastatic form. Proteomics information is essential to classify the functional subtypes and stages of the breast cancer， to decipher its tumorigenesis mechanisms， c behavior and aggressiveness， to predict recurrence， to assess and reduce the drug resistance， to choose and monitor the most appropriate breast cancer treatment and its efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The office of cancer clinical proteomic research， in the Division of Cancer treatment & Diagnosis of NCI is a national effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the applications of large-scale proteome and genome analysis (Proteogenomics)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【8】COVID-19 Applications\n\n【9】Shen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> performed the proteomic (and metabolic) profiling of sera from 46 COVID-19 patients and 53 control individuals， using a machine learning model. The study revealed the characteristic proteins and metabolic changes in the sera of severe COVID-19 patients. They identified molecular changes in the sera of COVID-19 patients， compared to other group， implicating dysregulation of macrophage， platelet degranulation， complement system pathways， and massive metabolic suppression. There were93 proteins with differential expression in severe COVID-19 patient sera. 204 metabolites in COVID-19 patient sera correlate with disease severity and the various pathways analysis highlighted metabolic and immune dysregulation in COVID-19 patients. These could be used as potential blood biomarkers for severity evaluation in the clinics. These molecular changes could be used for therapy development in COVID-19 patients. Demichev et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> also reported a proteomic survival predictor for COVID-19 patients in intensive care.\n\n【10】Cardiac Application\n\n【11】Proteomics can be a key tool for the prognosis of cardiac allograft rejection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. 13 out of 100 overexpressed proteins were identified to have cardiac tissue specificity in post-transplant endomyocardial biopsies. Of those 13， two proteins (alpha-beta-crystallin and tropomyosin) could be measured in patient’s serum presenting cardiac rejection after three months. Thus， the power ofproteomics in the clinic could enable biomarker discovery， useful for future patent treatments. Proteomics enables a more thorough investigation into molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease， facilitating identification of both quantitative (number of modified proteins) and qualitative (the nature of their modification) details 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. It helps analyze organ and tissues at the subcellular， and molecular levels have revealed dynamic， complex， and subtle intracellular processes associated with heart and vascular disease.\n\n【12】Human Body Fluid Proteomics\n\n【13】Less or non-invasive body fluids， representative of a tumor or tissue or other， such as blood， urine form suitable samples for proteomics study. In clinics， blood is the most widely used human body fluid in disease diagnosis， prognosis and treatment outcomes\n\n【14】通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Blood consists of cellular components and theliquid component(plasma). Blood is tested for various plasma proteins via enzymatic assays or antibody-based immunoassays. The vast abundance of 22proteins， constituting 99% of protein content have a dynamic range of mg/mL to pg/mL. This could mask salient， low abundant potential disease biomarker proteins of clinical significance. Advances in MS-based proteomic detection technology and sample preparation have helped to partially overcome these issues.\n\n【15】Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) are tumor cells， shed from the primary tumor into the circulatory system and can lead to metastasis in different organs， provide a unique source of potential biomarkers. The occurrence of CTCs in blood is very small， only one CTC/mL. Different approaches， including that approved by FDA are used to isolate and detect the epithelial-based CTCs in breast cancer and CRC metastatic studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Advances in MS-based analysis， especially recent single cell proteomics approaches could potentialy provide proteome-wide insights of these CTCs to identify novel protein markers for their detection and insights into tumour heterogeneity， cancer progression and treatment outcomes. Isolating minute amounts of these cells is a challenging task and all the methods mentioned above come with limitations such as leukocyte crosslinking， which leads to contamination of the target CTC proteome. Recent advancements in moving toward single-cell proteomics will improve coverage of the CTC proteome in future studies.\n\n【16】Urine is another commonly sampled human body fluid， because of its large volume and ease of non-invasive collection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Compared to blood， it has a narrower dynamic range， and is less prone to proteolytic degradation allowing for more stable storage over longer periods of time. Over 6，000 proteins in normal subjects have been identified in urine， using advanced LC-MS instrumentation，leading to the analysis of urinary biomarkers. The challenges associated with urinary proteomics studies include inter-patient variability， as urine protein concentrations depend on kidney filtration and reabsorption performance， which greatly fluctuates within a population. Secondly， intra-patient variability needs further characterization because urinary protein concentrations are affected by the time of day， exercise， diet and age. Leng et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> studied the urine proteomics of167 healthy individuals and created the reference levels， of over 1，500proteins. They indicate that this study provided a proof-of-principle concept for the use of urine proteome for health monitoring and disease screening using the physiological and pathological changes. More work needs to be performed in this area.\n\n【17】In addition to blood and urine， there are other human body fluids that could potentially be used for biomarker discovery. Lassman et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> identified two biomarkers， SME1-1， and SME-2 from the cerebrospinal fluid from post-mortem diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease. Some of these non-conventional fluid samples are rich sources of organ-specific proteins due to their close proximity， but need invasive sample collection， and hence they may not be as applicable for routine clinical practices， such as early cancer detection or longitudinal monitoring of cancer progression-yet.\n\n【18】Summary\n\nEffective and economical applications of proteomics for clinical practice could help patients all over the world， immensely. Cancer biomarkers have transformed current practices in the oncology clinic. Mass spectrometry has the potential that enables increasingly|删除段之间换行|comprehensive insights into changes of the proteome to advance clinical medicine. Label-free， quantitative， high throughput， tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic studies in multi-centers， with standardized protocols， with high specificity and selectivity of proteins enable identification of novel pathways and biomarkers that enhance the quality of patient treatment that are affordable and efficacious， in cancer and other diseases.

Her nasopharyngeal swab test was negative for Influenza A and B virus but positive for SARS-CoV-2. She had a chest CT scan which showed lateral ground glass opacities with consolidations. Patient was started on ceftriaxone (1 g， i.v.， Q d) and azithromycin (500 mg i.v.， Q d). Twenty-four hours after admission， she was in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intensive care.

This innovative procedure is based on the use of the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical， Inc.， Mountain View， Calif， USA) that provides the surgeon with three-dimensional， high-definition， magnified visualization of the operative field， and allows control of various instruments with increased precision， tremor filtration， and more degrees of freedom. Since its introduction in 2007 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， the use of this robotic system for thyroidectomy has been seducing more and more surgeons and patients worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. Recently robotic assisted thyroidectomythought transaxillar approach is become widely used in the western world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， however concern yet to be for large or retrosternal goiters.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 37 year old female presented to the American Hospital of Paris with a cervical mass that appeared few months before her presentation， complaining of dyspnea， dysphagia pressure and suffocation in s supine position.\n\n【4】The patient was determined not to be operated by classic cervical approach fearing a neck scar. During this time seeking for treatment the size of the goiter enlarged from 12 cm to 15 cm with marked retrosternal extension.\n\n【5】The neck ultra-sound revealed a huge enlargement of the right thyroid lobe with retrosternal extension， measuring approximately 15 cm. An MRI was made to evaluate the retrosternal involvement which was confirmed by a remarkable sub-sternal extension， tracheal compression and pulling to the contralateral side .\n\n【6】The patient was informed about her condition； with such a challengeable surgical case there is a very high chance of converting the operation to open approach. Furthermore， no previous data or successful cases were published in literature. With all of this she insisted on being operated initially with robot via transaxillary incision.\n\n【7】Under general anesthesia a 5 cm axillar incision was made， ducking time (working space creation) was 25 min， a transaxillar robotic thyroid lobectomy was performed， the console time was90 min. the procedure went without complication， the RLN was preserved and monitored via NIM. Both parathyroid gland from the operated side were identified and preserved.\n\n【8】T： Trachea； G： Goiter； Ao： Aortic Arch\n\n【9】A large specimen of 15 cm length  was extracted only via the transaxillar incision.

Left side was clear. He is a product of FT NVD with uneventful neonatal period and no previous hospital admission. This patient was a conceived by non-consanguineous parents and was born at term. Perinatal course was uneventful.\n\n【4】Patient was admitted initially to pediatric inpatient facility and started on IV Cefotaxime. Initial CXR： No obvious abnormality detected. US Neck： Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were noted at the right side of the neck with the largest measuring 2.8 cm×1.2 cm. Right-sided parotid gland was noted to be heterogeneous with increased vascularity. Blood Smear： Leukocytosis -Neutrophilia and Monocytosis and Microcytic Anemia.\n\n【5】Seen on the same day by the PICU team due to concerns on airway patency and was shifted to PICU immediately， we anticipated worsening of the condition and antibiotics were upgraded to IV Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Clindamycin.\n\n【6】On day 2 of admission， he was more sick looking and with increasing swelling. Fever spikes of up to 39°℃ were noted with rise in inflammatory. We proceeded to intubate him electively to secure his airway. This was done with Anesthesia assistance in OR where an Incision and Drainage were done at the same time. Patient returned to ICU intubated. After few hours in the PICU， patient self-extubated (due to inadequate sedation) and ET was re-cited. Larynx was noted to be inflamed and edematous. US neck showed enlarged right parotid gland and ill-defined localized collection measuring about 2.7 cm ×1.2 cm x 2.1 cm with perilesional increased vascularity . CT scan neck with contrast done post all above showed the abscess tracking posteriorly to the carotid sheath and medial to the pharyngeal wall .\n\n【7】ENT team was involved， who recommended IV Dexamethasone for 3 days. ID consultant has recommended adding Vancomycin if patient was persistently febrile and toxic. On Day 3 patient clinical condition improved， fever controlled. COVID PCR was negative. NBT test for CGD(Chronic Granulomatous Disease) was reported negative.\n\n【8】On day 4 Pus swab C&S showed： Heavy growth oxacillin sensitive Staph aureus， sensitive to Clindamycin. Tazocin sensitivity was not tested but expected to be well sensitive to Piperacillin too. Size of swelling started to reduce on day 4 and he was successfully extubated on Day删除4:<u> 6</u>. On day 9， right parotid swelling seemed to be increasing in size and uplifting the right ear pinna and he had spiking temperature up to 38.9°C. US scan revealed a smaller collection .\n\n【9】Patient was taken to the OR； I&D was done with very small volume of thick pus aspirated by interventional radiologist and a Penrose drain left in situ by the pediatric surgeon to aid drainage of pus for 2 days. Vancomycin was started along with Clindamycin and Tazocin was discontinued. He was extubated on the same day.\n\n【10】Patient was discharged home on day 16 with advice to continue PO Clindamycin for total of 4 weeks. He was seen in pediatric clinic on day 21， no neck swelling was noted， US showed postoperative changes in the right parotid gland， no collection seen.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Acute Suppurative Parotitis (ASP)， an inflammatory and infectious process of the parotid gland， was a well-recognized complication of abdominal surgery before the advent of antibiotics. With the use of perioperative antibiotics， ASP has become a rare occurrence 5\\].\n\nPrematurity， low birth weight， dehydration， oral trauma，|删除段之间换行|immunosuppression， male gender and congestion in the parotid gland are known predisposing factors. However， like in our patient， it has been reported in healthy infants who had no risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The diagnosis of ASP is primarily clinical. Sonography of the parotid gland may help confirm the diagnosis and rule out abscess formation. Advanced imaging studies may be considered when the diagnosis is in doubt to rule out other congenital and inflammatory disorders of the parotid gland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【14】In the differential diagnosis， trauma，lymphadenitis，hemangioma， adenoma， lipoma， parotid gland duct anomalies， intraglandular abscess and neoplasia should be considered.\n\n【15】The polymicrobial nature of parotid space infections was illustrated in a study of 32 patients with acute suppurative parotitis. Aerobic bacteria were isolated in 34%， anaerobic bacteria in 41%， and mixed aerobic and anerobic bacteria in 25%. S. aureus Was the predominant aerobe (in 10 patients)， followed by viridans streptococci and H. influenza (in four patients each). Pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp， Fusobacterium spp， and Peptostreptococcus spp. were the predominant anaerobes. Although rare， risk of Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is higher in immunocompromised patients and hospital-acquired infections删除4-1:<u>8</u>.\n\n【16】Althougzhh上bacterial eeding oi the parotid can OCC11r hematogenously， infection is more common from oral flora tracking in a retrograde fashion into the gland. Possible etiologies of retrograde flow from the oral cavity into the parotid include dehydration with resultant decrease in saliva production and stasis， dilatation of the ducts (sialectasis) through scarring or obstruction by stone or mass， and congenital variations in ductal structure. Other causes of facial swelling that may be confused with parotid enlargement include maxillary infections， trauma，lymphangiomas，hemangiomas， lipomas， and adenomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Osteomyelitis of the mandible or temporomandibular joint， thrombophlebitis of the jugular vein， respiratory obstruction and sepsis are potential complications associated with neonatal ASP，and should be considered in the infant with unchanged or worsening symptoms. Facial palsy， salivary fistula and mediastinitis can occur rarely. Mortality is primarily related to the general medical condition of the infant， and is higher in patients who develop complications.\n\n| Table 1： The laboratory test results of the patient.  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Characteristic  | Value on day 1  | Value on day 3  | Value on day 21  |\n| CBC  |  |  |  |\n| WBC  | 25660/ml  | 9300/ml  | 9090/ml  |\n| PMN  | 70.70%  | 61%  | 29%  |\n| LYM  | 12.70%  | 23%  | 54%  |\n| RDW  | 15.20%  | 16%  | 18%  |\n| Hb  | 8.70 g/dL  | 7.4 g/dL  | 11.2 g/dL  |\n| Pt  | 335000/ml  | 293000/ml  | 465000/ml  |\n| CRP  | 186.2 mg/L  | 82 mg/L  | 1.4mg/L  |\n| Procalcitonin  | 13.2 ng/mL  | 5.1 ng/mL  |  |\n| Blood smear， peripheral  | Leukocytosis-Neutrophilia and Monocytosis，Microcytic Anemia  | 一  |  |\n| B/C  | No growth  | No growth  |  |\n| Pus culture  | Staphylococcus aureus， heavy growth  | No growth  |  |\n| U/A  | Normal  | Normal  |  |\n| LFT  | Normal  | Normal  | 一  |\n| RBG  | 7.2 mmol/L  | 6.0 mmol/L  |  |\n| Biochemistry  | Normal  | Normal  |  |\n| Urine culture  | No growth  | Normal  | \\-  |\n| Immunoglobulin A， G， M and E level  | 一  | Normal  |  |\n| NBT test for CGD  | 一  | Negative  |  |\n| COVID PCR  | 一  | Negative  |  |\n\n【19】Table 2： Some of studies concerning acute suppurative parotitis in neonates and pediatrics.\n\n| Author  | Journal  | Title  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ismail et al.  | Pediatrics International2012 Japan Pediatric Society  | Neonatal suppurative parotitis over the last 4 decades： Report of three new cases and review  |\n| Spiegel et al.  | The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal Vol. 23， No. 1， January 2004  | Acute neonatal suppurative parotitis： case Reports and review  |\n| Soltani et al.  | Iran Red Crescent Med J. 2019；21通用删除7(英):<u>(10)</u>：e96224.Published online 2019 November删除4:<u> 3</u>.  | Acute Bacterial Parotitis in Early Infancy： A Case Reportand Review of the Literature  |\n| Stoesser et al.  | Pediatr Infect Dis J.

We expose the peculiarities of each case， their personalized treatment and the results that we have obtained so far.\n\n【3】Our patients present an improvement of their facial aesthetic as well as their pronunciation， chewing capacity andeyelid closure. Therefore， they developed a better functional and psychological adaptation to their residual sequela due to severe facial palsy.\n\n【4】Keywords： Facial palsy； Static technique； PDO threads； Hyaluronic acid\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】The static facial suspension procedure stabilize the hemifacial palsy and contributes to facial symmetry， better aesthetic appearance， better chewing capacity and pronunciation in speech in patients with facial paralysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The new generations of PDO threads for tissue suspension contribute to a new form of facial traction. This polydioxanone suture allows tissue growth in situ， and consequently a greater suspension force.\n\n【7】This technique is an effective alternative to the use of allografts or autografts for facial suspension， since these techniques have their limitations and partial outcomes. Additionally， it could be an adjuvant technique for other static or dynamic treatments in patients with complete facial palsy. By using suspension threads it is possible to lift the descended facial portion and correct asymmetry that results as sequels of facial repair surgery. It allows as well， other sequela corrections such as synkinesis in patients with or without previous repair surgery.\n\nIn our attempt to implement and optimize the effectiveness of repair surgery in residual facial palsy， we expect to incorporate the use of differenttensor threads with 4D PDOtechnology， in which its safety has being proved due to its broad use in aesthetic surgery， aiming for more functional and long-lasting results|删除段之间换行|These tensor threads are reabsorbable and present multidirectional spicules. These spicules can distribute， press and hold in place the subdermic soft tissue of face and neck. The thread's design allows performing a complete treatment of the affected area， using a minimally invasive procedure threads are inserted in the facial areas tributary of lifting using microincisions. The treatment usually consists in implantation of， approximately， five threads in the paralyzed hemi face. In some cases， where there is excessive skin， one or two more threads are required in order to maximize correction. Suspension threads with 4D technology are approved by EC (European Community) with ISO (International standards organization) 13485：2003.\n\n【9】Ocular closure and lagophthalmos treatment， using upper eyelid gold weight and canthopexy， could be partially resolutive. In order to treat these defects， as well as elevate or modify the descended facial area and correct asymmetry we use a reticulate Hyaluronic acid implant. These implants already have being proved of safe use due to their application in aesthetic surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\nHyaluronic acid implant is a synthetic，non-allergenic， injectable materialthat allows performing|删除段之间换行|a treatment in the affected area using a minimally invasive procedure. It is inserted in the desired area using preformed vials that have different reticulations that are chosen depending on the expected outcome. HA implants are approved by EC.\n\n【11】The inclusion ofthis material to other therapeutic procedures that we can offer to our patients， improves facial correction a well as the contracture and synkinesis post paralysis that can result so disabling.\n\n【12】Case Series\n\n【13】Case 1\n\n【14】Eighty four years old female patient， with a previous right tympanoplasty surgery in 2012， performed in other hospital due to an ipsilateral cholesteatoma with a secondary flaccid facial paralysis. The patient came to our service in 2015， when then， she underwent surgery due to a cholesteatoma recurrence on the same ear， performing also a canthoplasty， a nasogenian sulcus and supraciliary plasties in the same surgical procedure. In 2021， we proposed facial thread lifting and palpebral injection of Hyaluronic acid， with a subsequent articulation and mastication improvement after three weeks until the current day .\n\n【15】Case 2\n\n【16】Seventy years old male patient， with a previous right flaccid facial palsy due to ipsilateral Ramsay Hunt syndrome， 25 years ago. He underwent a facial nerve decompression at the time in other hospital， also a facial lifting on the same side in 2016 with autologous static technique and gold upper eye lid weight. In 2021， facial threads lifting and palpebral injection of Hyaluronic acid were performed in our center. After 2 weeks， patient refers articulation， mastication and facial asymmetry improvement， as well as full amelioration of eye discomfort .\n\n【17】Case 3\n\n【18】Sixty eight years old female patient with facial palsy at age 4， of idiopathic cause. No posterior surgical intervention was performed. She underwent facial threads lifting with facial aesthetic improvement after three weeks of the procedure .\n\n【19】Case 4\n\n【20】Seventy years old female patient with a previous vestibular neurectomy in 2019， performed in other hospital， due to vestibular Schwannoma with secondary post-surgical facial palsy. In 2019， facial lifting， lipofilling， sural nerve cross-face and mastering nerve transfer were performed， also a gold upper eye lid weight. At last， in 2021 the patient came to our center， and there underwent right facial threads lifting with inferior palpebral injection of Hyaluronic acid， showing articulation， mastication and ocular improvement after follow up at three weeks .\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】Facial palsy can be consequence of diverse procedures and interventions， with different clinical presentations. In this case report study， we present only facial palsy with the maximum degree of facial degeneration， with no posterior facial movement recovery due to spontaneous reinnervation. In these cases， reconstructive surgery is the treatment.\n\n【23】Repairing techniques divide in： Dynamic， in which the patient can be able to recover some grade of facial movement， specially smiling； and static， which pursues facial suspension in the most natural possible way 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>.\n\nDynamic techniques are based on nervous or muscle grafts， according to the time facial nerve injury occurred. Neurorraphy and neural grafts techniques are indicated when nervous anatomical discontinuity or total irreversible loss is present， but nonetheless，|删除段之间换行|there are still functional distal neural tubes and facial muscles aren’t atrophied 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>.\n\n【25】On the other hand， static techniques， allow facial symmetry improvement at rest. They can be performed in either patients not candidates for dynamic techniques (age， comorbidities，etc.)， such as in those who are not willing to undergo these invasive procedures.\n\n【26】Facial lifting， thread lifting with grafts， myotomies， etc. ar included in these static techniques. Both techniques have advantages and disadvantages， but neither one allows optimal facial movement recovery. In our attempt to optimize the multidisciplinary treatment efficacy of the aesthetic and functional sequela in these patients， we introduce the use of facial thread lifting and Hyaluronic acid implants， with previously proven safety use in aesthetic treatments. Our objective is to obtain more functional and long-lasting results in patients with facial palsy sequela secondary to facial nerve section or aberrant reinervation within complete recovery.\n\nIndications for these and other type of facial palsy repair techniques are previously discussed in the Facial Palsy Unit of our University hospital， which is formed by many different clinical and surgical specialties， which treat each of these patients from their own case|删除段之间换行|Incorporation of this material has been motivated by the need of our Facial Palsy Unit to keep working on the therapeutical improvement in these techniques， and hence， offer the best possible outcome for our patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>.\n\n【28】And so， we propose minimally invasive surgery procedures to obtain more acceptable aesthetic and functional results， in patients with severe facial palsy sequela with or without previous facial nerve surgical repair.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It was first described by Pierre Mason in1923 in an ulcerated haemorrhoidal vein， but has also been reported to occur at various sites such as the cranium， thyroid， breast， neck， external jugular vein， tongue， oral cavity and rarely urethra 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Due to its histological features of papillary formation， anastomosing vascular channels and plump endothelial cells， it was earlier thought to be a variant of angiosarcoma； however nowadays， it is considered a reactive vascular proliferation to traumatic vascular stasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Due to its common presentation as a subcutaneous soft tissue lump， the diagnosis is usually not possible without histopathological examination.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 56-year-old， male patient came to our Outpatient Department (OPD) with the complaint of a left supraclavicular swelling for one year. On examination， the swelling measured 2 cm×2cm， and was mobile， non-tender， firm， and with no associated skin changes. A clinical diagnosis of lymphadenopathy was made and Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) asked for. FNAC reported the lesion as a benign lipomatous lesion  and the patient underwent excision of the lesion under local anaesthesia on OPD basis. During excision， the lump was found to be highly vascular， and multiple small vessels were seen traversing through it. The lesion was excised and sent for histopathological examination.\n\n【7】Histopathological examination revealed proliferation of endothelial cells within fibrous tissue， dilated blood vessels that contained thrombi， as well as fibrin deposition. There was no cellular atypia or mitotic figures， and a diagnosis of Masson's haemangioma was made . On receiving the histopathology report， the patient was questioned about any past history of trauma， and he revealed that he had been involved in a road side accident two years ago in which he had sustained trauma to the neck， left upper limb and a fracture of the shaft of left humerus that were managed conservatively.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Masson's haemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that is always almost intravascular， and clearly distinct from an organizing thrombus. It is known by various eponyms such as Masson's intravascular hemangioendothelioma， Intravascular Papillary Endothelial Hyperplasia (IPEH) or reactive endothelialhyperplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It was first described in 1923 by Pierre Masson within the lumen of inflamed hemorrhoidal veins in a 68-vear-old male and he believed the lesion caused obliteration of the vessel lumen leading to subsequent degeneration and necrosis. Masson's observations were modified by Henschen， who believed that the lesion was a reactive process rather than a neoplasm. This was confirmed by the findings reported by Kauffman and Stout 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> that the endothelial layer of the lesion was composed of normal endothelial cells and that the endothelial proliferation was of benign papillae pattern and the cells showed no atypia. Nowadays it is considered to be a reactive vascular proliferation following traumatic vascular stasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【10】It is difficult to make a pre-operative diagnosis of Masson’s haemangioma， and it is often misdiagnosed as fibrolipoma， ganglion， cyst， soft tissue tumor or sarcoma. The lesion has no age or gender predilection and has been frequently reported from the head， neck， fingers， trunk and cutaneous veins. It usually presents as a small， firm， superficial mass with bluish-red discoloration of the overlying skin. Color Doppler or a plain ultrasound can be helpful in diagnosing a vascular lesion， but there are no pathognomic features to make the diagnosis with certainty.\n\n【11】Histopathological examination of the excised swelling is the gold standard for making a diagnosis-the following features are important in making the diagnosis and ruling out other vascular lesions：\n\n【12】Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia， either well-circumscribed or encapsulated；\n\n【13】The papillae are composed of fibro-hyalinized tissue oftwo or more endothelial cell layers；\n\n【14】The proliferative process is completely limited to the intravascular spaces；\n\n【15】The endothelial cells are hyperchromatic， but extreme nuclear atypia and mitotic figures and necrosis are not seen；\n\n【16】There may be pseudo channels， but there are no irregular or anastomosing blood vessels in the stroma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Based on histopathology， Masson’s haemangioma can be classified into three distinct categories：\n\n【18】However， these different pathological varieties do not have any clinical significance， since the treatment is total excision.

The patient was intubated 4 days after hospital admission and was admitted in COVID Emergency Unit after 15 days in the intensive care unit. CTperformed 22 days after his hospital admission showed extensive peripheral predominant ground-glass opacities. Bilateral consolidation areas and cavitation in left lower lobe. Pericardial and bilateral pleural effusion was also described. QuantiFERON-TB Gold test， microbiological tests were negative except a sputum sample positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\nThe variety of the findings in COVID-19 has been categorized in the consensus documents from American College of Radiology/Society of Thoracic Radiology/Radiological Society of North America通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The typical features are peripheral bilateral and rounded ground glass opacities， and reverse halo sign of organizing pneumonia. Atypical features include isolatedconsolidations，tree-in-budopacities and smooth interlobular septal thickening with pleural effusion， and cavitations， that have been reported very rarely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A larger number of reports on imaging findings in COVID-19 diseases are present in literatureandprobably newimagingpatterns mayemerge inthe future. The size and type of CT abnormalities may be related to a more severe pulmonary involvement and longer hospitalization and can vary in different patients and stages. In this paper， we reported a case series of patients with pulmonary cavitations which represented the 13.3%of our cohort. This result can be interpreted as a late CT manifestation of COVID-19 disease， not rare in patients that have been intubated. This conclusion is supported by the timing of CT examinations in our patients， performed later than previous cases reported in literature(27days on average after admission).Bacterial superinfections|删除段之间换行|cannot be excluded as a possible cause of the cavitations we observed， but the germs we isolated were all opportunistic hospital-acquired pathogens， very common in ventilated intensive-care unit patients and rarely causing lung excavations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>.

Hence， it will be ignored and misdiagnosed in the clinical activities， especially for the remote districts without well-equipped medicine. The doctors can be misled by the clinical experience. In this case， a 31-years old patient with adult-onset T1DM complicated with obesity and serious insulin resistance suffering from ketoacidosis was treated as T2DM by insulin injection based on the adult-onset， high BMI and serious insulin resistance. However， the blood glucose was beyond normal level obviously even we gave her a large amount of insulin from the continuous injection pump to short-acting combining with long-acting insulin (0.95 U/kg/d). The pre-meal glucose level fluctuated at 9 mM and the post-prandial glucose concentration waved at 15 mM. This phenomenon confused us and made us doubt the diagnosis We examined the insulin and c-peptide at fasting and 1-h postprandial points. The insulin concentrations were 185.90 uIU/mL and 133.9 uIU/mL while the c-peptide was 0.48 ng/ml and 0.65ng/ml， respectively. After， the patient completed the related antibodies examinations which showed that glutamic acid decarboxylase was over 2000.0 IU/mL. We diagnosed the patient as adult-onset T1DM with serious insulin resistance rather than LADA or T2DM. This was the first time to report adult-onset obese T1DM with serious insulin resistance. This case indicates that it is necessary to detect the autoimmune antibodies and OGTT to identify diabetes.\n\n【2】Keywords： T1DM；T2DM；Adult-onset； Insulin resistance； Obesity\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Diabetes is one of the most popular diseases around the world and increases risk of mortality for its complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It brings the heavy economic burden to the society 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is well known that Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) are the major types of diabetes. In the past， the much higher incidence of T2DM and its serious complications， such as metabolism diseases， nerve-system disease，cardiovascular and kidney disease and so on， earn more attention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-6\\]</u>. T2DM is a metabolic disease featured with insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency， while without autoimmune antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. It usually happens to middle and elder-ages in the past several decades and is always progressed by pre-diabetes after several years or decades通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However， it has been certified that the increasing incidence of T2DM occurs among young people called youth-onset T2DM with higher mortality than elder people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. Whatever in the period of pre-diabetes or diabetes stage， optimizing lifestyle by enhancing activities and improving diets intake is well recommended and the patient can reverse abnormal glucose and prevent its progressing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. When it fails to hypoglycemic after three months， it is time to take oral drugs. Ultimately， the exogenous insulin is utilized to achieve the glucose target after oral hypoglycemia drugs failing or emergent situation， such as glucose toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>.\n\n【5】T1DM is featuredwith absolutely deficient insulin for the autoimmune attack and alwayshappens to children and adolescents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. However， adult-onset T1DM should be paid more attention. In detail， adult-onset T1DM is divided into classic adult-onset T1DM and Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults (LADA) which can be distinguished by injecting insulin immediately or not 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. To be specific， LADA shows the characteristics of both T1DM and T2DM， which is called 1.5 types of diabetes in the past. Its diagnosis criteria are following： the onset age is more than 30 years； one of the autoantibodies Including Antibodies to Insulin (IAA)， Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (IA-2)，\n\n【6】Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GADA) or Islet Cell Autoantibodies(ICA) are positive at least； and insulin independence maintains 6months after diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Unlikely to T2DM， most T1DM patients should inject insulin or its analogs essentially and immediately once been diagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Based on the accumulated evidence， the differences between T1DM and T2DM include insulin-dependence or independence， symptoms，BMI Iand autoantibodies， complicationsSsuch as microvascular disease and metabolic syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. However，LADA make the differences vague and a further study has demonstrated that 5% to 10% LADA patients are misdiagnosed as T2DMl 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. This reflects that it is not always easy to clarify T1DM and T2DM in some cases. In addition， the increasing ofT2DM among children and teenagers and serious insulin resistance happening to T1DM patients make it harder to identified T1DM from T2DM in complicated situations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，20\\]</u>. Consequently， the clinical doctors should conduct thoughtful laboratory examinations and inquiry medical history， especial for young adult-onset diabetes.\n\n【8】We described a case of confused diagnosis as LADA or adult-onset T1DM with serious insulin resistance or T2DM. This case may illustrate that the young adult-onset diabetes needs more convincing evidence to be diagnosed.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\nA 31 years old lady was delivered to emergency department for main complaint of thirsty for a half month as well as omitting and fatigue one day on 2：00 am of January 18h，删除4:<u> 2021</u>. The history of present illness was as following： The lady felt thirsty a half month ago without any reasons， she wanted to drink and urinate more than before at the same time. She ignored those symptoms and did not receive any treatment. Then， she had the omitting and fatigues a day before and was complicated with the dyspnea and restlessness and then was delivered to emergency department. The physical detection found that her BMI was 28.4 kg/m’ and she had a full moon face with coma and rapid breath (41 times/min). Some moist rale and rough respiration had been heard in the lung. The pupils were same size in round and the diameter was about 2.5 mm. The light reflex was normal. The past history included hypothyroidism with serum Antithyroglobulin Antibody (TGAb) ranging from 22.4 IU/mL to64 IU/mL and Antithyroid Peroxidase Antibody (TPOAb) ranging from 123 IU/mL to 440.8 IU/mL and she took euthyrox according to the doctors’ guideline by monitoring thyroid hormone. She delivered|删除段之间换行|her second baby by cesarean section at April删除4:<u> 2020</u>. During the whole pregnant period， the blood glucose levels including FBG and 2hPG and urine glucose were normal. However， the random blood glucose was 28.4 mM by glucose monitor at emergency department. The doctor diagnosed as diabetic ketoacidosis and assigned her to the ICU. After， the detailed detections were carried out. The blood routine showed that the WBC and neutrophil were 13.51 ×10/L and 11.34x10/L，respectively. The monocyte was 0.76×10/L. The percentage of lymphocyte decreased to 10.1 %. The RBC was 5.51×10/Land hemoglobin was 156.0 g/L. The platelet was 369.0×10/L. The HbA1c was 13.2%. Based on arterial blood gas analysis， PH value was 6.958； partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide (PCO2) and concentration of HCO3- were 8.1 mmHg and 1.8 mmol/L， separately. The routine biochemistry analysis showed that serum iron K decreased to 3.16mM while serum Na increased to 154.2 mM. At the same time， the concentration of HCO3- declined to 5.2 mM. Light liver damage had been found and blood ammonia rose up to 81 umol/L. The urine routine showed that red and white cells were strong positive. Additionally， both glucose and urine ketone bodies increased remarkably. The results of CT scanning of head and abdomen were normal. There was some gas in the mediastinum by CT scanning for the falling down during the transporting. The treatment in ICU focused on decreasing blood glucose by insulin injection pump and eliminating ketoacidosis by CRRT for 39 h and transfusing large liquid. When the situation was stable， she was transferred to our department for following therapy on January 20h，删除4:<u> 2021</u>. During this period， the patient never felt uncomfortable， except for high blood glucose. The patient was still treated by the insulin syringe pump (3U/h to 5 U/h) and the finger glucose was detected every 2 h until to morning on January删除4:<u> 234</u>. After that， the glucose was monitored by before and after meals and 9 pm because of transferring to use the short-time insulin and long-time insulin. According to the glucose status， we continually adjusted insulin dose. The blood glucose levels were showed in Figure删除4:<u> 1</u>. It demonstrated that the glucose levels were far from normal even treating with a large amount of insulin. Finally， we adjusted the pre-meal insulin from 8 U to 12 U，14U and 14 U. The insulin at 9 pm maintained 28 U. The glucose was still out of control. This phenomenon forced us to conduct deep detection of fasting and2 h post-meal insulin and c-peptide levels. The fasting and post-meal insulin concentrations were 185.90 uIU/mL and 133.90 uIU/mL， while the fasting and post-meal c-peptide levels were 0.48 ng/mL and0.65 ng/mL. Although it was essential to examine the antibodies， it was inconvenient in the branch hospital to conduct and the patient|删除段之间换行|refused to detect immediately. Finally， she decided to leave hospital even with high blood glucose on January 28h. We advised her to detect the antibodies in our headquarters and change her lifestyle to lose weight. In addition， she must adjust the dose of insulin based on finger glucose levels. After 10 days later， she went to the headquarters for her seriously high glucose level. The antibodies were identified and the concentrations of GADA and ICA were beyond 2000.0 IU/mL and 34.4 COI while IAA was normal. As a result， she obtained an improved hypo-glucose schedule： Short-time and long-time insulin combining oral drugs. The detail was that she injected 8 U short-time insulin pre-meal and 28 U long-time insulin at 9 pm. At the same time， she took Kashuangping composing of pioglitazone and metformin for 1 pill twice as well as the Invokana for 1 pill once per day. The fasting and postprandial blood glucose was approximately decreased to 5 mM and 8 mM，respectively. Based on the fluctuating glucose level， the patient persisted taking oral hypo-glucose drugs and cut down short-time insulin to 5 U and long-time insulin to 24U. During this period， the glucose level fluctuated at 5 mM and she loses weight 5 kg successfully. Besides， the patient felt well， except for constipation. After two months， the patient decided to cease the pre-meal insulin and merely take oral drugs since the blood glucose was controlled well and stably by 4 U for every pre-meal. However， the glucose went up obviously after stopping the short-time insulin for a half of month. The patient continued injecting 10U insulin before meals and the blood glucose did not decreased ideally.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Age is just a big trap for differing T1DM and T2DM. It is well-known that most of T1DM are diagnosed at childhood and teenager and more than 85% of them are below 20 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Besides， the increasing rate of pediatric T1DM is about 3% to 5% every year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. It proves that incidence of T1DM among children and adolescents are serious and make pediatric experts nervous. Nevertheless， one clinical study demonstrates that adult-onset T1DM is also popular and the authors appeal that it is time to test islet antibodies for diabetes patients as a routine item 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. In further， LADA， a majority of adult-onset T1DM， which is characteristic with positive pancreatic antibodies， slower beta-cell lesion and some metabolic syndromes. The similarities between LADA and T2DM mislead investigators. A data shows that 2% to 12% of diagnosed T2DM belong to LADA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Concurrently， numerous evidences demonstrate that T2DM is more and more prevalent at childhood and adolescent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. A large data analysis proves that the morbidity of young T2DM goes up 4.4 folds from 2002 to 2016 in Korea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Compared with adult-onset T2DM， T2DM in children and adolescents is more aggressive with rapid beta-cell deterioration， serious complicated diseases. Also， it is hard to distinguish from T1DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Another study shows that there is an overlap between T1DM and T2DM and suggests that the diagnosed T2DM should be detected related antibodies and a new subtype of diabetes may be identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. In conclusion， it is not easy to apart T1DM from T2DM by age which is a weak principle for diagnosis.\n\nObesity and insulin resistance are prevalent complications for the T1DM. In the past， T1DM patients is lean and sensitive to insulin. In this case， we considered the patient as the T2DM at first depending on adult-onset age， high BMI and serious insulin resistance. However， the blood glucose did not decrease well； even we had up-regulated insulin injection to 0.95 U/kg/d. The outcomes astonished us for the extraordinary insulin and little c-peptide. The extensive exogenous insulin injection contributed to the outstanding serum insulin|删除段之间换行|concentration. The poor c-peptide reflected actual terrible secretion function of pancreatic beta cell. Those meant that the patient suffered serious pancreas impairment and remarkable insulin resistance. It was weird for the new diagnosed“T2DM”since nearly entire loss of beta cell and woeful insulin resistance. In fact， obesity and insulin resistance are not any more the features for T2DM based on the existed evidence. A comprehensive analysis shows that the ratio of overweight and obesity increase 20.1% and 9.5% in children and adolescent T1DM， respectively. Besides， the metabolic syndrome grows up from 3.2% to 29.9%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Multiple researches illustrate that the incidence of overweight or obese T1DM ranges from 12.8% to20.2% in different countries and districts and there is a growing up trend in recent decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30-32\\]</u>. A large scale of clinical study proves that adult-onset T1DM is 5.49% in 17，349 newly diabetes and LADA contribute 65%.Additionally， the ratio of overweight or obese T1DM is 5.84% and LADA patients account for 79.2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. In summary， obesity and insulin resistance are popular complications in both T1DM and T2DM.\n\n【14】Autoimmune diseases may be a great clue for T1DM diagnosis. T1DM has a close relationship with other Autoimmune Diseases(AID)， such as thyroid disease， rheumatoid arthritis， collagen vascular diseases， and autoimmune enteropathy (Crohn’s and Ulcerative Colitis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33，34\\]</u>. There is an evidence illustrates that the additional autoimmune disease has been verified in 33% of new T1DM. It is relatively high rate and reminders us to detect other antibodies essentially 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. What’s more， the risk for additional AID for late-onset T1DM over 30 years is much higher than that of children and adolescent onset and it also reveals that the female prefers to have AID compared with the male 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. Moreover， Autoimmune Thyroid Disease (ATD)has higher incidence in patient with T1DM andLADA is an independent risk for it. A clinical study shows that 23% children and/or adolescent T1DM patients have been diagnosed as ATD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Another clinical investigation also proves that the patient with T1DM is susceptible to ATD which may attribute to susceptible genes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. In this case， the young lady had been diagnosed as hypothyroidism with TPOAb positive. It is an important clue for T1DM diagnosis. In clinical practice， the physician should ask the history carefully and find hints.\n\n【15】Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) would be more difficult than before for the changes of characteristics (age and complications) and it is time to combine insulin and oral hypo-glucose drugs to reverse uncontrollable glucose， regardless of whatever types of DM. Accumulating data show that the patient with T1DM have the features of T2DM which is called double diabetes， such as insulin resistance， metabolic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39，40\\]</u>. It also means that those people have higher risk for suffering from serious complications including kidney disease， cardiovascular lesions. Meanwhile， the change of onset age makes it hard to distinguish them by age. Regarding to the treatment， it is important to combine insulin and oral drugs to decrease glucoselevel. In this report， we just gave her insulin injection at first for protecting the pancreatic beta-cell function based on the recent studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41，42\\]</u>. However， the high level of glucose was never be reversed due to extremely severe insulin resistance. After giving her insulin and oral drugs at the same time， the glucose can be controlled and maintained in target. In summary， considerate therapy schedule should be made based on the right diagnosis and insulin combing with oral drugs is the optimal choice for T1DM with insulin resistance.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】characteristics for T1DM. It is essential for every newly diagnosed patient to carry out OGTT and detect glucose， c-peptide and insulin levels in different time points， especially for young people. At the same time， autoimmune antibodies should be taken into consideration. Those measures will help doctors to diagnose correctly and make right treatment plan to assure patient to obtain effective medicine as soon as possible.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However， SUI development following inguinal herniorrhaphy is extremely rare. We report the case of a patient who developed SUI following inguinal herniorrhaphy after open radical prostatectomy. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first reported case of SUI development following in guinal herniorrhaphy in a man who had undergone radical prostatectomy.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Japan，\n\n【9】ac.jp\n\n【10】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【11】A 66-year-old man was diagnosed with localized prostate cancer cT2cN0M0. His past medical history was unremarkable. He underwent open radical prostatectomy in 2008 after a 9-month neoadjuvant hormone therapy. Following the prostatectomy， he developed mild SUI that gradually improved. Thereafter， he did not need a pad after 15 months of prostatectomy. Four years later， he underwent salvage radiation therapy (66 Gy) for biochemical recurrence. Subsequently， the prostate-specific antigenserum levels decreased from 0.64 ng/mL to 0.1 ng/mL. After radiation， he did not experience the difficulty in voiding and his Qmax was 21.0 ml/second and urinary incontinence did not develop. During the follow-up period， he developed left inguinal hernia， for which he underwent synthetic mesh repair (inguinal herniorrhaphy) in 2014. After removal of the urethral catheter 12 French in size， he developed severe SUI. He then needed more than three pads a day for his total incontinence while standing. Cystourethrography and cystourethroscopy detected only a mild urethral stricture， and a urodynamic study showed no detrusor over activity. Conservative therapies along with pelvic exercise and use of several agents， such as anticholinergics and B2-stimulants， were ineffective in treating SUI. Two year later， an artificial urinary sphincter implantation was performed， and SUI disappeared. Patient’s clinical course is shown in Figure删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\nThe patient had moderate SUI for a few months after prostatectomy. Thereafter， SUI improved gradually， and he rarely needed pads. SUI recurred after inguinal herniorrhaphy. Imaging as well as endoscopic and urodynamic studies were negative for urinary in continence. The underlying mechanisms for SUI recurrence after inguinal herniorrhaphy were unclear. Radiation to the prostatic fossa might have slightly affected the urethral sphincter； however， this was not the main cause for the development of SUI because he did not develop SUI after radiation therapy. It may be suspected that this patient with post-operative sphincter damage had developed urethral stenosis according to radical prostatectomy and/or post-operative radiation therapy which contributed|删除段之间换行|to improvement of urinary incontinence. However， placement of urethral catheter during surgery for inguinal hernia dilated the|删除段之间换行|stenosis， and after removal manifested stress urinary incontinence which had been once hidden by the urethral stenosis. This story is， however， unlikely， because of the following reasons； 1) his SUI after prostatectomy disappeared 15 months surgery and he did not need a pad even after radiation，2) he did not have the difficulty of voiding suggesting urethral stricture that could mask SUI， 3) it is hard to dilate urethral stricture with 12 French urethral catheter. Thus， we believe that herniorrhaphy was the main cause of SUI.\n\n【14】Abdominal pressure to the bladder might have been reduced by the dilated inguinal canal before inguinal hernia repair. However， after the herniorrhaphy， the abdominal pressure to the inguinal canal was blocked， resulting in increased abdominal pressure to the bladder； this in turn might be the main cause of SUI recurrence after the herniorrhaphy . To the best of our knowledge， this is the first reported case of SUI development following inguinal herniorrhaphy in a man who had undergone radical prostatectomy. Although rare in occurrence， we need to be aware of SUI after hernia repair in patients with a weak or damaged urethral sphincter.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However unlike trigger point injections， this minimally invasive myofascial nerve injection is performed differently and targets the myofascial tissues， peripheral innervations， posterior spinal structures and spinal nerve roots at the same time. It is different from a trigger point injection that aims to block trigger points within a muscle. Prolonged standing or sitting， posture and other multiple factors can create recurrent injuries with attendant inflammation and episodically aggravate pain. Thus there is a need for a simple intervention technique that can be performed from the medical clinic to the battlefield to quickly relieve inflammation and prevent chronic pain.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】This myofascial nerve injection is also the first procedure for spine pain since epidural pain injection was first described by Jean-Anasthase Sicard in Paris on April 20\"， 1901通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. However， at about the same time， Fernand Cathelin also from Paris had been treating patients with epidural injections for some months already 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Incidentally， a few months after we published our novel short needle technique for paraspinal muscle block in February 2016 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>， the Erector Spinae (ESP) nerve block was described in a publication in September 2016， as a regional block for thoracic neuropathic pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. The injection is performed by a single shot or with a catheter insertion for continuous infusion (5 ml to 14 ml per hour) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. The primary mechanism is thought to be a direct effect of local anesthetic via physical spread and diffusion to the erector spinae muscles as well as neural structures in the fascial plane deep to the erector spinae muscles and adjacent tissue compartments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Satisfactory results have been obtained in the treatment of both acute pain and chronic pain， and in some cases the ESP has replaced the use of epidural injections.\n\n【5】Clear solution of medication injected under pressure from a 30 G 5/8 inch (15.6 mm) needles travel a distance of 4 cm to 6 cm. As described in Sota Omoigui Short Needle Technique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， utilizing the physics principle of the law of conservation of mass， the increased velocity of the injectate is sufficient to traverse the erector spinae muscles to the vertebral lamina and block the posterior spinal structures and nerves at the level injected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Compressing the soft tissue with one hand，and injecting 1 ml to 2 ml Lidocaine 2% at the two most painful levels on each side of the vertebra or spinous process， we have been able to achieve 60% to 100% ofrelief of axial and radicular pain within5 min. Total dosage of Lidocaine must be below the toxic dose of 3 mg/kg without epinephrine.\n\n【6】Due to the small size and length of the needle， this technique can be performed not just by pain specialist but by a primary care physician， physician assistant， nurse practitioner or any medical service provider trained to do intramuscular injections. This myofascial nerve block can be performed with or without imaging guidance in a variety of settings from the operating room to the medical clinic to the battlefield.\n\n【7】This myofascial nerve block may be used in combination with an anti-inflammatory regimen， including oral， IV or IM Steroid， Ketorolac/Diclofenac， Opioids， Ketamine， Ketorolac， Magnesium Sulfate， Kineret，CGRP Blockers， Botulinum Toxin etc. These block or inhibit various inflammatory mediators including prostaglandins (steroid， ketorolac/diclofenac)， IL-1 Beta (Kineret) NMDA receptors (magnesium sulfate， ketamine)， Substance P (Botulinum Toxin) etc 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Low back and neck pain causes more disability than any other and accounts for the third highest health care spending after diabetes and ischemic heart disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Subsequent too ttiissssuuee injury， theinitialimmune reaction generates an inflammatory milieu of chemical mediators that include prostaglandin， interleukin 1-alpha， interleukin 1-beta， interleukin-4， Interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 nitric oxide， tumor necrosis factor alpha，histamine and serotonin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Following this injury，there is increased nerve traffic in the sensory neurons that travel to the spinal cord and stimulate the release of inflammatory protein Substance P. The presence of Substance Pand other inflammatory proteins such as Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide(CGRP) neurokinin A and vasoactive intestinal peptide removes magnesium induced inhibition and enables excitatory inflammatory proteins such as glutamate and aspartate to activate specialized spinal cord NMDA receptors and increase magnification of the nerve traffic and pain stimuli.\n\n【11】Axial and radicular back pain is symptoms of injurythat result in a cascade of inflammatory mediators. Local anesthetic agents stabilize nerve membrane and decrease pain by reducing the rate of discharge of sensory nerve fibers and decreasing neurogenic inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Current procedural injections for back， neck and radicular pain focus on structures that are visible with imaging， skeletal system(bones， joints， intervertebral discs) and central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) components while completely ignoring the largest organ in the spine and most often the initial site of injury， which are the paraspinal muscles-cervical， thoracic and lumbar. The most common pain procedures are essentially blind techniques as pain triggers are targeted based upon structural pathology. Unfortunately there is poor correlation between structural pathology and the presence of back 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u> or neck pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Myofascial tissues constitute a pain generator that is not addressed in current interventional pain procedures. Randomized controlled studies of current procedures have yielded conflicting results. In a study by Dilke et al.， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> patients who received epidural corticosteroids experienced less pain than controls， needed surgery less often and returned back to work sooner. However and on the contrary， Snoek et al.， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> showed that epidural steroid injection was no more effective than a placebo injection in relieving chronic symptoms due to lumbar disc herniation. In 2008， Staal et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> reported on a systematic review of the literature conducted with a focus on randomized， controlled trials. Based on their analyses， the authors made the conclusion that there is moderate evidence that epidural corticosteroid injections are no more effective than placebo injections for pain relief.\n\nOther procedureesSrangefromLtransforaminal injections， radiofrequency thermal lesioning of the medial branch nerves， radiofrequency cryolesioning of the medial branch nerves， intradiscal electrothermy(thermalburn to theintervertebral disc)，and spinalcord stimulation. Recent randomized control trials have also questioned the effectiveness of these more invasive procedures. A multicenter， randomized， double-blind， sham treatment controlled trial was performed to determine the efficacy of radiofrequency lumbar facet joint denervation. In both groups， there was significant improvement in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. In the Mint study， three randomized clinical trials were conducted on the effectiveness of minimal interventional treatments for participants with chronic low|删除段之间换行|backpain. Radiofrequency denervation combined with a standardized exercise program resulted in either no improvement or no clinically important improvement in chronic low back pain compared with a standardized exercise program alone. In another randomized control trial， assessing the efficacy of Radiofrequency (RF) denervation ofthe cervical facet joints in chronic cervical facet joint pain the authors stated that they did not observe significant differences between RF denervation combined with injection of local anesthesia compared with local anesthesia at 6 months follow-up. The need for pain medication did not differ significantlybetween groups通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. In another randomized controlled trial， in patients with cervicogenic headache the authors did not find evidence that radiofrequency treatment of cervical facet joints was a better treatment than the infiltration of the greater occipital nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【15】In one study the author stated that the evidence is poor for cervical transforaminal epidural injections. Complications with cervicalinterlaminar epidural injections are rare， but more commonly occur with transforaminal epidural injections. These can be fatal and include vertebral artery injury， systemic allergic reactions to radio contrast agents， transient cortical blindness and brain injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>， stroke， paraplegia， quadriplegia， spinal cord and cerebella infarction删除4-1:<u>27，28</u>.\n\n【16】These trials raise the issue of questionable benefits， compared to simpler procedures such as our myofascial nerve blockade.\n\n【17】As stated in the NIH， HEAL Initiative Fund Opportunity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>， the field of musculoskeletal pain has largely focused on the skeletal system (bones， joints， intervertebral discs)and central nervous system(brain and spinal cord) components. The contribution of myofascial tissues， especially fascia， and the interactions of fascia， muscles， and peripheral nerves are understudied and remain mostlyunknown. Pain originating from muscles and fascia is likely an important component of many severe and chronic pain conditions. The perimuscular fascia is richly innervated with small-diameter fibers whose receptive fields increase in the presence of inflammation. Thus myofascial tissues play a significant role as pain generators.\n\n【18】The NIH noted that for many years， structural imaging was the main toolto guide treatment decisions， including surgery. Meanwhile， imaging and other objective measurements of \"soft\"tissues including muscles， and connective tissues or “fasciae，were not even considered as musculoskeletal pain biomarker candidates. Thus NIH has called for development of biomarkers of myofascial tissues for effective pain management regimens.\n\n【19】In the last seven years， we have replaced epidural and facet joint/nerve injections with a myofascial nerve block. We routinely perform myofascial nerve injections， with or without ultrasound guidance to relieve pain. We had observed during spinal procedures that a clear solution of Lidocaine 2%， injected from a 30G 5/8 inch (15.6 mm) needle， using a 3 ml syringe， and inserted just lateral to the spinous process， into the paraspinal muscles， traveled a distance of 4cm to6 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This distance was sufficient to travel through the erector spinae muscles down to the vertebral lamina and posterior spinal structures and within minutes produce anesthetic block to relieve radicular pain from the nerve roots 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【20】In the last two years， the advent of erector spinae plane blocks that are essentially myofascial blocks but utilizing longer needles inserted to the target point， with large volumes of dilute local anesthetic has validated our original but simpler myofascial nerve block (Figures 1-6\n\n【21】and Video 1).\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】When a 30 gauge needle is attached to a 3 ml syringe， the distance of travel of medication from the syringe and needle into tissue will be greater， because there is increased velocity through the smaller needle and hence greater penetration of medication into the tissues.\n\nUtilizing the equation ofcontinuity， we can analyze what happens|删除段之间换行|to the fluid if the size of the tubing through which it flows， changes. Figure7 shows the pipe constricting from area A to area A. Since no fluid can leave through the walls， the mass crossing each section of the tube per unit time must be the same. Therefore the velocity of fluid through the smaller area is faster than the velocity of the fluid through the larger area. This phenomenon can be explained and quantified by examining the flow rate of mass through the tubing. The equation of continuity states that， in any steady state process， the rate at which mass enters a system is equal to the rate at which mass leaves the system：\n\n【25】It can therefore be seen that by compressing the soft tissue and shortening the distance， with our technique for procedural injections utilizing a short small bore needle such as the BD 30G 5/8 inch needle， medication can be delivered at a distance， under pressure， to travel to block pain generators including peripheral nerves in the muscle， fascia， as well as in the posterior spinal structures in including the medial branch nerves， facet joints and lumbar nerve raots. This is the first procedural technique that can black multiple pain generators in just one injection.\n\nFlow rate through A. =Flow rate through A|删除段之间换行|Theretore，\n\n【27】dAv= Constant\n\n【28】This equation expresses the law of conservation of mass in fluid dynamics.\n\n【29】If fluid is incompressible， then the density is constant (d=d)，\n\n【30】Then，\n\n【31】Av=AP2\n\n【32】Where\n\n【33】A1=Area in tube 1\n\n【34】v1=Velocity in tube 1\n\n【35】A2=Area in tube 2\n\n【36】v2=Velocity in tube 2\n\n【37】d=density of the fluid\n\nFor our purpose， Alvl will be a syringe and A2v2 the hypodermic needle. When a higher gauge (smaller) needle is used， with a 3 ml syringe， the distance of travel of medication from the syringe and|删除段之间换行|needle into tissue will be greater， because there is increased velocity through the smaller needle and hence greater penetration of medication into the tissues.\n\n【39】Advantages\n\n【40】Clear fluid medications can be injected to traverse and provide a therapeutic effect at a distance to the needle point e.g. paraspinal muscles and lamina.\n\n【41】Limitations\n\n【42】This targeted structure must be within 6 cm distance and not obstructed by bone e.g. a hip or knee joint.\n\n【43】Myofascial Injection Technique\n\n【44】With the Myofascial Injection Technique for Spinal Pain， the spine is palpated to locate the most painful sites. A short 30G 5/8inch needle is inserted adjacent to the spinal process or vertebra at the level of those sites. The soft tissue is compressed and the needle is advanced just past the subcutaneous tissue into the muscle layer， and 1 ml to 2 ml of local anesthetic solution (preferably 2% Lidocaine for most sites) is injected in each site. If performed under ultrasound guidance the solution will be seen to spread 4 cm to 6 cm deep into the paraspinal muscle， down to the lamina and posterior spinal structures. The injection is repeated at the 2 to 4 most painful sites， keeping in mind not to exceed the toxic dose of the local anesthetic(3 mg/kg). The number of sites injected is limited by the volume and concentration of local anesthetic injected so as not to exceed the toxic dose of anesthetic.\n\n【45】With the myofascial injection， the soft tissue is compressed and the needle is inserted close to its hub (5/8 in)， the medication is injected to reach the target site. In most instances， it is no longer necessary to use longer and bigger gauge needles for epidural injections for treatment of axial pain and radiculopathy. With a myofascial injection， the medication can be pushed under pressure through the erector spinae muscle to blockthe posterior spinal structures， using a smaller shorter needle. Use of such a short small bore needle such as the BD 30G5/8 inch needle will make myofascial injections much safer as there is significantly decreased risk of needle trauma. This technique is also useful in patients who are anti-coagulated. Compression of the skin and subcutaneous fatty tissue reduces the distance of travel required for the medication to penetrate through the paraspinal muscle to the posterior spinal structures.\n\n【46】Distances\n\n【47】Clear solution of medication injected under pressure from a 30G5/8 inch (15.6 mm) needles travel a distance of 4 cm to 6 cm.\n\n【48】In thelumbar spine，the distance from the skin to the ligamentum flavum is 3 cm to8cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30-32\\]</u>. In the upper thoracic spine the distance from skin to the lamina with a paramedian approach， 1 cm from the midline， is 4.2 cm， middle thoracic spine is 3.7 cm， lower thoracic spine is 3.6 cm and lumbar spine is 4.0 cm. The average distance from skin to the epidural space with a paramedian approach， 1 cm from the midline， in the upper thoracic spine is 5.6 cm， middle thoracic spine is5.2 cm，lower thoracic spine is 4.4 cm andlumbar spine is 4.7 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. The mean distance from the skin to the transverse processes and facet joint articular processes，ranges from 3.2 cm to 5 cm， as measured in a study utilizing a 3 MHz to 5 MHz ultrasound probe see Figure 8 \\[34.\n\nWe have had a variable duration of pain relief from one week to one year and similar to the epidural steroid and facet nerve injections|删除段之间换行|that we previouslyperformed. There have been no complications with this technique， in more than 500 procedures.\n\n【50】Conclusion\n\n【51】The Myofascial nerve injection is a simple intervention technique that can be performed from the medical clinic to the battlefield to quickly relieve inflammation， treat acute pain and prevent chronic pain.\n\n【52】It is the first procedure that targets the myofascial tissues， peripheral innervations， posterior spinal structures and spinal nerve roots at the same time.\n\n【53】Due to the small size and length of the needle， this technique can be performed not just by pain specialist but by a primary care physician， physician assistant， nurse practitioner or any medical service provider trained to do intramuscular injections.\n\n【54】The therapeutic and anti-inflammatory effect of the myofascial nerve injection is from the neuro-modulatory activity local anesthetic(preferably 2% Lidocaine for most injection sites).

Delivery was defined as precipitous. Apgar score at 1 min was 9 and at 5 min were删除4:<u> 10</u>. At 46 hrs and 30 min of age she presented brief episodes of perioral cyanosis accompanied with tachypnea， and bradycardia tillto 80b/min during sleep. She was brought by the mother to the Nursery. Capillary refill time was 3.5 sec， the baby was given O， and was admitted to the NICU. Exams did not reveal infections， hypoglycemia， electrolytes disturbance，hemorrhage or changes in echogenicity at brain ultrasounds； QTc interval on ECG was within limits and chest X-ray was negative for diseases. The only findings were a transient increase in Hs troponin Ilevel and a small Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) with left-to-right shunt at Doppler echocardiography. The baby was breastfed； first attachment was done at 12 hrs. She was taken under observation and monitoring for seven days and discharged when troponin was normalized and infection excluded. Outcome after 1 vear was favorable.\n\n【28】Case 2\n\n【29】Male， 39 wks’ gestation， b.w. 3，360 gr， Chinese， born by vaginal delivery from a multiparous mother. Vaginal swab was positive for Group B Streptococcus and complete intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis was given. Apgar score at 1 min was 8 and at 5 min was删除4:<u> 9</u>. At first visit in the delivery room minimal axial hypotonia was recorded. SUPC occurred at 3 hrs and 40 min of age with facial cyanosis， axial hypotonia， acrocyanosis， tremors under stimulation， valid suction， normal differential pulsoxymetry. He was given O，for few minutes and was admitted to NICU for observation and exams particularly addressed to hypotonia and cyanosis. Aminoacidic profiles and acylcarnitine were within limits.TSHwas high(8.2mU/L) at the episode， but returned to normal after 1 month without any therapy. Anti-thyroid antibodies were negative. Similarly ECG with QTc interval measurement was normal as well as brain echography. At Doppler echocardiography a small PFO was shown with left-to-right shunt. The baby was breastfed and first attachment was done at4 min. Hospital staying lasted 8 days. He was lost at follow-up.\n\n【30】Case 3\n\n【31】Female， 40\\wks'gestation， b.w. 3，390 gr， Caucasian， born by vaginal delivery at another hospital from a primiparous mother. Apgar score was not available. SUPC occurred at home between 48-72hrs， i.e. after an early discharge from the nursery. At 10 pm， 2 hrs after breastfeeding， the baby was supine and presented tremors followed by stiffening of head and trunk， and then hypotonia and pallor with unconsciousness. Parents refer that the event lasted about 10 minutes. At the arrival at ER she was awake， reactive，heart rate was 133 b/min and transcutaneous SatO. was 99% in room air. She was admitted to NICU and given O，because SatO，subsequently lowered to 90%， with respiratory rate of 35 br/min. Mild axial hypotonia was described and bilateral ocular secretion too.Bacteriological examinations， including blood， ocular secretions， urine， pharynx and auricular samples， were negative as well CRP and the rapid test for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Glycemia， serum electrolytes and ammoniemia were within limits. WBCand RBC count were normal but hematocrit was62.8%. At 4 hours from the event QTc interval was elongated (450msec) with reversed T in V and V. After 18 hrs QTc interval was normal (382 msec)， but a complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) was present. Hs troponin I level was increased (0.62 ng/ml). Doppler echocardiography did not show anomalies. To exclude seizures， an aEEG was performed and resulted within limits (then confirmed by12 channels EEG). In the familial history there was a paternal aunt with a not well defined genetic anomaly and peripheral paralysis.\n\n【32】The baby remained in hospital for 4 days and was discharged with diagnosis of SUPC characterized by loss of consciousness and hypotonia. Outcome after 1 year was favorable.\n\n【33】Case 4\n\n【34】Male， 40 wks gestation， b.w. 3，320 gr，Caucasian， born by elective CS from a primiparous mother. Apgar score was 9 at 1 min and 10at 5 min. SUPC occurred at home between 72-96 hrs of age. The baby was discharged at 72 hrs. In the following day， while he was fed with expressed mother’s milk given by bottle， he suddenly closed the mouth，becamehyperemic in the face and rapidlyturned tohypotonia. Mother stimulated him and he restarted breathing， however remaining hyporeactive. He was therefore brought to pediatric ER and at admission he was cold， sleepy with slow response to stimuli. The physical examination was normal and vital parameters were stable. Chest X-raypicture was compatible with inhalationofmilkand，during a subsequent feed， he presented 2 short episodes of desaturation with spontaneous resolution. Hs troponin I， myoglobin and CK-MB levels resulted altered. ECG showed non-specific anomalies of ST-T in V and V. To exclude other diagnosis the following exams were done and resulted negative： EEG， cardiorespirography， gastro-esophageal junction and pyloric echography， adrenal glands echography， fundus oculi， aminoacidemia， aminoaciduria， urinary organic acids， very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA). Only troponin resulted high (1.32ng/ml) and persisted high for days without significant ECG and cardiac echo changes and with the baby being in good conditions. For such a reason after 12 days he was sent to a Pediatric cardiology center where， however， they could not explain the cause of such high level of the enzyme and reckoned it was due to some problem of the laboratory method. We discharged the baby with the diagnosis of SUPC in gastroesophageal reflux done on a clinical basis. The infant was subsequently admitted at another hospital at the age of 2V/2months confirming the clinical diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux. At 1 year the outcome was good.\n\n【35】Case 5\n\n【36】Female， 41+?wks’ gestation， b.w.， 3270 gr， Caucasian， born by vaginal delivery from a primiparous mother at another hospital. Apgar score at 1 min was删除4:<u> 9</u>. Vaginal swab was positive for GBS and antibiotic intrapartum prophylaxis completed. SUPC occurred at home at 160 hrs of life. The mother referred that the previous evening the baby had refused breastfeeding. Then， in the morning she sucked less vigorously than usual. Vomits and regurgitations at every meal were reported. Parents therefore decided of paying a visit to the hospital where the baby was delivered， but during the way the baby became cyanotic， hypotonic and hyporeactive. They therefore stopped at the first ER on their way， where the father attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and subsequently chest compressions and insufflation were performed， following which the baby started recovering. She was then transferred to our pediatric ER， and when she arrived her vital parameters were within normal limits， she cryed vigorously， her clinical exam， including the neurological aspect， was normal. Capillary refill time was 2 sec. In the familial history： epilepsy. Arterial blood gases， CBC， BUN， glycemia， serum electrolytes， CRP resulted negative. Blood culture， auricular swabs， urine culture， adeno-rota virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus search resulted negative. In the pharyngeal swab S. aureus was isolated. Normal was also ECG， QTc， cardiorespirography， EEG， abdominal echography， cerebral ultrasounds. Chest X-ray showed reduced transparency of superior and medium right lobes， compatible with milk inhalation.\n\n【37】Table 1A： Laboratory examinations done and their absolute and relative positivity.\n\n|  | Done  | Positive  | % Positivity  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BGA  | 2  | 1  | 50  |\n| CBC  | 6  | 2  | 33  |\n| CRP  | 6  | 0  | 0  |\n| Hs troponin1  | 4  | 3  | 75  |\n| RSV  | 1  | 0  | 门  |\n| Aminoacidic profile， VLCFA， acylcarnitine  | 1  | 0  | 0  |\n| TSH  | 1  | 1  | 100  |\n| Blood culture  | 3  | 0  | 0  |\n| BUN，glycemia， serum creatinine， serum electrolytes  | 6  | 0  | 0  |\n| Ammoniemia  | 2  | 0  | 0  |\n| Urine culture  | 2  | 0  | 门  |\n\n【39】BGA： Blood Gas Analysis； CBC： Complete Blood Count； CRP： C Reactive Protein； Hs： High Sensibility， RSV： Respiratory Syncytial Virus， VLCFA： Very Long Chain Fatty Acids， TSH： Thyraid Stimulating Harmone， BUN： Blaad Urea Nitrogen.\n\n【40】Gastroesophageal junction echography put in evidence an open His’angle with frequent regurgitations and reduced cleaning time (>5sec). At echocardiography PFO with right-to-left shunt was found， and Hs troponin I was modestly increased： 0.239 ng/ml. The baby was given amoxicillin + omeprazole and was discharged after seven days with the diagnosis of SUPC and gastroesophageal reflux. She was lost at follow-up.\n\n【41】Case 6\n\n【42】Female， 39 wks’ gestation， b.w. 3，290 gr， Caucasian， born by vaginal delivery from a primiparous mother. Apgar score at 1 and5 minutes was删除4:<u> 9</u>. SUPC was recorded at 8 hrs of life， in hospital. The neonate was brought from the mother in her arms for regurgitation and apnea. She was cyanotic， in apnea， hyporeactive and hypotonic. Mucous with digested blood was present in mouth and choanae. After aspiration of such secretions， O， was administered with mask， and gradual recovery of colour and reactivity followed. Hematocrit resulted 71.1%， WBC 30，000/mm， RBC 6，470，000/mm’， Hb 22.4g/dl. All other exams were normal apart from the discovery of a very small PFO with left-to-right shunt. The baby had already been attached at mother's breast within 1s hr and the mother had no fissures of the nipple. The baby was given iv fluids due to the very high hemoconcentration and after 5 days was discharged with the diagnosis of SUPC by hematic hyperviscosity. Outcome after 1 year was favorable.\n\n【43】Analysis by exams done \n\n【44】When we analyzed the biochemical exams performed and their contribution to the diagnostic process we could observe that blood gas analysis (BGA) was altered in 50% of cases，Hs troponin I in 75%of cases and T'SH in the only case in which it was determined (100%)， while all other laboratory investigations resulted significant only to exclude any particular disease. Instead， if we take into account the instrumental investigations， the positivity of such exams was greater and especially important when they were done on the basis of a diagnostic suspect tied to symptoms.\n\n【45】Discussion\n\n【46】In the present report we analyze the data from 6 cases of SUPC that we observed in our county general hospital in 1 year period.\n\n【47】Table 1B： Instrumental investigations done and their absolute and relative positivity.\n\n|  | Done  | Positive  | %positivity  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chest X-ray  | 4  | 2  | 50  |\n| Abdomen X-ray/US  | 3  | 0  | 0  |\n| Brain US  | 4  | 0  | 0  |\n| Heart echo -Doppler  | 5  | 4  | 80  |\n| GEJ US  | 2  | 2  | 100  |\n| ECG  | 6  | 2  | 33  |\n| QTc  | 6  | 1  | 16.6  |\n| EEG  | 3  | 0  | 0  |\n\nUS： Ultrasounds； GEJ： Gastroesophageal Junction； ECG： Electrocardiogram； QTc： Corrected QT；EEG： Electroencephalogram|删除段之间换行|Fifty percent occurred in hospital while the remaining 50%happened at home. In particular 33% occurred in the time period2-24 hrs， none in the first 2 hrs， and the remaining 67% in the time interval 24-168 hrs.\n\n【50】From the literature data about one third of SUPC are registered in the first 2 hrs of life and have been related to unattended or poor controlled SSC， sleepy or tired mothers， unstable infants， use of smart phone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>.\n\n【51】Why SUPC is limited to the first week of life， and especially to the first hours after delivery， is not clear. One hypothesis is that transition from fetalto extra-uterine life can make the newborn more vulnerable during these first hours of life. Neuro modulators and prostaglandin that inhibits fetal movement are elevated before delivery and during birth， and fall after birth. In the normal delivery there is a fall in the inhibiting adenosine and this allows more movements of the newborn and increased breathing activity. Asphyxia during delivery determines a great release of PGE， in the newborn that has an inhibitory effect on the brainstem centres of breathing. Besides these levels of PGE in plasma are 20-fold higher in newborns than in older infants， and declines quickly after the first postnatal week. Here hence the hypothesis that PGE are implied in the respiratory instability of the infant in the first week of life .\n\n【52】Prevention of SUPC is especially addressed to a greater attention at risk factors in the first 2 hrs of life， when control can be more easily conducted by skilled personnel in the delivery room 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In Italy mother and infant must remain in the delivery room for the first 2 hrs after delivery by law， where they are regularly checked by skilled personnel. We can speculate that this is the major determinant of the absence of cases in the first 2 hrs of life in our series. This in turn might imply the need of a more close control in the first 24 hrs while in hospital. However it remains very arduous to prevent home events， even with prenatal and postnatal family education on correct and controlled SSC， avoidance of unattended co-bedding， avoidance of hypothermia and of supine position. Indeed in our cases none of the preventable causes of SUPC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u> were evident. Only in case 2mild hypotonia probably would have required more prudence before starting rooming-in.\n\nBesides our cases were each one very different in their presentation， varying from respiratory symptoms to symptoms related to feeding and to neurologic signs， and it is therefore difficult to identify a classical clinical picture of SUPC and therefore also to implement prevention， especially when babies are at home and a direct control cannot be carried out. The major link between them is|删除段之间换行|that 5 out of 6 were babies born by primiparous mother； however this is a non-preventable risk factor. Case 1 had a collapse with troponin movements； case 2 had hypotonia and transient hypothyroidism； case 3 had tremors followed by stiffening and loss of consciousness with RBBB， a transient elongation of QTc and troponin movement； case 4 had hypotonia and hyporeactivity episode during feeding and diagnosis was gastroesophageal reflux and persistent elevation of troponin； case 5 similarly had gastroesophageal reflux and milk inhalation， was resuscitated and also in this case troponin’s value was altered； case 6 had hypotonia and hyporeactivity due to very high hematocrit.\n\n【54】A second link was the presence in two cases of gastroesophageal reflux， a treatable problem. Five cases out of 6 had hypotonia as presenting symptom， but only one had hypotonia before the SUPC. ECG changes found were in any case transient and can be interpreted as secondary to the symptoms instead of being the cause of SUPC.\n\n【55】Signs and symptoms resemble ALTE and we cannot exclude that links exist between ALTE and SUPC. Some Authors suggest a link between SUPC and SIDS or ALTE in the first week of life is strong， with analogous mechanisms and risk factors. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-10\\]</u>An apparent connection is prevention by avoidance of the prone position of the baby and by performing control during prone position of SSC.\n\n【56】As concern the laboratory investigations done to diagnose or at least exclude any possible cause of SUPC， in our series the very great majority of the exams performed routinely proved unuseful to diagnosis， but useful anyway to exclude infections or electrolyte disturbances or metabolic congenital problems. Hs troponin I resulted positive in many cases，but this finding was not accompanied with ECG abnormalities or， to be precise， was associated only with minimal aspecific changes. We retain that the movement oftroponin can be related to the severity of the event more than to be a cause of SUPC.Hs troponin I， being very sensitive， can be increased even when damage to muscle of the heart is not evident on ECG， but can be an indirect sign that something was really happened even when we did not observe it. Severe infections and renal problems can alter Hs troponin I， but its value is not influenced by difficult blood sampling or muscle trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Anyway more data are required to establish its diagnostic value in infants.\n\n【57】As for the instrumental investigations， these were positively involved in the diagnosis when they were done on a clinical suspect basis. Indeed， also in this case it is difficult to say which investigations could be avoided. Collapse and hypotonia and cyanosis， at this age of life， can be due to infectious， cardiac， neurological or metabolic problems as well. Clinical examination also when performed by a skilled neonatologist， can give some clues and can induce to perform some investigation before than others， trying non-invasive exams if possible， e.g. ultrasounds instead of X-rays. However if the results are negative it is necessary to search again and exclude other possible causes. In the meanwhile the baby must remain under strict observation and monitoring without interrupting the processes of bonding and milking.\n\nMinor echocardiographic findings as PFO， were not probably connected with SUPC in our cases because in none of the patients there were persistent neurological deficits possibly tied to cerebral embolism through PFO. The increased value of troponin led to perform echocardiography but it is very probable that changes of cardiac enzymes and of ECG after a SUPC are a scar of the event and/|删除段之间换行|or of the resuscitation manoeuvers and not the cause of it.\n\n【59】Looking at our data， different clinical onsets in different settings(hospital vs home) were approached differently by the physicians. In any case the work-up was consistent more with clinical symptoms than with a standardized protocol for SUPC.\n\n【60】A protocol of investigations both for intra-hospital or outside hospital SUPC has been proposed from Wellchild， a charity endorsed by the British Association of Perinatal Medicine，to allow diagnosis of SUPC， but it looks quite complex for an extensive use， especially to screen with priority relevant and treatable problems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【61】Only in 50% of SUPCs of our series a possible and related cause was found， and this is another similarity with ALTE. In the cases in which we find a cause we can give a treatment or solve the problem. When SUPC is idiopathic， instead， return at home creates problems both for parents and physicians. Parents are worried about the possibility that the event can recur and pediatricians do not have precise answers. To propose home-monitoring in these cases might betaken into account， but there are not definite indications for SUPC cases.\n\n【62】Conclusion\n\n【63】SUPC is a relatively new acronym for an already known problem. However the new approach to physiologic delivery and birth has given an impulse to the frequency of such problem. Unattended SSC and rooming-in seem the main cause of the increased incidence of SUPC in hospital， together with erroneous indications to the procedure. Cases happening at home may have other and less definite facilitating causes.\n\n【64】A question arises： does the increase of SUPC recorded in the last years determine a crisis of several concepts that have been demonstrated to be useful for the infant and the mother-infant bonding as SSC，rooming-in， discharge at 48 hrs? Our actual answer is that a greater non-intrusive control during the first 24-48 hrs in the hospital targeted to safe SSC， safe breastfeeding establishment and secure positioning of the infant during sleep could reduce the risk of intra hospital SUPC， and a checklist has been proposed for evaluating SSC and the first 2 hrs after delivery that could be broaden to the entire period of staying in the hospital 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，7\\]</u>. Such physiological approach requires skilled personnel in sufficient number， and not a reduction of it， how rooming-in is too often interpreted by hospital directorates. Anyhow such approach requires to be evaluated in large numbers.\n\n【65】Prenatal and postnatal education of parents on SSC management， co-bedding avoidance， back-to-spine sleep of the baby seems at present the only way for preventing home SUPC as well SIDS.\n\n【66】More studies are necessary to define better SUPC， to determine a simple protocol of first investigations and to promote new forms of prevention.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In the pre-anesthetic assessment， the patient had previous head and neck radiation， limited oral opening <1.5 cm， facial paralysis and previous maxilloethmoidectomy with ocular exenteration and reconstruction with an anterolateral paratracheal ALT flap stood out. Under appropriate topical anesthesia and sedation， intubation was made in an awake patient with an Airtraq°videolaryngoscope. In this case， it was the patient who performed the self-introduction of the videolaryngoscope to his maximum tolerance， achieving intubation， without a gag or cough reflex， bleeding associated with airway manipulation and with adequate patient satisfaction.\n\n【2】Keywords： Airway management； Airtraq； Videolaryngoscope； Awake intubation； Difficult airway； Self-intubation； Adenoid cystic carcinoma\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Patients with head and neck cancer are characterized by a high probability of encountering a Difficult Airway (DA). Up to 39% have problems associated with the airway and up to 70%have associated obstructive lesions in the airway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. They have often undergone radiotherapy， oropharyngeal surgeries， tracheostomies and some have difficulty in cervical flexion-extension or tumors that make oral opening complex， becoming a challenge for the anesthesiologist. In cases of anticipated (DA)， we have fibrobronchoscope or videolaryngoscopes. The fibrobronchoscope was first described to assist Orotracheal Intubation (OTI) in 1967， becoming the gold standard for awake intubation. However， with the development of new generations of videolaryngoscopes in the 2000s， high success rates have been achieved， reducing the number of failed attempts and the incidence of trauma in the airway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In addition， they allow a steep learning curve， ease of training for personnel in training， operator ergonomics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and easy change oftube number in cases of subglottic stenosis. Likewise， videolaryngoscopes are of great value in places where access to fibrobronchoscope is more limited， such as anesthesia outside the operating room or with poorly trained personnel. For all these reasons， videolaryngoscopes are currently frequently used devices and are even used by many anesthesiologists as a first-line device in cases of anticipated difficult airway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. There is little consensus on the ideal sedation regimen during awake intubation. The DAS (Difficult Airway Society) guidelines describe the benefit of minimal sedation， although they also report that it can be performed safely and effectively without it， although it can become unpleasant， trigger coughing， nausea， vomiting and even oropharyngeal injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. A case of planned difficult airway is presented in which the patient self-inserts an Airtraq' videolaryngoscope under local anesthesia and sedation without nausea， vomiting or cough， without any other complications， and adequate tolerance.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nA 40-year-old male patient， 54 kg and 170 cm tall (BMI 19.58 kg/m²) ASA IV， scheduled for embolization of an aneurysm ofthe intracavernous segment of the left Internal Carotid Artery(ICA). As background， he presented a diagnosis of metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma in the left nostril， initially treated with maxilloethmoidectomy with ocular exenteration and reconstruction with an anterolateral paratracheal flap that required tracheostomy with posterior closure， subjected to radiotherapy and chemotherapy， subsequently presenting a relapse with pulmonary， bone， cerebellopontine angle and subcutaneous tissue in the region of the previous tracheostomy metastases. Admission due to suspicion of acute meningoencephalitis due to contiguity in relation to infection of the flap/surgical area of the previously performed maxillectomy. An aneurysm in the cavernous segment of the left ICA was incidentally diagnosed in the extension study， confirmed|删除段之间换行|by diagnostic angiography under sedation. It was then decided to perform scheduled embolization of the aneurysm with coils.\n\nIn the preoperative evaluation， he presented a history of radiation in the head and neck region with a physical examination that showed trismus with limited oral opening of 1.5 cm， thyromental distance of >6 cm， class II mandibular protrusion with adequate cervical flexion and extension， with flap in previous tracheostomy region in adequate conditions. Laboratory tests revealed chronic anemia and lymphopenia with correct coagulation and renal function. Upon his arrival in the angioradiology room， the patient was hemodynamically stable， eupneic with oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. After obtaining consent for the planned intubation technique， it was explained to him that he would control the insertion of the device (airtraq) and it could be terminated at any time if he was uncomfortable. Standard monitoring was performed and oxygen was administered at 2 L/min through nasal cannula. 5 ml of nebulized 2%lidocaine were used followed bytopical anesthesia with 10% lidocaine spray on the oropharynx. Sedation was started with Remifentanil at0.07 mcg/kg/min and midazolam 2 mg. Next， with the head of the stretcher at 30° and under spontaneous breathing， the patient was asked to self-introduce the Airtraq size 2 devices with a 7.5 mm diameterendotrachealtubeaccording to his tolerance. Once the self-introduction of the Airtraq'reached the maximum possible|删除段之间换行|Video 1： Patient who performs the complete self-introduction of the Airtrag under sedation for subsequent intubation， by the anesthesiology team.\n\n【8】tolerance for the patient， the anesthesiologist proceeded to visualize it through the videolaryngoscope. At that time， the visualization of the glottis was partial， so its placement was optimized， after which， and under complete visualization of the glottis， the tube was introduced， which passed the vocal cords， followed by a stop due to subglottic stenosis， for which a second attempt was made with a 6 mm tube with no difficulties in advancing it. The tube change was done quickly due to the ease of assembly of the Airtraq (Video 1). Once the tube was inserted， induction was carried out with propofol， fentanyl， and rocuronium. The procedure was well tolerated by the patient. Maintenance was performed with Propofol TIVA and remifentanil. The intervention was uneventful. At the end， the muscle relaxant was reversed with sugammadex and the patient was extubated in the angioradiology room without complications. He was transferred to the semi-critical unit for postoperative control.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Intubation in patients with expected difficult airway is a challenge for Anesthesiologists. The fibrobronchoscope is the device traditionaly used for intubation in the awake patient and is considered the reference device.\n\nHowever， its learning curve is long， requiring intense training and enough experience for its proper use. In addition， it is a device that is not always easily available， especially in those cases in which intubation is required outside the operating room. In recent years， the Airtraq' has emerged as an alternative to the fibrobronchoscope for awake intubation in cases of difficult airway. Several studies have published that it is easier to manage the Airtraq compared to the fibrobronchoscope in intubation with the patient awake in cases of difficult airway. In addition， learning for its proper use is fast and is easily available in areas outside the operating room. On the other hand， the use of Airtraq requires a refined technique that allows the|删除段之间换行|procedure to be the least uncomfortable for the patient. For this， different sedation techniques and local anesthetics are used to achieve optimal conditions for intubation with the patient awake. However， on many occasions'intubation can become uncomfortable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In a series of 50 morbidly obese patients who underwent awake intubation with videolaryngoscope after topical anesthesia and sedation， almost50% failed on the first attempt due to gag reflex and cough 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.Other studies report intubation failure rates of up to 10% due to inadequate suppression of airway reflexes or discomfort 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In this regard， self-introduction of Airtraq by the patient can reduce discomfort，reducing the presence of nausea， vomiting or cough 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This would be due to the fact that byhaving the patient control over the videolaryngoscope， they can also control the tolerance they have when inserting it. In our case， self-introduction of Airtraq by the patient occurred without complications and was very well tolerated. In addition， taking into account the characteristics of the patient with a locally advanced neoplastic process of the face and neck and limited mouth opening， self-introduction constituted a safety element and made it possible to reduce patient anxiety regarding intubation， improving comfort. One limitation of its use is that it can only be used in selected patients who want to collaborate in its performance. In addition， it is necessary to properly explain the technique so that the patient can help effectively. Although sedation during awake intubation using fibrobronchoscope or videolaryngoscope is associated with high levels of patient satisfaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， the risk of over sedation could be particularly dangerous in patients with difficult airway， including respiratory depression， hypoxia， aspiration， and hemodynamic instability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，8\\]</u>. In those cases where the use of sedation could be controversial， the self-introduction of Airtraq would be an advantage as an option to increase patient safety because it would require a lower level of sedation. On the other hand， it requires greater optimization of the sedation level to avoid overdosing that prevents this collaboration. Since the self-introduction of Airtraq is a novel technique， new studies are needed to establish the benefits of this technique with respect to traditional methods of intubation in awake patients with difficult airway. Another advantage of self-introduction would be related to the trauma associated with the airway due to its manipulation with videolaryngoscopes or fibrobronchoscope.Kramer et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> published that minor nasopharyngeal bleeding occurred in 18% of cases with the use of a videolaryngoscope for intubation with the patient awake， while with a fiberoptic bronchoscope the bleeding rate was 24%. On the other hand， Rosenstock et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> to the obtained values of 4.7% and 7% for the videolaryngoscope and the fibrobronchoscope， respectively. In this regard， the self-introduction of the videolaryngoscope could reduce bleeding by reducing the possibility of trauma due to the patient's control over the device.\n\n【12】However， new studies would be needed to test this hypothesis.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Patient self-introduction of the videolaryngoscope is a tool that could be useful in cooperative patients， to increase comfort and reduce episodes of nausea， vomiting or coughing， prevent minor bleeding associated with trauma during the procedure and even reduce the level of sedation in patients that is required， making the patient participate in the procedure. However，new studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Rapid progression and non-specific symptoms render a definitive diagnosis exceptionally challenging. However， in spite of the fact that there is no specific treatment for HELLP syndrome， the delivery appears to be beneficial both for the fetus and the mother.\n\n【2】Our paper presents a case ofa woman who developed HELLP syndrome at the 315 week of gestation. On admission， the pregnancy had already been complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus， third-degree obesity， and uncertain gestational age. Due to the BMI equal to 63.48 kg/m² (weight 162.5kg height 1.6 m)， cardiotocography was impossible， and the range of the ultrasound examination was limited. It is vital to note that in this case two pathologies were observed， which affected both the fetus and the mother. Initially， the patient presented with gestational diabetes which resulted in maternal hyperglycemia and excessive fetal growth. Furthermore， secondary placental insufficiency developed which manifested as HELLP syndrome. In turn， impaired placental function reduced maternal glucose levels due to inadequate insulinase activity and restricted the fetal growth. Therefore，establishing the diagnosis entailed the understanding of the two co-existing antagonist effects， concealing the potential symptoms of the disease. The treatment involved corticosteroids to manage fetal maturation as well as timely delivery.

Our case confirmed the relevance of liver and placental impairment biomarkers in HELLP syndrome diagnosis，particularly in view of the limited diagnostic tools in patients with obesity.\n\n【4】Keywords： HELLP syndrome； Obesity； Morbid obesity； Preterm delivery\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Hemolysis， Elevated Liver enzymes， and Low Platelets (HELLP) syndrome is a severe multisystemic complication of pregnancy. It affects 0.5% to 0.9% of pregnancies， and nearly 25%of cases complicated by preterm preeclampsia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Patients usually develop HELLP syndrome between the 27h and 37h week of gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， presenting with non-specific symptoms， such as epigastric pain， or emesis. Notably， impaired placental function leading to materno-fetal imbalance is characteristic for patients suffering from HELLP syndrome， and maybe relevant for the diagnosis.In fact， in the described case， establishing the correct diagnosis was even more challenging considering the patient's comorbidities， as well as obesity. Nevertheless， no specific treatment for HELLP syndrome exists， and the treatment usually involves corticosteroids to manage fetal maturation， maternal hypotensive therapy， and timely delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. On the other hand， patients with obesity are additionally at risk of developing gestational diabetes and fetal macrosomia，although extensive growth of the fetus maybe limited by placental insufficiency.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 31-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the obstetric emergency department with hypertension which did not respond to the prescribed treatment. The patient was admitted to the hospital in the 31 week of gestation of her first pregnancy. The first obstetric consultation was performed in the 26h week of gestation， since the patient had previously been unaware she was pregnant， due to irregular menstrual periods and obesity -the patient weighed 162.5 kg and was 1.6m tall， with the BMI amounting to 63.48 kg/m. Additionally， the gestational age was uncertain as a result of irregular menstrual bleeding， and the patient's blood pressure on admission was 170/105\n\n【9】mmHg.\n\n【10】We modified the existing hypotensive therapy， methyldopa250 mg 3 times daily to 4 times daily， 500 mg methyldopa and nitrendipine 20 mg every 12 h. Due to the patient’s obesity， CTG monitoring could not be performed， thus， we opted for Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) monitoring every 2 h. Additionally， we started antenatal corticosteroids therapy in order to stimulate fetal maturation， and we also ordered blood tests to control Hemolysis， Elevated Liver enzymes， Low Platelets (HELLP) syndrome， and multiple organ dysfunction.\n\n【11】On the basis of the interview， we found that during her first obstetric consultation in the 26h week of gestation， one of the ordered tests included Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). The OGTT results were abnormal at each time point， indicating that the patient’s condition fulfilled Gestational Diabetes Criteria (GDM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. Her fasting glucose was 107 mg/dL； one hour after ingestion of 75 g glucose it reached 211 mg/dL， whereas after two hours it amounted to156 mg/dL. Her primary care obstetrician diagnosed gestational diabetes mellitus and recommended a special diet for GDM patients， as well as a regular glucose control treatment， which the patient did not comply with. She was diagnosed with gestational hypertension two weeks later； hence， she was prescribed 150 mg of aspirin as a potential prevention of preeclampsia.\n\nFollowing hypotensive therapy modification， the patient’s blood pressure remained below 140/90 mmHg. Glycosylated hemoglobin was 5.62%， indicating adequate glycemic levels despite the lack of|删除段之间换行|ambulatory glycemic control. The patient did not require insulin intake to maintain euglycemia， and treatment of hypertension was successful. Nevertheless， laboratory findings revealed placental insufficiency. Daily urine protein loss exceeded 10 g per 24 h， where0.3 g per 24 h constitutes a key proteinuria cut-off point. During the first three days of hospitalization， the platelet count dropped from 166G/L to 40 G/L，andlactate dehydrogenase increased from 459000 U/L to 683000 U/L. The above mentioned results led us to the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome and to the decision of performing the cesarean section.\n\n【13】Every aspect of the cesarean section in patients with a BMI equal to 63.48 kg/m’ constitutes a challenge . The Pfannenstiel incision allows operators to avoid dissecting most of the abdominal fat tissue， although the estimated blood loss during the surgery did not exceed 500 ml additionally， due to the risk factors， thromboprophylaxis was necessary in order to avoid postpartum complications. The neonate was born prematurely in the 31 week of gestation， with the body mass of 1，360 gm and Apgar scores删除4:<u> 7，7，8，8</u>. At birth， the neonate was within the third centile for the gestational age， which allows for the estimation of the fetal growth restriction， most likely due to the placental insufficiency. The neonate's arterial blood gas parameters measured in the umbilical artery presented pH of 7.28， and the base excess equal to -4.96. For the first ten days of life， the neonate remained in a serious condition in the intensive care unit. He required parenteral nutrition for the first 12 days and a single dose of pulmonary surfactant. After 41 days， the neonate was discharged from the neonatology department in good condition.\n\n【14】The mother's condition improvedevery day following the delivery. An early phase of wound healing was uncomplicated. Blood pressure was approximately 135/80 mmHg with reduced antihypertensive medications at the time of the patients discharge. Laboratory findings improved in the days following the delivery； platelets increased to 156G/L， lactate dehydrogenase decreased to 420 U/L. The patient was discharged four days following the delivery in good condition.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\nThe differential diagnosis of HELLP syndrome is challenging particularly with a limited number of diagnostic tools due to the patient’s obesity. The clinical presentation of HELLP syndrome varies among patients， therefore， it is extremely difficult to develop univariate diagnostic criteria based on the symptoms. Furthermore，|删除段之间换行|other complications ofpregnancy may involveliver dysfunction which could mimic HELLP syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. Hence， the typical differential diagnosis includes such disorders as thrombocytopenia of pregnancy， antiphospholipid syndrome， acute fatty liver of pregnancy， hemolytic uremic syndrome， viral hepatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，9\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Although the pathophysiology of HELLP syndrome remains unclear， it is classified as a severe manifestation of preeclampsia， which usually manifests in the second half of pregnancy， with the number of cases increasing with each gestational week 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，10\\]</u>. Abnormal placentation leads to the release of soluble toxic agents into the maternal circulation. These toxins result in vasculitis， endothelial dysfunction， and systemic maternal diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In a normal pregnancy， the trophoblast migrates deeply into the uterine wall and spiral arteries inside the myometrium. However， the impaired trophoblast penetration leads to an insufficient arterial blood supply for the developing placenta， resulting in local ischemia. A reduced blood flow through uterine arteries can be observed during screening in the first trimester of pregnancy， indicating abnormal placentation and increasing the risk of placental insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Twoantagonist nmechanismscomplicated the patient's pregnancy. First， she was diagnosed with gestational diabetes， which was superimposed by third-degree obesity. Moreover， gestational diabetes leads to hyperglycemia which may cause an increased fetal growth. Nonetheless， due to the placental insufficiency， fetal growth was restricted despite elevated maternal glucose levels. Regardless of her obesity and gestational diabetes， the patient did not require insulin treatment. We hypothesize that the underlying explanation for this mechanism is the placental insuficiency， which resulted in a reduced placental insulinase activity. This， in turn， contributed to lower glycemia than would have been expected on the basis of the OGTT results and the mother's body weight.\n\n【19】Although the treatment of preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome is based on hypotensive therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>， the severity of the HELLP syndrome does not correlate with the level ofhypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， which indicates that both Mississippi and Tennessee classification systems are based on biochemical laboratory parameters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Furthermore， liver and placental biomarkers represent promising options which could contribute to the identification of novel biochemical factors pointing to the HELLP syndrome development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. In fact， biochemical evidence of placental impairment predicts fetal growth restriction and maternal systemic disease. Additionally， it is applicable in patients with obesity where the ultrasound diagnosis is less reliable.

Although uncommonly found in human microflora， and previously thought to be non-pathogenic， although very rare， human infections with Myroides have been observed， and due to increasingly advanced technologies in the detection of microorganisms， there has been an increased number of these infections observed. Based on literature review， less than 70 cases of Myroides infection have been reported. Three species have been identified as causing human infection：Odoratus， odoratimimus， and injenensis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Case reports have demonstrated that these bacteria can cause significant morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>.

However， other cases of endocarditis， bacteremia， UTI， pneumonia， and one case of ventriculitis have been reported \\[1，91.\n\nTreatment of Myroides can be particularly difficult owing to its intrinsic antibiotic resistance.

This resistance is thought to be related to its production of metallo-beta-lactamases1|.\n\nThis patient was particularly interesting in several circumstances. First the patient developed bacteremia. In literature， only 6 cases of bacteremia have been reported， 4 of which were related to cellulitis or diabetic foot ulcer. This patient possessed was not only a diabetic， but complicated with bilateral chronic cellulitis and ulcer. Patient presented following traumatic injury to foot， which may have initiated seeding of the bacteria in the blood. Additionally， a|删除段之间换行|chronically infected lower extremity with disrupted skin barrier not only provides a nidus for propagation on the bacteria，but also a route to the blood stream.\n\n【12】Additionally， this case is unique in that the patient also developed ventriculitis.

Here is a case of a 34-year-old lady， with gestational age of 28 weeks， who presented with an abrupt appearance of Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) treated in a tertiary care hospital. The initial unusual presentation with an enlarged protruding right eyeball was quite a puzzle. Non-resolving Unilateral (U/L) proptosis and sustained mastitis led to a Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) discussion for the management of the pregnant patient. Ultimately through a chain of investigations， the culprit was detected and most importantly the patient agreed to receive the antenatal combined chemotherapy with R-CHOP regime instead of labor induction or postponing treatment until term delivery. Afterward， during the early chemotherapy period at32+ weeks， a healthy premature baby was delivered smoothly by the vaginal route， weighing 1，510g with a good Apgar score. Later in the course， postnatal Intrathecal Chemotherapy (ITC) was administered as the patient's sensorium was affected due to lymphoma infiltration to the Central Nervous System (CNS). The patient’s symptoms were relieved quite a bit as soon as the therapy ensued. But unfortunately， due to an aggressive refractory malignancy， it could not be controlled and the patient survived a year after the diagnosis. We believe that MDT plays a pivotal role in establishing the diagnosis and tailoring treatment of such rare， complicated and challenging obstetrical cases. Therefore this aspect should always be taken into account as early as possible for speedy decision-making for obstetrics cases with atypical Signs and Symptoms (S/S).\n\n【2】Keywords： Lymphoma； Pregnancy； Antenatal chemotherapy； Multidisciplinary analysis\n\n【3】Abbreviations\n\n【4】BL： Burkitt Lymphoma； PBBL： Primary Breast Burkitt Lymphoma； NHL： Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma； MDT： Multidisciplinary Team； CNS： Central Nervous System； B/L： Bilateral； USG：Ultrasonography； MRI： Magnetic Resonance Imaging； IHC： Immunohistochemistry； DWI：Diffusion-Weighted Imaging； CT： Computed Tomography； NICU： Neonatal Intensive Care Unit； PET-scan： Positron Emission Tomography scan； G-CSF： Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor； MIP： Maximum Intensity Projection； HIV： Human Immunodeficiency Virus； OS： Overall Survival\n\n【5】Introduction\n\nLymphoma in pregnancy is rare with an incidence of 1 in 6，000 births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. PBBL is an extremely rare， highly aggressive tumor， growing in pregnancy with an incidence rate of 0.04% to 0.5%. Average-age of onset is 55 years but seldom seen at age <35 years. Stages I & II have good prognosis of about 90% if treated timely， but in more advanced stage when CNS is involved survival reduces|删除段之间换行|to as low as 0% to 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-22\\]</u>. Literature reports 21 cases of PBBL associated with pregnancy， 16 were diagnosed during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-15\\]</u> and 5 in lactation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，16，17\\]</u>， with mean age of 29.9 years (ranging15 to 42). Out of 16 cases diagnosed during pregnancy， 11 were in3d trimester， whereas 4 and 1 in 2nd and 1s trimester， respectively. The reported OS among 21 cases was <1 month in 9，<6 months in4 and one case had 10 month survival. Whereas， 6 were disease free at 12+ months after aggressive treatment. Pregnancy complicated with Lymphoma is extremely challenging to manage， partly by fact that it's thought to be untreatable， and partly by the patient's fear of antenatal-chemotherapy being harmful to her baby. We report the first case from China， for PBBL diagnosed in the 3d trimester. Our patient mindfully accepted to undergo antenatal-chemotherapy. Initially，R-CHOP regimen was started， and meanwhile， a premature healthy baby was delivered. Later， postnatally ITC was added for CNS infiltration and more potent drugs including R-DA-EPOCH regimen were used for this nasty cancer. R-CHOP regimen is considered safer in 2n and 3 trimester except for increased risk for preterm delivery通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Thus， current recommendation for treatment of BL depends on the time of presentation in pregnancy， nature of the disease， and patient preference 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\nA 34-year-old pregnant patient (G P.A ) was admitted to our inpatient in 28h week of gestation with unresolved Bilateral (B/L) swollen breasts and extensive right proptosis for three weeks. The initial outpatient treatment opted for mastitis and inflammatory pseudotumor， and remained futile. Therefore， inpatient admission was advised to assess her thoroughly to catch the culprit. On clinical examination， vital signs were normal， there was obvious right proptosis without tenderness， and B/L breasts were diffusely swollen， without redness or palpable lump. The gravid uterus was palpated with fetal touches， along with a hard density mass mimicking the fetal head， on the left side of the uterus. Mild physiologic edema was noted on the lower extremities. Patient gave the history of viral hepatitis 10 years ago which was effectivelytreated and two Cesarean-Sections (CS) 10 and 7 years ago and had two healthy daughters. At admission， her hemoglobin level was 100 g/L， white cell count 7.6×10/L and platelet count was 280x10/L. The viral markers suggested chronic HBV carrier status， but HIV & Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) were negative. The obstetric-Ultrasonography (USG) showed an intrauterine single alive fetus and an uneven hypoechoic mass measuring 15.2 cm x9.8 cm (clear boundary and regular shape) was observed on the left side of the uterus， probably a uterine fibroid. The breast color Doppler USG， showed B/L inflammatory changes along with axillary accessory breast tissue， importantly swollen axillary lymph nodes with size of 1.3 cmx0.6 cm on right and 1.2cmx0.5cm on the left. The result of the binocular (magnetic resonance imaging) MRI. Treatment for symptomatic relief went in vain， besides only aggravating her signs and symptoms. Therefore， it prompted MDT discussion (Obstetrics and Gynecology， Infectious Diseases， Breast Surgery， Neurology， Ophthalmology) for management and to dig out for unknown disease. Relevant examinations proposed by each department were carried out to detect the root cause of her condition. Breast MRI was suggested but as it needs prone positioning， alas to rely on USG， wherein findings remained the same. However， current obstetric USG showed increased size of left sided mass to 16.7 cm x 11.6 cm and， another mass with regular shape measuring 12.2cm x 9.0 cm seen on right of the uterus， both masses appeared with unclear boundaries and abundant blood flow signals. It was opted|删除段之间换行|to take a biopsy of the right axillary mass under local anesthesia with patient's consent.The microscopic histopathologic and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results of the core biopsy confirms the diagnosis of BL. To know more precise characteristics of the masses， abdominal MRI was performed； chest CT-scan was ordered to see the metastatic status and chemotherapeutic consideration. As it was quite clear what the patient was going through， hence the MDT， now including a hematologic oncologist recommended， preferably postponing the cesarean section if patient agrees and to start the combined chemotherapy immediately. The patient was risk-stratified as high intermediate based on the International Prognostic Index score|删除段之间换行|Once everything was made clear to the patient about her diagnosis of BL and treatment options， she chose antenatal chemotherapy. The prophylactictreatment of entecavirwas given priorto commencement of chemotherapy. Pretreatment with dexamethasone and Polyene phosphatidylcholine was given and R-CHOP regimen was started. As soon as the therapy was initiated， the patient responded well， proptosis and breast swelling reduced remarkably.\n\n【9】Chemotherapy became a challenge when the patient developed short lived psychosis just before baby's birth， anticipating that lymphoma had infiltrated CNS causing Lymphomatous meningitis. Pregnancy-related symptoms were aggravated (shortness of breath， palpitations) due to ongoing chemotherapy. Meanwhile the patient developed neutropenia after the 2u-chemo cycle， and went into labor and vaginally delivered a premature (32+2 weeks) alive and healthy baby weighing 1，510 g with Apgar score 8 and 10 at 1 and 5 min respectively，without any apparent anomaly. The baby was transferred to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for prematurity. ITC was added on day 1 followed by R-CHOP regimen for positive CSF report(presence of white blood cells， cue protein， andlactate dehydrogenase71.0 U/L) clarifying the infiltration. ITC worked well and psychosis symptoms disappeared quickly. When patient developed Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) after 2nd cycle， she was rehydrated， urine alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate， febuxostat to lower uric acid， furosemide for diuresis， and hypertonic sugar with insulin to promote potassium transfer to cells， were administered to further prevent the occurrence of TLS. For raised liver enzymes， reduced glutathione injection and human serum albumin were added. The post chemotherapy myelosuppressive period of neutropenic fever， was managed with antibiotics， blood products and recombinant human Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) to rescue leukocytes. However， as the patient's condition remained unchanged with subsequent chemo， the bone marrow biopsy was taken. Further， a more potent drug Etoposide was added to the regimen for refracto PBBL. Later in the course of aggressive therapy when the patient did not show any improvement， Positron Emission Tomography (PET-CT) examination was performed， which revealed the distant spread sign of failed treatment. Patient requested to stop chemotherapy except only for the symptomatic relief. By now she had completed11 cycles of systemic chemotherapy and 25 ITC injections but unfortunately being very aggressive nature of the malignant tumor is metastasized abruptly making it difficult to control and required further chemotherapy. Patient was encouraged to continue treatment but she abandoned and died due to multi organ failure after 6 weeks， with an overall survival of 12+months.\n\n【10】Comments\n\n【11】non-pregnant women. Currently， there is no evidence that pregnancy accelerates development oflymphoma， but some say， its pathological type in pregnancy seems more malignant therefore gives poor prognosis. Misdiagnosis is common， often due to atypical clinical manifestations or considering otherwise physiological pregnancy-related changes making it difficult to distinguish from hyperhidrosis of lymphoma so delaying diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Some risk factors induce the occurrence of malignant lymphomas， such as infections including EBV， HIV， ionizing radiation etc 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Our patient had a history of infection with HBV， was adequately treated but it's highly suspicious whether this chronic infection was a predisposing factor of this attack? BL affecting pregnant women requires prompt diagnosis and should be managed immediately with an aggressive therapeutic approach. Ideally， for patients with limited early disease， pregnancy should be terminated and radiotherapy be started when diagnosed in the first half. While in the second half， combined chemotherapy can be started antenatally， and radiotherapy be added after the fetus is born 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Our case presented in the 3r trimester， diagnosis was delayed for 3 weeks due to atypical symptoms but multidisciplinary approach helped greatly. Even though termination of pregnancy by cesarean-section was an option to ensure timelyaggressive treatment， as the prognosis of the premature newborn is good， but our patient preferred antenatal-chemotherapy. On the other hand， to avoid fetal exposure to radiation， several imaging examinations are restricted，so it further delays the diagnosis and the best time for therapy is missed. Therefore， it is suggested that for pregnant women with unexplained fever， fatigue， bleeding tendency or abnormally increased blood cells， and progressive anemia， further relevant tests， even bone marrow testing should be considered. Quality of prenatal examinations should be improved for early detection of disease to ensure timely treatment. In past， it was believed if pregnancy with lymphoma is diagnosed， labor should be induced immediately， the main reasons were， and active treatment with low molecular weight cytotoxic agents in the 1 trimester has potentially negative effects on the fetus通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.Complications predictable for 2n and 3r-trimester are fetal or neonatal death，preterm delivery， low birth weight， and severe bone marrow suppression secondary to disease and treatment endangers mother and fetus at any time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. But so far there is no conclusive evidence that induction of labor is beneficial for prognosis. Therefore， if the condition itself is not critical， it is worth taking the pregnancy to the middle and late stages of pregnancy under close monitoring通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Our patient exhibited significant respiratory depression and altered sensorium， but her condition stabilized when ITC was started. Therefore， the author personally prefers to terminate pregnancy onc the organ dysfunction occurs in middle and late stages of pregnancy.

{"seq_id": "946cc3b0-6d29-4718-8338-91cf99b47a07", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background\n\n【1】According to the depth of the tooth in the bone， position of impacted wisdom tooth is divided into three categories. To extract deeply impacted wisdom tooth is one of the highest risks and it is easy to cause postoperative complications. It is highly demand for dentist to prevent these risks.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 22-year-old man was referred to the Department of Implantology， Stomatology Center， and Central South University Xiangya School of Medicine Affiliated Haikou Hospital with a chief complaint of the molar miss in the right side. Intraoral examination revealed absence of right mandibular third molar， mesial impaction of right mandibular second molar with mesial II° caries. CBCT revealed that the tooth was found in the apex of first molar and near inferior alveolar nerve canal . The patient was admitted for surgery under Local Anesthesia (LA) after thorough physical examination and routine blood investigations. Prior to the surgery a duly signed written informed consent was obtained from the patient. A full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was reflected. The posterior part of the buccal wall of the #47 tooth was breached by rosette round bur over teeth #47 and #48， the lateral wall was also resected till the posterolateral wall was approached， guttering of the bone was done around the tooth， distal retractor was used and the #47 tooth was retrieved along with the help of a curette. The #48 tooth was found in the apex of first molar and near Inferior alveolar nerve canal， the vertical and buccal bone of the #48 tooth was to be removed with piezosurgery carefully， the #48 tooth was discovered， then it was split in the neck， but cementum of the #48 tooth close to the IAN was retained， remove the root of it， crown was divided into two pieces then extracted from beneath the #46 tooth， the socket was filled with Bio-OSS and PRF， the wound was sutured . Post-operative recovery was uneventful； the patient was prescribed analgesics and antibiotics. He was followed up for three months and found to have no complaint.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Tooth extraction is a very common procedure in oral surgery通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The complications include Inferior Alveolar Nerve (IAN) injury， hemorrhage， surgical site infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u> pain， dental fracture， the displacement of teeth or fragments， iatrogenic damage or luxation of the second molar 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， soft tissue damage， subcutaneous emphysema， trismus， swelling， and iatrogenic mandibular fracture. How to prevent these problems above all?\n\n【6】The incidence ofIAN injury reported in the literature ranges from1.3% to 5.3% which depend mainly on the position of the impacted tooth in relation to the inferior alveolar canal before surgery. If there is close proximity between the IAN and the roots， the incidence may be as high as 19%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u> and may be temporary or permanent injury通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， therefore proper presurgical planning is required to reduce the risk of injury to the IAN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. The minimally invasive extraction operation， originally described in the late 1900s， is an approach to the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus by making a full thickness flap， but in the present case we had to modify this approach as the tooth was located posteriorly in inferior alveolar nerve canal， Minimally invasive extraction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> of mandibular impacted wisdom tooth is better than traditional method. So a vestibular incision was given starting from tooth #46 till distally to tooth #48. The use of a surgical navigation system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> together with an interocclusal splint enabled the retrieval of a close proximity to the mandibular canal impacted wisdom tooth in a safe and minimally invasive manner without damaging the surrounding vital structures. Removal of deeply impacted tooth using the described techniques is safe with regard to mandibular nerve injury and neurologic damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\nIatrogenic Fracture of Mandible (IFM) related to the removal of teeth is a rare complication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Subcutaneous emphysema is not very common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The use of piezosurgery can accurately remove the bone wall； effectively preserve the thickness of the mandible， thereby reducing iatrogenic fractures. And because the piezosurgery does not require high pressure gas as a driving force， it can also prevent the occurrence of emphysema. The antibiotic administration showed a decrease in pain suffered by patients but a higher incidence of gastro-|删除段之间换行|intestinal side effects. Chlorhexidine gel (CHX) is superior to a placebo in reducing the incidence ofalveolar osteitis after mandibular third molar extraction. There were no significant differences in soft tissue closure at any time point and provide any additional benefit to enhance the soft tissue closure of extraction sockets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【8】In this case， the position of the Mandibular Canal (MC) in CBCT is close to the #48 tooth and absence of cortical bone between the root of the #48 tooth and MC； and the minimum distance between the MC and the third molar is 0 mm， the actual distance was <0.5 mm. The crown ofthe #48 tooth is proximity connects to the distal apex of first molar， the #47 tooth is upon it and there are caries in the mesio-crown. Under the guidance of CBCT， the resistance of bone tissue and adjacent tooth was removed with piezosurgery carefully， #47 and#48 were removed by precise surgical procedure. It is safe to extract teeth without any complications.\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】With the development of high resolution imaging technology， we can clearly understand relationship between the impacted tooth and the surrounding tissue， the blindness of extraction can be reduced because of CBCT accurate guidance. The impacted wisdom teeth were removed safely by precise surgical procedure.\n\n【11】Consent\n\n【12】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Formerly known as Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis (APD)， the condition has been increasingly referred to as PH due to a body of evidence suggesting its pathogenesis is most likelyan IgE-mediated reaction and not due to the production ofautoantibodies通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. We present a case of this rare disorder that was found in an African-American female of child-bearing age and without exogenous Progestogen use.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 41-year-old African-American female patient presented to the Allergy Clinic complaining of swelling of her lips， tongue and face for the past few years. Other symptoms included difficulty swallowing， and changes in her voice. The patient denied shortness of breath，rash， visual changes， sneezing， rhinorrhea， cough， or wheezing. At the time of initial office visit the patient had no known allergies. She reported that these symptoms have been recurring every month a few days after her menstruation period， coinciding with the ovulation window. Skin testing was performed revealing positive results against progesterone. Having never been on any medication containing progesterone， it was concluded that her allergy was to endogenous progesterone. The patient was initiated on prednisone 20 mg orally every month for symptomatic control and was also given two epinephrine auto-injectors in case of emergency. Allergy shot immunotherapy was initiated to immunize to progesterone， however the patient did not respond appropriately. After a long course over 9 years to conservatively treat her rare allergy， she was ultimately referred to Gynecology for planned oophorectomy.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】PH may present clinically with a heterogeneous range of dermatological and systemic symptoms including， but not limited to， urticaria， angioedema，pruritic clustered vesicular rashes， anaphylaxis， wheezing， and chest tightness in response to exposure to progestogens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. While the underlying derangements in physiology required to develop PH have not been elucidated， a prominent theory proposes that exposure to exogenous progestogens (oral contraceptive pills， In-Vitro Fertilization(IVF) treatments) causes the development of progestogen-specific IgE antibodies that cross-link to mast cells which subsequently degranulate in a type I hypersensitivity reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However； this theory does not account for the reported cases in which the patient had no know previous exposure to exogenous estrogens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Diagnosis of PH involves a careful history that temporally associates symptoms with exogenous progestogen administration or the progesterone surge of luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. This can then be followed by skin prick， progesterone challenge， or serological testing to confirm the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Multiple therapeutic approaches to PH have been reported with variable success. Importantly， therapeutic choices should be guided by the goals ofthe patient， specificallywith respect topregnancy desires and side effect tolerability. Generally， treatment is aimed at relief of hypersensitivity symptoms， ovulation suppression， or desensitization to the offending progestogen. Regarding symptomatic relief， oral H1 antihistamines and oral corticosteroids have demonstrated incomplete efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， while corticosteroids have well-documented and compliance-limiting side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In a recent case， omalizumab， a monoclonal antibody directed at the IgE surface receptor on mast cells and basophils， was used successfully to treat PH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In future practice， use of biologics like omalizumab may be limited by high costs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>； however， they offer a promising potential treatment option for PH.\n\n【8】Ifa trial of symptomatic relieftherapy fails， ovulation suppressants have been used as a next line of treatment. These medications have their own potential drawbacks. Unsurprisingly， combination Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCP’s) are poorly tolerated due to the chance of a hypersensitivity reaction to low-dose progesterone within the OCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. GnRH agonists and selective estrogen receptor modulators have been used to control symptoms with incomplete success and undesirable side-effect profiles that result from estrogen withdrawal通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. For patients with severe symptoms who do not respond to the above therapies or desire pregnancy， cases of desensitization to progestogens with intramuscular， oral，and intravaginal progesterone have been reported to be successful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Ultimately， in patients with severe and refractory symptoms to the aforementioned therapeutics， oophorectomy is a viable option for patients who are past child-bearing years or do not desire pregnancy that was first described by Shelley et al. in 1964 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. However， oophorectomy is a procedure with well-documented risks including decreases in cognition and sexual function along with increases in cardiac risk and osteoporosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13-16\\]</u> and should be used as a last resort.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】PH is a very rare disorder that has little to no known incidence and prevalence in the U.S population. There are fewer than 200 reported cases worldwide. We present a rare case of PH that was refractory to standard therapies such as H1-antagonist， corticosteroids， and even Allergy shot immunotherapy. This patient was passed her child-bearing years， making her an appropriate candidate for surgical intervention.

All patients underwent routine abdominal，IVIM，DTIand DKI scans， and the main MRI parameters of kidney and clinical characteristics were measured. The diagnostic performance of AKI was compared， and the relationships among these indices， Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) and AKI staging were analyzed. Finally， all parameters were analyzed by single- and multiparameter regression.\n\n【3】Results： Compared with the non-AKI group，the percentage of CD3+ CD4+ T cells and CD4\\/CD8+ratio in peripheral blood increased significantly. The fast ADC value and Ff ADC value of the renal medulla in the AKI group were significantly lower than those in the non-AKI group. The FA value in the renal cortex was significantly lower than that in the medulla and significantly lower than that in the non-AKI group. The renal medulla MK value in the AKI group was significantly lower than that of the non-AKI group and had the best diagnostic value for AKI in SAP patients， which was positively correlated with AKI staging and negatively correlated with the eGFR. MK values， the percentage of CD3+ CD4+ T cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratio were independent risk factors for AKI by multiparameter logistic regression analysis.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The measurement of renal DKI parameters combined with CD4+ T lymphocytes is practical for early diagnosis and predicting the severity of renal injury in SAP patients.\n\n【5】Keywords： Acute severe pancreatitis； Acute kidney injury； Intravoxel incoherent motion imaging； Diffusion tensor imaging； Diffusion kurtosis imaging\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Acute Pancreatitis (AP) is a systemic disease with immune disorders， especially Severe Acute Pancreatitis (SAP). Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication in hospitalized patients and manifests as a sudden decrease in renal excretion. The mortality rate can be as high as 70%when AP is combined with AKI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. However， the onset of AP-induced renal injury is insidious， and its early clinical manifestations are nonspecific. The levels of serum Creatinine (sCr) and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) indicators may be normal， while renal lesions are still in a reversible stage， and active treatment can reduce or delay the occurrence of renal injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>. Therefore， early detection of AP kidney injury and understanding its immune mechanism can delay the occurrence and development of AP kidney injury， which are of great significance to improve the curer 日 and reduce mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. T lymphocyte subsets participate in the formation of the body's immune system， which mainly maintains the body's immune balance through the T cell network of helper T cells， namely CD4+ T cells and suppressor T cells， namely CD8+ T cells.\n\nIn recent years， functional kidney MR imaging has developed rapidly， making it possible to noninvasively evaluate the morphology and function of the kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. With the continuous improvement of biological tissue diffusion technology， the IVIM two-compartment model was first|删除段之间换行|proposed by Bihan et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>， which measures the microcirculation perfusion and diffusion of the kidney through the observed signal attenuation at different B values. Therefore， IVIM has shown great potentialinthe diagnosis andevaluation ofkidney diseases by revealing the pathophysiological changes of the disease. DTI indirectly reflects information on kidney function changes by detecting the degree and direction of limited diffusion movement of water molecules in human tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. With the extensive application of parallel acquisition technology and plane echo imaging， the application of DTI in organs other than the central nervous system is expanding and becoming a hot topic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. In addition， the kidney is characterized by high perfusion， high water content and radial arrangement of various structures (renal tubules， collecting ducts， and blood vessels)， which lays a theoretical foundation for renal DTI imaging. DKI was derived from DTI model. Due to the impediment of cell membranes， compartments and special cell morphological changes in the lesion area， water molecule diffusion does not always follow a Gaussian distribution. The newly developed DKI was employed to describe the non-Gaussian distribution. Kurtosis， as a dimensionless metric， was employed to quantify the degree of non-Gaussian diffusion and characterize tissue heterogeneity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，15-17\\]</u>. At present， some scholars use a 3.0 T MRI scanner to study kidney DKI in healthy volunteers， and they have confirmed its application value in the kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18-20\\]</u>. As DKI is a newly developed functional imaging technology， there are no reports on the evaluation of renal function in AP patients.\n\n【9】In addition， our previous clinical studies have confirmed the value of DTI in the quantitative diagnosis and severity evaluation of AP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Therefore， we applied the above imaging techniques to further explore the early diagnostic value and severity classification of acute kidney injury in SAP patients， as well as the change of T lymphocyte subsets.\n\n【10】Materials and Methods\n\n【11】Patient population\n\nThe study was approved by the ethics committee of the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College， and all participants signed informed consent forms. Consecutive patients with a clinical history of SAP in our institute between January 2017 and June 2020were initially considered in this study. SAP diagnosis was based on the Atlanta classification criteria revised in 2012 and is presented in|删除段之间换行|Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The diagnosis of organ failure was performed using the modified Marshall scoring system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>， as shown in Table 2， which included the respiratory， circulatory and urinary systems. Organ failure could be diagnosed if any of the three systems reached 2 points or more. Local complications could be aseptic or bacterial within 4weeks and after 4 weeks. Systemic complications refer to basic diseases(such as coronary heart disease) aggravated by the exacerbation of AP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Patients with chronic pancreatitis， tumor and chronic liver disease， chronic renal disease， hypoproteinemia， severe systemic infection or hemorrhagic disease， and poor compliance in MR examination were excluded.\n\n【13】Allpatients were divided into AKI and non-AKI groupsaccording to serum creatinine levels. The AKI diagnostic and grading criteria conformed to the 2012 guidelines for improving the prognostic organization (KDIGO) of global kidney disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. The diagnostic criteria were as follows： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Serum creatinine increased more than26.5 umol/L within 48 h， 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> serum creatinine levels increased by 1.5times over the baseline within 7 days； and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the urine volume in six consecutive hours was less than 5 mL/kg/h. The AKI staging criteria are detailed in Table删除4:<u> 3</u>. All patients completed the determination of serum creatinine levels one day before the MRI examination. The formula for calculating the eGFR based on the epidemiological collaboration (CKD-EPI) for chronic kidney disease is as follows 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>：\n\n【14】MR technologies\n\n【15】All subiects were scanned in the supine position on a 3.0T MRI scanner (Discovery MR 750； GE Medical Systems， Milwaukee， WI.) with a 50 mT/m maximum gradient length and 200 T/m/s maximum slew rate using a 32-channel body array coil with sixteen anterior and sixteen posterior elements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The routine scan sequence included transverse T1WI， T2WI， coronal T2WI and three-phase dynamic enhancement scans covering the two kidneys. To avoid increasing the burden on the kidneys， AP patients with abnormal renal function did not receive enhanced MR scans.

The patient fasted without water for 6hours prior to MR examination.\n\nBreath-holding DTI and free-breathing IVIM and DKI scans of the kidneys were performed in the transverse position before enhanced scanning. The DTI parameters were as follows： TR 2500ms， TE minimum ms， section thickness =5 mm， intersection gap=0mm， FOV= 28 cm to 36 cm， bandwidth 250 Hz，NEX=1 and matrix=256×192. Auto shim： on， diffusion-encoding directions =9， b-value=500 s/mm². The IVIM and DKI sequences were both based on single|删除段之间换行|shot DW spin echo planar imaging with a fat-suppressed sequence， and the IVIM-specific parameters were as follows： b-factor values(0， 50， 100， 150，200，300，500，800，1000 and 1500 s/mm)， TR/TE=4000 ms to 4500 ms/90 ms to 100 ms， matrix= 192~256×192~256， FOV= 28 cm to 36 cm， section thickness =5 mm， and intersection gap=0 mm. The DKI parameters were as follows： b-factor values (0，1000，2000 s/mm)， diffusion-encoding directions =30， TR 8000 ms， TE minimum ms， thickness =5 mm， intersection gap =0mm，NEX=2. The average scan times of DTI， IVIM and DKI were 21 sec， 2 min to 3\n\n【29】MR image analysis\n\n【30】The original DTI， IVIM-DWI， and DKI images were loaded onto a workstation (Advantage Workstation 4.4； GE Healthcare). The FuncTool 2 software package was used to process all raw data， and maps of the corresponding parameters were then obtained by automatic pixel-wise analysis on the GE workstation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Images of the surrounding fat， bone， gas and other tissue were removed by applying the threshold definition method. The parameters of the renal cortex and medulla were quantitatively measured， including DTI-associated ADC， Fractional Anisotropy (FA)， IVIM-associated standard ADC， perfusion fraction (Ff ADC)， pseudodiffusion coefficient (fast ADC)， diffusion coefficient (slow ADC)， DKI-associated Mean Kurtosis (MK)， mean corrected diffusion coefficient(MD) and FA value.\n\nTo avoid the effect of cardiac motion on the image， the right kidney was selected as the target Region of Interest (ROI). Renal ROIs were manually delineated on the b=0 DW images with the aid of T2-weighted images as a reference for distinguishing the cortex and medulla. In each kidney， the ROI of the renal cortex and medulla was an irregular area with a size of 15 ± 2 mm and contained at least 10to 15 pixels. ROIs were manually drawn at the level of the renal hilum carefully avoiding artifacts， the kidney collection system， and the edge|删除段之间换行|of the kidney. Then， the measurement was repeated three times， and the average values were recorded . All parameters were measured by a radiologist with more than five years of experience in abdominal MR. After 3 days， the second time was measured by the same method， and the results were averaged as the final results of statistical analyses.\n\n【32】Laboratory biochemical tests\n\n【33】Biochemical laboratory indicators were determined by an automatic biochemical analyzer (Mindray BS-22) according to the operation procedure and carried out by special personnel in the laboratory of our hospital. These indicators included serum Creatinine (sCr)， Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)， Serum Uric Acid(UA)， Serum Cystatin C (Cys-C)， Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG)， Serum Amylase (AMY)， Serum Lipase (LIP)， Serum Cholinesterase(CHE)， Total Protein (TP)， Albumin (ALB)， Globulin (GLOB)，Total Bilirubin (TBIL)， Direct Bilirubin (DBIL)， Total Bile Acid (TBA)， Glutamate-Propionate Aminotransferase (ALT)， Glutamate-Oxalate Aminotransferase (AST)， R Glutamate Transferase (GGT) and Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP).\n\n【34】CD4+， CD8+ T cell subgroup detection\n\nPeripheral blood lymphocyte counts were analyzed by flow cytometry (Mindray BriCyte E6， Shenzhen) and supporting reagents to detect specific fluorescent antibodies on the surface of immune|删除段之间换行|acid and eGFR were 340.6 pmol/L， 21.6 mmol/L， 343.7 pmal/L， and 65.4 ml/min， respectively.\n\n【36】cells. The specific operation was strictly in accordance with the kit instructions and performed by a dedicated person in the laboratory of our hospital. The percentages of total T lymphocytes (CD3\\)， Th lymphocytes (CD3+ CD4\\) and Ts lymphocytes (CD3\\ CD8\\) were reported， as well as the CD4+/CD8+ratio.\n\n【37】Statistical analysis\n\n【38】Continuous variables were tested for normality， and normally distributed variables were expressed as the means ± standard deviation. The classification variables were represented by the composition ratio. Multiple independent samples t tests were used to compare the differences in MR parameter values between the two groups. Spearman correlation analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between renal parenchymal parameters and eGFR and renal injury grade. Chi-square test was used for classification variables. A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was established to analyze the diagnostic efficacy of IVIM， DTI， and DKI. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to predict the risk factors for AKI. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows (Version13.0， Chicago， IL， USA). P<0.05 was considered to be significant.\n\n【39】Results\n\n【40】General information of SAP patients\n\n【41】In total， 68 patients were included in the study， and 12 patients were excluded (1 with chronic pancreatitis， 2 with tumor and chronic liver disease， 3 with chronic renal disease or renal failure， 2 with hypoproteinemia， 2 with severe systemic infection or hemorrhagic disease， and 2 with poor compliance in MR examination). The final study group consisted of 56 consecutive patients with SAP， including21 women and 35 men with an average age of 59.2±15.9 years (20to 81 years)， 14 of whom were diagnosed with AKI according to the KDIGO criteria . The number of AKI patients with stage I， II， and III disease was 7， 5， and 2， accounting for 50%， 36%， and 14%， respectively. The proportion of men was higher than that of women (28.6% vs. 19.0%， P<0.05). The basic information of all patients is shown in Table删除4:<u> 5</u>. The indicators were not significantly different between the AKI and non-AKI groups， which included age (P=0.732)， FBG (P=0.421)， AMY (P=0.219)， TP (P=0.080)， ALB(P=0.057)， GLOB (P=0.286)， TBIL (P=0.473)， DBIL (P=0.225)，TBA(P=0.226)， ALT (P=0.876)， AST (P=0.432)， GGT (P=0.722) and ALP (P=0.560). Compared with the non-AKI group， the blood urea nitrogen， creatinine and uric acid were significantly increased in the AKI group， while the blood LIP， CHE and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) were significantly decreased (P<0.05).\n\n【42】Comparison of T lymphocyte subsets\n\n【43】The changes in T lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood in both groups are shown in Table删除4:<u> 6</u>. The percentage of CD3+ CD4+T cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratio of peripheral blood in the AKI group were significantly lower than those in the non-AKI group (P<0.05). Although the percentages of CD3+ and CD3+ CD8+ T cells in the AKI group were also lower than those in the non-AKI group， the differences were not statistically significant (P>0.05).\n\n【44】Analysis of IVIM， DTI， and DKI parameters\n\n【45】No serious artifacts were found in the MR images of any of the subjects. The results ofthe main renal IVIM，DTIand DKI parameters in both groups are shown in Tables 7-9， respectively. In IVIM mode， the fast ADC and Ff ADC of the renal medulla in the AKI group were lower than those in the non-AKI group (P=0.043； 0.037). The slow ADC values in the renal cortex and medulla were not significantly different between the AKI and non-AKI groups (P>0.05). In DTI mode， the FA value of the renal cortex in both groups was lower than that in the medulla (P=0.013；0.041)， and the FA value of the renal cortex and medulla in the AKI group was significantly lower than that in the non-AKI group (P=0.419；0.026). However， there was no significant difference in ADC values between the renal cortex and medulla (P=0.438；0.429). In addition， the renal cortex FA value in the AKI group was significantly lower than that in the non-AKI control group (P=0.045)， and there were no significant differences between renal cortex ADC and medullary ADC in the two groups (P=0.331；0.349). In DKI mode， the MK value of the medulla was higher than that of the cortex (P=0.045)， and the MK value in the AKI group was also higher than that in the non-AKI group (P=0.041).\n\n【46】Comparison of the diagnostic efficacy of IVIM， DTI， and DKI in the diagnosis of AKI\n\n【47】To further explore the diagnostic efficacy of positive parameters for AKI， a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was established by taking the AKI group as the positive sample， and the analyzed indices were divided into several segments according to the numerical range of the total level of the sample (broken line). According to the ROC analysis， the above five indicators have high diagnostic value， as shown in Table 10 and Figure删除4:<u> 6</u>. However， MK of the medulla had the highest diagnostic efficiency， and its sensitivity， specificity， and Youden index were 0.793， 0.818， and0.611，respectively.\n\n【48】Correlation analysis\n\n【49】To further analyze the relationship between each parameter and eGFR， we performed a Spearman correlation test on AKI patients. The results showed that eGFR was positively correlated with IVIM-\n\n【50】Table 5： Comparison of general clinical data.\n\n| Clinical index  | non-AKI(n=42)  | AKI (n=14)  | P  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age  | 58.65±15.62  | 60.83±13.68  | 0.732  |\n| Gender (female/male)  | 118/24  | 4/10  | 0.039  |\n| Bun (mmol/L)  | 6.02±2.85  | 16.41±8.43  | <0.001  |\n| Cr (pumal/L)  | 75.57±23.97  | 358.37±266.33  | <0.001  |\n| UA (umol/L)  | 292.03±102.65  | 383.94±171.58  | 0.025  |\n| eGFR(ml/min)  | 108.67±20.34  | 82.45±21.37  | <0.01  |\n| FBG (mmol/L  | 7.70±3.22  | 7.23±3.86  | 0.421  |\n| AMY(U/L)  | 852.77±507.00  | 869.33±872.52  | 0.219  |\n| LIP (U/L)  | 803.77±518.69  | 719.80±947.56  | 0.037  |\n| CHE (U/L)  | 6675.78±1921.20  | 4685.22±1874.63  | <0.001  |\n| TP (g/L)  | 63.47±6.29  | 58.52±9.52  | 0.080  |\n| ALB (g/L)  | 37.08±4.64  | 33.63±6.68  | 0.057  |\n| GLOB (g/L)  | 26.66±5.23  | 24.88±6.23  | 0.286  |\n| TBIL (pmal/L  | 40.65±46.44  | 31.34±26.51  | 0.472  |\n| DBIL (pmal/L  | 19.69±28.84  | 12.17±14.99  | 0.224  |\n| TBA (umol/L  | 34.45±69.10  | 13.15±22.82  | 0.225  |\n| ALT(U/L)  | 168.13±188.50  | 172.39±226.09  | 0.866  |\n| AST (U/L)  | 147.65±209.97  | 110.83±140.16  | 0.432  |\n| GGT (U/L)  | 271.03±316.83  | 270.00±251.27  | 0.711  |\n| ALP (U/L)  | 130.31±99.02  | 134.33±93.97  | 0.550  |\n\n【52】Table 6： Comparison of Tlymphocyte subsets between AKl and non-AKl groups.\n\n| Tcell  |  | non-AKI (n=42)  |  | AKI(n=14)  | f  | P  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CD3+(%)  |  | 62.23±15.19  |  | 53.83±11.82  | 0.98  | 0.076  |\n| CD3+CD4+(%)  |  | 41.78±10.45  |  | 27.81±8.44  | 2.34  | 0.021\\  |\n| CD3+CD8+(%)  |  | 22.13±5.69  |  | 24.73±6.62  | 0.29  | 0.460  |\n| CD4+/CD8+  |  | 1.72±0.36  |  | 1.21±0.29  | 1.95  | 0.043\\  |\n\n【54】\\represents Pe0.05\n\n【55】Table 7： Comparative analysis of renal lVIM parameters in the Akl group and non-AKl group.\n\n|  | slow ADC  |  | fast ADC  |  | Ff ADC  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Group  | Cortex  | Medulla  | Cortex  | Medulla  | Cortex  | Medulla  |\n| Non-AKI  | 1.34±0.21  | 1.26±0.25  | 22.71±2.38  | 17.25±1.25  | 0.42±0.05  | 0.25±0.02  |\n| AKI  | 1.35±0.24  | 1.33±0.28  | 20.63±2.87  | 16.86±1.12a.b  | 0.38±0.03  | 0.22±0.02ab  |\n\n【57】Represents P<0.05 compared with the cortex by t test； b represents Pe0.05 compared with the non-AKl group by t test.\n\n【58】Table 8： Comparative analysis of renal DTI parameters in the AKl group and non-AKI.\n\n|  |  | FA  | ADC  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Group  | Cortex  | Medulla  | Cortex  | Medulla  |\n| Non-AKI  | 0.28±0.02  | 0.57±0.17a  | 2.24±0.17  | 2.20±0.19  |\n| AKI  | 0.23±0.05  | 0.41±0.16ab  | 2.16±0.29  | 2.12±0.28  |\n\naRepresents P<0.05 compared with the cortex by t test； b represents Pe0.05 compared with the non-AKl group by t test fast ADC value， DTI-FA value， CD4+/CD8+ ratio and CD3+ CD4+T cell percentage (fast ADC of medulla： r=0.513， P=0.012； fast ADC of cortex： r=0.548， P=0.009； medulla FA： r=0.40， P=0.016； cortex FA： r=0.36， P=0.021；CD4+/CD8+ ratio： r=0.45， P=0.014； CD3+ CD4+T cell percentage： r=0.507， P=0.011)， and it had a highly negative correlation with the MK value (medulla MK： r= -0.882， P=0.000). Since the MK value had the highest correlation with eGFR ， we further grouped the AKI patients according to the stages of AKI and compared the MK differences among different stages of AKI patients.

However， a study found that of 414 SAP patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)， 287(69.3%) developed AKI. In this study，25% of SAP patients (14/56) developed AKI， which is consistent with the KDIGO guidelines. The proportion of men with AKI was higher than that of women (28.6% vs.19.0%). This result is consistent with previous reports， indicating that male patients with acute pancreatitis are more likely to develop AKI.\n\n【68】Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that sex (OR=0.316， P=0.048)， CHE (OR=0.886， P=0.003)， eGFR (OR=0.865， P=0.005)， BUN(OR=1.049，P=0.001)，CR(OR=1.202，P=0.001)，UA(OR=1.006， P=0.002)， FA value (OR=0.999，P=0.001)， percentage of CD3+ CD4+T cells (OR=1.448，P=0.001)，CD4+/CD8\\ratio (OR=1.203，P=0.001) and MK value (OR=1.554， P=0.001) were important predictors of AKI in acute pancreatitis. After further multivariate logistic regression analysis， we found that the percentage of CD3+ CD4+T cells (OR=1.312， P=0.001)， CD4\\/CD8\\ ratio (OR=1.256， P=0.001)， and MK value (OR=1.530， P=0.001) were independent risk factors for acute pancreatitis with AKI.\n\n【69】Discussion\n\n【70】Important clinical indicators for predicting AKI in acute pancreatitis\n\nAKI is a clinical syndrome defined as a sudden (within 48 h) and persistent decline in renal function caused by a variety of factors， including renalhypoperfusion，nephrotoxic substances， inflammatory factors， and urinary tract obstruction. At present， there are still no specific clinical treatment measures， and the mortality rate remains high. AKI is one of the common complications of acute pancreatitis， and its morbidity is between 1% and 14%， while the mortality rate|删除段之间换行|Renal injury in AP is a complex disease caused by multiple factors， and various factors induce kidney injury through mutual intersection in the process of disease occurrence and development. Therefore， it is particularly important to discover multiple new molecular markers to realize the early prediction of AKI. In our study， there were no differences in liver function indices (TP， ALB， GLOB， TBIL， DBIL， TBA， ALT， AST， GGT and ALP) between AKI and non-AKI groups in SAP patients. These results suggested that liver function indicators should not be used to predict AKI in AP patients. In addition， blood urea nitrogen， creatinine， and uric acid levels were significantly increased in AKI patients， while serum LIP， CHE， and eGFR were decreased， which indicated that AP patients with AKI have severe renal damage. Univariate regression analysis showed that these variables may be important indicators for predicting AKI in acute pancreatitis.\n\n【72】The value of T lymphocyte subsets in the prediction and diagnosis of AKl in acute pancreatitis\n\n【73】The T lymphocyte subset is an important part of the body's\n\n【74】immune system. Studies have shown that an imbalance in their proportion may lead to necrosis， infection and even death in AP patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. In this study， we found that the percentage of CD3+CD4+ T cells and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ in peripheral blood in the AKI group were significantly lower than those in the non-AKI group， suggesting that the body exhibits immunosuppression in SAP patients. This result was consistent with previous reports. Therefore， our results showed that immunosuppression can occur in SAP patients at an early stage， and the decrease in the percentage of CD3+CD4+ T cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratio could indicate the possibility of exacerbation of SAP patients with AKI.\n\n【75】Research value of IVIM， DTI， and DKl in acute pancreatitis with AKI\n\n【76】At present， blood Cr， BUN and urine volume is often used to evaluate renal function. However， the early diagnostic value of these indices is extremely limited， and they are vulnerable to some non-renal factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28-30\\]</u>. However， renal function MR imaging has become a hot topic in kidney research 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31-35\\]</u>. Kidney DTI studies are mainly used for the evaluation of renal pelvic ureter obstruction in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>， diabetic nephropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>，polycystic kidney disease in children and adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>， and ischemia- reperfusion injury of transplanted kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. Renal IVIM research reports are mainly used for the identification of renal tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40-42\\]</u> and the assessment of renal function damage caused by different reasons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43-45\\]</u>. There are several reports on the application of DKI technology in the kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，20，45，46\\]</u>. In addition， our previous clinical studies have confirmed the value of DTI in the quantitative diagnosis and severity assessment of AP. Therefore， we attempted to apply multimodal DWI technologies to the further assessment of AKI in SAP patients.\n\n【77】In this study， to avoid the influence of cardiac motion on the image， we selected the right kidney as the parameter measurement object. Furthermore， many studies have confirmed that there is no significant difference in the FA， ADC， and MK parameters of the left and right kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，20，46\\]</u>. Therefore， we have reason to believe that the right kidney can represent the body's renal function.\n\nIVIM uses the observed signal attenuation of different b-values to determine renal microcirculation perfusion and diffusion， which can accurately reflect tissue DWI information. In this study， slow ADC values were not significantly different in the renal cortex and medulla， and there was still no difference between the two groups. However， the fast ADC and FfADC values of the renal medulla in the AKI group were significantly lower than those in the non-AKI group，|删除段之间换行|and both of them had good diagnostic performance for AKI in SAP patients； the AUCs were 0.682 and 0.705，respectively. Moreover， the fast ADC values were moderately positively correlated with eGFR， which is consistent with research reports by Zhang et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[47\\]</u> and Liang et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>. Our results indicate that renal microcirculation perfusion and effective blood flow are significantly reduced when SAP is combined with AKI. It is speculated that the causes are related to pathological changes， such as swelling and bleeding of glomerular cells， dysfunction of endothelial cells， increase in vascular permeability and infiltration of inflammatory cells.\n\n【79】The results of this study showed that the FA value of the renal cortex was significantlylower than that of the medulla in the DTI and DKI models， and the FA value of the renal parenchyma in AKI patients was lower than that in the control group and had good diagnostic performance for AKI in SAP patients. These results were inferred from two observations. On one hand， the kidney has a complex and special anatomical structure. The renal medulla， which consists of many blood vessels and straight tubules， is arranged in parallel and radial into the pelvis and sinus. The renal cortex is composed of many renal corpuscles and tubules， and the former is mainly composed of capillary globules distributed tortuously. It is precisely because of the difference in the microstructure of the renal cortex and medulla that the diffusion of water molecules in the renal medulla is more directional. On the other hand， when SAP is combined with AKI， pathological changes， such as decreased renal microcirculation perfusion， renal tubular injury， and renal tubular fibrosis， will cause limitations in the multi-directional diffusion of water molecules； as a result， the difference in anisotropic diffusion is relatively reduced， and the FA value decreases. Our results are consistent with the results of previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49-51\\]</u>， which confirmed that FA can reflect pathophysiological changes in early renal injury in SAP patients. Although the ADC value of the renal cortex medulla in SAP patients with AKI was lower than that in the non-AKI group， there was no significant difference in value between the two groups. This result indicates that FA values are more sensitive than ADC in detecting renal functional changes in SAP patients， and the results were also supported in subsequent studies on the correlation between the FA values of the renal cortex and medulla andeGFR(r=0.696 and 0.689).\n\n【80】MK is the characteristic index of DKI， which reflects the average level of complexity of organizational structure in each direction. The MK value increases as the tissue complexity increases. In this study， we found that the MK value in the renal cortex in SAP patients was lower than that in the medulla， while the MK value in the renal medulla of AKI patients was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.001). We speculate that this may be related to the complex tubular structure of the renal medulla. In addition， when SAP is combined with AKI， pathological changes， such as swelling， necrosis and shedding of renal tubular epithelial cells； narrowing or occlusion ofthe official cavity； formation of an intracavitary tube type； infiltration of a large number of inflammatory cells； and a decrease in extracellular space， lead to an increase in the complexity of renal tissue. Therefore， MK is eventually increased. Moreover， we found that the renal medulla MK was negatively correlated with eGFR and positively correlated with AKI stage， which had the best diagnostic performance for AKI. Similarly， Mao et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u> found that renal parenchymal MK was negatively correlated with eGFR in chronic kidney disease. Therefore， our results showed that the MK value might be a supplementary indicator for diagnosing and determining the severity of kidney injury in SAP patients.\n\n【81】Correlation analysis\n\n【82】In this study， we found that eGFR was negatively correlated with renal medulla MK and positively correlated with the percentage of CD3+ CD4+ T cells and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the renal medulla MK value， percentage of CD3+ CD4+ T cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratio were independent risk factors for SAP patients with AKI. Therefore， using DKI combined with T lymphocyte subsets to determine the stage of renal injury in SAP patients may contribute to the diagnosis of AKI before eGFR reduction and provide the possibility for early interyention.\n\n【83】Research limitations\n\n【84】The number of SAP patients with AKI 25%(14/56) may have introduced a slight bias into our results. Moreover， SAP patients are in serious condition and have poor compliance in MR examination， which can affect image quality. Therefore， more patient data will be included in our future study.\n\n【85】Conclusion\n\n【86】In conclusion， the kidney IVIM， DTI and DKI parameters in the kidney had good early diagnostic value for AKI in SAP patients， especially the MK value of the renal medulla， which was positively correlated with AKI staging and negatively correlated with the eGFR. The decrease in the percentage of CD3+ CD4+ T cells and the CD4\\/CD8+ ratio in peripheral blood indicate immunosuppression， which underscores the possibility of exacerbation of SAP patients with AKI. Therefore， the measurement of renal DKI parameters combined with CD4 T lymphocytes is practical for early diagnosis and predicting the severity of renal injury in SAP patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The majority of these patients present with oronasal mucosal necrosis. During active abuse， patients have characteristic necrosis with a white， crusty exudate in the nasal cavity often extending into the posterior oropharynx Purulent nasal discharge is an additional sign often seen during periods of active abuse. Other manifestations include perforation of the nasal septum and perforation of the nasal floor or palate.

Examination again showed thick plaques of white， powdery material coating the nasal cavity， pharynx， and larynx. There was erosion of the soft palate， as|删除段之间换行|well as >75 % of the nasal septum， the uvula was absent， the epiglottis was eroded and indistinct， and the left pyriform sinus was blunted. Supraglottic laryngeal structures were edematous and indistinct with overlying mucoid secretions and eschar .\n\n【16】Pathology revealed necrotic soft tissue diffusely involved with fungal elements. Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida krusei were seen to involve the luminal space and walls of vascular structures within the necrotic soft tissue. Voriconazole treatment was initiated due to these findings， for a total of 9 weeks.\n\n【17】Postoperatively， the patient refused a nasal trumpet for prevention of nasopharyngeal stenosis. Her swallow function was evaluated given the extensive pharyngeal and laryngeal involvement， showing evidence of aspiration. A percutaneous gastrostomy tube was placed for nutritional supplementation. She was discharged on hospital day删除4:<u> 22</u>.\n\n【18】Infectious Disease saw the patient intermittently in follow-up， with adequate weight gain and eventual oral intake. She was taking her antifungal medication intermittently，although had no new infectious symptoms. After multiple missed appointments， the patient was seen four months after hospitalization in the Otolaryngology clinic. Re-evaluation showed a persistent near-total septal perforation， right-sided choanal and nasopharyngeal stenosis， and lateral portions of the epiglottis that were adherent to the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls causing supraglottic stenosis. The patient had normal vocal fold motion . Her swallow function had been adequate to warrant gastrostomy tube removal.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Our case illustrates the potential for airway damage secondary to intranasal acetaminophen abuse. This young woman caused destruction of her intranasal and pharyngeal anatomy， with resultant nasopharyngeal and supraglottic stenosis， requiring temporary gastrostomy tube feedings because of her abusive habit. Prior reports of intranasal drug abuse describe early use of oral antibiotics to treat a presumptive pharyngitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. This highlights a delay in diagnosis， often due to patients withholding information. Patients who inhale medications through one nostril exclusively typically have unilateral disease， helping rule out most infectious etiologies and guiding the clinician toward a correct diagnosis. One may visualize crushed pill debris in the nasal cavity， or analysis of intranasal debris can confirm the suspicion of drug abuse.\n\n【21】intranasal abuse of acetaminophen-hydrocodone OI\n\n【22】acetaminophen-oxycodone combination drugs is well described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，7\\]</u>. Most patients present with necrosis of the oronasal mucosa， with pill debris visible during periods of active use. In cases of extensive intranasal drug abuse， perforation of the nasal septum or erosion of nasopharyngeal structures may occur. While reviewing intranasal abuse of opioid-acetaminophen compounds， Houlton et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> found66% of patients in their series had septal perforations， yet Alexander et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> reported 51% of patients having a septalperforation. Arecent case report by Hardison et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> describes a patient with severe nasal， nasopharyngeal， and oropharyngeal erosion secondary to intranasal acetaminophen use， without involvement ofthe larynx. Interestingly， cocaine-associated septal perforation was much less common， with an incidence ranging between 4-11%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Diffuse involvement of the nasal mucosa may result in fungal infection， as seen in our patient. A pathologic diagnosis of invasive fungal sinusitis (IFS) was made in this case， however her clinical disease was considered distinctly different from IFS. Other reports have also indicated similar pathologic findings without complete clinical correlation. In a retrospective chart review by Vosler et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， pathology and cultures revealed non-invasive fungal disease in85.7% of patients abusing intranasal acetaminophen-hydrocodone. These patients did not respond to antifungal treatment； however， their infections resolved with cessation of intranasal drug abuse. It is hypothesized that tissue necrosis facilitates superficial saprophytic fungal growth. Houlton et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> found that Candida albicans is the most common fungus found in intranasal drug-induced fungal rhinopharyngitis， followed by Aspergillus fumigatus and the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus.\n\n【24】The etiology of mucosal and structural necrosis in patients abusing medications， including cocaine， narcotics， as well as non-prescription：medications， ilsSincompletely understood.While the vasoconstrictive properties of cocaine are well known and documented， similar patterns of necrosis may be seen in patients who abuse narcotics without these properties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，6\\]</u>. Multiple theories have been put forward， including osmotic properties of the medications and pills， adulterants in illicit drugs， as well as fillers used in the manufacture of the pills themselves. In the case of acetaminophen， a study by Hart et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> examined the localization of acetaminophen in a mouse tissue model. They found toxic doses of acetaminophen can collect not only in the hepatocytes and renal cells， but olfactory epithelium. Talc， commonly a filler in drug tablets， is known to cause a granulomatous reaction in respiratory epithelium， both in inhaled and injected forms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，11\\]</u>. Prior reports of intranasal opioid/acetaminophen combination tablets have found evidence of talcosis in the mucosa of some of these patients.\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\n【26】Without patient description of abusive behaviors， intranasal drug abuse diagnosis maybe delayed or missed entirely.Patients presenting with nasal and nasopharyngeal abnormalities such as necrosis of the oronasal mucosa or nasal septal perforation， particularly with unilateral findings， should raise suspicion of intranasal drug abuse. While the direct etiology of the damage is debated， there is likely a combination of factors that lead to mucosal injury. While there are few reported cases ofintranasal abuse of over the counter medications such as acetaminophen， the easy accessibility of these drugs may lead to increased incidence of use with similar clinical findings to the abuse of prescription and illicit drugs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Currently， there isn’t a clear consensus on the treatment of choice for unstable distal radial fractures in elderly patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Elderly patients are usually treated with closed reduction and cast fixation， but the use of the volar approach and a locking plate is becoming increasingly popular 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-6\\]</u>. A benefit of the volar locking plate in distal radial fractures is that it has a preshaped design that makes placement of the plate easier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. It also increases the stability of the fixation and improves blood supply to the periosteum compared to the non-locking volar approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，7\\]</u>. Volar locking plates work just as well in older patients as they do in younger patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However， they do come with potential risks and complications， one of which is hardware failure， which is an uncommon complication occurring in about 2.4% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Here we report a rare case of plate failure following a fall in a 70 year old female with a previous distal radial fracture. We discuss the potential mechanism of this injury and consider how this might have been prevented. We also discuss how hardware failure might impact on fracture repair in these uncommon injuries.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\nA 70 year old lady was admitted to the emergency department following a fall with pain and a deformity to her left wrist. She had fallen over whilst walking her dog and fell onto an outstretched left hand. There were no other injuries sustained from this fall apart from the injury to her left wrist. Her past medical history included type 1 diabetes mellitus， asthma and a chronic ulcer to her right foot. She also had two previous myocardial infarctions， one and two years earlier which were treated with cardiac stenting， and two Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs)， two months earlier.Additionally， she had sustained a left and right ankle fracture in 2010 and 2013 respectively， which were both managed non-operatively， and a left wrist fracture， which was treated with a volar plate and screws. On examination in the emergency department the patient was alert but in pain. There was an obvious deformity to her left wrist and tense swelling to her left forearm. Her neurovascular status|删除段之间换行|was normal. She had good palpable pulses and her capillary refill time was normal. Her median and ulnar nerve function was preserved. An X-ray of the left wrist was performed. The case was discussed in the local trauma meeting and it was decided to take the patient to theatre to remove and replace the internal fixation plate. She was taken to theatre the following day. A Henrys approached was performed and a soft tissue dissection was performed to the plate. The plate was bent at the level of the unused hole and the distal screws had avulsed from the distal radius. The plate was removed which revealed a severely comminuted fracture. The fracture was reduced and alignment confirmed on image intensifier before a bridging volar Acu-Loc plate was applied and fixed with a combination of locking and non-locking screws. A fasciotomy of the flexor compartment of forearm was also performed to manage what appeared to be an impending compartment syndrome and a carpal tunnel release was performed to avoid a carpal tunnel syndrome. The flexor compartment of the forearm was swollen but not necrotic and the median nerve and the thenar branch were identified and preserved. Postoperatively the patient managed well and was discharged home with a backslab in situ. She was seen in follow up clinic at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively with numbness over the thumb， middle and ring finger suggestive of some damage to the median nerve despite preservation efforts. We cannot determine at this moment if these symptoms will be reversible or not.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】This case is unusual in that the plate failed as a result of trauma from a fall. Volar plates are known to fail due to loosening or breaking of the screws as well as bending or breaking of the plate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However， bending of the plate typically occurs as a result of stress fractures that are caused by damage over time， as opposed to acute trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Repetitive use of the wrist， particularly if patients use their wrists to assist standing， has been shown to cause both titanium plates and the screws to break 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. In the elderly， prolonged stress is more likely to weaken the hardware to the point of breaking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Osteoporosis， obesity and muscle wasting can also contribute to hardware failure通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【6】The choice of hardware itself can determine the success or failure of the plate， and poor selection can contribute to the stress that it is under 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. There is a higher rate of failure in plates made from titanium than those made from steel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Additionally， an unfilled screw hole is a potential weak point in the plate from which it can bend or break and so failure to fill all of the screw holes could be a reason for hardware failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，13\\]</u>.\n\nAxial load testing of volar hybrid and locking plates， which aims to replicate long term stress on a plate， demonstrated that the mechanism of failure was by distal fracture collapse and plate bending 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>. These tests found that the force required to bend volar plates with a single-head design was 1025 Newtons (N)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Models suggest that falls onto outstretched hands at a height greater than 0.6 m generate enough force to fracture the distal radius 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Given that estimates of the force required for a radial fracture range from 1640 N to 3390 N， i.e. greater than the force required for volar plates to fail， it is not so surprising that the plate failed in our case通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17-19\\]</u>. Despite this， plate failures due to trauma are extremely rare， with only a handful of cases reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，11\\]</u>. Axial load tests fail to take into account is the ability of the bone to heal，it could be that the fracture healing is what usually prevents the peri-implant injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>. Plates are not usually removed electively|删除段之间换行|from the distal radius as there is an increase in morbidity from repeat surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However， if complications such as synovitis or tendon rupture occur then they can be removed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，21\\]</u>. Hardware is also removed in cases of mal/non-union， infection or pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Bent plates can cause swelling and damage to the surrounding tissues as well as nerve injuries and as such， our patient required the removal of the plates and screws 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this case the removal of the original plate and screws was quite complicated. One of the factors that can make removal of volar locking plates more complicated is cross-threading of the screw in the plate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. This can be caused by poor positioning of the screws or use of excessive force when drilling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. The use of a torque limiting screwdriver is thought to be essential to prevent this from happening， and is perhaps something that could have been done to make this plate removal easier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. There have been similar case reports of plates bending following road traffic collisions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，11\\]</u>. Lucke-Wold et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> suggest that the mechanism of injury for plate bending following a road traffic collision could also apply to those of falls. In their case， the plate used in the patient’s initial fracture repair was a thin， four-hole\"T platerather than a locking plate， which could mean she had a less stable repair， thus causing the plate to bend通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The patient then had the deformed plate removed and was fixed using a volar plate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Another case report by Kanji et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> also chose to exchange the‘T plate’that was used in the original fracture repair and replace it with a locking plate. In these cases， volar locking plates were chosen to replace the damaged plates. However， for the majority of distal radial fractures there is still no clear evidence that these locking plates provide better outcomes for patients than non-surgical management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Whilst volar locking plates have shown to be effective， they may not outweigh the complications， albeit rare ones， of hardware failure， that could be circumvented through the use of non-surgical management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Summary\n\n【9】Decisions on how to treat these distal radial fractures should be made on a case-by-case basis. Hardware failure is a rare complication of distal radial fracture repair， but high impact injuries from falls or road traffic collisions can make this more likely. Plate selection， delayed healing， and surgical technique can all contribute to hardware failure. Additionally， measures should be taken during fracture repair to ensure that should hardware need to be removed at a later date， it is not made more complicated than necessary.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It highlighted an unexpected sub diaphragmatic fixation. The abdominal CT scan highlighted a small size formation， hyper vascular， located at the right side of the abdominal aorta， close to the ostium of the inferior mesenteric artery. The diagnosis of paraganglioma of the Zuckerk and l body was suspected and confirmed by resection of the tumor under laparoscopy.\n\n【2】Keywords： Paraganglioma；PET-CT\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】A 72 years old female patient presented with chest pain. She described having long lasting been treated for hypertension controlled by beta blockers and thiazidic diuretics. She had never smoked. At physical examination the patient was normotensive. She reported experiencing peri-umbilical intermittent pain for three months， more and more frequent， but this was not the reason why she had consulted her doctor. Chest and abdominal examination were normal.\n\nThe chest x-ray showed two opacities of the left lung： the one apical， paramediastinal； the other next to the hilum. A computed tomography (CT) disclosed the images in the form of two opacities oftissue density， very suggestive of malignancy， located one in the apex of the upper lobe， the other in the lower lobe： . There was no visible hilar or mediastinal lymph node enlargement. The right lung was normal. The bronchial fibroscopy was normal， bronchial biopsies were negative. CT-scan controlled fine-needle aspiration of the inferior lobar lesion disclosed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Routine laboratory findings were normal|删除段之间换行|Therefore it was concluded the diagnosis of bifocal bronchial carcinoma； surgical treatment was advocated for that tumor classified T4N0， as the patient was in good general condition， with good respiratory tests， authorizing a pneumonectomy. In order to check the extension of the tumoral process， magnetic resonance (MRI) brain imaging was done and was normal； a 18 fluoro-deoxy glucose positron emission (PET-CT) revealed an uptake of both pulmonary opacities； no uptake of the mediastinal lymph nodes. An isolated uptake oftracer at the abdominal level， on the median line， between the aorta and the inferior vena cava， at the level of the spinal disc L3-L4  was discovered.\n\n【6】Contrast material-enhanced helical CT of the abdomen was performed to document this unexpected uptake of the tracer： it demonstrated a soft-tissue mass 6\\10 mm. Despite the small size， intense density enhancement after contrast material injection was unmistakable. The mass was located between the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava， close to of the ostium of the inferior mesenteric artery， well distinguishable from surrounding tissues， notably the aorta. It also demonstrated the presence of biliary cyst in the right liver， normal adrenal glands， an intense contrast enhancement of the anterior pole of the spleen， which had no PET-CT correspondence.No Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen was deemed necessary.\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\nAt the end of these investigations， the diagnosis of abdominal lymph node metastasis of lung cancer seemed unwise due to the situation of the process very remote from the lung， the absence of any intermediate abnormal lymph node， intense enhancement after contrast injection proving a highly vascular tissue. A benign tumor was suspected， and between other hypotheses the diagnosis of a paraganglioma was offered， but this diagnosis seemed to lack of evidence， as|删除段之间换行|abdominal paragangliomas are very rare， and so no blood or urinary metabolites of catecholamine assay were done. In order to document the nature of the mass， a histological control was proposed and the patient underwent surgery by laparoscopy： lymphadenectomy of the inter aorto-caval area was performed. A small nodular formation was easily seen and easily removed.\n\nMicroscopic examination disclosed a 8mm formation with endocrine structure， with thick sheets and trabeculae separated by fibrous septa. Cells had a granular and eosinophilic cytoplasm， a pleomorphic nucleus with numerous nucleoles and few mitoses. Peripheric to the nodules were found sustentacular cells. There was no focus of necrosis. The capsules of the tumor were thick and no embole was noted. Immunoperoxydase stains were strongly positive for chromogranin on tumoral cells， while sustentacular cells were|删除段之间换行|positive with protein S删除4:<u> 100</u>. These findings substantiated the diagnosis of paraganglioma.No particular elevation or drop of arterial pressure was noted during or after the operation.\n\n【10】The recovery from this intervention was uneventual. The patient reported the disappearance of abdominal pain that she previously experienced. The diagnosis of metastatic lymphadenopathy being set aside， lung surgery was considered and the patient was operated two weeks later and had left pneumonectomy with mediastinal lymphadenectomy； one mediastinal node was metastatic. As the tumor was now classified Grade III B (T4N2)， adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy was offered. The prognosis of the bronchial tumor itself seemed poor， so the risk of tumoral recurrence of the paraganglioma was not considered and no specific supervision was proposed neither genetic study for the patient or her family. The patient died two years later of tumoral progression of the bronchial carcinoma.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumours (approximately 1case on 1 000 000) similar to the pheochromocytomas of the adrenal glands. They are developed from extra adrenal paraganglionar cells of the chromaffin tissue， which explains their locations at the level of the normal locations of chromaffin tissue. Head and neckparagangliomas are of parasympathetic type， and non-secreting： they are found near the carotid bifurcation， where is the carotid body； near the temporal bone and at the level of the larynx and rarely upper trachea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【13】In the mediastinum the aorto-pulmonarywindowparagangliomas are developed at the expense of the aortic body. They are sympathetic type paragangliomas， as are abdominal paragangliomas.These include the paragangliomas of Zuckerkandl body， infradiaphragmatic paraaortic other than from the Zuckerkandlbody，and paragangliomas of the bladder.\n\n【14】Histological examination proves the diagnosis of paraganglioma： microscopic examination reveals sheets and trabeculae of polygonal cells with abundant granular， eosinophilic cytoplasm .The tumor shows prominent vascularity. Neoplastic cells are positive for CD56， synaptophysin and chromogranin， and there are focal S-100protein positivity in sustentacular cells. Histology does not predict benignity or malignancy： malignancy can be proved only by the initial discovery or the subsequent occurrence of distant metastases， as malignant paragangliomas lack histological or molecular markers that distinguish them from benign ones. Tumor size does not seem neither to be a prognostic factor. Ayala-Ramirez 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> reports 66%of metastatic evolution. The genetic study done on the patients highlights in 10-50% of cases inactivating germline mutations of the B and D subunits of the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This is a mutation of autosomal dominant character but incomplete penetrance， which explains that the absence of other cases in the family does not eliminate the familial nature of the disease. Ayala-Ramirez 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> claims that there is a strong correlation between the presence of mutation and malignancy. Other familial diseases can be associated： Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (NEM type 2)； Von Hippel-Lindau disease； Neurofibromatosis； hereditary pheochromocytoma.\n\n【15】Location\n\n【16】The corpuscle of Zuckerkandl， described by Zuckerkandl in1901， is located at the right edge of the abdominal aorta， between the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery and the aortic bifurcation. It is present in the fetus and remnants can be found in the para aortic plexus in the adult. It is a site of development of paragangliomas：Lodish 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> in 2010 listed 135 cases.\n\n【17】Diagnosis\n\nThe clinical signs of Zuckerkandl body paraganglioma are on the one hand， if the tumor is secretant， signs which are common to secreting paragangliomas and are related to excess catecholamine secretion： discomfort with bouts of pallor and tachycardia，headache， paroxysmal hypertension； on the other hand intermittent abdominal pain. As most abdominal and thoracic paragangliomas hypersecrete epinephrine and/or dopamine， biological tests that allow the positive diagnosis of paraganglioma are measurings of plasma and or urine concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine， and their metabolites metanephrine and normetanephrine. However， a large number of paragangliomas are non-secretant. Imaging studies confirm the presence of an abnormal formation located anterior to the abdominal aorta， between the inferior mesenteric artery ostium and the aortic bifurcation. On CT scan there is a strong enhancement|删除段之间换行|of the lesion after injection of iodine proving the highly vascular nature of the lesion. In MRI there is a hyper-intense signal in T2. CT scan and MRI will also allow checking the local extent of the tumor， which can include invasion of local blood vessels and surrounding tissies 5\\].\n\n【19】Angiography is rarely requested except in order to achieve a procedure of preoperative embolization. Functional imaging allows localizing the tumor each time the biochemical diagnosis has been established， by using agents that specifically target the catecholamine metabolism. It includes scintigraphy with MIBG (octreoscan)， which specifically targets the catecholamine synthesis， but has about 10% false-negative rate. PET-CT may be performed with18-Fluorodihydroxyphenilalanine and 18-Fluorodopamine. Actually， PET CT with 18- Fluorodeoxyglucose allows locating the tumor and possible metastases and seems to be the most efficient functional imaging technique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. As this imaging is now widely used， much more than MIBG， it is much easier to implement.\n\n【20】Treatment\n\n【21】Treatment involves surgical excision as often as possible：eventually by laparoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> as we did but usualy by laparotomy because these are most often large tumors， which may have developed hyper vascularized adhesions to the aorta， vena cava or other surrounding tissues which can even be invaded， leading to major vascular resections.\n\n【22】Monitoring and prognosis\n\n【23】Only the initial finding of metastases or their subsequent occurrence proves malignancy. Evolution is slow and eventual metastases may be accessible to surgical resection， which justifies long-lasting monitoring， preferably by annual plasma or urine measurement of metanephrines and MRI of the abdomen. A genetic study is desirable for all patients， to search a mutation in the gene of the SDH. Given the possibility of somatic mutations with variable penetrance， the interest of family screening is controversial.\n\n【24】Peculiarities of this case\n\n【25】The tumour was discovered fortuitously during a PET-CT aimed to exploration of a bifocal bronchial cancer. Kahraman 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> claims that up to 10% of paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas are discovered incidentally.\n\n【26】Of course an abdominal lymph node metastasis was suspected but this diagnosis seemed unlikely，given its unusual location， and the absence of any other node location. The scanner noted the welllimited nature of the lesion and the intensity of enhancement after injection of iodine which indicated a hypervascularization very unusual among lymph node metastases. We know for a long time that other tissues than malignant tumors capture 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose and those false positives of PET-CT are common： this includes infectious(tuberculosisir particular) and inflammatory (post-radiation pneumonitis) processes. Sarcoidosis， granulomatous processes like silicosis give mediastinal nodes images too frequently interpreted as metastatic. Some benign tumors as schwannomas are also the cause of false positive images. In the present case， and as it has been said， we cannot confidently speak of a benign tumor but anyway it was not a metastasis of the lung cancer.\n\nBefore surgery the diagnosis of paraganglioma had only been mentioned； one did not dare set it with certaintydue to the exceptional nature of this pathology； and for this reason no bioassay had been|删除段之间换行|achieved which can be regreated. However and retrospectively， one can say that， given the intense vascularization of the lesion and its metabolic activity， its anatomical location in the exact spot where anatomists describe the corpuscle of Zuckerkandl， that no other diagnosis was possible. One often hesitates to make an exceptional diagnosis on clinical and radiological data only： the case that we have described proves that one should not hesitate if there are serious reasons to do so.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】PET-CT examinations required for evaluation of a cancer or for monitoring of evolution often reveal outbreaks offixation of the tracer without relation to the tumor， whether physiological or pathological. Therefore any fixation of the tracer of unexpected setting， whose existence and location are inconsistent with the tumoral extension， should be interpreted keeping in mind this possibility.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Fasting can also occur involuntarily throughout time in famine， or as consequence of refusal to eat seen in physical or mental illnesses， as occur in the very old frail person， in the terminal cancer， or anorexia nervosa patients. Voluntary prolonged fast has also been described in otherwise healthy people practicing hunger strike or self-denial of food owing to a religious discipline. Comprehensible metabolic studies have been performed with normal persons fasting for five tomore than 30 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Metabolic adaptive mechanisms in the body that permit survival for prolonged periods of time include the provision of glucose from liver glycogen in the first 18-24h， and from hepatic gluconeogenesis derived mainly from muscle amino acids thereafter. From the energy requirement point of view， increased lipolysis and ketone bodies production allow the brain to displace glucose utilization to ketone bodies， sparing muscle protein， and permitting human beings endure several days or months of fasting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【6】After following up a peculiar case of a healthy man fasting for 21 days， we found unforeseen laboratory features suggesting adaptive changes in iron metabolism.

The 21 days of fasting ofthis man was associated with a reduction of 15.5%(13kg) of body weight， with disproportionate higher loss of body fat (50%) than lean body mass (9.3%).\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Despite limitations offBIAAttoC accurately measurebody composition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， data are in agreement with other studies showing higher weight reduction at the beginning of fasting period， with preferential lipid depletion during deprivation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-8\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Progressive urinary and serum urea decrement， as well as the reduction of daily urinary creatinine excretion are also in accordance with decreasing body muscle mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，9，10\\]</u>. Despite within normal laboratory reference range， a 10% increase in serum creatinine was observed. As the subject drank enough water， and maintained a normal urine output all the fasting period time， an intravascular volume contraction is not a reasonable explanation for this phenomenon， which can plausibly be associated with minor renal dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In humans， the first week of fasting is associated with a marked increase in water excretion， suggesting impairment in the urinary concentrating mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，11\\]</u>. In the rat， it was reported the occurrence of a decline in whole kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the beginning of fasting period， followed by an ulterior adaptive phase with normalization of GFR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Despite alow protein diet in humans for 7 days is associated with decreased synthesis of albumin， and increase in the synthesis ofacute phase proteins such as haptoglobin and fibrinogen， the maintenance of serum albumin levels during 3-weeks of total fast is consistent with the serum albumin lifespan and the relative preservation of visceral protein synthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The most remarkable findings of this case report are (i) the 60%reduction in the serum transferrin levels， with (ii) a fourfold increase in serum C-reactive protein and ferritin， and (iii) persistent reduction in the levels of serum haptoglobin， with normalization of all these laboratory data after 14 days of refeeding.\n\n【21】The differences in serum half-life of transferrin (5 days) and albumin (20 days) could explain the progressive reduction of the former in a 3 weeks period of fasting， but the increase in serum C-reactive protein suggest the occurrence of low-grade， sub-clinical inflammation as occur in atherosclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. These findings are in accordance with the increase in oxidative stress in men and women submitted to nutrient and energy intake restriction for 21 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【22】The remarkable increase in serum ferritin and decrease of haptoglobin levels suggest the occurrence of intravascular hemolysis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Serum ferritin is increased in situation such as body iron excess， anemia of chronic diseases， or inflammatory diseases. Another explanation could be the occurrence of liver dysfunction as occur in non-alcoholic fatty liver， but the injury should be severe enough to decrease both albumin and haptoglobin synthesis. Haptoglobin is a protein synthesized in the liver and other tissues， such as skin， kidney and lung. She binds the free hemoglobin released by the erythrocytes. The complex haptoglobin-hemoglobin is removed from the body by mononuclear phagocyte system. Therefore， in the intravascular hemolysis， the haptoglobin serum levels are decreased 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【23】As genetic and other aspects of iron metabolism were not studied， one cannot be assertive about the occurrence of hemolysis in this 40v old man fasting for 21 days. Two studies supporting this point of view： first， Wanby et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> showed increase ferritin serum levels in adolescents with anorexia nervosa. An increased in ferritin serum levels in starvation may be due to hepatocyte dysfunction caused by starvation. The decreased of lean body mass， with consequent decrease in oxygen demand， combined with the limited availability of nutrients， leads to the suppression of bone marrow activity， which may explain the increased iron stores； second， Kennedy et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> which described decreasing of serum ferritin levels after nutritional rehabilitation of adolescent female in patients with anorexia nervosa， suggesting that red blood cells are broken down with contraction of intravascular volume， with iron being deposited into body stores， resulting in increased ferritin.\n\nThese findings are in accordance with the concept of autophagy of red blood cells in adult starvation， as occur in liver，pancreas，kidney， skeletal muscle， and heart， and with the cell breakdown products providing substrates for both biosynthesis and energy generation， allowing survival20|.\n\n【25】Concluding， in this case report we described unforeseen laboratory features suggestive of intravascular hemolysis during starvation. This observation should prompt physicians to study iron metabolism in normal persons fasting for at least 7 days， and be careful in interpretation of serum ferritin levels in conditions associated with reduced food intake.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This fibrous band was visualized near the patient's left lateral canthus. Patient appeared to be in no acute distress or discomfort and was able to open the left eye to greater than 90%. Patient is currently being seen by a pediatric ophthalmologist for ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum. AFA in our patient appears to have no adverse impairment to proper development of her vision. Due to the small size and length of the thin fibrous band， the patient's parents and medical team decided to see if the AFA would resolve on its own. The band of tissue did not spontaneously regress and has remained.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】Patient's gestational age at birth was 35 weeks and 3 days， thus being 4 weeks premature.

She was sent home after the bleeding subsided however one week later she reported heavier bleeding and a cesarean section was recommended and undergone at 35 weeks 3 days. Patient has caught up to all childhood milestones and his height and weight are trending upwards as well.

The index patient was irregularly used statin at age 35， and the reduction was unknown. After PCI and genetic sequencing， reduction inpatient who used statins and ezetimibe in combination with lipid-lowering during a year was55.2% to 62.7%. Therefore， FH with heterozygous LDLR mutation (c.1599G>A) may be suitable for combination lipid-lowering therapy with statins and ezetimibe. In addition， the family members (II1，\n\n【19】site. lV1 were wild type.\n\n【20】II2 and III2) used statins at the early stage. However， the reduction was 20.5% (II1)， 15.1%(II2) and 13.3% (III2)， the treatment adjusted to the combined lipid-lowering therapy of statins (20 mg/day) and ezetimibe (10 mg/day) after cascade screening. For family member III2， it is strongly suggested to strengthen lipid-lowering therapy， improve bad living habits， and further coronary CTA or coronary angiography can be carried out. After sequencing， family member III2 did reexamination that the LDL-C level is 4.12 mmol/L， the reduction is 47.8%. It was found that positive genetic confirmation of FH recognizes the importance， increases confidence in the role of lipid-lowering medicines， motivates initiation and adherence to lipid-lowering treatments.\n\n【21】In conclusion， comparing with traditional screening， cascade screening is more cost-effective. Genetic testing and cascade screening improve cognition and treatment adherence in FH patients.

Currently only fourteen cases have been documented. VESS may be correlated with endometriosis and chronic high-dose estrogen levels. It is usually diagnosed by a pathological examination. Specific clinical symptoms are often not present. In most cases， VESS is a low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. The malignant transformation of endometrial stroma is marked by uniform stromal cells with minimal cellular pleomorphism， mild nuclear atypia and variable mitoses. We report the case of a 33-year-old woman who presented with increasingpelvicpainandwas diagnosed withalow-grade VESS. Onexamination， a smooth-bordered 2.0 cm x2.1 cm lesion between the right levator muscle and the right posterior vaginal wall was found. There are no guidelines based on large prospective-randomized studies for the treatment of Endometrial Stromal Sarcomas and existing recommendations are mostly derived from case reports due to the rarity of these tumors. Our patient received a local excision of the tumor and an adjuvant treatment with a GnRH analogue combined with an aromatase inhibitor.\n\n【2】In conclusion， this case report clearly shows that LG-ESS must also be considered in women with rectovaginal fistula， even though it is very rare. Due to the rarity of VESS， the creation of a register for one is also useful.\n\n【3】Keywords： Vaginal endometrial stromal sarcoma； Malignant transformation of endometriosis； Extrauterine sarcoma\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 33-year-old female patient complained of increasing， severe pelvic pain for around one year. Initially， the dull pain occurred only during movement， but with time it also manifested at rest. The patient reported no other complaints. Her past medical history was unremarkable and there was no relevant family history and no history of other clinically relevant diseases.\n\n【6】During physical examination a hard， palpable lesion was found on the right pararectal side on her posterior vaginal wall. The pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed a smooth-bordered 2.0 cm ×2.1 cm lesion between the right levator muscle and the right posterior vaginal wall. No other abnormalities were found in the lower abdomen. The patient first presented at a regional hospital and received a fractional， transvaginal resection of the tumor due to the primary suspicion ofan endometriosis cyst. Histological work-up including a reference pathological evaluation diagnosed a Low-Grade Vaginal Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma (LG-VESS). Two months after the initial resection the patient noticed a discharge of bowel contents through her vagina and was admitted to our hospital.\n\n【7】Physical examination revealed a scarred vaginal density at 6 oclock without any sign of dehiscence or stool leakage. No sonographic abnormalities were found in the uterus and the adnexal region， as well as no free fluid in the Douglas space.\n\nRectoscopy showed a supra-sphincteric rectovaginal fistula in the scarred area of the vagina at 6oclock. The histopathological results detected a regular cervix without any infiltrates of the clinically known low-grade stromal sarcoma. The radiologic workup， including a CT scan of the chest/abdomen， did not find evidence of metastatic disease. Since the patients’desire to have children|删除段之间换行|had not been fulfilled yet， a fertility-preserving surgery including an en-bloc resection of the scarred recto-vaginal part as part of shared decision-making therapy was planned.\n\n【9】In cooperation with the department of general- and visceral surgery， a whole resection of the vagino-rectal fistula with preservation of the sphincter muscle was performed. A Gracilis muscle flap from the right thigh was used to cover the anastomosis resulting from the resection. A protective ileostomy was placed laparoscopically to protect the anastomosis. The histopathological report described a low-grade endometrioid stromal sarcoma infiltrate which was locally resected in Sano. The microscopical analysis showed bland oval cells surrounding arterioles resembling endometrial spiral arterioles with no nudear atypia or pleomorphism. The immunohistochemical evaluation was as follows： Positive for CD10 and ER， isolated cells were Desmin positive， negative for CK， PR and S100. The Ki-67 labelling index was 1% . Due to positive hormone receptor status adjuvant treatment with a GnRH analogue (11.25mg Leuprorelin acetate q3m) and aromatase inhibitor (Letrozol 2.5 mg q1d) was started after surgery for at least two years. Five months after the operation， the ileostomy was moved back without complications.\n\n【10】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【11】Uterine mesenchymal neoplasms also include Endometrial Stromal Sarcomas (ESS)， which account for less than 10 percent of uterine sarcomas and only about 1 percent of all malignant neoplasms of the uterus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

However， the vagina (VESS) is with fourteen documented cases an extremely rare site of these extrauterine locations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【12】The origin of extrauterine ESS tumor cells is not yet fully understood. In most cases of extrauterine ESS， foci of endometriosis have been detected in the vicinity of the neoplasm， and the presence of endometriosis may explain the estrogen-depending occurrence of these tumors in extrauterine sites such as the ovaries， fallopian tube， and pelvic peritoneum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Typically， VESS presents with nonspecific symptoms such as irregular vaginal bleeding， particularly after sexual intercourse， increasing abdominal discomfort， as well as abdominal distension. Therefore， a definitive diagnosis of ESS can only be achieved through pathological examination. Immunohistochemistry is the preferred method for differentiating ESS from other extrauterine tumors， although none of the immunohistochemical markers are specific for the diagnosis of ESS. In our case， the tumorcells were immunoreactive for ER and CD10， but negative for CK， PR and S100. In most cases， VESS is a low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma with lower than10 mitosis/10 HPF and sparse necrosis. Dense， uniform stromal cells with minimal cellular pleomorphism， mild nuclear atypia and variable mitoses are typical characteristics of ESS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>.\n\nThere are currently no established guidelines available based on large prospective-randomized studies for the treatment of ESS and recommendations are mostly derived from case reports due to the rarity of these tumors. Surgery remains the primary treatment option for ESS， especially for early-stage cases confined to the uterus (stage I-II) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Complete resection may be a good choice for patients in early disease stages without any remote metastases. A total hysterectomy combined with Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy (BSO) and careful abdominal exploration is commonly accepted as the treatment of choice in higher stages (stage 3) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Depending on hormone receptor status of the tumor， ovarian-sparing procedures should only|删除段之间换行|be considered in young women， as reported in our case. Although local recurrences are common after fertility-sparing treatment， they can be treated by surgery without compromising survival通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. After surgery， treatment options may include local radiation therapy， adjuvant hormone therapy or a cytostatic chemotherapy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Although radiotherapy may reduce local recurrence， its effect on long-term survival is uncertain. Hormonal therapy， particularly progestin therapy， is an option because low-grade ESS are typically positive for progesterone receptor. Evidence regarding cytostatic chemotherapy{six coursesplatinum-containing combin chemotherapy (PAC regimen) as adjuvant therapies after surgery) for advanced or recurrent ESS is scarce due to the rarity of the disease and only a few clinical trials have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【15】In general， treatment of primary VESS should be individualized based on stage and grade of the tumor as well as the patient's age and overall health. Further prospective trials are needed to identify the most effective treatments for vaginal ESS and to establish evidence-based guidelines. Close follow-up with imaging and pelvic exams is also important to timely detect any recurrence or metastasis. The current recommendation for high-grade sarcomas is a physical examination and CT imaging of the chest， abdomen and pelvis every three to four months for the first two to three vears， every six months for the next five years and annually thereafter. LGESS usuallypresents with a slow-growing， malignant course with a rather restrained development. Several studies suggest that up to 80% of recurrences can be detected by regular radiological surveillance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\nPrognosis of uterine sarcomas is usually bad， with a median time to recurrence of 14 months. For stromal sarcomas the situation is different. The prognosis of LG-ESS generally tends to be favorable. The rate for disease-specific five-year survival is 80 to 90 percent and for ten-year survival about 70 percent |13，14.\n\n【17】In conclusion， this case report clearly shows that LG-ESS must also be considered in women with rectovaginal fistula， even though it is very rare. Due to the rarity of VESS， the creation of a register for one is also useful.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Neurological complications due to influenza B infection are rare. This case report describes a 54-year-old male who presented neurological complication post viral illness. He was screened for in fectious， inflammatory， neoplastic，paraneoplastic and metabolic causes all of which came back negative apart from Influenza B infection and chronic Hepatitis C infection. The radiological imaging was diagnostic of inflammatory polyradiculopathy involving multiple cranial nerves and the brachial plexus. His neurological symptoms gradually improved following a course of Tamiflu. We hereby present a case of inflammatory polyradiculopathy post Influenza B infection. This case highlights the importance ofconsidering neurological complications in patients with influenza B infection and the need for timely diagnosis and management.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Influenza B is a common cause for upper and lower respiratory tract infection. It mainly presents with upper respiratory tract symptoms like rhinorrhea， dry cough， and nasal congestion along with systemic symptoms like generalized fever， headache， malaise and myalgia. Neurological complication due to influenza B infection is very rare. We report a case of polyradiculopathy post influenza B infection.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 54-year-old gentleman presented to Emergency Department as he woke up with new left-hand numbness and weakness， drooping of left eye associated with double vision and right sided facial weakness. These symptoms were preceded with a two-day history of fever， cough and myalgia. He is generally fit and well with no past medical history. He denied having his annual flu vaccine.\n\n【6】He was initially seen by the stroke team in Emergency Department for a presumed stroke and given aspirin. Initial CT head showed no intracranial pathology and the subsequent MRI confirmed this. He was referred to neurology. Neurological examination showed he had a left cranial nerve III and VI palsy and right cranial nerve VII (LMN) palsy， with weakness of power in his left hand， there was no sensory deficit， ataxia or cerebellar signs. His deep tendon reflexes were normal and plantars were flexor.\n\n【7】Investigations\n\n【8】A nasopharyngeal swab was sent for respiratory viral screen on admission which tested positive for influenza B and was negative for all other viruses including SARS-CoV-2.MRI head and spine with contrast suggested inflammatory polyradiculopathy involving the right facial and right abducens and lower cervical nerve roots (C7 and C8). The subsequent MRI of the brachial plexus confirmed inflammatory polyradiculopathy involving the left C7 and C8 cervical nerve roots， the inferior trunk of the left brachial plexus and the right facial nerve. Nerve conduction studies further reiterated brachial plexus involvement on both sides with medial cord (C8) dysfunction that is mainly sensory on the left， with moderate left median nerve involvement and severe left radial nerve involvement， and sparing of more proximal muscles. The right radial territory (C7) was also involved. He also had a whole-body CT scan which excluded any evidence of malignancy.\n\nHis blood results on admissionshowed a normalwhite cell countof7.9×10/L，thrombocytopenia with platelets of 109×10/L and C-reactive protein of <5 mg/L， he also was tested negative for Borrelia， Epstein Barr virus， Hepatitis B， Cytomegalovirus.However， his Hepatitis C virus antibody|删除段之间换行|was positive， HCV RNA titer was slightly raised at 5.74 Log IU/mL. His autoimmune screen was tested negative for ANCA，ANA， complements， myeloma screen and normal ACE levels. His lumbar puncture study showed clear Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)， CSF glucose3.6 mmol/L and protein 0.29 g/L， CSF viral PCR was negative and CSF culture showed no growth. Furthermore， no oligoclonal bands were detected in the CSF.\n\n【10】Recovery\n\n【11】During his inpatient stay， he was started on a course of Tamiflu for 5 days. The cranial nerve palsies improved gradually as well as his left-hand strength. His neurological symptoms completely resolved by day 7 of his admission and he was discharged home.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】We report a unique case of a patient with multiple cranial neuropathies and inflammatorypolyradiculopathy including brachial plexus with Influenza B infection. In view of his smoking history and sudden onset of symptoms he was suspected of stroke but following radiological study did not confirm this hence was investigated further. As he had preceding viral flu like illness， he had nasal swab test for the respiratory virus which confirmed Influenza B. The radiological study， CSF study and nerve conduction study confirmed multiple cranial neuropathy and lower cervical root involvement including brachial plexopathy.\n\n【14】In view of his given symptoms， he was screened for infectious， inflammatory， neoplastic/paraneoplastic and metabolic causes of polyneuropathy.

Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade are rare in rheumatic heart disease and infective endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. Pericardiocentesis is required in cardiac tamponade and pericardial decompression syndrome is one of its complications. Pericardiocentesis in presence of pulmonary artery hypertension and valvular heart diseases needs to be done with utmost care and hemodynamic monitoring. Sudden withdrawal of a large amount of pericardial fluid can result in hemodynamic instability.\n\n【6】History of present illness： A 20-year-old workman initially presented to a peripheral health center with a fever for the last 3 weeks， worsening dyspnea (NYHA Class I> III)， fatigue and retrosternal chest heaviness. He had a poor response to initial medical care received at the peripheral center and was referred to a higher center for further management. But he had progressive symptoms and presented to us in poor general condition with NYHA Class IV dyspnea with orthopnea.On admission， his pulse rate was 130/min， low volume， regular， blood pressure was 90/40 mmHg and respiratory rate of 38/min. His O， saturation was 99% on room air. His JVP was distended up to the angle of the jaw while sitting， with prominent x descent. The heart sounds were muffled with a gallop rhythm.\n\n【7】Past medical history： At around 9 to 10 years， he had migratory arthritis involving the right knee，left knee and right elbow. He was diagnosed with rheumatic fever and was advised oftreatment and secondary rheumatic prophylaxis. Medical advice was not followed because of illiteracy and affordability. The patient remained in good functional capacity till the present episode of illness.\n\n【8】Investigations： Recent chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly with straightening of the left heart border with wide carina and double atrial shadow suggestive of LA enlargement with prominent vascular markings in the upper lobes of both lungs . His WBC count was 30.8×10%L with neutrophilia. ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with low voltage complexes.\n\n【9】Echocardiography： RHD was evident by the presence of thickened AML and restricted movement of PML with severe mitral stenosis (mitral valve area- 0.7 cm’， mean gradients of 18mmHg @ heart rate of 130 per minute. His aortic valve was thickened and there was vegetation on the non-coronary cusp leading to severe aortic regurgitation. There was moderate pulmonary hypertension with an estimated RV systolic pressure of 50 mmHg. Large circumferential pericardial effusion with maximum dimensions measuring 38 mm anterior to RV in RV diastole was noted with intra-pericardial strands. There was diastolic inversion of the right atrium. IVC was disten ded with <50% respiratory variability .\n\n【10】Management： The patient was admitted to the cardiac critical care unit. Emergency pericardiocentesis was planned for diagnostic as well as therapeutic intent. About 1200 ml of serosanguinous pericardial fluid was drained slowly under hemodynamic monitoring. There was a dramatic initial improvement in his symptoms. But the condition of the patient deteriorated suddenly after the procedure as soon as he was shifted back to CCU. He suddenly developed respiratory distress. An immediate echocardiographic evaluation didn't reveal re-accumulation of pericardial effusion. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation after acute refractory respiratory distress. His chest X-ray was suggestive of pulmonary oedema  and there was no residual pericardial fluid on repeat echocardiographic assessments. He had a rapid downhill course and also developed refractory hypotension； he collapsed despite intensive resuscitative measures.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Rheumatic heart disease is endemic in India， with the highest estimated number of cases and deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\nRheumatic heart disease remains a leading cause of infective endocarditis in the adult population.

She had been using the drug for seven months at a dose of 800 mg daily for a chronic interstitial cystitis. Although an attempt was made to taper the medication to discontinuation， severe urinary pain impeded this process， and the patient could only accept a reduction in dose to 600 mg daily. Nonetheless， the hemoglobin improved from 9.1 g/dl to 10.4 g/dl after just one month on the lower dose. Several months later， while still taking 600 mg daily， the hemoglobin continued to improve to11.9 g/dl.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Phenazopyridine hydrochloride (DPP) is a urinary analgesic used to treat patients experiencing pain，burning， urgency， or frequency caused by lower urinary tract mucosa irritation. These maladies may be due to infection， trauma， surgery， endoscopic procedures， imaging studies， or catheters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. PPD is able to ease patients' discomfort by providing a local anesthetic effect on the urinary tract mucosa. However， the precise mode ofaction of DPP is unknown.\n\n【4】DPP is found in a medication called AZO， and is sold over the counter in many states. The recommended dose for adults is 200 mg three times a day after meals for a maximum of 2 days in patients with normal renal function. While there is no definitive dose adjustment for renal impairment， drug labeling states that “the dose must be lowered in those with impaired renal function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>”.\n\n【5】DPP (2-6-Diamino-3-Phenylazo Pyridine) is hepatically metabolized via hydroxylation to produce 2，3，6-triaminopyridine， or aniline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is also excreted unchanged， as shown in Figure删除4-1:<u>1</u>.

This case report will demonstrate yet another example of chronic DPP use leading to hemolytic anemia.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 68-year-old woman with history of type 2 diabetes， hypertension， hyperlipidemia， hypothyroidism， osteoporosis， obstructive sleep apnea， previous pulmonary emboli， migraines， and interstitial cystitis was experiencing onset of shortness of breath， nausea， decreased appetite， dizziness and diarrhea over several weeks. In July of that year， her primary care provider found that she had a progressing case of anemia of unknown etiology.\n\n【8】The patient then contacted a pharmacist for a medication consult on August 16h，删除4:<u> 2020</u>. The pharmacist perused her medications， labs， and problem lists. Based on her labs from early August， as well as her history of recently beginning dailyhigh dose DPP， the pharmacist suspected she might be experiencing DPP-induced hemolytic anemia. The patient reported she had been taking two 100mg DPP tablets four times daily since January删除4:<u> 2020</u>. Clinically relevant labs included： Hgb of 8.7 g/dl， an MCV of 110 fL， haptoglobin of <10 mg/dl，LDH 383 U/L， a reticulocyte count of 295(11%)， and normal iron labs. The pharmacist recommended that she be referred to a hematologist for a complete work-up and diagnosis. At the behest ofthe pharmacist， she attempted to gradually taper off the DPP. However， this process was stalled because of the exacerbation of urinary pain at the lower doses.\n\nBy 9.1.20， the patient had managed to reduce the dose of DPP to 200 mg TID and had her first|删除段之间换行|hematology visit. Her lab results at that visit yielded a Hgb 9.1 g/dl MCV of 108 fL， haptoglobin <10， mg/dl and LDH 267 U/L， all which suggested hemolytic anemia. Due to negative Direct Anti-globulin Tests (DAT) also done at that time， hematology felt they had ruled out autoimmune hemolytic anemia. As a result， the suspicion of DPP-induced anemia was strengthened.On 9.10.20， a decrease in the DPP dose from 200 mg TID to 200 mg BID was attempted. However， it was not successful， and 200 mg TID dose was resumed. During this time， she also visited a urologist in an attempt to find other remedies|删除段之间换行|toward relieving her interstitial cystitis- related pain.\n\n【10】At the time of her second hematology appointment on 9.29.20， she was still taking DPP 200 mg TID. However， at the slightly lower dose， the patient's labs showed some improvement. Her Hgb was increased from 9.1 to 10.4 g/dL， MCV decreased from 108 fL to 103fL， haptoglobin increased from <10 mg/dl to 23 mg/dl， LDH dropped slightly from 267 U/L to 256 U/L. As a result， the hematologist concluded that there was no emergent need to completely taper her off the medication. Therefore， the patient wished to continue on DPP200 mg TID. On 10.30.20， hydroxyzine was attempted to treat her bladder spasms， but resulted in no appreciable effect.\n\n【11】Finally， at a follow-up visit on 6.2.2021， the patient was still on both DPP 200 mg TID and Levsin 0.125 mg Q4-6h as needed for pain. Results showed an Hgb increase to 11.9 g/dL， an MCV decrease to92.7 fL， and all other lab results in normal ranges. The hematologists chose to not repeat haptoglobin or LDHlevels. These results appeared to demonstrate a direct correlation between the DPP dose and the degree of drug- induced hemolytic anemia.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Because of the mechanism involved in the adverse effect， DPP-\n\n【14】Table 1： Chronology of events and laboratory values.\n\n| Date  | Description of Visit and Phenazopyridine Dose  |  | Hgb g/dL  | MCVfL  | HaptoglobinMg/dl  | LDHUIL  | Otherlabs  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| August 6， 2020  | PCP visit On 800 mg daily since January， 2020  |  | 8.7  | 110  | <10  | 383  | Retic 11%  |\n| September 1， 2020  | Hematology Initial Visit On 600 mg daily since mid-August  |  | 9.1  | 108  | <10  | 267  | DAT neg  |\n| September 29， 2020  | Hematology Visit #2  |  | 10.4  | 103  | 23  | 256  |  |\n| September 29， 2020  |  |  | 10.4  | 103  | 23  | 256  |  |\n| September 29， 2020  | Still on 600 mg daily  |  | 10.4  | 103  | 23  | 256  |  |\n| June 2， 2021  | Hematology Visit #3 Still on 600 mg daily  |  | 11.9  | 92.7  | Not done  | Not done  |  |\n\n| Table 2： Summaries of case reports of phenazopyridine-induced hemolytic anemia.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Reference  | Dose  | Duration before manifestation of HA  | Labs  |  | Duration forlabs to normalizeonce drug was stopped  |  |\n| Phenazopyridine-induced hemolyticanemia Noonan HM， Kimbrell M， Ben JohnsonW， Reuler JB.

As previously mentioned， the drug is hepatically metabolized via hydroxylation to form aniline and its congeners . Of course， the higher the dose， the higher the concentrations of these oxidizing metabolites. At some critical individual-specific“threshold”level， the oxidizing effect of the aniline derivatives exceeds the endogenous reducing capacity of the enzymes within the host's RBCs. This then results in the net increased catabolism of hemoglobin and the clinical manifestation of hemolytic anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【19】In this case， the anemia was quite significant on 800 mg a day of DPP. The hemoglobin fell below 9 g/dl； and， the patient possessed symptoms of systemic hypoxia. Meanwhile， over a period of a few months， reducing the DPP dose 600 mg a dayyielded an improvement nthiee hemoglobin to 11.9g/dl withLSsome commensiirate improvements in other labs and exercise tolerance. The findings of a low haptoglobin and elevated LDH in this case were other classic characteristics of hemolytic anemia， and these normalized as early as late September . Initially， it was hoped that the drug could be stopped altogether， but the continuance of urinary symptoms precluded the patient from doing this. This case shows that， in patients who do symptomatically require longer term daily use of DPP， a small reduction in dose could possibly reduce the magnitude of a drug-induced hemolytic anemia.\n\nThere have been several published reports of hemolytic anemia from the use of DPP in the literature . Previous cases have shown an association of hemolytic anemia with chronic use of this drug in the elderly population， those with renal impairment， and those with G6PD mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-6\\]</u>. The patient in this case was 68years old with multiple comorbidities， but she had normal renal function. A G6PD test was not done. The hematologists confirmed|删除段之间换行|the pharmacist's suspicion through their clinical experience and the use of serial labs such as the hemoglobin， haptoglobin， LDH， and elevations in MCV levels. What made this particular case so unique was the stark difference in the magnitude ofthe anemia seen between the 800 mg and 600 mg daily doses.\n\n【21】Although DPP is not labeled for long term use， there are patients who can find no other modality for controlling bladder pain. All patients on long term DPP should be monitored for hemolytic anemia， especially if on higher doses. However， if hemolytic anemia does occur， a complete discontinuation ofthe medication may not be necessary.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Aberrant FAM83D expression was reported in multiple cancers. Here， we summarized the latest researches of FAM83D in recent five years， and discussed the relationship of FAM83D and cancer diagnosis， development and prognosis， aiming to provide new perspectives for the research of FAM83D in tumors.\n\n【2】Keywords： FAM83D；Malignant tumors； Tumor biomarkers\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The FAM83D gene (Family with sequence similarity 83 member D)， also named as CHICA or C200rf129， is located on chromosome 20 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. FAM83D is relative highly expressed during cell division，playing critical roles in mid-plate formation， regulatingthelocation ofhuman Chromokines in Kid to spindle during metaphase and sister chromatid separation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. Loss of FAM83D leads to dysfunctional spindle， failure of chromatid separation and consequential generation of aneuploidy. Furthermore， researchers have found that FAM83D was co-expressed with many known mitosis-related factors， including Aurora-A， Aurora-B， Plk-1， Plk-4，Cdc20，Cdk1，Nek2， Geminin and CENP protein family， in types of cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. FAM83D belongs to FAM83 protein family (FAM83A-H)， whose functions had long been elusive. The proteins in FAM83 family share a common Domain of Unknown Function 1669 (DUF1669)， which has weak homology to Phospholipase D 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Phospholipase D has been widely investigated in cell proliferation and differentiation. Besides， database analysis showed that the expression level of FAM83D is negatively correlated with overall survival time in various types of cancers. Therefore， FAM83D is tightly related to cell division and may be correlated to cancer development. Here， we summarized the updated cancer-related studies of FAM83D and discuss the possibility of FAM83D as biomarker or target in cancer diagnosis or therapy.\n\n【5】FAM83D and Lung Cancer\n\n【6】Up to date， three independent researchers investigated the relationship of FAM83D expression and lung cancer development. First， through analysis of TCGA LUAD (Lung Adenocarcinoma) datasets， Shi R found that compared to adjacent normal tissues， LUAD tissues showed significant upregulation of FAM83D expression and higher FAM83D expression related to higher DNA ploidy， corresponding well to previous in vitro study that loss of FAM83D leads to aneuploidy. Besides， higher FAM83D expression was associated with shorter survival time. Finally， they performed in vitro assay and showed that FAM83D deficiency inhibited lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1299 proliferation and mobility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Similarly， Yin C found elevated FAM83D expression levels in high invasive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and in the distant metastasis of clinical samples. Interestingly， they illustrated that FAM83D promoted Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in BEAS2B NSCLC cells but not in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cells， implying the discrepancy of FAM83D functions in different NSCLC cells. Additionally， they showed that FAM83D knockdown increases A549 and H1299 sensitivity to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The latest article concerning FAM83D and lung cancer found that circFOXM1 promote NSCLS development by sponging miR-614， and FAM83D was one of the targets of miR-614. Consequently， they conclude that circFOXM1/miR-614/FAM83D axis may regulate lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis in clinic and cell proliferation and progression in vitro and in vivo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【7】FAM83D and Digestive System Cancer\n\n【8】In total， four independent researches concerned the relationship of FAM83D and liver cancer.\n\n【9】Table 1： Summary of the rale of FAM83D in cancers.\n\n| Cancer type  | No. of literaturereported  | In vitro  | In vivo  | Pathway regulated  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lung  | 3  | OE： promote growth， mobilityKD： increase sensitivity to cisplatin  | Higher expression in cancer tissues and relatec to shorter OS.  | influencing CCND1，CCNE1 expression  |\n| Liver  | 4  | OE： promotes growth， colonytormation.

Soon afterwards， Lin B got the similar results by analyzing 150 clinic samples collected between 2006 and 2013 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Additionally， they found better outcomes of patients with lower FAM83D after liver transplantation. More recently， another research confirmed the role of FAM83D through analysis of TCGA and GEO 通用删除7(英):<u>(33006， 45436，84402)</u> datasets， demonstrating that compared to adjacent normal tissues， liver tumors exhibited higher FAM83D expression， and the higher FAM83D levels implied worse DFS and OS， higher recurrence rate and mortality and more advanced AJCC stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Their results indicated that FAM83D may serve as one independent marker for liver cancer progression diagnosis and survival times 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In vitro， Wang D. et al compared 30 liver cancer samples and corresponding adjacent normal tissues and found no differences in expression levels of FAM83A， FAM83B and FAM83C except for FAM83D. Besides， FAM83D levels were elevated in most liver cancer cell lines compared to normal liver cells. Moreover， FAM83D over expression promoted proliferation and colony formation of Hep3B and Focus cell， while FAM83D knockdown inhibited that of SK-hep-1 and YY-8103 cells通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Lin B reported FAM83D deficiency inhibited liver cancer stem cell growth and self-renewal in vitro， as well as tumor growth and tumor metastasis in mice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. As to pancreatic cancer， only one literature stated that FAM83D levels were up-regulated in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) no matter in TCGA datasets or in collected clinical samples， and related to poor prognosis. Meanwhile， in vitro assay showed that FAM83D knockdown inhibited the growth and increased the gemcitabine sensitivity of PDAC cells BxPC3 and SW1990 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Apart from digestive glands， FAM83D were also related to digestive tracts cancer development. Firstly， one group described FAM83D and esophageal cancer， revealing higher FAM83D expression in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) tissues|删除段之间换行|compared to adjacent normal tissues and tightly correlated to poorer clinical outcomes. Furthermore， FAM83D deficiency inhibited ESCC cells ECA109 and KYSE30 growth and increased their radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Secondly， two articles reported FAM83D expression is positively related to Gastric Cancer (GC) cells HS-746T， AGS and SGC-7901 growth， invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo. Besides， clinical samples and database analysis showed that FAM83D upregulation was observed in GC tissues and celllines， and implicated poor prognosis of GC patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. Thirdly， two groups studied the role of FAM83D in Colorectal Cancer (CRC). One reported that FAM83D over expression may promote HCT-15 and HT-29 cells proliferation and invasion in vitro 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The other study found that FAM83D levels are upregulated in clinical CRC samples and in CRC cells lines. Besides， FAM83D knockdown inhibited proliferation， colony formation， migration and invasion of HCT116and SW480 CRC cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【12】FAM83D and Female Reproductive System Cancer\n\n【13】In the year of 2019， two groups conducted the research about FAM83D and ovarian cancer. Both groups reported higher FAM83D levels in cancer tissues than normal tissues. Besides， patients with higher FAM83D levels exhibited shorter OS and DFS times and more advanced stages. One of the researches proposed that FAM83D may serve as an effective marker to distinguish low malignant potential tumor from invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. Like in other cancer types， FAM83D over expression promoted growth， migration and invasion of ovarian cells in vitro 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，20\\]</u>. Similar to ovarian cancer， two groups researches indicated that FAM83D is one ofthe genes that up-regulated in Endometrial Cancer (EC)， and higher expression was related to more advanced stages. It is worth to note that they showed that FAM83D levels in patients’blood would be a efficacious marker to predict the EC prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21，22\\]</u>. Through database mining， four studies dig out the correlation between the expression of FAM83D and breast cancer. Zhai X reported that FAM83D expression was negatively associated with the recurrence-free survival in Triplet-\n\n【14】Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) samples by analyzing GSE45827， GSE38959， GSE65194 datasets from GEO， while another research found FAM83D was associated with poor relapse-free survival and OS of Luminal A type of breast cancers by analyzing dataset GDS2250 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23，24\\]</u>. Furthermore， RNA-seq data from GEO showed that FAM83D was one of the most highly regulated genes in TNBC通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Additional two studies reported that FAM83D was upregulated in breast cancer tissues and related to poor DFS regardless of breast cancer classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26，27\\]</u>. Besides， in vitro assays showed that FAM83D over expression promoted human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC and MCF10A) transformation， migration， invasion and Anchorage-Independent Growth (AIG) . One the other hand，knockdown of FAM83D in breast cancer MDA468 and BT549cells dramatically inhibited cell growth and invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26，28，29\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Above， we summarized the role of FAM83D in multiple types of cancers with clinical data and laboratory in vivo and in vitro research data. To get one step further， we compressed all the key information in one table . In the table， we involved the reported cellular pathways that FAM83D may regulate in cancer cells. Collectively， up to date， FAM83D has been reported critical roles to cell proliferation， migration and invasion in nine types of cancers. Through high throughput screenings and validations， the downstream regulating factors/pathways of FAM83D have been identified. Meanwhile， several studies indicated upstream factors that may regulate human FAM83D expression， including circFOXM1/miR-614 axis， miRNA-495 and promoter methylations. However， we found no relationship between promoter methylation status and FAM83D expression levels in mice tissues during development， implying different regulating mechanisms in different physiological or pathological conditions. As one protein that tightly related to mitosis and had highly correlational expressions with CYCLINB1， FAM83D was intensively investigated these years for its mechanisms in regulating cellular behavior. Prospectively， FAM83D may serve as one effective biomarker for cancer diagnosis or prognosis. Furthermore， given that FAM83D deficiency inhibited proliferations and migrations of in many types of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo， it has the potential to be one promising target for cancer therapy. Further studies of FAM83D may focus on three aspects： 1) how it regulates cell division or chromatin separation；2) how it regulates downstream factors or cellular pathways and what is its biochemical features. 3) More retrospective and prospective clinical study to validate its role as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis and its mutations landscape in cancer cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Patients report pain， jaw muscle fatigue， stiffness， and reduced mobility. Surgical treatment should be considered after failure of other non-invasive methods and if quality of life is significantly affected. TMJ disorders fall into the category of difficult airway and nasotracheal intubation with optical fiberoptic bronchoscopy with the patient awake is the technique of choice.\n\n【2】Keywords：Osteoarthrosis；Temporomandibularjoint；Difficult airway； Fiberopticbronchoscope\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】We present the case of a 43-year-old woman with severe temporomandibular osteoarthritis who underwent surgery for the placement of bilateral prostheses . As background， he presented an adaptive disorder，second-degree Mobitz I atrioventricular block and hypervagotonia with a history of vasovagal syncope and cardiorespiratory arrest in two TMJ repair operations under general anesthesia. Before the surgery， we obtained consent for the publication of the case， the anesthetic-surgical risks of the intervention were reported， and the implantation of a temporary perioperative external pacemaker was scheduled. The airway examination revealed retrognathia， inability to open the mouth (maximum 2 cm)， which made it difficult to assess Mallampati， and an intratracheal diameter of 1.7 cm (measured by ultrasonography with a linear probe in the transverse cervical axis). Nasotracheal intubation with a 3-mm Ambu'aScope\"Fiberoptic Bronchoscope is planned， under sedation with intravenous midazolam 2 mg and topical anesthesia of the upper airway with 0.4% lidocaine nebulization. A ringed tube of size 6.0 is chosen. As a nasal preparation， oxymetazoline is applied at 0.5 mg/ml， 1 ml per nostril. Sevoflurane is then administered via face mask for one minute before fiberoptic bronchoscopy. During the intubation maneuver， it is necessary to perform a jaw thrust maneuver to achieve a partial view of the vocal cords. Once the vocal cords are visualized， instillations of 0.4% lidocaine are applied “as you go”to facilitate the infraglottic penetration of the fiberscope and the tracheal tube. At the end of the intervention and with recovery of consciousness and spontaneous ventilation， the patient was extubated without complications and transferred to the post-anesthetic recovery unit.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\nPatients suffering from TMJ pathology， especially in cases of severelimitation of mouth opening，|删除段之间换行|bronchoscope is usually necessary， either oral or nasal.\n\n【7】pose a challenge for all professionals involved in airway management通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

His birth weight was below the 3d percentile (-2 SD). He had multiple facial dysmorphisms. An inspiratory stridor was noted and deep desaturations for which he was referred to the neonatal intensive care unit. He was started on continuous positive airway pressure. Laryngo-and bronchoscopy showed a laryngeal cleft grade I， a functional relevant laryngomalacia， a right sided tracheal bronchus and very proximal branching in the major bronchi. A CT thorax confirmed the abnormal branching of the bronchi. Cerebral ultrasound revealed a mega cisterna magna and partial atresia of the corpus callosum. The trio WES analysis in the patient revealed a 24.1 Mb de novo， interstitial deletion in 4q13.1q21.3 of the paternal allele of chromosome4(GRch37： chr4：62，383，011-86，491，865)， encompassing more than a hundred protein-coding genes and including the 1.37 M critical region of the 4q21 microdeletion syndrome.

The majority of patients have an additional congenital abnormality. Recognizable syndromes in which laryngeal clefts are reported include syndromes caused by a chromosomal aneuploidy， 22q11.2 deletion syndrome，Opitz/BBB syndrome， Pallister Hall syndrome， CHARGE syndrome and VACTERL association. Recurrence in families has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. In many patients， however， an underlying genetic cause cannot be identified. The 4q21 microdeletion syndrome (OMIM： #613509) was first described by Bonnet et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> in 2010 after identifying a commonly deleted critical interval of 1.37 Mb in nine unrelated patients with differently sized， overlapping， de novo deletions in 4q删除4-1:<u>21</u>.

He was conceived naturally. The pregnancy was complicated by fetal growth restriction at 30 weeks gestational age whereas normal growth was observed at20 weeks of gestation. The delivery was complicated by prolonged rupture of membranes and a postpartum rupture of a notably thin umbilical cord； which was clipped immediately after birth. His Apgar scores were 8/8 at 1- and 5-min post-partum with points withdrawn for color and reactivity. His birth weight was below the 3d percentile(-2 SD)， his height was -1.5 SD and his head circumference was +1.5SD. His physical exam showed low set ears， a wide frontal fontanel， broad nasal bridge， frontal bossing， hypertelorism， hypospadia and hypotonia. He was admitted to the neonatal ward for intravenous treatment of hypoglycemia， which was noted during routine glucose screening for children small for gestational age. An inspiratory stridor was noted as well as deep desaturations for which he was referred to the neonatal intensive careunit. He was started on continuous positive airway pressure. Laryngo-and bronchoscopy showed a laryngeal cleft grade I， a functional relevant laryngomalacia， a right sided tracheal bronchus and very proximal branching in the major bronchi. A CT|删除段之间换行|thorax confirmed the abnormal branching of the bronchi. Cerebral ultrasound revealed a mega cisterna magna and partial atresia of the corpus callosum. Cardiac and renal ultrasound showed no abnormalities. Multiple attempts to wean from respiratory support failed over a prolonged period. This was due to severe incidents with airway collapse when positive pressure support was weaned. This continuing dependency on respiratory support led to discussions on the proportionality of long-term invasive respiratory therapy. After much deliberation care was withdrawn .\n\n【8】Materials and Methods\n\n【9】Genetics\n\n【10】Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed with a trio based approach on genomic DNA extracted from blood leukocytes of the patient and his parents. Exomes were captured and enriched using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V5 Kit， according to manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent Technologies， Santa Clara， California， USA). Sequencing was performed using a NovaSeq Sequencer (Illumina， San Diego， California， USA). Read alignment to the human reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) and variant calling was performed using the BWA and GATK software， respectively. Variant annotation was performed using a custom designed in-house annotation and variant prioritization pipeline. Copy Number Variation analysis was performed using CoNIFER software and annotated using an in-house strategy.

Seven other patients are listed in DECIPHER with a laryngeal cleft， none of them have overlapping deletions with our patient. Laryngomalacia was described in 127 other patients； however， none of these patients had an abnormality of chromosome删除4:<u> 4</u>. DECIPHER reports 134 patients with (partly) overlapping deletions that are smaller than the deletion identified in our patient and one patient with a larger deletion. One patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> with a deletion of 3.3 Mb that completely falls within the deleted region in our patient had a laryngeal stenosis. No other laryngeal or bronchial abnormalities are described in this cohort.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Over a hundred patients are reported with a deletion that is partly overlapping with the deletion in our patient. Overlapping clinical features are abnormalities of the corpus callosum， frontal bossing， neonatal hypotonia and growth delay with relative brain sparing.

This prospective study was performed on 68 chronic low back pain patients divided into two groups by their usual doctor. The first group received a multidisciplinary care in a rehabilitation center for114 h spread over four weeks. The other group received a reconditioning program composed of six hours of physical activity spread over two weeks. Our result suggested that both care programs resulted in improved physical and psychological parameters， and reduced pain intensity (p<0.001). Thus， a physical activity reconditioning program outside the conventional health care structure can reduce pain and disability as well as increase physical capacities as shown by better muscle endurance and flexibility.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\nA large number of people worldwide are affected by low back pain. Indeed， epidemiological studies have shown that globally the number of people with low back pain in 1990 was 377.5million， and it increased to 577.0 million in 2017 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Thus， it is a very common health problem and a major cause of disability. This disability comes from the multifactorial nature of low back pain， including physical， functional， psychological， occupational and social factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. That is why there are numerous reports in the scientific literature that Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) patients suffer from a syndrome of physical and psychological deconditioning linked to pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>， making the management complex|删除段之间换行|Because ofthis complexity，interdisciplinaryrehabilitation programs appear to be one ofthe most effective care regimens to improve back pain and decrease disability通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. These programs include at least one physical component (physical activity or ergonomics exercises) and one other element of mental approach (psychological， social and/or educational). The length of these programs， usually4 to 6 weeks at the rate of 5 days a week，7 h a day， requires inpatient or outpatient hospitalization通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. Despite the differences between all these interdisciplinary programs， their objectives remain the same， namely to restore functional， physical and psychological capacities of CLBP patients in order to facilitate their return to work 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. But these programs are not suitable for subjects who are still employed.Indeed，this treatment requires hospitalization， so CLBP workers must take sick leave during the time of the care， in ducing direct costs (loss of wage， medical costs，etc.) and indirect costs (loss of production for the enterprises， etc.) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. That is why many authors recommended these programs as a second-line treatment due to the resources allocated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>. Thus， according to the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>， it is recommended to propose multidisciplinary rehabilitation only for CLBP patients at a therapeutic impasse， associated with social and/or professional exclusion.\n\nOther programs based on physical activity， such as non-medical treatment to counteract disability in CLBP patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>， seem to be a good alternative to multidisciplinary programs for CLBP workers because they do not require hospitalization and can be provided outside conventional health care structures. Thus， the CLBP workers can maintain their work during the care. However， although the impacts of aerobic exercise interventions alone， muscle strength training alone or flexibility training alone on CLBP patients are known， the benefits of a general exercise program which combines the three interventions has not yet been demonstrated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. However， as concluded|删除段之间换行|by Gordon and Bloxham， a specific intervention program focusing on one area of fitness for CLBP may not be appropriate because CLBP is multifactorial and affects all areas of fitness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. That is why these authors recommended the implementation of a general exercise program to cover all areas of fitness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The objective of this current study was to demonstrate the impact， on CLBP workers， of a short physical activity reconditioning program including general exercises， outside the conventional health care structure， on the evolution of physical and psychological parameters.\n\n【6】Materials and Methods\n\n【7】Study design\n\n【8】This was a prospective study of two groups undergoing different care regimens. The first group of low back pain patients (G1) included patients who followed a multidisciplinary care program in a rehabilitation center for 4 weeks， 5 days per week， 7 h per day. The second group of low back pain patients (G2) comprised patients who underwent a physical activity reconditioning program outside the conventional health care structure over 2 weeks， 3 times a week， for 1 h per session. The G1 served as a reference group since the effectiveness of intensive multidisciplinary care is no longer to be demonstrated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【9】The inclusion criteria were that the patients were more than 18years old and had low back pain for at least 3 months， demonstrating the chronicity of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The exclusion criteria were specific low back pain (e.g.， infection， fracture and malignancy)， severe psychiatric or psychological disorders， and cardiac disease restricting physical activity. The patients were directed to either the rehabilitation center or the non-conventional health care structure by their usual doctor. Patients were directed to a rehabilitation center if they presented a therapeutic impasse and often had to miss work. The other patients who did not have these characteristics were directed to the non-conventional health care structure. Therefore， the constitution of the groups did not allow randomization， but it should be noted that the patients in the rehabilitation center serve as a reference group without comparison with the non-institutionalized group.\n\n【10】Before study enrolment， the design was explained to each patient， after which they signed a written consent form， specifying the purpose and risks of the study. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee N°2019-380-S77.\n\n【11】A total of 68 CLBP patients (35 males， 33 females) were included in this study. The G1 had 38 patients (22 males and 16 females) aged41.5±10.0 years old， and the G2 comprised 30 patients (13 males and 17 females) aged 42.5 ±15.7 years old. Their characteristics are summarized in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. At the beginning of the study， G2 was composed of 36 patients， but six patients were excluded from the study because they did not meet the inclusion criteria， three because of the time commitment， two for personal reasons， and one for secondary low back pain.\n\n【12】Program content\n\nMultidisciplinary care program (G1)： The G1 program included a multidisciplinary team composed of physicians， physiotherapists， occupational therapists， psychotherapists， sports therapists and social workers. Patients in this program had to tolerate some temporary discomfort， such as detoxifying from habit-forming narcotic medication. This program was intensive because the patients were|删除段之间换行|present in the rehabilitation center 5 days a week， 7 h a day over 4weeks， representing 114 h of care for each patient.\n\n【14】Over a week， patients received：\n\n【15】7% h of individual physiotherapy， including global muscle strengthening using body weight for 45 min a day， with a physiotherapist， and stretching， focusing on quadriceps， hamstring. pyramidal and spinal muscles for 45 min a day.\n\n【16】5 h of balneotherapy， composed of lower limb muscle strengthening exercises， stretching and relaxation.\n\n【17】5 h of occupational therapy， including training in weight-bearing techniques and rules for a healthy spine.\n\n【18】10 h of physical activity， with training in techniques for warming up， muscle strengthening (spine and lower limbs) and cardiovascular endurance， as well as soft gymnastic exercises， Scandinavian walking， badminton and outdoor biking. In addition， every morning for 45 min， patients underwent muscle waking， from mild to moderate intensity.\n\n【19】a 1-h theoretical class， given by a doctor of physical medicine and rehabilitation， regarding the anatomy of the spine， mechanisms of pain， and available non-medical treatment like physical activity in order to deconstruct false fear-avoidance beliefs.\n\n【20】The patients could also meet with a psychologist and/or a social worker， depending on their needs.\n\n【21】Physical activity reconditioning program(G2)：Patients received a physical activity reconditioning program for 6 h， spread over 2 weeks (three sessions of 1 hour a week)，including an individual session of muscle and cardiorespiratory endurance， an individual low-impact gym session， and a group aquatic gym session. Duringthe entire care， G2 patients had to stop narcotic treatments like patients in the G1 group.\n\nThe individual session of muscle and cardiorespiratory endurance consisted of the following：|删除段之间换行|15 min of cardiorespiratory warm-up on a cycle ergometer or an elliptical bike， at 65% of target heart rate， as determined by the Karvonen formula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【23】30 min of stato-dynamic muscle strengthening activities using body weight or a resistance band. This activity included strengthening of the lumbar and dorsal region， and also the lower limb muscles.\n\n【24】15 min of stretching of the spine and lower limb muscles.\n\n【25】An individual low-impact gym session consisted of：\n\n【26】10 min of warm-up， including all articulations ofthe body.\n\n【27】30 min of proprioception and balance using Swiss exercise balls， a Bosu balance trainer and walking trails for balance and coordination.\n\n【28】20 min of muscle relaxation exercises， including stretching and respiratory exercises.\n\n【29】A group aquatic gym session was made up of：\n\n【30】Warm-up， consisting of swimming freestyle for 150 to 200meters.\n\nLower limb training for 20 min by， for example， swimming|删除段之间换行|three lengths of a 25-meter pool by forward kicking， backstroke kicking and vertical kicking motions. Training on the upper limbs for20 min by， for example， three lengths of breaststroke with alternate lengths of front crawl. These exercises included muscle strengthening and cardiorespiratory endurance， and used pool noodles， bodyboards and swimming fins. These sessions were of moderate intensity.\n\n【32】Recovery， which consisted of swimming 100 meters freestyle between each 20-min session.\n\n【33】The end of session， which consisted of relaxing for 5 min. The patients could choose either stretching exercises in the small pool or lying on their backs， on a pool noodle， letting the water rock them.\n\n【34】Physical and psychological measurements\n\n【35】For the G1， all the assessments were made in the rehabilitation center， the first before the care was started (T0) and the last one after4 weeks (T4 weeks). The G2 was assessed in a non-conventional health care structure before the beginning of the first session (T0) and after the sixth session (T6). Each assessment for both groups was realized by the same evaluator， and each patient completed the same assessment in the same way.\n\n【36】For each patient， age， body mass， height， gender， duration of complaint and disability were recorded .\n\n【37】Psychological measurements： Each evaluation began with pain measurement by the Analogue Visual Scale (VAS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>， which is a 0 mm to 100 mm scale (low scores indicate less severe pain)； then assessment of psychological parameters was done by three questionnaires. The Dallas questionnaire 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> assessed the repercussions of pain in four areas： Daily Activities (DA)， Work and Leisure activities (W/L)， Anxiety and Depression (A/D) and Social Interest (SI) (scale 0% to 100%； high scores indicated a severe repercussion of pain). The Tampa Scale for kinesiophobia questionnaire 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> determined the level of kinesiophobia in patients(scale 17 to 68； high scores indicated severe kinesiophobia). Finally， the Roland Morris disability questionnaire 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> measured back pain disability (scale 0 to 24；low scores indicated less severe disability).\n\nPhysical measurements： All the patients for the two groups began physical measurements with a 10-min warm-up on a cycle ergometer， at 65% of their target heart rate， as determined by the Karvonen formula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. After the warm-up， the patients underwent|删除段之间换行|muscle endurance and then flexibility tests.\n\n【39】The physical measurements included： 1) tests where the finger-to-floor distance was used to estimate posterior chain flexibility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> and heel-to-buttock distance was used to estimate anterior chain flexibility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>； and 2) two additional tests： the Ito-Shirado test to assess abdominal endurance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> and the Biering-Sorensen test to determine spinal endurance \\[251.\n\n【40】Statistical analysis\n\n【41】Statistical analysis was performed with Sigma Stat version 3.5software. All values were expressed as means ± Standard Deviation(mean ± SD). For each parameter， data normality was tested with the Shapiro-Wilk test. The comparison of the initial demographic characteristics between the two groups was made using an unpaired t test. The intra-group comparisons between initial training and the end of training were made by paired t test. The significance level was set at the 0.05 level for all performed tests.\n\n【42】Results\n\n【43】Baseline evaluations of the two groups\n\n【44】There was no difference between groups in terms of age， body mass index and the duration of pain before study enrolment . Only work status differed between groups. For G1， nine subjects were still at work (23.7%)， 20 were on sick leave (52.6%)， six were unemployed (15.8%) and three were retired (7.9%)， while the 30CLBP patients in G2 were still at work (100%)； Table删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n【45】Patients of G2 presented significant differences in comparison with the patients of G1 for disability 通用删除1(英):<u>(p=0.002， Rolland Morris questionnaire； Table 2)</u>， pain repercussion 通用删除1(英):<u>(p=0.039 for the item DA； p=0.003 for the item W/L； p=0.014 for the global score of Dallas questionnaire； Figure 1)</u>. In the same way， some significant differences appeared between the two groups for flexibility of the posterior muscle chain (finger-to-floor distance)， with a difference of6.0±11.5 cm (p=0.024)， and the holding time ofthe Ito-Shirado test， with a difference of 20.8±41.2 sec.(p=0.045)； Table删除4:<u> 3</u>.\n\n【46】Post-treatment evaluation\n\n【47】Multidisciplinary care program (G1)： The 4 weeks of the multidisciplinary care program allowed a significant improvement in all the parameters measured.

Last， the global score of the Dallas questionnaire was significantly improved (p<0.001)， and three of the four items of this questionnaire were also improved by a decrease of DA： -20.2±19.3%， p<0.001； W/L： -15.4±23.0%，p<0.001； A/D： -7.8±24.5%，p=0.014.\n\nConcerning the physical parameters， the finger-to-floor distance significantly improved (p<0.001)， as did the heel-to-buttock distance(p<0.001 for both sides). The holding time of muscle endurance tests was significantly increased by 51.7 ± 56.2 sec on the Ito-Shirado test (p<0.001) and by 38.4 ± 49.1 sec on the Biering-Sorensen test|删除段之间换行|(p<0.001)； Table删除4:<u> 3</u>.\n\n【58】Physical activity reconditioning program (G2)： Pain intensity通用删除1(英):<u>(p<0.001， Table 2)</u>， kinesiophobia 通用删除1(英):<u>(p<0.001， Table 2)</u> and disability通用删除1(英):<u>(p<0.001， Table 2)</u> significantly decreased respectively by 31.0±12.1mm，8.5±7.5 a.uand 4.0±3.5 a.u. The Dallas questionnaire presented a significant improvement for all items (DA：-26.0±19.1%，p<0.001； W/L：-23.2±21.9%， p<0.001； A/D： -17.4±18.9%， p<0.001； SI：-11.8±17.6%， p=0.008).

The muscle endurance holding time significantly improved by 35.9±65.7 seconds on the Ito-Shirado test 通用删除1(英):<u>(p=0.041， Table 3)</u> and by 52.1± 48.9 sec on the Biering-Sorensen test 通用删除1(英):<u>(p<0.001， Table 3)</u>.\n\n【60】Discussion\n\n【61】A physical activity reconditioning program proposed to CLBP workers outside the conventional health care structure over a short period has highlighted the possibility to break the vicious deconditioning psychological and physical circle by significant improvements in the feeling of pain， disability， physical capacities(muscle endurance and flexibility)， repercussions of pain on daily life and a decrease of kinesiophobia. As expected， these same results occurred in the multidisciplinary care program.\n\n【62】The interest in offering several types of physical activities supervised to patients was to provide them with positive experiences in a safe environment to demonstrate that movement is not necessarily associated with the occurrence of pain or increased pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. This method， named graded exposure to physical activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>， notably reduces kinesiophobia and increases self-efficacy in low back pain patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.Ogston et al. stated that the decrease in kinesiophobia would come from an awareness of the possibility of safely engaging in physical activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Thus， the reduction in kinesiophobia in our study could explain the significant improvement in other pain-related parameters.Indeed，kinesiophobia is one of the mediators of disability in this population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Moreover， the decrease in kinesiophobia seems to be the cause of the improvement in physical parameters as well. Indeed， in order to improve physical abilities， it is necessary to offer a longer training period than the one we tested in our study. In this sense， Hakkinen et al. showed that in order to obtain physiological improvement in muscle function such as muscle hypertrophy， it was necessary to follow a period of muscle strengthening longer than 10weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. To improve neuromuscular parameters， the literature has also demonstrated the need for a training period longer than 2 weeks\\[32-341.\n\nIn the current study， at baseline， G2 presented significant differencesregardingrepercussion ofpain and disability in comparison with G1. In the literature， scores on the Dallas questionnaire are close to those of our G1， with scores for the daily activities and the work and leisure activities items generally between 50% and 60%， and for the anxiety-depression and the social interest items between 30%and 40% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35，36\\]</u>. This statement also applies for the Roland Morris disability questionnaire， for which the mean score for CLBP patients in the literature is usually around 12 a.u 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37，38\\]</u>. With regard to the impact of the pain， the differences encountered in our study between the two groups could be explained by the fact that the patients in|删除段之间换行|G2 were still in professional activity. Indeed， workers with CLBP should maintain at least a sufficient level of physical activity to meet the physical demands of their jobs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>.

This result was evidenced equally in our study， with a significant difference in favor of G2 compared to G1 for the physical parameters at baseline. That is why it is necessary to propose early management to CLBP workers in order to avoid， in particular， a progression of kinesiophobia， which would limit physical activities删除4:<u> 431</u>.\n\n【64】There are a few limitations of the present study. First， the participants were not randomized because the choice of the care depended on participants’work status and therapeutic impasse. However， the main objective of this study was not to compare the two forms oftreatment， but to determine the possibility and the impact of a physical activity reconditioning program outside the conventional health care structure over a short period for CLBP workers.\n\n【65】Conclusion\n\n【66】This study demonstrated11thata a short physical1：activity reconditioning program outside the conventionalhealthcare structure is possible， and it can reduce pain and disability as well as increase physical capacities as shown by better muscle endurance and flexibility. In the same way， this program allows， through gradual exposure to physical activity， for the provision of positive experiences to patients， thus leading to a decrease in kinesiophobia and an increase in their physical aptitudes. The promising results of this study show that a short physical activity reconditioning program outside the conventional health care structure is a good alternative to multidisciplinary care for chronic low back pain patients still at work.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is associated with neurological symptoms like epilepsy and involvement of other organs and systems. It has a slow and progressive and its cause remains largely unknown. A female sex predilection has been noted. We report a case of Parry Romberg syndrome in a 9 years old child who presented to us for the evaluation of seizure.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Parry-Romberg syndrome， otherwise known as progressive hemifacial atrophy， is characterized by progressive atrophy of the skin and its underlying tissues， primarily affecting the face and neck， usually unilaterally. Caleb Hillier Parry and Moritiz Heinrich Romberg were the first to describe the case in 1825 and 1846 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The incidence is about three cases per 100，000 people per year and occurs more commonly among females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The disease manifests between the age of 2and 20 years with a slow and progressive course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The pathogenesis of this disease is unknown通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>； nevertheless， a variety of theories have been proposed， including immunological， traumatic， infectious， endocrinological， neurological， and genetic causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，4\\]</u>. Epilepsy is the most frequent abnormality associated with Parry-Romberg syndrome.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 9-year-old male child presented to the outpatient department with his mother for evaluation of seizures. He was the firstborn child， delivered by vaginal route to non-consanguineous parents. He was apparently well and developmentally normal till the age of 6 years， when he started developing discoloration (hyperpigmentation) on the left side of the face， which became progressive over the year. Parents did not seek medical consultation for the same， and by the age of 8 years， parents also noticed a gradual change in his facial features， noticeably a slow shrinking of the left side. At eight and half years of age， he had a seizure episode of a generalized tonic-clonic type， lasting for about 30 min. At first， he was treated with Ayurvedic medications， but since the seizure episodes recurred mother brought him to our center for further evaluation and management. On examination， the child was moderately built and nourished. We observed an atrophic lesion on the left side of the face， extending from the trichion down to the chin with a depth of 2 mm . Madarosis was noted on the left side. A zone of alopecia was found in the left frontal region. Blood workup， including complete blood count， electrolytes， and calcium， was found to be normal. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a well-defined FLAIR and T2W hyperintense oval area in the caudate nucleus and thelentiform nucleus on the left side ， which also appeared hyperintense on the T1W images. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed diffuse changes in the temporal region， suggestive of seizures. He was started on Sodium valproate and has been on regular follow-up thereafter. The dosage required optimization for control of seizure attacks.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\nParry Romberg syndrome is a rare and sporadic condition reported to be more common in females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. The onset of the disease is in the first two decades， with a progressive phase lasting for 2 to 20 years. This is followed by a stable phase which usually culminates in resolution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Patients distinctly experience atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues， and as the disease progresses， they could develop atrophy of the underlying muscular， cartilaginous， bony， and|删除段之间换行|glandular structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The etiology of Parry-Romberg syndrome is still undetermined； however， the most accepted hypothesis is the autoimmune etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Diagnosis of Parry Romberg syndrome is based on patient history and clinical examination and is supported by imaging and histopathological studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. This child was normal till six years of age， when the clinical symptoms began to develop. The anatomic changes of Parry-Romberg syndrome impact the growth potential of hard tissue， preventing an increase in size during active growth periods. The dominant clinical feature noted is atrophy of the facial tissues， usually adipose tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Seldom， skin， and other connective tissues， including bone， could be affected. The severity of the atrophy can range from barely noticeable asymmetry to severe disfigurement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The present case showed a clear line of demarcation from the forehead down to the chin on the left side. Around 10% to 35% of patients show ocular involvement； the most encountered manifestation is enophthalmos characterized by sunken|删除段之间换行|eyes due to loss of adipose tissue around the orbit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. We did not observe any orbital changes in our case. Around 50% of affected individuals show dental changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， though our child did not have any findings. While the most frequent neurological manifestation of Parry-Romberg syndrome is epilepsy (60.5%)， focal seizures ipsilateral to brain calcifications are also common (50%). Secondary epilepsy， seen in about 30% of the cases， is very difficult to treat. Headache (44%)， behavioral disturbances， and trigeminal neuralgia(8.5%) may also be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，14，15\\]</u>. Our child had seizure episodes which were consistent with the EEG findings. He also had behavioral disturbances. MRI showed hyperintensity areas of the white matter， similar to the description in several previous case studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，16-19\\]</u>. Parry-Romberg syndrome has a significant biopsychosocial impact on the patient’s life due to functional and aesthetic limitations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. There have been proposals to restore facial asymmetry through surgical approaches. Treatment of mild and moderate cases is performed with silicone fillers， collagen， porous polyethylene implants， and autologous fat grafting. The grafting of cartilage， bones， fat， and skincare treatment are reserved for more severe cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，21\\]</u>. The main aim ofpsychological treatment is the social reintegration of these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】Parry-Romberg syndrome is an uncommon condition， which manifests as atrophy of one side of the face. In most cases， Parry-Romberg syndrome appears to occur randomly from unknown etiologies. The pathophysiology of the syndrome remains largely unknown.

She attended other health care facility and Dapagliflozin 10mg once daily was added due to poor control DM with HbA1c of 10.%. Two weeks later presented to the emergency department of this hospital of three days history of severe symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection in form of temperature， cough and shortness of breath. Initial assessment demonstrated the patient had low oxygen saturation， tachypneic， with tachycardia however， blood pressure maintained. Temperature： 38.0°C and BMI 38.1kg/m . Therefore， immediate management applied by giving 10liters ofoxygen/min， steroids， anticoagulation and antibiotics. e-DKA diagnosed on the laboratory tests results  mandate transfer the patient to the Intensive Care Unit(ICU) to continue the management of the eu-DKA according to the hospital protocol approved by endocrinology and ICU departments of this hospital. Tocilizumab added to the treatment following COVID-19 pulmonary changes seen on chest X-ray and moderate pneumonia ofHRCT scan of the chest . PCR of the nasal swab was positive for the virus. ECG was normal sinus rhythm without ischemic changes or heart blocks and cardiac enzymes were within normal ranges. Other causes of DKA and acidosis were excluded and the patient has no history of alcohol intake or taking any other drug. The patient improved on the following days and transferred to the general medical ward to continue COVID-19 and diabetes management. After 9 days of hospitalization， the patient discharged home and advised to discontinue Dapagliflozin and avoid SGLT2 inhibitors group.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】SGLT2 inhibitors drugs including Canagliflozin (Invokana)， Dapagliflozin (Forxiga) and Empagliflozin (Jardiance) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in T2DM in 2013 and 2017 for a new drug Ertugliflozin. These also considered in patients with(T1DM) Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In 2015， many organizations warned about the association of DKA with SGL2 inhibitors.

Patients with poor diabetes control are at higher risk of more severe COVID-19and have higher mortality rate regardless the age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Other factors， such as obesity， comorbidities， metabolic syndrome and a chronic subclinical inflammatory state might be responsible for a|删除段之间换行|preferential association between COVID-19 and T2DM rather than T1DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Obesity is an important independent risk factor for the severity of COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【7】The patient in this case has many risk factors of ominous outcome including， poor DM control (HbAlc 10.0%)， grade II obesity (BMI38.1kg/m²) and moderate severity pneumonia according to the HRCT scan in addition to the eu-DKA. The management is challenging in those sick patients with many risk factors requires ICU admission. The addition of the steroid in the treatment of hypoxemia of COVID-19is worsening the glycemic control. Furthermore， the fluid therapy in eu-DKA is different from the classic DKA because of the normal glycemic level in the blood. The fluid contains glucose are needed in the initial stage and not later as in the classic type by increase glucose administration using higher percentages of dextrose (10% or 20%) are required to facilitate the concomitant administration of the relatively large amounts of insulin that are needed to correct the severe acidosis in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【8】The hospital stay of this patient was nine days and there were no complications throughout this period despite of the initial severity of the illness because COVID-19 infection trigger ketosis or ketoacidosis， and induced diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with diabetes and increased the length of hospital stay and mortality. In a study 42 patients developed ketosis out of 658 admitted for COVID-19.

It is found more often in the non-bulbar area with worse prognosis compared with Caucasians. No consensus is reached regarding the standard surgical treatment of palpebral CM. We presented a 39-year-old Chinese female who developed CM at her right eye， involving superonasalpalpebral conjunctiva，superonasal bulbar conjunctiva and medial caruncle. We excised the lesion including underlying Tenon capsule and the main part of underlying tarsus with a maximum clear margin of 4 mm， while sparing the tarsus of the eyelid margin. We applied a hemi-depth lamellar incision on the eyelid margin tarsus to preserve the contour of eyelid. Double freeze-thaw cryotherapy was applied to the excision margin， and the conjunctival deficit was closed by an amniotic membrane graft. We provided post-operation adjuvant chemotherapy with 0.02% Mitomycin Cthree times daily for a schedule of three weeks on， one week off. Good cosmetic outcome was achieved with no recurrence in the following 35 months. Tarsus is important in lid function and for aesthetic appearance. To achieve wide-enough safety margin and intact eyelid contour， we presented a new simple approach with good cosmetic outcome and desirable disease control in palpebral CM surgery.\n\n【2】Keywords： Blepharoplasty； Conjunctival neoplasms； Melanoma\n\n【3】Key Messages\n\n【4】Non-bulbar conjunctival melanoma is associated with poor prognosis especially in the Chinese population. The wide excision with externallamellar lid margin tarsus sparing was a simple approach that yielded good cosmetic outcome and desirable disease control.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Conjunctival Melanoma (CM) is a rare and highly recurrent malignancy that primarily affects old Caucasians in their 60s. CM annual age-adjusted incidence rates (1 million person years) for different races were 0.49 for non-Hispanic Whites， 0.18 for Blacks and 0.15 for Asians 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Bulbar conjunctiva is the most common site ofCM， affecting 60% to 92% of cases， and half ofthem involving the limbus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.CM in Chinese patients， with 70% to 95% of them invading non-bulbar area，leading to a poorer prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. Surgical treatment for bulbar melanoma has long been reported， but little has been discussed on the aspect of reconstruction related to palpebral conjunctival melanoma. Cases reported are mainly limited to those undergoing tarsoconjunctival graft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， Hughes tarsoconjunctival flap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and total-tarsus-sparing surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Here， we demonstrated a novel and relatively simple surgical approach for treating palpebral CM. This surgical method achieves wider safety margin without grafting， prevents donor-induced wound on donor site， as well as a good aesthetic appearance.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\nA 39-year-old Chinese female with no systemic disease presented with a pigmented lesion at the superonasal palpebral conjunctival of her right eye . The lesion existed since her age of 32 years， and enlarged progressively over the recent two months. There were no associated|删除段之间换行|complaints related to the central nervous system， chest or abdomen. On examination， an elevated dark-brown lesion measuring 15 mm in size was located at 12 o'clock to 3 o’clock area of right palpebral conjunctiva， invading caruncle， superior fornix and superior bulbar conjunctiva. The lesion was close to but did not invade the eyelid margin. Her visual acuity was 6/6.7OD and 6/5 OS. Other ophthalmic examinations including those of the anterior chamber and B scan were all unremarkable. No palpable lymphadenopathy was detected over the submandibular， cervical， preauricular and parotid areas. The patient's systemic work-up including general physical examination， chest X-ray， abdominal sonography， brain MRI and Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT were also unremarkable.\n\nWe performed a wide local excision with a planar clear margin|删除段之间换行|of 4 mm as much as possible. It started from the superior palpebral conjunctiva to the superior bulbar conjunctiva， including caruncle and superior fornix. We excised deep to the underlying Tenon capsule and tarsus， while sparing the external hemi-depth lamellar tarsus of superior eyelid margin， which was 2 mm superior to eyelid margin， to preserve the function of eyelid with enough safety margin. Double freeze-thaw cryotherapy was applied over the conjunctival excision borders and the base of palpebral conjunctival excision site. The residual conjunctival defect was closed with an amniotic membrane graft， using a second set of instruments to avoid contamination. The symblepharon ring was inserted in place. The final histopathology revealed malignant melanoma arising from Primary Acquired Melanosis (PAM) with moderate atypia， with microinyasion<1mm. The Breslow thickness was less than 1mm. The resection margin was free of tumor but less than 1 mm in distance to the peripheral and deep margin . Lymph-vascular invasion and perineural invasion were not identified. The final clinical staging was cT2cN0M0， according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual (8h edition) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\nThe patient appeared unable to tolerate the symblepharon ring and symblepharon with shallow upper fornix was observed. We reconstructed， 7 weeks after primary surgery， a superior fornix with a contralateral conjunctival graft. No obvious syndromes of dry eye for diplopia were noted after surgery. Topical adjuvant chemotherapy was applied considering the higher recurrence risk related to pagetoid pattern of pathology. We started the patient on topical chemotherapy|删除段之间换行|one week after the fornix reconstruction， allowing the wound to heal. The three-week course of topical chemotherapy was followed by one-week of rest and repeated for 12 cycles. Follow-ups of 35 months showed no recurrence of melanoma with good cosmetic outcome.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】About the surgery for conjunctival melanoma， the \"no touch\"surgical technique was firstly described by Shields et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> and was widely accepted.Wide excision and reconstruction with clean instruments can prevent the tumor from recurrence and metastases related to inadequate surgical treatment or iatrogenic seeding. The excision of underlying Tenon capsule in bulbar CM is widely performed， and lamellar scleral dissection is suggested if the Tenon capsule is involved or scleral adhesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In our case， the underlying Tenon capsule was not involved， so we did not perform lamellar scleral dissection.\n\n【13】Different from bulbar conjunctiva， which isloosely attached to the sclera by the Tenon capsule， the palpebral conjunctiva adheres firmly to the tarsus. In palpebral CM， posterior lamellar eyelid resection is often conducted. The defect of tarsus and conjunctiva can be repaired by the Hughes technique or nasal cartilage with mucous membrane通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Some may excise the conjunctival lesion only with tarsus sparing to preserve the eyelid function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. If the lesions extend onto the eyelid margin or skin， a full thickness eyelid resection is required. In our case， the melanoma invaded both bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva with eyelid margin sparing. We excised the posterior lamellar of eyelid， namely the conjunctiva and the full-thickness of tarsus underneath the palpebral CM， and performed the superficial lamellar tarsal excision at the eyelid margin， leaving hemi-depth of residual tarsus to preserve the normal eyelid contour. The surgical technique in this patient created a larger safety margin than total-tarsus-sparing procedure and was much simpler in reconstruction compared with conventional posterior lamellar evelid resection due to no need of grafting. A good functional and aesthetic outcome was achieved with no tumor recurrence in 35-month follow-up.\n\n【14】Post-operative adjuvant therapy is also important in treating conjunctival melanoma. Topical chemotherapy such as mitomycin C is widely used. There is no recommended dose and treatment cycle duration， but the convention is 0.04% mitomycin C four times a day for 1 to 3 weeks， followed by 1-week rest or topical steroids通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In addition to mitomycin C， others use interferon alpha-2B as an alternative due to its fewer adverse events. Brachytherapy is another adjuvant treatment and has effects on sclera， deeper than the topical mitomycin C. For extensive tumors， proton radiotherapy is used after excision and conjunctival mapping if patients refuse exenteration. At present， no effective systemic treatment is available for CM. Recent studies reported benefits of immunotherapy of CM using checkpoint inhibitors (like nivolumab or pembrolizumab)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In view ofthe high similaritybetween cutaneous melanoma and conjunctival melanoma， the efficacies of BRAF/MEK inhibitors are also being evaluated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. We prescribed 0.02% mitomycin C three times daily instead of 0.04%regarding that higher dose was related to limbal stem cell failure in some cases. Our patient went through topical chemotherapy well and showed no melanoma recurrence in the following 35 months.\n\n【15】For CM， prognostic factors include tumor location， tumor thickness， andits origin and histopathology findings. Bulbar melanoma’s outcome is better than those involving other sites， like limbus， cornea， fornix， palpebral conjunctiva and caruncle. Tumors\n\n【16】\\>2 mm thick (as measured from epithelial surface to the substantia propria involved) have higher stagings and poorer prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. De novo melanoma develops metastasis and mortality worse than those arising from nevi or PAM with atypia. Histopathology involving epithelioid cells， pagetoid growth， absence of inflammatory response and lymphatic invasion are associated with a poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In our present case， the tumor was located at palpebral conjunctiva， which is a site with unfavorable outcome. The pathology with pagetoid growth is also associated with poorer prognosis. Apart from the above conditions， our patient's tumor originated from PAM and was <2 mm thick， both of which are associated with a better outcome.\n\n【17】Very few case reports and series of CM are available for Chinese and other Asians. Compared to Caucasians， Chinese patients tend to have poorer prognosis with the younger population， with more cases of de novo origin， or located at the non-bulbar area， showing multifocal lesions， more metastases and tumor related deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Another study on Asian Indians showed the same trend of younger patients， more de novo in origin， and metastasis rate higher than Caucasians， but with fewer local recurrences and more incidents of bulbar melanoma \\[151.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】CM in Chinese is found more often in the non-bulbar area with poorer prognosis compared with Caucasians. There are very few studies on the treatment and reconstruction of palpebral CM. We here reported a new and simple surgical technique that achieved good disease control without grafting and donor site wound， as well as desirable cosmetic results. More cases and longer follow-up periods are needed to assess long-term outcomes.\n\n【20】Ethical Approval Statement\n\n【21】All procedures performed in studies involving human participant were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.

There was a decline in pain and a rise in function in all evaluations.\n\n【3】Conclusion： The results of the present trial suggest that a course of 448 kHz CRMRF as described in the present trial can produce significant improvements in terms of pain and disability in acute LET.\n\n【4】Keywords： Lateral elbow tendinopathy； 448 kHz capacitive resistive monopolar radiofrequency； Tennis elbow； Lateral epicondylitis； Indiba\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Lateral Elbow Tendinopathy (LET) commonly referred to as lateral epicondylitis or tennis elbow is the most common tendinopathy in the elbow area. Pain and decreased function are the main symptoms of LET 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Diagnosis is simple. The symptoms are reproduced by 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> gripping activities； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> palpation on the site of pain (facet of the lateral epicondyle)； 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> clinical tests such as resisted middle-finger extension and/or cozen's test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【7】The management of LET is usually conservative. A plethora of physiotherapy techniques have been recommended for the management of LET. The effectiveness of the recommended physiotherapy modalities have been investigated in chronic LET. Chronic LET is degenerative or failed healing tendon response rather than inflammatory 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. To our knowledge， there have been no studies to find out the effectiveness of physiotherapy modalities in acute LET. More recently， physiotherapists are able to use a new modality called 448 kHz Capacitive Resistive Monopolar Radiofrequency (CRMRF). However， the evidence of the 448 kHz CRMRF in the management of LET， acute or chronic， is minimal. Therefore， the objective of the present report is to find out the effect of 448 kHz CRMRF in acute LET.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】Mr. J.， a 46- year-old male complained of acute pain (less than 48 hours) in the lateral aspect of his left elbow， of his dominant hand. The pain was on the facet of the lateral epicondyle. He lifted up a suitcase about 48 hrs ago. He experienced pain immediately. Since then， he complained of constant pain. He was not able to sleep. He did not receive any NSAIDs. He did not have any other symptoms or any problems in peripheral joints or in the spine. In the Cozen’s test (extension of the wrist with the elbow in extension) the power was 1 on the Oxford scale and there was pain over the facet of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus， 9/10 on the VAS. Resisted extension of the middle finger was painful (9/10 on the VAS) on the facet and the power was 1 on the Oxford scale. The reported pain of the patient in the handgrip dynamometer test was 9/10 on the VAS. All the other movements (passive， active and under resistance movements of the elbow， wrist and neck) were pain free， with full range of motion and strength. Finally， the pain was reproduced by palpation over\n\n【10】Table 1： Pain， function， pain-free grip strength and PRTEE questionnaire over the 24 h before each evaluation.\n\n|  | Pain (cm)  | Function (cm)  | Pain-free grip strength (lb)  | PRTEE questionnaire  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Before treatment  | 9  | 1  | 15  | 96  |\n| After treatment  | 2  | 7  | 52  | 18  |\n\n【12】the common extensor tendon on the facet of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus.\n\n【13】The patient received 448kHz CRMRF intervention. The CRMRF at 448 kHz was delivered using INDIBA Activ 902， a new factory calibrated device with a peak power of 200 W， which delivered continuous-wave RF energy in two modes： Capacitive (CAP) and Resistive (RES)， using metallic electrodes via a coupling medium. The CAP mode was delivered in thermal dose (according to patient feedback on his perception of moderate heating) in muscles around the elbow (biceps， triceps， extensor muscles of wrist). CAP mode was delivered 5 minutes for each muscle. The RES mode was delivered in non-thermal dose (inflammatory stage) to the more symptomatic area. The RES mode was delivered for 10 minutes. Finally， CAP mode in non-thermal dose was delivered in the symptomatic area for 5 minutes. The return electrode was placed in the scapular area. Treatment was delivered twice a day (morning and afternoon)for five consecutive days providing ten sessions in total.\n\n【14】Function and pain were measured in the present study. The patient was evaluated before and after the treatment period. Pain and function were measured on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)， a valid and sensitive approach of the LET 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In addition， pain-free grip strength was used to measure function as described in previous trial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Finally， pain and function were measured using the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE). The PRTEE questionnaire， provides a very quick (it takes less than 5 min to complete)， easy， and standardized quantitative description of pain and functional disability in patients with LET. It has been translated and culturally adapted into Greek 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】Pain on VAS was 9， function on VAS was 1， pain-free grip strength was 15lb and the score of the PRTEE questionnaire was 96 at the initial evaluation. At the end of the treatment (session 10)， there was a decline in pain on VAS of 7 units，a rise in function on VAS of 6units， a rise in pain-free grip strength of 37 units and a decline in the score of the PRTEE questionnaire of 78 units .\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】The present case report has looked at the effect of 448 kHz CRMRF in a patient experiencing acute LET and its findings have demonstrated significant improvements in terms of pain and disability. The results obtained from this case report are novel； as to date，similar studies have not been conducted.\n\n【19】The most common physiotherapy treatment for LET is a supervised or in clinic exercise program 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6\\]</u>. However， the patient with acute LET was not able to perform an exercise program due to pain. The patient was advised by the clinician to follow an exercise program after completing the 448 kHz CRMRF treatment.\n\n448 kHz CRMRF is a relatively new treatment approach， but it is reported to be used by clinicians worldwide. Many clinicians think that Shortwave Diathermy (SWT) and 448 kHz CRMRF is the same. However， the 448 kHz CRMRF differs from SWT mainly in two|删除段之间换行|ways - firstly the operating frequency (SWT commonly operates at27.12 MHz) and secondly， unlike SWT it is applied using a coupling medium since CRMRF cannot be delivered through air 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Hence， one hypothesized advantage of 448 kHz CRMRF over SWT is that scattering of the RF waves is potentially considerably lower 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Since pain reliefand improvements in function were noted in the present case study on a short term， it is proposed that the 448 kHz CRMRF energy may potentially have promoted an anti-inflammatory effect in the soft tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However， to understand the potential changes to the tissues in response to 448 kHz CRMRF treatment， future studies should consider employing outcome assessments that are capable of monitoring the changes in deeper tissues.\n\n【22】The present case study was the first report to examine the effectiveness of 448 kHz CRMRF on acute LET. One previous study assessed the effectiveness of this treatment on chronic knee osteoarthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However， LET and knee osteoarthritis are two different conditions and the results are not comparable. The two previously reported trials found that a course of 448 kHz CRMRF may improve patients’symptoms. The findings of these two trials encourage the design of future well-designed RCTs that might produce strong evidence for the effectiveness of 448 kHz CRMRF on sports/musculoskeletal injuries.\n\n【23】A course of 448 kHz CRMRF treatment was applied in the present study based on manufacturers'claims. It is a dose-response modality and the optimal treatment dose has obviously not yet been discovered. Future studies are needed to standardize 448 kHz CRMRF parameters in the management of LET (acute， chronic and calcific).\n\n【24】Although the positive effects of such a treatment approach in acute LET have been reported in the present study， its study design limits the generalization of these results. Future well-designed trials are needed to confirm the results of this case report establishing the effectiveness of such a treatment approach in the management of LET (acute， chronic and calcific). In addition， structural changes in the tendons related to the treatment interventions are needed to investigate. Further research is needed to establish the cost-effectiveness of such treatment，because reduced cost is an important issue for the recommendation of any given treatment and the possible mechanism of action of this treatment approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\n【26】A course of 448 kHz CRMRFtreatment had reduced the pain and improved the function in a patient with acute LET at the end of the treatment. Further well-designed trials to confirm the results of the present case study are needed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

POEMS syndrome has evolved， redefining its diagnosis criteria which includes mandatory criteria， major criteria and minor criteria. Mandatory criteria include polyneuropathy， usually demyelinating， and monoclonal plasma cell-proliferative disorder. Major criteria， includes Castleman's disease， sclerotic bone lesions， vascular endothelial growth factor elevation， at least one is required. Minor criteria include organomegaly， extravascular volume overload， endocrinopathy (other than hypothyroidism)， skin changes， papilledema， thrombocytosis/polycythemia， along with other symptoms which are none specific clubbing， weight loss， hyperhidrosis， pulmonary hypertension， thrombotic diatheses， diarrhea， low vitamin B12 values 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Ten-year survival is 79% which can vary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， in a Mayo Clinic series during 2003， overall median survival was of 13.7 years， being a bit lower in patients with clubbing or extravascular volume overload having a median survival of 2.6 and 6.6 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. The relationship between amyloidosis with cardiac involvement and POEMS syndrome has not been well established in terms ofprognosis， considering POEMs syndrome has a good prognosis with adequate treatment compared to those patients with cardiac amyloidosis， for this reason we would like to share the following clinical case.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nWe present the case ofa 65-year-old male patient who came to our hospital startinghis condition2 years prior to his visit with hair loss， constipation， dry skin， fatigue， and difficulty speaking； being valued by various doctors without reaching a diagnosis. Six months after the onset of the symptoms of the previous ones， the patient presented dysphonia， and dysphagia to solid foods， weight loss of3 kg (unintended)， paresthesias and dysesthesias in the lower extremities； therefore， a diagnostic protocol was started. Physical examination reveals macroglosia ， left cervical lymph node movable and painless 2 cm around area IV of the neck， maculopapular hyperpigmented skin lesions in thorax， holosystolic tricuspid murmur 4/6， ungeal lesion with trachyonychia on both hands ， and lower extremities with pitting edema accompanied with decreased vibratory sensation. Contemplating the manifestations amyloidosis was suspected and periumbilical biopsy|删除段之间换行|was done reporting collagenous homogenous fiber interlaced with|删除段之间换行|fibroblasts staining orange red with red Congo stain making the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Laboratory evaluation revealed a light chain in urine with kappa spike predominance of 290.94 mg/L (0.01 mg/dL to 33 mg/dL)， lambda of 10.89 mg/L (0.45 mg/dL to 4.9 mg/dL)， a kappa/Lambda relation of 26.7， a beta 2 microglobulin of 2195 ng/mL (609 ng/mL to 2366 ng/mL)， a vascular endothelial grow factor of 310.6 pg/mL (31 pg/mL to 86 pg/mL) and N-terminal cerebral natriuretic pro-peptide of 4686 pg/mL. Although hypothyroidism is common in amyloidosis and a thyrotropin (TSH) blood test was obtained reporting TSH of 8.3 IU/mL， rest of profile was normal diagnosing subclinic hypothyroidism. A complete hormonal profile was requested that report hypogonadism with total testosterone of101 ng/dL (181 ng/dL to 772 ng/dL)， a dehydroepiandrosterone of12.1 ug/dL (228 ug/dL to 283 ug/dL)； what allowed us to integrate POEMS syndrome. Due to the data found in the histopathological study of the periumbilical fat， an echocardiogram was performed that reported infiltrative myocardiopathy in racemic grapefruit pattern suggestive of Amyloid infiltration， ventricular hypertrophy， systolic ejection fraction 50%， diastolic dysfunction with restricted pattern， moderate mitral insufficiency， severe tricuspidinsufficiency，moderate pulmonary hypertension PSAP 60 mmHg， biatrial dilatation without thrombi. After these findings N-terminal cerebral natriuretic pro-peptide (NT-Pro-BNP) was obtained reporting a value of 4，686 pg/mL(<900pg/mL)， confirming poor prognosis associated with cardiac involvement. Due to the symptoms that the patient reported in the extremities and the alterations found in the physical examination， an electromyography was performed that reported mixed predominance polyneuropathy with axonal demyelinating damage. And due to the gastrointestinal symptoms， an endoscopy was obtained with a report|删除段之间换行|of chronic esophagitis， alterations in motility due to amyloidosis and chronic duodenitis. Finally， as part of the diagnostic protocol， a complete bone series that did not have osteosclerotic changes， ruling out damage at this level.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Since amyloidosis or POEMS syndrome are treated in a similar manner， identifying coexistence between these two entities doesn't see of significant importance and it basically speaks of the presence of a chronic inflammatory process generated mainly by interleukin-6that has been detected present in the germinal centers of the lymph nodes. For the above the treatment is usually started with melphalan plus dexamethasone o bortezomib when there is a monoclonal peak， which is accompanied bythe presenceofremission ofpolyneuropathy， macroglossia and skin lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In the case of our patient with cardiac amyloidosis and POEM syndrome， we asked ourselves whether the coexistence of both pathologies had an association linked to a better prognosis， fin ding only that the survival reported in these cases is usually 79% at 10 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In POEMS syndrome， skin findings (hyperpigmentation， hemangiomas， hypertrichosis， redness， acrocyanosis， white nails， facial atrophy or clubbing) are frequent， so there should be a thorough examination when this entity is suspected， as in the case presented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A Mayo Clinic prognostic model involving NT-pro-BNP plus cardiac troponin has been established in patients with cardiac amyloidosis， where a 5-year survival rate ranges from 8% to 28%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> compared to a rate of 13.7-year overall survival in patients with POEMS Syndrome； however， in the case of our patient， the elevated levels of NT-pro-BNP in isolation confer a poor prognosis of cardiac function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. Cardiac involvement is rarely seen in POEMS syndrome， but it is seen more frequently in the development of amyloidosis， although the most affected organ is the kidney； it usually presents as a restrictive heart disease with predominantly septal concentric ventricular hypertrophy， as reported in the echocardiogram of our patient， and arrhythmias are usually present in up to 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. Some authors have suggested cardiomyopathy as a manifestation of organomegaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-12\\]</u>， which should raise the argument in designing new therapeutic strategies. Tanus T and Miller HJ reported a case of POEMS syndrome and cardiac involvement showing resolution of cardiomyopathy after chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. This result implies a change in prognosis among patients with cardiac amylosis and POEMS syndrome. It is possible to infer that those patients with POEMS syndrome along with cardiac involvement due to amyloidosis may have a better prognosis compared with amyloidosis without POEMS syndrome通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14-16\\]</u>. A case series could further clarify this prognosis， probably changing the panorama. A series of cases could further clarify this prognosis， probably changing the panorama， without forgetting that by modifying the inflammatory state of the organism， the presence of Amyloid tends to decrease. In our patient's case， the fact that he does not present sclerotic lesions or disseminated bone marrow is a good prognostic data， although in the literature they are described as one of the most characteristic findings ofPOEMS syndrome.\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\nWe consider that the case presented is representative of the affectation of both pathologies， in a patient who began with very general symptoms where the physical examination was a fundamental pillar for the suspicion of the entities involved， which was corroborated by the complementary studies； in the case of the patient， the presence of both pathologies could be demonstrated，on|删除段之间换行|the one hand， with myocardial infiltration and positive Congo red staining， and on the other， meeting the diagnostic criteria， which represented a benefit for patient follow-up.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

To date， more than 80 genes have been identified as causative of autosomal dominant， autosomal recessive， and X-linked forms of HSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， and the scenario is still incomplete. HSPs can be clinicaly grouped into uncomplicated (or pure) when spasticity is the only clinical finding， and complicated (or complex) when other clinical features (intellectual disability， dementia， cerebellar ataxia， epilepsy， peripheral neuropathy， extrapyramidal signs， amyotrophy， deafness， or optic neuropathy) are also present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Mutations in SPAST/SPG4 are the single commonest cause of autosomal dominant HSPs， accounting for up to 40% of familiar cases and up to 6% to 15% of apparently sporadic forms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>. SPAST gene encodes Spastin， a member of the AAA (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) family of proteins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Spastin interact with microtubules， and contributes to membrane modeling， and intracellular and axonal transport of vesicles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. To date， 159 SPAST variations have been reported . Spastin mutations are|删除段之间换行|usually associated with a pure or uncomplicated phenotype， even though complex forms of HSP have been described for specific SPG4mutations. We report a detailed phenotype characterization of a new SPAST mutation identified in the index case of a 5-generation family showing an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.\n\n【8】Materials and Methods\n\n【9】Clinical and paraclinical assessment\n\n【10】Patient was assessed and followed-up at the Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases and the Aging Brain， University of Bari“Aldo Moro”-A.O. Pia Fondazione Cardinale G. Panico， Tricase(LE)， Italy. He underwent a detailed clinical assessment， including personal medical history， standard neurological examination， and cognitive evaluation， including the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale(CDR)， the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， and a complete neuropsychological assessment， using a battery of cognitive tests， described already 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. As per diagnostic protocol， patients underwent routine blood biochemical analyses， a high-field (3-Tesla) brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan， motor evoked potentials， and somatosensory evoked potentials. After a written informed consent， a blood sample was also collected for genetic analyses and shipped to the Centre of Molecular Genetics， IRCCS Neuromed， Pozzilli (IS)， Italy. Family pedigree was reconstructed and drawn based on the information collected from the examined patient and his caregiver (wife). No other family members were available for genetic analysis. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the “Azienda Sanitaria Locale， Lecce\". All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.\n\n【11】Genetic analysis\n\n【12】Next generation sequencing (NGS) panel： The NGS analysis was performed using the Seq Cap EZ Choice Enrichment Kits(Hoffmann-La Roche， Basel) on an Illumina MiSeq (San Diego， CA). A full list of genes sequenced is provided in Supplementary Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. All coding exons of the RefSeq transcripts of the genes and 15 base pairs of the flanking introns were targeted. 99% of the coding exons were sequenced with a minimal read depth of 30X. GenomeUp software  was used for data analysis. It provides automated annotation (Best Practices workflows of GATK v4.1 for germline variant calling)， alignment of sequence reads to the reference genome GRCh37/hg19， and selection of potentially pathogenic variants. Direct evaluation of data sequence was performed by the Integrative Genomics Viewer v.2.3. Mutation re-sequencing and segregation analysis were performed by Sanger sequencing ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).\n\n【13】Data analysis and variant interpretation： Variantswere classified as Pathogenic (class 5)， Likely Pathogenic (class 4)， and VoUS (class 3) according to ACMG guidelines for germline variant classification (Richards S； Aziz N； Bale S； Bick D； Das S； Gastier-Foster J； Grody WW； Hegde M； Lyon E； Spector E； ACMG Laboratory Quality Assurance Committee. Standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants： A joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology. Genet Med.2015；17：405-424， doi：10.1038/gim.2015.30.). To this aim， public databases were used (Varsome https：//varsome.com； Gnomad https：//gnomad.broadinstitute.org). In silico analyses of variants were performed using SIFT ， PolyPhen2 ， PROVEAN (http：//provean.jcvi.\n\n【14】org/index.php)， and Mutation Assessor .\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】Case report\n\n【17】A 73-years old Caucasian male came to our attention because of a long history of gait abnormalities started in his fifties. The walking difficulties progressed slowly over the last 20 years and lead to loss of autonomy for the last 2 years， when he started to use a walking aid.For one year he had been also manifesting autonomic involvement with urinary and fecal incontinence. His past medical history was remarkable for a- chronic HBV-related hepatitis， followed by hepatic cirrhosis and hepatic carcinoma， treated with radiotherapy； b-colorectal cancer， diagnosed 2 months before his first appointment with us， and subsequently treated with a bowel surgical resection and chemotherapy. Neurological examination showednmoderate/severe spastic paraparesis，withh moderate proximal weakness of the lower limbs and mild proximal weakness of the upper limbs； asymmetrical mild atrophy of the quadriceps and gluteal muscles (dx > sx)； mild spasticity of the legs (hamstrings， quadriceps， adductors， gastrocnemius， and soleus)； deep tendon reflexes were all brisk both on upper and lower limbs， especially on the right lower limb； Babinski sign was present bilaterally； pinprick sensation was normal， while he had moderate hypopallesthesia， more pronounced in the lower limbs； he also had urinary and fecal incontinence. Neuro-cognitive tests were all in the normal range for his age and education level. Laboratory tests showed low levels of vitamin B12 (154 pg/ml； normal range： 187 pg/ml to 883 pg/ml)， which resulted in a mild macrocytic anemia. Conventional spinal cord MRI showed several posterior disc protrusions at the cervical， thoracic and lumbar levels， with no signs of radiculopathy or spinal cord compression. High field (3-Tesla) brain MRI scan revealed small diffuse hyperintensities of the white matter， suggestive of small vessels disease； moderate subcortical and cortical atrophy， especially of the right frontal and parietal lobes (Global Cortical Atrophy scale：2； Koedam score for parietal atrophy： 2) ， mild left and moderate right hippocampal atrophy (Medial Temporal lobe Atrophy score： 1 - right， 2 - left). Corticospinal tract appeared bilaterally normal. Arterial Spin Labeling identified lower perfusion of the right frontal lobe， than the left one. Nerve conduction study was normal. Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) were normal for the upper limbs， while revealed prolonged central conduction time when registered from both legs. Somatosensory Evoked Potentials(SEPs) were normal from both arms and legs. Genetic analysis identified a new heterozygous deletion NM\\014946：c.\\[1005-1delG\\]\n\n【18】gene. This variant is yet not registered in the following public genetic databases： LOVD . Based on the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics for variants’classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， this variant was classified as pathogenic (Class 4： PVS1-PM2-PP3). Family pedigree  showed an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance， spreading on 5 generations. No other family members were available for neurological examination or genetic analysis.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\nWe reported a novel SPAST variant with a high probability of being pathogenic， considering the type of mutation， its predicted effect using in-silico studies， and its absence in genetic databases of healthy individuals. We also reported a detailed phenotypic characterization of the proband， who presented a classical course of the disease， with insidious onset of walking difficulties， a slow disease progression， and a pure phenotype for a long time period. Impaired vibratory sensations， as well as upper-limb hyperreflexia at the neurological examination have also been described already as typical for SPAST mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The Age of Onset (AO) was around his fifties. This late AO is not typical for autosomal dominant HSPs. A recent meta-analysis by Erfanian Omidvar et al. which included13.570 patients with HSP， reported a mean AO of 24.79 (95% CI21.00-28.58) for SPAST mutations， and even earlier for ATL1(4.53，95% CI 3.09-5.98) and REEP1(17.00， 95%CI 11.18-22.82) mutations通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. However， clinical presentation of HSPs can be extremely heterogeneous， also regarding AO， and a “very late\"AO (>35 years of age) has already been described for SPAST mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>，but is considered rare. In our family pedigree， AO， although late for all the|删除段之间换行|affected members， is really variable， spanning from 30 to 50 years. It is reasonable to consider that other factors (genetic modifiers) may have influenced this phenotypic trait in our family. The proband's phenotype was also characterized by autonomic impairment， with urinary and fecal incontinence， but only after more than 15 years from the onset of symptoms. Autonomic involvement in patients with SPAST mutation has been reported already， especially urinary and sudomotor dysfunctions， probably related to a damage of the peripheral nervous system (small post-ganglionic cholinergic fibers)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Moreover， bladder dysfunction is present in SPAST related HSPs more frequently， compared to other autosomal dominant or recessive HSPs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.Althoughhigh-field brain MRI showed moderate subcortical and cortical atrophy， both global and parietal， the patient did not manifest cognitive impairment. This is in line with previous studies， which showed that cognitive impairment is rarely associated with SPAST mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>， although mild cognitive impairment， especially in the executive and visuo-spatial domains has been reported already 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. SPAST mutations have been previously associated to brain MRI abnormalities， with a predominant involvement of basal ganglia， thalamus， and posterior white matter通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Global reduction of both gray- and white-matter volumes in the brain， as well as corpus callosum volume， cortical thickness， and subcortical gray-matter volume have been also described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. However， a frank diffuse cortical and subcortical atrophy， detectable at the visual assessment， like in our case， was never been described. This can be partly related to the age of the proband， but it is further behind an age-related pattern of atrophy. Unfortunately， no other family members were available for genetic analysis and clinical/paraclinical examination， so we were not able to perform a proper\n\n【21】Supplementary Table 1： Target genes included in our NGS panel.\n\n| Gene  | Ref sequence  | MIM  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| AFG3L2  | NM\\006796  | 604581  |\n| ALS2  | NM 020919  | 606352  |\n| ATL1  | NM 015915  | 606439  |\n| BSCL2  | NM 001122955  | 606158  |\n| CCT5  | NM 001306153  | 610150  |\n| CYP7B1  | NM\\00482  | 603711  |\n| GJC2  | NM\\020435  | 608803  |\n| HSPD1  | NM 199440  | 118190  |\n| KIAA0196  | NM 014846  | 610657  |\n| KIF5A  | NM 004984  | 602821  |\n| KIF3A  | NM\\001300791  | 604683  |\n| L1CAM  | NM 000425  | 308840  |\n| NIPA1  | NM\\144599  | 608145  |\n| PNPLA6  | NM\\001166111  | 603197  |\n| REEP1  | NM\\001164730  | 609139  |\n| SLC33A1  | NM 004733  | 603690  |\n| SPAST  | NM\\014946  | 604277  |\n| SPG11  | NM 025137  | 610844  |\n| SPG20  | NM\\001142296  | 275900  |\n| SPG21  | NM 016630  | 608181  |\n| SPG7  | NM 003119  | 602783  |\n| ZFYVE27  | NM\\001002261  | 610243  |\n| ZFYVE26  | NM\\015346  | 612012  |\n\n【23】segregation analysis and a detailed phenotypic characterization of other mutation carriers.

Gait disturbance was added thereafter， and she became unable to walk without support. Her neurological examination showed limited abduction in her left eye and ataxic gait. Her routine blood tests did not reveal any pathology. Her brain MRI showed hydrocephalus as well as leptomenigeal thickening and contrast enhancement around the brainstem Figure删除4:<u> 1</u>. T2-weighted spinal MR images revealed a diffuse hyperintense area between C2 and C7 in the spinal cord，consistent with edema.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the tumor usually reveals diffuse leptomeningeal contrast enhancement and hydrocephalus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In addition to the above-mentioned conventional MRI findings， our case had diffuse edema affecting a long segment|删除段之间换行|in cervical spinal cord without an intrinsic mass lesion. Increased intracranial pressure due to communicating hydrocephalus is the major clinical finding in DLGNT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. MRI findings are important for diagnosis. Conventional MRI findings of DLGNT are leptomeningeal contrast enhancement especially in the basal cisterns and throughout the spinal cord， which can be confused with tuberculous and other types of meningitis， and accompanying hydrocephalus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. The only specific radiological finding described for this tumor is subpial cysts which can only be seen in some of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It is of interest that various spinal cord lesions are described in DLGNT tumor patients in the literature whereas brain lesions are somewhat the same limited number of lesions. Many radiological findings such as intramedullary predominantly cystic lesion without spinal leptomeningeal contrast enhancement， enhancing intramedullary lobulated mass， small enhancing intramedullarylesions， subpial cysts， and extramedullary nodular lesions were described in the spinal cord通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>. Our case showed diffuse leptomeningeal contrast enhancement which was most prominent in the anterior median fissure and two tiny enhancing extramedullary nodular lesions. In addition to these classical findings， the most striking finding in our case was long segment spinal cord edema exceeding two vertebral bodies although there was no intramedullary tumoral lesion. We suggest that the most appropriate mechanism for the formation of long segment T2-hyperintense lesion is that diffuse leptomeningeal involvement prevents venous return and edema occurs in the spinal cord as a result of increased capillary pressure. In diffuse leptomeningeal involvement， parenchymal infarcts can also be expected due to alteration of the arterial supply. In our patient， diffusion restriction was not observed in the cervical spinal cord in DWI.On the contrary， increased diffusion was observed， so acute and subacute infarctions were ruled out. Another possible mechanism is that DLGNT may have made a diffuse microinvasion into the spinal cord through the perivascular spaces which is difficult to detect with MRI. This could be demonstrated by postmortem pathological examination， but this was not possible in our case. Lesions can be observed in the brain and spinal cord as a result of paraneoplastic effect， however， in this case antibody-mediated damage in myelin and neuronal elements and associated clinical findings are expected. Our patient did not have transverse myelitis findings， which ruled out the aforementioned mechanism.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Our case showed that increased T2 signals can be seen in the spinal cord in DLGNT. Although MR images are suggestive of transverse myelitis， they might be misleading. As in our case， the absence of clinical findings of transverse myelitis in patients with myelitis findings on MRI and diffuse leptomeningeal contrast enhancement should suggest DLGNT.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The lack of recognition of this uncommon complication of herpes zoster， which is easy to diagnose， may lead to the multiplication of complementary studies. The prognosis for this complication is good and usually without sequela. The main characteristics of the syndrome are outlined.\n\n【2】Keywords： Abdominal pseudo hernia； Herpes zoster； Segmental zoster paresis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Herpes zoster is caused by the activation of varicella-zoster virus in the dorsal-root ganglia. The sensory abnormality is a predominant symptom of herpes zoster virus infection， whereas， motor neuropathy， although uncommon， can also occur in this infection. Segmental zoster abdominal paresis is one of the rare motor complications， mimicking an abdominal hernia. But unlike from the real abdominal wall hernia， it needs no surgery. Here， we report a case with an abdominal protrusion， with typical skin lesions due to Herpes zoster (Hz).\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 50-year-old woman presented with pain on the right side of her lower abdomen for three days， sometimes radiating to the right lumbar fossa. She noticed abnormal swelling on the right side of her abdomen， with hyperesthesia. She had a history of thyroid cancer with surgery in 2020. The patient had no other comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus or hernias. One month earlier， she had received her second injection of SPIKEVAX vaccine against COVID-19. The examination in the supine position  triggered a pain with pressure on the McBurney point. On standing examination， a prominent bulge 10 cm to 15 cm in diameter was present on the right side of the abdomen . The area was hyperesthetic to the touch. Abdominal reflexes were absent on the right side. Skin examination showed a papular， erythematous lesion in the right lumbar region， suggestive of herpes zoster. Treatment with valaciclovir and pregabalin was initiated. Routine laboratory tests were normal， and HIV serology was negative. An abdominal CT scan was performed， which showed no evidence of a Spigelian hernia in the right anterolateral abdominal wall. Thoracic and lumbar MRI showed no lesions in the anterior horn of the spinal cord.\n\n【7】Discussion/Conclusion\n\nIn 1895， Taylor described for the first time a segmental abdominal zoster paresis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Since then， only a few similar cases have been described. Herpes zoster mainly affects the sensory nervous system and motor deficits are uncommon and mainly involve the muscles of the head. Abdominal pseudohernia due to segmental denervation is rare， probably because of overlapping innervation. The pathogenesis is thought to be due to a direct viral infection spreading from the dorsal root ganglion to the cells of the anterior horn. Abdominal wall paralysis can be caused by a variety of conditions affecting the peripheral nerves that innervate the abdominal muscles， including Hz， diabetes， lumbar disc herniation or spinal cord injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In1972， Thomas recorded 1，210 patients with a diagnosis of Hz \\[31.Of these patients， only 61 had segmental zoster paresis， most of them with cephalic zoster. Weakness of the abdominal muscles was noted in only two patients (0.2%). In a review by Chernev 36 individual cases were identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Usually， the herpetic rash preceded the development of pseudohernia with a mean delay of 3.5 weeks. Of|删除段之间换行|the 36 patients， 23 had a complete recovery， with a mean time of4.9 months and a maximum of one year. It should be kept in mind that this rare complication of herpes zoster has a good prognosis， and usually recovers without sequela； therefore， physicians should reassure the patient， limit further studies， and avoid unnecessary surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Once they reach the natural sinus ostium they may protrude to the nasal meatus. Usually， the growth of antrochoanal polyps causes a destruction of a medial wall of a maxillary sinus. As a consequence， an additional ostium of a maxillary sinus develops and a polypoid mass may be found in a nasal cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Most common symptoms are unilateral nasal obstruction， rhinorrhea， nasal bleeding， dyspnea， dysphagia， obstructive sleep apnea， nasal speech and even cachexia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Antrochoanal polyps represent 4% to 6% of all nasal polyps and usually respond well to a surgical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Although benign， these lesions may sometimes be taken for malignant tumors due to their unusual presentation. In this report we present a case of an unusuallylarge antrochoanal polyp which was mistaken for a nasal carcinoma. A false diagnosis despite findings suggesting an opposite and eventuallyleading to a different treatment plan is an example of an anchoring bias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\nA 52-year-old Caucasian women was seen in a Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic of the National Institute of Oncology in Warsaw with a six-month history of a left-sided nasal obstruction. Other symptoms reported were rhinorrhea， odynophagia， nasal speech，left-sided headache and cachexia. Her past medical history was not significant for tobacco use. On examination with a nasal speculum a fragile soft-tissue large polypoid mass in the left nasal cavity was found. It was causing nasal septum deviation and an enlargement of a left nasal cavity. On pharyngoscopy it was noticed that the mass was hanging from the nasopharynx to the meso-pharynxlevel. Nasal endoscopy revealed a mass coming from the left nasal cavity passing to the nasopharynx and partially oropharynx . A computed tomography showed a large hypo-attenuating mass filling the left nasal cavity， left maxillary sinus， left frontal sinus and sphenoid sinus what is presented on Figure删除4:<u> 2</u>. A marginal bone destruction was seen but no regional metastases were noticed. Histopathological findings of several biopsies conducted during fiberoscopy revealed inflammatory cells and fibrosis. Subsequently，|删除段之间换行|the procedure of the open biopsy under general anesthesia was performed as the previous histopathological results were uncertain. Due to the strong suspicion of a cancerous diagnosis as well as the bone destruction displayed on CT scan， an access through a lateral rhinotomy was used. Once the intranasal component of the mass was removed， the contents of a maxillary sinus were excised through the sinus ostium. Following this， the nasopharyngeal portion of the mass was excised through the oral cavity access. Once a homeostasis was achieved， a nasal pack consisting of cotton gauze was placed in the nasal cavity and removed two days after the surgery. Histological results of a sample examined postoperatively supported the diagnosis of antrochoanal polyp instead of a nasal carcinoma. Four days after the procedure there was a wound infection as well as nasal bleeding occurred. The patient was given antibiotics and the bleeding stopped as the nasal tamponade was made. Subsequently， the patient was discharged home on the seventh day after the procedure without nasal packing and with antibiotic regimen to proceed with a couple of days after the discharge. Eventually， the patient's recovery was satisfactory as she experienced a relief of her nasal obstruction.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\nAnchoring bias refers to physician tendency to prioritize medical findings that support their initial diagnosis although the first impression is wrong. Similarly， a confirmation bias occurs once a medical practitioner refuses to take alternative diagnoses into consideration when the first diagnosis is already made despite|删除段之间换行|contradicting data. The presented case is an example of an anchoring bias which led to the incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate treatment plan. The Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) remains a gold standard procedure of nasal polyps and should have been considered as a first line treatment. Nevertheless， this patient underwent a lateral rhinotomy as the suspicion of a cancerous diagnosis was almost certain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Some of the patient’s symptoms such as one-sided nasal mass， nasal bleeding and cachexia caused by dysphagia were those incentives that resulted in performing an open biopsy instead of an endoscopic surgery at first. Although rare， nasal polyps may easily mimic cancerous nasal tumors especially when they are large. While characteristic for malignant tumors a marginal bone destruction is also common for ACP. In this case scenario in addition to the CT scan other investigations such as PET scan or MRI should have been performed. Those steps would have probably ruled out a cancerous origin of a tumor and would have pointed to a correct diagnosis.\n\n【10】Frosini et al. indicate that ACP may sometimes display pseudosarcomatous features and maylead to weight loss and cachexia. It should also be distinguished from other bone destroying tumors such as lymphoma， rhabdomyosarcoma or Wegener granulomatosis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. It seems that dealing with malignant tumors on a daily basis keeps the doctors alert but it can also rarely cause a false assumption. Steps must be taken to avoid this way of thinking as maintaining one's in itial impression despite evidence pointing to a different disease increases a risk of unnecessary procedures and patient’s complications as well An algorithm of detailed physical exam followed by endoscopic exam and CT scan together with MRI or PET scan should be performed always when there is a suspicion of malignancy. In this case several non-diagnostic biopsies of the nasal tumor and the lack of PET scan or MRI due to the strong conviction of malignancy based on CT scan have eventually resulted in the open biopsy procedure although endoscopic surgery is the first line treatment. Scheduling this patient to the open biopsy procedure put her in the risk of suffering from serious complications such as bleeding， face deformation and wound infection as well. It appears obvious that if the above-mentioned tests had been conducted the patient health would have not been jeopardized.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】While nasal polyps are quite common and benign findings， antrochoanal polyps account for only 4% to 6% of them. FESS remains a gold standard treatment of nasal polyps. However， bone destruction， nasal bleeding and cachexia caused by large masses in nasal cavities may suggest a cancerous origin of a tumor. A detailed assessment including physical exam， endoscopic exam and PET scan or at least MRI should be performed to dispel doubts about the origin ofa tumor. Sticking to an initial diagnosis despite findings pointing to a different disease may lead to the unnecessary procedures associated with severe complications.

The patient also has chronic systolic heart failure with an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD). Further history was remarkable for positive myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) at|删除段之间换行|invalving inflammatory thickening of the dura mater .\n\n【4】the time of his initial anti-GBM diagnosis. Both ANCA and anti-GBM titers have since been undetectable and there have been no reported symptoms of recrudescent disease. He was not on maintenance immunosuppressive therapy as he remained dialysis dependent and was otherwise asymptomatic.\n\n【5】For the last two months or so the patient has been experiencing progressive vision changes leading to intermittent vision loss which he describes as a gradual dimming and seeing dark shadows in all visual fields. The patient saw his outpatient ophthalmologist who observed severe bilateral papilledema prompting referral to the emergency department.\n\n【6】Further review of systems revealed approximately 40-pound unintentional weight loss as well as increased fatigue over the last three-to-four months. He denied fever， skin rashes， joint pain， rhinorrhea， sinus pressure， shortness of breath， chest pain， or cough.\n\n【7】Current outpatient medications included amlodipine，carvedilol， valsartan， hydralazine， and calcium acetate. He has been fully compliant with his three times weekly dialysis sessions.\n\n【8】On initial examination， the patient's blood pressure was 170/101mmHg， pulse was 90 beats per minute， oral temperature 98.2 F， and his oxygen saturation was 97% while breathing ambient air. His height was 168cm， weight 82kg， and body-mass index 29kg/m. He appeared mildly uncomfortable but did not exhibit light sensitivity. His pupils were equal， round， and reactive to light bilaterally. Extra ocular movements were intact. He had bilateral papilledema on funduscopic examination. There were no cranial nerve deficits and his visual fields were intact. The remainder of the physical exam was normal. The white blood cell count， hemoglobin， platelet count， electrolytes， liver function， and tests of coagulation were unremarkable for a patient on hemodialysis.\n\n【9】As a consequence of headaches and visual disturbances， imaging of the brain was required. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with venogram was preferred given papilledema however this possibility was excluded due to the patient’s ICD. Instead，computed tomography(CT) of the brain was obtained with CT venogram which revealed dural thickening concerning for hypertrophic pachymeningitis with diminished caliber of the superior sagittal and straight sinuses. Lumbar puncture revealed elevated opening pressure of 38cm H，0， 10 WBC/uL， 3401 RBC/uL， protein 137 mg/dL， and glucose64 mg/dL. He experienced temporary symptomatic improvement on acetazolamide while further work-up was pending. Extensive CSF studies including gram stain with culture， cytology， acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear， rapid plasma reagin， cryptococcal antigen， and angiotensin converting enzyme were negative. Serum anti-nuclear antibody and ANCA titers were negative as were blood cultures， serum AFB， and HIV.\n\n【10】The first several days ofhospitalization were spent obtaining these results and the patient'sheadache was temporized with acetazolamide with diminishing efficacy. The hypertrophic pachymeningitis onbrain imaging includes a wide differential diagnosis such as sarcoidosis， syphilis， lymphoma， subarachnoid hemorrhage， tuberculosis， and S， ANCA vasculitis. Given the wide spectrum of possible etiologies with unrevealing work-up， and potential detriment from treatment if the wrong diagnosis was pursued， a dural biopsy was performed. Our neurosurgical colleagues remarked that the patient’s dura was 3-4times normal thickness and grossly granulomatous in appearance. Pathologic examination revealed necrotizing vasculitis involving the small vessels with granulomatous inflammation concerning for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) . The patient was started on IV steroids，plasmapheresis， and rituximab. He experienced symptomatic improvement of his headaches and vision changes shortly thereafter.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\nInflammation of the central nervous system is a rare but documented manifestation of GPA. In two case series from the1990's， meningitis was observed in two out of a combined total of482 patients (0.4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. A review from 2006 found 46 additional cases， three of which appeared to have isolated dural involvement通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Demographics data from this review shows a male/female ratio of 1.13， with mean age at diagnosis of 48.2±15 years. The mean time between symptom onset and diagnosis of meningitis varied widely and was about 35 ±60 months with a range between 0-240 months. Thirty-seven of these 48 cases included detailed clinical information with most common symptoms being headache and cranial nerve|删除段之间换行|palsies usually in the absence of meningeal signs. About two thirds of patients had positive serum ANCA at the time of diagnosis of meningeal involvement. Twenty-six patients underwent meningeal biopsy with the most common histopathologic finding being necrotizing granulomatosis without vasculitis (62%). Approximately15% of patients had both necrotizing granulomatosis and small vessel vasculitis as with our case.\n\n【13】Hypertrophic pachymeningitis is a rare condition involving inflammatory thickening of the dura mater which may lead to signs of increased intracranial pressure or cranial nerve palsies. MRI is the diagnostic modality of choice to identify meningeal thickening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. CT scan has limited sensitivity but can still be of diagnostic utility as in this case. Two patterns of hypertrophic pachymeningitis have been described： diffuse and focal， which has led to postulation of disease mechanisms. The focal form has a predilection to the paranasal and periorbital regions which may be a result of direct extension of granulomatous inflammation from the nasal cavities reaching the meninges. The more diffuse form， as in our patient， may represent a primary presentation or recrudescence of the disease but is poorly understood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，5\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Another interesting feature of this case is the original anti-GBM diagnosis eight months prior to this presentation. This case illustrates an example of anti-GBM disease with MPO positive ANCA which is a disease entity associated with worse renal prognosis than anti-GBM disease or ANCA vasculitis alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Clinicians should consider maintenance therapy in these patients even if ANCA titers turn negative， as negative titers do not prove dormancy of underlying vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Conclusions\n\n【16】Hypertrophic pachymeningitis is a rare phenomenon can be caused by GPA. Prompt recognition and treatment of increased intracranial pressure is essential to avoid vision loss and life-threatening complications. Typically， there are systemic manifestations of disease recrudescence， often times including more accessible tissue for biopsy. If that is not the case， a dural sample may be necessary to facilitate definitive and prompt diagnosis thus guiding therapy.

Known allergies or systemic problems to the child were not present. Patient’s behavior was definitely negative as per Frankl behavior rating scale. Dental trauma was caused by a fall on ground while playing about 4 months earlier. Lip or soft tissue lacerations or evidence of alveolar bone fracture was not found.

In fact， SARS-CoV-2 can be a trigger factor for the VAA.\n\n【2】Keywords： Acute kidney injury； Glomerulonephritis； Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis； COVID-19\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA) -Associated Vasculitis (AAV) are a group of small vessel vasculitides characterized by granulomatous and neutrophilic tissue inflammation， often associated with the production of antibodies that target neutrophil antigens. The two major antigens targeted by ANCAs are leukocyte Proteinase 3 (PR3) and Myeloperoxidase (MPO) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【5】It is a disorder that affects predominantly small- and medium-sized arteries and has similar features on kidney histology \\[e.g.， a focal necrotizing， often crescentic， pauci-immune Glomerulonephritis (GN) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【6】The biological mechanisms underpinning this autoimmune disease are not entirely known， but research points to a combination of genetics and environmental factors， such as exposure to pollutants， drugs， and microbial infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【7】In some instances， the diagnosis is difficult， and if the degree of organ disorder is severe， the disease becomes refractory and is associated with a poor prognosis.\n\n【8】Only a few cases of AAV after Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) have been reported. We herein report a case of Myeloperoxidase Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (MPO-ANCA) associated vasculitis following COVID-19 infection.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A-54-year-old women， with a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. She was vaccinated against COVID-19 with an RNA vaccine， a single dose on June删除4:<u> 2021</u>.\n\n【11】On July 2021， she had COVID-19 pneumonia with 97 umol/1serum creatinine level. She had several antibiotics (initially cefotaximeandlevofloxacin then amoxicillin and clavulanic acid then ciprofloxacin)； she had CT scan of the chest with contrast.\n\n【12】Afterwards the patient presented with deterioration in her general condition with prolonged fever. The biological analyzes showed a severe acute renal injury with 606 umol/l serum creatinine level， anemia (hemoglobin =6 g/dl)， absence of leukocyte or red blood cells on Cytobacteriological Examination of Urine (CBEU)， 24-h proteinuria was 0.7 g/24 h with a diuresis of 1500 ml/24 h. She was thus admitted to the nephrology department.\n\n【13】Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) with conserved diuresis was suspected given the context and the renal presentation. Ten days later， the patient's renal function worsened even more with creatinine reaching 1011 umol/l but still without hematuria on CBEU. So an immunological investigations and renal biopsy was performed. MPO ANCA was positive and the renal biopsy showed showing severe glomerular and tubulointerstitial damages . The glomeruli contained extracapillary proliferation . Necrotic cells were observed within tubes lumen . Edematous changes associated with an abundant and acute inflammatory infiltrate within the interstitium were found .\n\n【14】The patient had an intra alveolar hemorrhage confirmed by the chest CT scan with respiratory distress and recourse to mechanical ventilation and the need for several hemodialysis sessions. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed septal hypokinesia with left ventricular outflow function =35% and myocarditis signs.\n\n【15】Shehad 3boli of 1g of methylprednisolone followed by prednisone1 mg/kg/d，6boli of cyclophosphamide and 7 plasmapheresis sessions as induction treatment and 10 mg of prednisone with azathioprine as maintenance treatment.\n\nThe evolution was marked by clinical and biological improvement|删除段之间换行|with a creatinine at 120 umol/l， improvement in transthoracic echocardiogram signs.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Autoantibody (ANCA)-Associated Vasculitis (AAV) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and damage to small blood vessels. It’s a systemic disease affecting several organs. Renal damage is frequent and can lead to permanent loss of kidney function. It is most often a rapidly progressive Glomerulonephritis (GN). Histologically， there is a crescentic extra capillary GN without immune deposits in immunofluorescence study (Pauci Immune GN).\n\n【19】The search for ANCA is useful as additional diagnostic criteria for these diseases and has a predictive value since clinical relapses are almost always associated with persistence or associated with the persistence or reappearance of ANCA.\n\n【20】Concerning the COVID-19， as its epidemic continues to expand； many features of this disease are being defined and described in detail. Among these aspects， we define Acute Kidney Injuries (AKI). It has been reported in 36.6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Several Causes of SARS-CoV-2-induced AKI have been reported. It may be a functional AKI， an acute tubular injury requiring renal replacement therapy， thrombotic microangiopathy， vasculitis， or a collapsing glomerulopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>.\n\nAlthough cases of kidney damage due to COVID- 19 have been reported， an association between COVID-19 and crescentic GN has|删除段之间换行|been rarely identified. Only few cases of AAV with COVID-19 have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In our case， the lesions were essentially glomerular with extracapillary proliferations but with the presence of tubular necrosis lesions and interstitial infiltrates. The tubular necrosis lesions may also be related to the nephrotoxicity of the antibiotics which the patienthad.\n\n【22】It has been shown in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 that it may lead to the emergence or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases in genetically susceptible patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Indeed， in a series of 33 patients hospitalized with coronavirus pneumonia， 15 patients (45%) tested positive for at least one autoantibody， including 11 for ANA (33%)， 8 for anti-cardiolipin antibodies (Immunoglobulin (Ig) G and/or IgM；24%) and 3 for anti-B2-glycoprotein antibodies (IgG and/or IgM； 9%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Further，vasculitis such as VVA can be induced bybacterial，fungul， parasitic and mainly viral infections 通用删除7(英):<u>(83)</u>. SARS-CoV-2， such as other virus may constitute a trigger factor for vasculitis and autoimmune diseases. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can potentially lead to an array of autoimmune disorders by molecular mimicry (cross-reacting epitope between the virus and the host)， bystander killing (virus-specific CD8+ T cells migrating to the target tissues and exerting cytotoxicity)， epitope spreading， viral persistence (polyclonal activation due to the constant presence of viral antigens driving immune-mediated injury) and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps NET 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【25】In fact， patients with AAV also have high levels of NETs in the circulation. ANCAs are capable of inducing NETos is in neutrophils， and their ability to do so has been shown to be affinity-depen dent and correlated with disease activity. NETs contain proinflammatory proteins and are thought to contribute to vessel inflammation directly by damaging endothelial cells and by activating the complement system and indirectly by acting as a link between the innate and adaptive immune system through the generation of PR3-and MPO-ANCA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【26】The presence of NETs has been observed on kidney biopsy samples of patients with AAV， and is postulated to be involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>.\n\n【27】It is also possible that the cytokine storm， with the dysregulation of the immune system in a uremic state，led to an altered response to infection， resulting in AAV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【28】According to the literature， 6 cases of AVV after SARS-CoV-2\n\n【29】infection were published 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，16-18\\]</u>. Three patients had positive p-ANCA MPO， 3 patients had c-ANCA PR3. Two patients were presented with severe AKI requiring hemodialysis. Imaging lung involvement showed patchy ground-glass opacities in five cases， bilateral pleural effusion in two cases and， alveolar hemorrhage in one case， and bilateral cavitary lesions in one case. All patients had a kidney biopsy. It showed in all cases crescentic glomerulonephritis. Our patient had positive p-ANCA MPO with severe AKI requiring hemodialysis and alveolar hemorrhage.\n\n【30】The cirrent therapeutic means， particularly the immunosuppressive therapies， have improved both the vital and renal prognosis especially when they are rapidly administered. In our case， the diagnosis was difficult given the absence of hematuria and the context suggestive of acute tubular necrosis at the beginning， hence the delay in diagnosis and management of vasculitis. According to the literature all patients received glucocorticoids； cyclophosphamide was administered in three patients； rituximab in two patients； plasmapheresis in one patient and plasma exchange in one patient通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，16-18\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Our patient hadglucocorticoids，cyclophosphamide and plasmapheresis. She presented a favorable response to treatment. Her kidney function started to improve 2 weeks after starting therapy. These outcomes join the literature data about the management of VAA associated tokidney failure. In fact，theuse of cyclophosphamide is an independent predictor for renal and patient survival presented with ANCA-Associated Vasculitis and Severe Kidney Failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The effect of cyclophosphamide on patient survival emphasizes the importance of assertive immunosuppression in the setting of severe kidney failure even on dialysis.\n\n【32】Concerning the cases reported for VAA after COVID-19， patients presented also improvement for their kidney function after immunosuppression. Serum ANCA levels have been decreased also during the follow-up通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，18\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】Diagnosis and management of ANCA related vasculitis is a big challenge for medical practitioners. The specific treatment of this systematic disease， mainly the immunosuppressive therapy has to be urgently administered so that it does not lead to permanent organ impairments such us the chronic kidney failure. A quick diagnosis raises the chance of better recovery with a minimum of somatic damages.\n\n【35】VAA can be associated to COVID-19. In fact， SARS-CoV-2 can be a trigger factor for the VAA. We should keep in mind that patients who develop an acute kidney injury after COVID-19 can have a crescentic glomerulonephritis in particular ANCA related vasculitis.\n\n【36】In front of any unusual clinical presentation or ulterior evolution， a kidney biopsy has to be performed after an immunological workup. Concerning the management ofVAA， the existing literature revealed favorable outcomes after immunosuppressive therapy.\n\n【37】Patient Perspective\n\n【38】AfterSstartinggeetiopathogenictreatment consisting corticotherapy， cyclophosphamide and plasma exchange， the patient noted a clear improvement in his clinical condition， particularly the respiratory performance and she was so satisfied for the improvement of her renal function and the cessation of hemodialysis sessions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

They are located between the muscular layers of the abdominal wall and can be easily overlooked because of abdominal obesity. Generally， they are difficult to diagnose because of their location and vague symptoms. The diagnosis has been considerably aided by the introduction ofultrasonography and Computed Tomography. Once the diagnosis is made operative management is indicated due to risk of incarceration. We report a 32 years old female patient from who presented with right upper abdominal pain associated with a swelling below the right subcostal margin. A diagnosis of Spigelian hernia and gallbladder stones was made. The patient underwentlaparoscopic mesh repair and cholecystectomy. Her recovery was uneventful.\n\n【2】Keywords： Spigelian hernia； Lateral ventral hernias； Laparoscopic mesh repair\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Spigelian hernia is named after Adrian Van der Spighel who described semilunar like(lineaspigeli) in 1645. The hernia was first described Klinkosch in 1764 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Spigelian hernia is a rare abdominal hernia， occurring through the spigelianaponeurosis， it carries a significant risk of incarceration and strangulation. Most spigelian hernias occur below the level of the umbilicus close to the level of the arcuate line (inferior margin of posterior leaflet of rectus sheath within the abdomen)，though they have being reported to occur above the level of the umbilicus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Diagnosis of Spigelian hernia requires a high degree of suspicion， with the most common finding on clinical examination being a lump at the semilunar line. Radiological tests are useful in confirming the diagnosis. Once diagnosed， Spigelian hernias require operative repair. Elective repair of uncomplicated Spigelian hernias can be performed both laparoscopically and by an open technique， with the former reported to be associated with a lower morbidity and shorter hospital stay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. We present a case of spigelian hernia in a female patient and its management and discuss about the various investigations and the treatment modalities available for its repair， with literature review.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 32 years old female patient presented to the outpatient department with history of intermittent right upper quadrant pain for 8 years. She underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy 2 years ago. On examination， she had a weight of 89 kg with a BMI of 33 kg/m. Physical examination revealed a firm lump of about 6 x 5 cm was found on the right upper abdomen at the margin of the right semilunar line. The lump would increase on coughing and decrease in lying position.\n\n【8】On investigation， haemogram， liver function tests， blood urea and creatinine were normal. Ultrasonography showed multiple gall stones and right hypochondrium anterior abdominal wall defect . CT scan showed the defect of a Spigelian hernia about 3 cm in diameter， containing omentum .\n\n【9】After adequate preparation she was planned for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Intraoperatively， right sided SH was detected. There was also hemangioma on the lower part of the right lobe. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was done and the hernia was managed laparoscopically. Omentum adherent to the defect was reduced. The defect was seen as a large opening in the peritoneum， along the lateral margin of rectus abdomens muscle on the right side . After dissection of the adhesions with the help of Harmonic scalpel，a prosthetic composite mesh (10x10cm) was introduced into the peritoneal cavity and was fixed with the help of tacks to cover the defect. A full laparoscopic exploration of the abdomen was completed without finding other defects. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day删除4:<u> 2</u>.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Spigelian hernia constitute about 0.12 to 0.2% of all abdominal hernias usually found between 50-60 years， affecting both sides and both sexes equally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In 2002， Morenao Egea et al， did a medline search and found that there were only 497 cases of spigelian hernia reported in the literature till that date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Most of the Spigelian hernia occurs in the lower abdomen where posterior sheath is deficient. SH most commonly presents at the level of the semicircular line(arcuate line of Douglas). Below this line， the Spigelianaponeurosis is a single layer and resistant to hernination. However， at the level of the semicircular line， the fascias of the oblique and transverse muscles begin to split， to allow the formation of two separatelayers. It is at this juncture， that the layers of aponeuroses are at their weakest.\n\n【12】The overlying external oblique muscle and fascia remains intact， contributing to the difficulty in diagnosis of this partial abdominal wall hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In our case， the defect was located in the upper part of the semicircular line and this is a rare entity.\n\n【13】The hernia sac usually contains the greater omentum. However， involvement of other organs has been reported， including the small intestine， colon， stomach， gallbladder， Meckels diverticulum， appendix， ovaries and testes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Clinical symptoms of SH are not characteristic and the preoperative diagnosis is often difficult. Given the rarity of Spigelian defects and lack ofpersonal clinical experience， the diagnosis often remains elusive for years with only half of cases are diagnosed preoperatively. The most common diseases that mimic Spigelian hernia include rectus sheath hematoma， abdominal wall abscess and seroma. Incisional hernias through the spigelian fascia or line conventionally are not considered as spigelian hernia， though some authors have described them as spigelian hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Our case underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy， and the site of the defect was close to one of the ports， therefore diagnosis of port site hernia was considered initially. Intraoperatively， the port site of previous surgery was clearly seen away from the defect.\n\n【14】Repair of this hernia has typically been accomplished with a transverse incision and primary repair. With the advent of mesh and laparoscopic techniques， other options now exist. In 1992， Carter published the first laparoscopic correction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Nowadays， laparoscopic hernia repair， with either trans-peritonealor total extra-peritoneal approach is recommended for patients with SH. The advantage of intra-peritoneal laparoscopic approach is that， it can be done at the same time with other surgical procedures， as clearly seen in our report. A mesh is fixed with either tacks or manual suturing. To prevent adhesions， presently there is composite mesh， which has both absorbable as well as non-absorbable components and costlier mesh can be used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Laparoscopic repair offers advantage over open mesh repair， including reduced morbidity， shorter hospital stay， cosmetic and perhaps the lower recurrence rate.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】A high index of suspicion is required for accurate diagnosis. Radiographic studies may facilitate the diagnosis of such hernias， which ultimately require operative repair. This case illustrates the role of laparoscopy in the treatment of spigelian hernia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Serial monitoring was done during his stay in the hospital. Referral to Dermatology and Ophthalmology were immediately placed. He was started on Hydrocortisone 100 mg/IV every 8 h for 5 days and Diphenhydramine/IV. Topical skin care was plain petroleum jelly. Application was instructed to be in a sterile environment. Mouthwash composed of mixed 120 mL Aluminum hydroxide and Magnesium hydroxide， 120 mL diphenhydramine solution， 2% lidocaine solution and 20 mL distilled water was instructed to be gargled three times a day to relieve the pain in the oral mucosa. Ophthalmology immediately treated him with fusidic acid ophthalmic solution and preservative-free hydrating eye drops. Contact precaution was strictly followed. After 5 days， his lesions started to regress as well as his constitutional symptoms. Hydrocortisone/IV was discontinued. Complete resolution of skin lesion was noted after 24 days and his laboratory parameters improved. He was discharged well.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\nStevens Johnson Syndrome is a rare， severe and potentially fatal delayed-type-four-hypersensitivityyrreaction.

This posts a question for a possible serious adverse effect of having heterologous COVID-19 vaccination. Stevens Johnson syndrome is extremely rare with vaccination.

{"seq_id": "2bfc4641-0312-4aa8-8763-33b8cf658e98", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】The Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) signaling pathway is closely related to the development of various biological processes. It has been found that dysregulation of FGFR signaling leads to cell proliferation， migration， angiogenesis， and immune evasion， all of which contribute to tumor occurrence and development. Tumor precision therapy is targeted treatment based on the driver gene. FGFR represents a novel and promising therapeutic target for tumor treatment in precision medicine. FGFR aberrations exist in a variety of tumors. By applying Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)， it is now possible to identify patients who are candidates for therapies targeting FGFR. Current evidence suggests that FGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated benefits for certain types of cancer patients and are approved by the FDA for the treatment of FGFR-dysregulated cancers. Although FGFR-TKIs have shown promise， they have encountered several problems， including acquired resistance and side effects. In this article， we will focus on FGFR-TKIs and their role in treating cancers with altered FGFRs， as well as summarize the challenges and solutions inyolved in their use.\n\n【2】Keywords： FGFR； Signal pathway； Targeted therapy； FGFR inhibitors； Acquired resistance\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Targeted therapy has become a typical representative of the age of tumor precision medicine. Tumor growth and progression are inhibited and blocked by many targeted therapies. There are a number of approaches that target tyrosine kinase receptors. Targeted therapy for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) in non-small cell lung cancer is a successful example. Targeting the FGF/FGFR signaling axis is a promising therapeutic strategy， and many tumor types have been successfully treated with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) that block the FGF/FGFR signaling axis. A number of biological processes involve the FGFR signaling pathway， including embryogenesis， cell differentiation， proliferation， migration， and angiogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. FGFR aberrations， including gene amplification， mutation， and gene fusion， result in abnormal activation of the FGFR signaling pathway， all of which are observed in malignant tumors such as urothelial carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma and are potential targets for cancer therapeutics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is likely that abnormally activated FGFR signaling leads to tumor cell proliferation， invasion and migration as well as tumor angiogenesis. In addition， the FGFR signaling pathway also plays an essential role in escape mechanisms and acquired resistance to anticancer therapies.\n\n【5】With the application of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)， an increasing number of FGFR aberrations have been detected. A growing number of FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors are under clinical study based on NGS detection results for multiple tumor types. Several clinical studies in different tumors have shown promising results in blocking the FGFR signaling pathway with TKIs通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Along with the popularity of clinical application，FGFR inhibitors also have some disadvantages， such as systemic toxicity and acquired drug resistance， which limit the clinical application of FGFR inhibitors. The development and combination of new FGFR inhibitors are effective measures to solve systemic toxicity and acquired drug resistance. To assess the therapeutic value of targeting the FGFR axis by TKIs in tumors， this review will first discuss the normal structure and function of FGFR. Then， we will discuss the recent improvements in selective FGFR inhibitors， as well as nonselective FGFR inhibitors， and explore the mechanism of drug resistance.\n\n【6】Structure and function of FGFR\n\n【7】By interacting with their receptors， Fibroblast Growth Factors(FGFs) coordinate multiple cellular processes. On the basis of sequence similarity and phylogeny， the FGF/FGFR family includes22 factors that bind to five FGFRs in humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>. A conservation core of 120 amino acids is found in each FGF ligand， ranging from35% to 50% sequence homology， which can be widely divided into hormonal and canonical isoforms according to its mechanism of action and FGFR binding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，7\\]</u>. Only the hormonal subtypes can spread into the blood vessels and bind to FGFR when klotho proteins are present， thus functioning as appropriate endocrine molecules to affect homeostasis and metabolism in adults \\[8，91. The canonical subtypes integrate with FGFR by heparin sulfate glycosaminoglycan and act in an autocrine/paracrine manner.\n\n【8】There are five different receptors in the FGFR family， FGFR1-5， which are encoded by FGFR1-4 and FGFRL1， respectively， and only FGFR1-4 expresses tyrosine kinases on cell membranes with 56% to71% homology通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，10，11\\]</u>. It consists ofextracellular immunoglobulin-like domains 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>， a transmembrane domain， an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain， a carboxyl-terminal region， and an acidic region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. By binding the FGF ligand to FGFR， FGFR dimerization istriggered， which in turn phosphorylates FGFR Substrate 2(FRS2). By activating downstream signaling pathways， indluding Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase (PI3K) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK)， FRS2 promotes cell proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. As a result of FGFR activation， the Phospholipase C gamma (PLC-gamma) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) signaling pathways are also triggered  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Different ligands and receptors determine different physiological functions of FGF-FGFR pathways. FGFR1-4 plays a crucial role in embryogenesis， cell cycle regulation， and angiogenesis. Additionally， FGFR4 is involved in glucose homeostasis， bile acid metabolism， and vitamin D synthesis\\[15，161.\n\n【9】A malfunctioning FGFR signaling system caused by gene amplification， mutations， and gene fusions is likely to promote cell proliferation， migration， and angiogenesis in cancer cells， which are potential targets for anticancer therapies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. An analysis of over 4，800 tumor samples revealed that 7.1% of tumors had FGFR abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. FGFR alterations were most common in urothelial carcinomas (32%)， breast cancers (18%)， endometrial cancers (13%)， and lung squamous cell carcinomas (13%). A majority of FGFR alterations were gene amplification (66%)， followed by mutation(26%) and rearrangement (8%).\n\n【10】FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)\n\n【11】In terms of mechanism， FGFR inhibitors are divided into different categories： FGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) that block the intracellular activity of FGFR and are small molecule inhibitors， Monoclonal Antibodies (MABs) that target FGFR， traps for FGF ligands and Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs).\n\nFGFR-TKIs mainly inhibit the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains，Vwhile FGFRRmonoclonallantibodiesStarget FGFR extracellular domains with better isotype selectivity and are a promising target for development. FGFR monoclonal antibodies inhibit FGFR and its downstream signaling pathways by interfering with the binding of the ligand FGF to the receptor or blocking FGFR dimerization. Currently， a variety of FGFR monoclonal antibodies are under clinical studies， such as Bemarituzumab. Because FGFR|删除段之间换行|monoclonal antibodies act only on specific FGFR subtypes in the extracellular domain， they have higher specificity and no off-target effects， resulting in fewer adverse drug reactions compared to small molecule FGFR inhibitors. Unlike small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies that directly act on FGFR， the mechanism of the FGF ligand trap is to trap and isolate free FGFS and block it's binding to corresponding receptors， thus achieving the purpose of inhibiting the FGFR downstream signaling pathway. At present， a variety of FGF ligand traps are in the clinical research stage， such as FP-1039. Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) are a class of drugs that conjugate cytotoxic drugs with biological activity to monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs) by chemical bonds. Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs) act as carriers to transport cytotoxic drugs to target cells. ADCs have the lethal power of cytotoxic drugs and combine the high targeting， stability and favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics of recombinant mAbs.\n\n【13】This paper mainly describes the progress of FGFR-TKIs. FGFR-TKIs consist of nonselective multitargeted inhibitors that inhibit FGFR， VEGF and PDGF as well as other tyrosine kinases in a nonselective manner and selective FGFR inhibitors that specifically inhibit FGFR1-4.\n\n【14】Nonselective multitargeted inhibitors\n\n【15】Multitargeted kinase FGFR inhibitors are first-generation FGFR inhibitors that notonlybindtoFGFR1-4in acompetitive and reversible manner but also show nonselective inhibitory activity against other tyrosine kinases， such as Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth Factor Receptors (VEGFR)， Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptors(PDGFR)， FMS-Like Tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT-3)， Removable Exon Trap (RET)， and c-KIT19. Nonselective multitargeted inhibitors targeting the FGFR signaling pathway are available， such as dovitinib， nintedanib，ponatinib，regorafenib，pazopanib，and Lenvatinib.\n\n【16】Some multitargeted FGFR inhibitors have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating cancer. Unresectable advanced renal cancer， liver cancer， and thyroid cancer can be treated with sorafenib， which has been approved by the FDA， whereas sunitinib is indicated for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors， advanced renal cell carcinoma， and pancreatic neuroendocrineetumors.Furthermore， regorafenib has been approved to treat a number of cancers， including advanced colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. As a multitargeted TKI， pazopanib inhibits the action of FGFR， VEGFR， PDGFR and c-KIT. According to FDA approval， the drug improves Progression-Free Survival (PFS) compared to placebo (4.6 months vs. 1.6 months) for the second-line treatment of soft tissue tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，21\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In clinical trials， several multitargeted inhibitors of FGFR are being tested. Dovitinib is a nonselective inhibitor of FGFR， PDGFR， VEGFR， and c-KIT that has been shown to be effective in phase II/III clinical trials as a second-line treatment in patients refractory to imatinib with a disease control rate of over 50% at 12 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22，23\\]</u>. A nonselective TKI for FGFR is ponatinib， which inhibits FGFR， KIT，RET， VEGFR and PDGFR， which inhibits FGFR downstream signaling pathways and shows strong activity with a more than 45%disease response rate in advanced cholangiocarcinoma treatment通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Similarly， anlotinib targets several members of the tyrosine kinase family， including FGFR1，PDGFR， DGFR， and c-KIT， due to a lack of drug selectivity， and is approved as a second-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer and soft tissue tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The advantage of multitargeted FGFR inhibitors is that they have a wide range of targets， which inhibits a variety of cancers with associated targets. However， due to their low selectivity and strong dependence on the inhibition of VEGFR and PDGFR， multitargeted FGFR inhibitors show high side effects， including hypertension， fatigue， and gastrointestinal reactions， so the clinical use of multitargeted FGFR inhibitors is limited. Therefore， the development of selective inhibitors that target FGFR is essential and a hot spot right now.\n\n【19】Selective FGFR inhibitors\n\n【20】A number of limitations exist in traditional multitargeted FGFR inhibitors， including off-target effects， treatment-related side effects， and acquired resistance. Recently， some types of tumors have been treated with inhibitors that selectively target FGFR for antitumor treatment. Based on their spatial configuration and the conformation they engage upon binding to their target kinase， selective FGFR inhibitors can be classified into two types： Noncovalent FGFR inhibitors and covalent FGFR inhibitors. In contrast to noncovalent FGFR inhibitors， covalent FGFR inhibitors are irreversible. Some selective FGFR inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials， as shown in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. First-generation noncovalent selective FGFR inhibitors(pan-FGFR inhibitors) were Erdafitinib， Infigratinib， Pemigatinib， and Rogaratinib， which inhibited FGFR1-4.\n\n【21】Noncovalent FGFRinhibitors\n\n【22】Erdafitinib is an ATP-competitive inhibitor that inhibits FGFR1-4. Erdafitinib 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[NCT01703481\\]</u> was studied in 187 patients， 92 of whom had aberrant FGFR， and of these， 19 (21%) showed partial responses. The response rates were 27% and 46%， respectively in cholangiocarcinoma and urothelial cancer patients harboring a mutant or fusion form of FGFR2-3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. In a phase II trial通用删除8(英):<u>\\[NCT02365597\\]</u>， Erdafitinib was evaluated for its antitumor effect in locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer that was resistant to platinum-containing therapies. A total of 99 patients with FGFR2/FGFR3 alterations had an objective response rate of 40% (CR：3%， PR： 37%)， a median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) of 5.5\n\n【23】months， and a median Overall Survival (OS) of 13.8 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Hyperphosphatemia is the most common adverse effect. On the basis of the above evidence， Erdafitinib received FDA approval.\n\n【24】The drug pemigatinib inhibits FGFR1-3 in an ATP-competitive manner and is approved as a second-line treatment for biliary duct cancer. In the phase II study FIGHT-202 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[NCT02924376\\]</u>， pemigatinib was investigated in cholangiocarcinoma's that had progressed to standard treatment. An ORR of 35.5% (CR： 2.8%， PR：32.7%)， median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) of 6.9 months， and median Duration of Response (DOR) of 7.5 months were observed in107 patients harboring fusions and rearrangements of FGFR2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. The common adverse effects include hyperphosphatemia， stomatitis and arthritis.\n\n【25】The ATP-competitive inhibitor 31 of FGFR1-3， Infigratinib， is used for the treatment of cancer. A phase II clinical trial通用删除8(英):<u>\\[NCT02150967\\]</u> enrolled 61 patients harboring FGFR1-3 mutations after progression on first-line treatment for cholangiocarcinoma通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Regarding genetic alterations， FGFR2 fusion (48/61) and FGFR2mutation (8/61) were the most common. The clinical study showed that the ORR of Infigratinib was 14.8%， and the median PFS was5.8 months. Infigratinib was obtained FDA approval in light of its favorable clinical trial results. The common adverse reactions in the course of treatment are hyperphosphatemia， stomatitis and fatigue. Several clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of Infigratinib in urothelial carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors are being carried out.\n\n【26】FGFR1-4 is inhibited by rogaratinib through ATP competition. According to a phase I trial 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[NCT01976741\\]</u>， rogaratinib had an ORR of 22.9% in 51 patients with FGFR1-3-overexpressing urothelial carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. It was also found that benefits were observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and non-small cell lung cancers. In the FORT-1 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[NCT03410693\\]</u> phase II/III study， following standard first-line treatment； rogaratinib achieved an ORR of 52.4%in urothelial carcinoma patients with FGFR3 mutation or fusion通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. As a first-line treatment for urothelial carcinoma， rogaratinib\n\n【27】Table 1： Selective FGFR inhibitors in ongoing clinical trials.\n\n| Agent  | Targets  | Tumors  | Phase  | Study Identifier  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Derazantinib  | FGFR1-4  | Solid Tumor  |  | NCT01752920  |\n| RLY-4008  | FGFR2  | Solid Tumors  |  | NCT04526106  |\n| Erdafitinib  | FGFR1-4  | NSCLC  |  | NCT03827850  |\n| Debio 1347  | FGFR1-3  | Solid Tumor  |  | NCT03834220  |\n| 3D185  | FGFR1-3  | Solid Tumors  |  | NCT04221204  |\n| pemigatinib  | FGFR1-3  | Gastric/Colorectal Cancer  |  | NCT05202236  |\n| SY-4798  | FGFR4  | Solid Tumor  |  | NCT05498519  |\n| AZD4547  | FGFR1-3  | IDH wild type Gliomas  |  | NCT02824133  |\n| ET0111  | FGFR1-4  | Solid Tumors  |  | NCT05522309  |\n| Futibatinib  | FGFR1-4  | liver cancer  |  | NCT04828486  |\n\n【29】combined with atezolizumab was evaluated in another clinical trial通用删除8(英):<u>\\[NCT03473756\\]</u>通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. The ORR was 44% among 31 patients with FGFR mRNA overexpression.\n\n【30】Debio-1347， or zoligratinib， is an oral selective ATP-competing inhibitor of FGFR 1-3 tyrosine kinase. A Pan tumor phase I study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Debio-1347 in patients with advanced solid tumors fusing FGFR 1-3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Of the 5 patients with cholangiocarcinoma enrolled in the trial， 4 carried FGFR2 fusion. All4 patients had disease control，2 had partial response，and 2 had stable disease. The most common adverse events were hyperphosphatemia(76%)， diarrhea (41%)， nausea (40%)， fatigue (38%)，and constipation(33%). In addition， the Phase II basket trial FUZE will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Debio-1347 in patients with solid tumors containing FGFR1-3 gene fusion 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[NCT03834220\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Other selective noncovalent FGFR inhibitors are in clinical trials， such as Ly2874455 and AZD4547. Although selective noncovalent FGFR inhibitors showed improved targeting and significantly reduced adverse reactions compared to nonselective FGFR inhibitors， the clinical application of selective noncovalent FGFR inhibitors is still limited by acquired resistance and adverse effects.\n\n【32】Covalent FGFR inhibitors\n\n【33】A number of studies have revealed that mutations at the gatekeeper residue of FGFR are the main cause of resistance to selective noncovalent FGFR inhibitors in different tumor types通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34，35\\]</u>. The covalent inhibition strategy is an effective way to overcome mutations that act as gatekeepers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. Common covalent FGFR inhibitors include fisogatinib， futibatinib and roblitinib.\n\n【34】Inhibitors of FGFR4， such as fisogatinib， are irreversible covalent compounds. An ORR of 17% was reported in a phase I trial of fisogatinib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma expressing FGF19  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. The FDA granted fisogatinib orphan drug status for treating hepatocellular carcinoma based on this evidence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. The covalent inhibitor futibatinib inhibits FGFR1-4 in an irreversible manner.\n\nFGFR2geneticall Lyyalteredpatients with unresectableOI advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who had received at least first-line treatment are recruited for FOENIX-CCA2 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[NCT02052778\\]</u>. Patients with FGFR2 fusions had an ORR of 36.2%， while those with FGFR2 rearrangements had an ORR of 44.4%删除4:<u> 39，401</u>. For this reason， futibatinib has been approved for the second-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma by the FDA. There is a covalent inhibitor of FGFR4 called roblitinib. The FGFR4 inhibitor|删除段之间换行|exhibited good efficacy with a Disease Control Rate (DCR) of 61% in hepatocellular carcinoma and other solid tumors that expressed the receptor. The median time to progression is up to 4.1 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，41\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Resistance to FGFR-TKIs\n\n【37】Despite the demonstrated potential of FGFR-TKI targeted therapy， resistance to FGFR-TKIs and exploring ways to overcome drug resistance are becoming increasingly important. Several studies have suggested that the mechanism of FGFR-TKI resistance in cancer is complex and mainly includes the occurrence of secondary FGFR genes and activation of bypass signaling pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42，43\\]</u>.\n\n【38】The primary mechanism of resistance to FGFR-TKIs in targeted therapy is secondary mutations in the FGFR gene， particularly at gatekeeper residues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>. As part of the ATP binding pocket， the gatekeeper residue in the hinge region participates in regulating TKIs and activating the conformation of kinases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>. It is critical to develop pan-FGFR inhibitors， such as LY2874455， that have binding sites that are not in the hinge region of the receptor， especially where the gatekeeper residues are located. Resistance based on mutation may be overcome by inhibiting mutant FGFR gatekeepers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. In contrast to gatekeeper mutations， other gene mutations are relatively fewer but still important. As an example，the FGFR1 N546K mutation promotes ATP binding， resulting in resistance to FGFR-TKIs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. In the presence of the E565A mutation of FGFR2， the PI3K signaling pathway can be activated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>.\n\n【39】As a result of resistance to FGFR inhibitors， PI3K-AKT signaling pathway activation and RAS-MAPK signaling pathway activation are also important mechanisms \\[431. In FGFRinhibitor-resistant celllines， AKT phosphorylation levels increased significantly， which could be reversed by AKT inhibitors and recovered FGFR inhibitor sensitivity通用删除6(英):<u>\\[47\\]</u>. Activated RAS-MAPK signaling pathways that stimulate cancer cell growth and bypass FGFR inhibition are also crucial factors in drug resistance \\[48，491. Furthermore， FGFR-TKI resistance is associated with the activation of membrane receptor tyrosine kinases， including ErbB3，MET，andEGFR通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>.To overcome resistance， it is important to improve the efficiency of kinase inhibitors.\n\n【40】The combination of inhibitors with different signaling pathways is a feasible strategy for blocking alternatively activated signaling\\[501. The combination of FGFR inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors has been studied in clinical trials for efficacy and safety通用删除6(英):<u>\\[51\\]</u>. Although combination targeted therapy shows some potential， it may cause more adverse drug reactions. Hence， a single compound with a binocular target is a promising development direction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[52\\]</u>. Inhibiting multiple signaling pathways， such as PIK3C3 and FGFR， is one of the latest therapeutic approaches， such as MPT0L145 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53\\]</u>.\n\n【41】Conclusion and Perspective\n\n【42】Because the FGFR signaling pathway has been implicated in multiple stages of cancer development， FGFR is a promising target for cancer treatment. Tumor precision therapy is a targeted treatment based on the driver gene， and targeting the FGFR signaling pathway is a typical example due to the detection of FGFR targets and the application of selective FGFR inhibitors. Currently， multitargeted FGFR inhibitors are widely used in tumor-targeted treatment. A number of selective FGFR inhibitors have been approved by the FDA， which will stimulate clinical trials of other selective FGFR inhibitors.\n\nIt is challenging to apply FGFR inhibitors in clinical settings due to the emergence of acquired resistance and the absence of|删除段之间换行|appropriate screening for patients. The FGFR signaling pathway should be screened in a variety of tumors， especially those with a high aberration frequency. The application of Next-Generation Sequencing(NGS) has normalized the selection of suitable patients for FGFR-targeted therapy. Meanwhile， appropriate biomarkers should be identified by NGS to select the most appropriate FGFR inhibitors for optimal efficacy. Identifying the mechanisms of acquired resistance by molecular detection is key to overcoming resistance. For example， for the activation of the bypass signaling pathway， combination treatment is a feasible strategy. In addition， the development of a single compound with a dual target is also a promising direction for better efficacy and fewer side effects.\n\n【44】In conclusion， targeted therapy for FGFR is an important link in the field of targeted oncology. Ongoing clinical trials are expected to speed up FGFR-TKI approval for all kinds of tumor patients with FGFR aberrations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Informed written consent for off-label use of Pembrolizumab was obtained from all 4 patients. This is a consecutive series of 4 patients， from King Hussein Cancer Center-Amman-Jordan between first of August 2016 and 24h of January删除4:<u> 2017</u>. Patients details illustrated in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. Median follows up of 13.25 months (range： 8 to 18 months).\n\nThe median age at the time ofrecurrent/refractory disease was 39years (range， 20-43)， and the median Karnofsky Performance Status(KPS) was 70% (range， 60 to 90). Four patients had stage IVB disease associated with disease bulk， and pleuropericadial involvement in 2 patients； one patient had thyroid gland and localized bone|删除段之间换行|involvement (T11 vertebrae).\n\n【13】All patients were treated with standard-of-care regimens and had no other available options. All 4 patients were Refractory to First Line Treatment (RCHOP)，andhad multiply recurrent disease； one patient relapsed with diffuse bone and pulmonary involvement. All 4 patients received a median of 4 previous chemotherapy lines (range： 3-5)， 1patient required re-irradiation to mediastinal disease bulk due to recurrent mediastinal disease associated with compressive pulmonary symptoms. Salvage treatments including GDP， ICE， and DHAP chemotherapy regimens. All 4 patients received pembrolizumab at fixed dose of 200 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks at a median of 5 cycles(range： 4-6). All 4 patients had objective response and achieved complete remission at a median of 4 cycles (range： 3-4). Three patients received high dose chemotherapy consolidation (BEAM) conditioning after Pembrolizumab (patients 1-3) and patient 4relapsedafterABMT received salvage Pembrolizumab andplanned for allogeneic Hematopoietic Transplantation (allo-HCT) consolidation. He achieved complete remission and continued in remission at 18months of follow up after the last dose of pembrolizumab.\n\n【14】All 4 patients were symptomatic prior to start of Pembrolizumab. All patients improved clinically with improved KPS. Objective metabolic and radiological responses (PET-CT) to treatment with Pembrolizumab were achieved in 4 patients . Responses were confirmed by PET CT and no disease recurrence identified at last follow up. The median number of pembrolizumab treatments to objective radiographic response was 4 (range， 3-4)， .\n\n【15】The median duration of follow-up was 13.25 months. At last follow up， 3 patients after ABMT were alive and continued in complete metabolic remission at 8+， 5+ and 28+ months； 1 patient who relapsed after ABMT， received 5 doses of pembrolizumab， achieved complete remission， but unfortunately discontinued due to pulmonary toxicity grade删除4:<u> 3</u>.

This causes nephritis with hematuria，proteinuria， and progressive renal damage， as well as high-frequency deafness and visual impairment. The prevalence of AS is approximately 1 in 5000， and it leads to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) in about 0.5% of adults and 12.9% of children. Despite the identification of associated receptors and pathways， the pathophysiology of AS is poorly understood. There is no specific treatment， although inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are often used. Recent progress in molecular biological techniques including next-generation sequencing have facilitated the diagnosis of AS and can assist in the elucidation of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Early diagnosis and therapy of AS is important， especially in children.\n\n【2】Here， we report an AS case resulting from a mutation in COL4A5. The patient was a two-year-old Chinese boy. Clinical examination showed occult blood and protein in the urine，the red blood cell count was 573/ul，and there was impaired urinary function while hearing appeared normal. Imaging examinations showed no obvious abnormalities. A renal biopsy was performed and AS was strongly suspected. Genetic testing showed a hemizygous mutation in COL4A5， c.4003-2a>T， chromosome location： chrX： 107924113 and the patient were diagnosed with X-linked AS. He was prescribed a low-sodium diet with oral chlorine sand treatment， and after three months， the urine red blood cell count showed a clear improvement.\n\n【3】This study reports a case of X-linked AS caused a mutation in the COL4A5 gene. The findings demonstrate the pathogenic role of this mutation in AS and provide insight into the pathological mechanism of this disease.\n\nKeywords： Alport syndrome； Hereditary kidney disease； Collagen； COL4A5 gene； Mutation； X-linked (XLAS) inheritance|删除段之间换行|Alport Syndrome (AS) is a hereditary progressive kidney disease， typified by the presence of blood in the urine， to get with sensorineural deafness and visual impairment， as well as other more rare renal manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is typified by pathological changes in the glomerular basement membrane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. AS is a rare single-gene genetic disease， involving mutations in collagen IV genes， specifically， COL4A4， COL4A4 (2q36.3)， and COL4A5 (Xq22.3) that encode the collagen IV alpha3， 4， and 5 chains， respectively. AS can thus be divided into three genetic models， differing in terms of the responsible gene and the mode of inheritance， namely， X-Linked AS (XLAS)， Autosomal Recessive AS (ARAS)， and Autosomal Dominant AS (ADAS). XLAS is caused by mutation in the COL4A5 gene on the X-chromosome 21-22， and accounts for 85% of AS cases， followed by ARAS and the rare ADAS caused by mutations in COL4A3 and COL4A4 variation on chromosome 2.q35to q37 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. AS is second only to Polycystic Kidney Disease (CKD) as an inherited kidney disease， and represents a major cause of end-stage renal disease in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. AS is often misdiagnosed in children， and there is limited therapy for children with end-stage renal disease.\n\nIn this study， we discuss a two-year-old Chinese boy with X-linked AS resulting from a COL4A5mutation. The patient was brought to the hospital with hematuria after finding blood in the urine. No abnormalities in immune function， renal function， urinary ions， and hearing and sight were observed. Routine urine examination showed urinary occult blood 3+， urinary protein ±， and red|删除段之间换行|blood cell 573/pl. Genetic analysis found that the proband had a potentially pathogenic mutation in the COL4A5 gene； as this gene is known to be responsible for XLAS， the patient was diagnosed with XLAS.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A two-vear-old boy was hospitalized after an abnormal urine test； there was no gross hematuria， increased frequency， urgency， or pain associated with urination， nor any cough， rash， and other symptoms present for more than 15 days. The child was a G2P2， and had been born full-term by normal vaginal delivery with no prenatal issues. The child was breastfed with supplementary feeds， was fully vaccinated， and had achieved all normal growth milestones. His parents were not consanguineous and there was no maternal history of stillbirth or abortion. Both the patient's mother and sister， however，had a history of hematuria.\n\n【8】On admission， the blood pressure was 71/50 mmHg， the respiratory rate was 20/min， heart rate was 115/min， and the body temperature was 36.8°C. The child weighed 12 kg and was 90 cm tall， with both measures falling within normal ranges for his age 通用删除11(英):<u>(P25-P50and P50-P75， respectively)</u>. His heart，lungs， and reflexes all appeared normal.\n\n【9】Laboratory examinations showed normal parameters， including immunoglobulin +C3 +C4 +k +A， erythrocyte sedimentation rate， urine ion content， anti-spectrum and ANCA， Streptococcus， urine ion detection， renal function， ANA spectrum and ANCA， bone metabolism three 25-VD iPT (CT)， 25-hydroxy determination of vitamin D VIT D23.11 ng/ml. The urine was positive for occult blood.\n\n【10】Accessory examination showed normal sonography of the heart， liver， gallbladder， pancreas， spleen， and kidneys. Abdominal probe：the nutcracker (negative). No obvious abnormality was found in the abdominal cavity nor on urinary nucear MRI. Hearing and visual acuity were normal. A renal biopsy strongly indicated suspected Alport syndrome . On the basis of this and the family history， we conducted genetic testing.\n\n【11】The clinical， laboratory， and imaging results strongly suggested AS. Exome sequencing of the patient， his parents， and sibling was performed， and verified by Sanger sequencing. It was found that the patient had a hemizygous mutation in COL4A5， c.4003-2 a>T， chromosome location： chrX：删除4:<u> 107924113</u>. The chromosomal position of this variant is chrX： 107924113 (genomic version： hg19)， with the transcript NM 033380， located in exon 44， which came from the patient's mother.\n\n【12】Both mother and sister showed heterozygous mutations. This hemizygous mutation is consistent with a pattern of X-linked dominant genetic disease. The mother and sister of the proband carried this mutation， but X chromosome inactivation may have reduced the severity of the disease . These findings， together with the clinical findings， resulted in a diagnosis of X-lined AS caused by COL4A5 mutation.\n\n【13】Treatment\n\n【14】The patient was treated with oral chlorine sand potassium tablets(10 mg， qd). The urine， renal function， and serum electrolytes were evaluated monthly at first and were then followed up regularly at later stages.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】AS is a progressive hereditary kidney disease. It is a rare single-gene genetic disease， caused by， the most common form is x-chain Alport syndrome (COL4A5) and autosomal AS (COL4A3 and COL4A4)， accounting for a small number of cases. Clinical with hematuria， proteinuria， progressive renal injury with or without high frequency sensorineural deaf and visual abnormalities for the clinical features of hereditary nephritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. Alport syndrome has various clinical phenotypes and can be divided into three categories according to the genetic mode. Among them， X-Linked Inheritance(XLAS) is the main form of as (mim#301050)， accounting for about80% of cases. Such mutations have a serious impact on male patients. There are mutations in genes encoding the collagen IV alpha chains， specifically， the a3， a4， and a5 chains encoded by COL4A3，COL4A4， and COL4A5， respectively. X-linked AS is the most frequent， representing over 80% of cases. The X-linkage may seriously affect male patients and hemizygous mutations in COL4A5 have been reported in men. Approximately 60% of these patients develop ESRD before the age of 30， with the incidence rising to 90% by the age of40 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. Approximately 90% of men with XLAS develop hearing loss before the age of 40 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， while about 30% of XLAS men have impaired vision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Females heterozygous for the COL4A5 mutation may experience mild hematuria or hematuria as severe as men due to random inactivation of the X chromosome in females. About 12%of women with XLAS are estimated to develop renal failure by the age of 40 and 15% to 30% by the age of 60 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The a3， a4， and a5collagen chains are all expressed in the basement membranes of the glomerulus， Bowman's capsule， cochlea， and retina， amongst others； thus， a deficiency in one or more of the chains will affect the kidney， ear， eye， skin， and muscle function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. Bilateral Sensorineural Hearing Loss (BSHL) is commonly seen in AS and is usually seen in conjunction with renal symptoms. BSHL reduces hearing in the high- and medium-frequency ranges and develops gradually， with approximately 18% of children below the age of 18 showing hearing loss， rising to 70% of adults. BSHL can thus be used for assessing the prognosis of nephropathy， as earlier onset is associated with higher ESRD risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In the eye， macular retinopathy and pyramidal lesion are often seen， frequently in combination with hearing impairment. The presence of central and peripheral macular retinopathy is linked to early-onset renal failure. Thinning of the temporal lobe retinal membrane also frequently occurs in AS although this is not associated with vision impairment and may improve. Other more rare ocular manifestations may also occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>.\n\nAlthough overall AS is classified as rare with a prevalence of about1：5000-10000通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， recent population-based genetic investigations have found that this may be an underestimation， with ADAS being between 5 and 16 times more prevalent than other forms of the disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In the past， mild hematuria was usually diagnosed as Benign Familial Hematuria (BFH) or Thin Basement Membrane Nephropathy (TBMN)， both of which resulted from autosomal COLA4 gene mutations and were usually heterozygous. More recent genetic studies have grouped these two diagnoses together as a single entity (collagen nephropathy)， and the prevalence is tough to be considerably higher as it is likely that many cases are either undiagnosed or misdiagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. It is second to the polycystic kidney disease is the most common hereditary kidney disease， mainly involving the kidneys， may also show renal symptoms， such as eye problems，such as hearing loss or the severity of the disease according to its genetic and other affected by known or unknown factors and|删除段之间换行|Table 1： Laboratory tests before and after treatment.\n\n| Laboratory examinations  | Before treatment  | After 3 months treatment  | Reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Occult blood  | 3+  | 3+  | negative  |\n| Urine protein  | ±  | negative  | negative  |\n| Red blood cell/ul  | 455  | 121  | 0-7  |\n| Microscopic examination of red blood cells/HP  | 25~30  | 5~10  | <3/HP  |\n| The urine trace albumin mg/L  | 65  | 30.7  | 0.0-30.0  |\n| 24 h urinary protein quantitative g/24 h  | 0.29  | 0.09  | 0.00-0.15  |\n\n【19】change 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The Glomerular Basement Membrane (GBM) contributes to the filtration function of the kidney. It is formed by an interlocking network of proteins and proteoglycans， including type IV collagen， laminin， and perlecan， amongst others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Structural alterations in these components can disrupt the network and its interactions， altering the function of the GBM andpotentially leading to progressive CKD. However， mutations in type IV collagen may cause a wide variety of phenotypes， resulting from the complex interactions between genotype， sex， and X-chromosome inactivation. Furthermore， the type of mutation may also be a factor. Over 1，500variants have been documented in COL4A5， with more than 500 in COL4A3 and COL4A4 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21，22\\]</u>. The most common polymorphism in COL4A5 is a missense mutation， accounting for approximately 43% of the observed polymorphisms， followed by 34% nonsense mutations，23% splice variants， 14% small deletions， 7% rearrangements or copy number variations， together with smaller numbers of repetitions and indels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Male patients with XLAS tend to develop renal failure. A European cohort study showed that a large deletion and nonsense mutation resulted in the likelihood of renal failure before the age of 30， while the risk of renal failure from a splice site mutation was70% and that of the missense mutation was 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. A cohort study of women with XLAS found a 12% risk of renal failure by the age of 45， rising to 30% by age 60， and 40% by age删除4:<u> 80</u>. The reason for this wide prognostic variation is unknown but X-inactivation is a probable cause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. ARAS results from homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in COL4A3 and COL4A4 and accounts for approximately 5% of AS cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. These patients， as well as those with ADAS， show a wide variety of symptoms ranging from mild hematuria to renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\nClinical manifestationsaand disease progression differs among AS patients. The current treatment is aimed essentially at|删除段之间换行|slowing the progression of the renal disease to delay renal failure. Nevertheless， most patients require renal replacement therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. It is thus important to investigate new ways of treating the disease， and investigations into the cellular and molecular functions of the GBM have suggested various possibilities， these include genomic strategies such as gene editing and therapy，RNA therapy， and partner therapy. Current treatment mostly involves the use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockade (ARB)， which have been found to protect against hypertension， proteinuria， and renal deterioration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28，29\\]</u>. While ACE inhibitors are the first-line treatment， AT1 receptor antagonists may be used if side effects are experienced. Increased RAAS axis activity has been linked to CKD progression mediated by both hemodynamic (increased pressure in efferent arterioles) and non-hemodynamic processes (increased cytokine production). Targeting RAAS can mitigate these effects and improve renal function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. RAAS inhibitors may also be combined with other therapies that have been found to improve the efficiency of treatment efficacy， although there is an increased risk of side effects通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor. It has been shown in the EARLY PROTECT ALPORT clinical trial  to be safe and efficacious for treating children with AS， as have animal studies通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31，32\\]</u>. In 2020， an updated guide was issued emphasizing the benefits of early initiation of treatment with RAAS inhibitors and the importance of early diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Renal function is stable in early childhood (normal GFR， no proteinuria). The only signs of disease in young children are that the GBM is thinner and there may be slight hematuria. In older children， the GBM thickens，leading to the development of proteinuria and fibrosis during adolescence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. It is thus recommended that men with XLAS and ARAS should receive RAAS inhibitor therapy when diagnosed. However， female patients with XLAS and ADAS should be treated at the sign of the first symptoms (microalbuminuria) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>.\n\nRecommendations for the use of ACE inhibitors are based on the ESCAPE trial in children with CKD and the EARLY PROTECT trial in children with AS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. In men with XLAS (hemizygous COL4A5variant)， we recommend starting ramipril therapy at diagnosis using an initial dose of 1 mg/m²/day for three to four months increasing to 6 mg/m/day， or maximum tolerated dose. Taking lisinopril as an example， it is recommended that the initial dose be 0.2 mg/kg/day (maximum dose 10 mg/day)， titrating upward to 0.6 mg/kg/day (maximum dose 40 mg/day)， or maximum tolerated dose. For both drugs， the dose should be adjusted according to the needs of children's growth to maintain a constant mg/m’or mg/kg dose and reach the maximum recommended or tolerated dose. For female patients with XLAS (heterozygous COL4A5 variants)， we suggest that when microalbuminuria occurs repeatedly detected without in the absence of infection， defined as the proportion where urinary|删除段之间换行|microalbuminuria and creatinine is greater than 30 mg/mg， treatment should beinitiated. Wehypothesizethatthe onset of microalbuminuria identifies those heterozygous women at significant risk of developing CKD and renal failure. At present， there is no reliable method for measuring the balance of X-inactivation balance in the kidney. We recommend that the dose of ramipril and lisinopril be the same as for male XLAS patients. Adult female patients should use contraception to prevent the formation of fetal lesions resulting from angiotensin blockade. For both male and female patients with ARAS， we recommend initiating treatment at diagnosis. Both male and female patients with ADAS that have no infection but show symptoms of microalbuminuria (urinary microalbumin creatinine ratio is greater than 30 mg/Mg) should receive treatment. We hypothesize that the presence of microalbuminuria identifies heterozygous individuals at risk ofprogression to CKD and renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33-37\\]</u>.\n\nThere are several drugs currently in clinical trials for AS. These include bardoxolone， an anti-inflammatory factor that activates transcription factor Nrf2 and prevents the activation of the NF-kB pathway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. In the COL4A3 Alport mouse model (129Sv/J)， artemisinin (paricalcitol) protectedagainst renal disease and fibrosis. Artemisinin was evaluated in combination with ACE inhibitors and was found to delay ESRD onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. The endothelin A receptor agonist Atrasentan has been found to reduce proteinuria without causing fluid retention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and the aldosterone antagonist|删除段之间换行|AS is a chronic disease that seriously affects the quality of life of patients. XLAS and ARAS usually lead to early renal failure， resulting in patients having to receive renal replacement therapy. This emphasizes the important of early genetic diagnosis and early treatment to prolong the health of patients for as long as possible. At present，there is no specific treatment forpatients with AS and the most frequently used treatment is by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Recently this year， with the continuous progress of second-generation sequencing technology， great progress has been made in diagnosis and this technology offers prospects for fully understanding the pathophysiology of the disease and developing new treatments. The identification of prognostic biomarkers is also important， ideally， a urine marker that does not require invasive investigations. A possible biomarker for progression in children may be uEGF/Cr (urinary epidermal growth factor normalized by urinary creatinine) which is lower in AS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Currently，the only way to predict the progression of disease to ESRD is the assessment of risk factors (increased proteinuria or hearing loss) or renal damage(nephrotoxic drugs， renal donors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The more progress we make in disease research and the more we know about this disease， the more innovative it will be， and the closer we will be to a cure.\n\n【25】In the present study， we report a case of X-linked AS caused by a COL4A5 mutation.

This study expands the human gene database， which is conducive to studying the individualized treatment scheme according to genotyping， and providing personalized treatment for patients with AS caused by different genetic mutations. Therefore， the early diagnosis and treatment of AS are very important. Early diagnosis and early intervention can delay complications such as renal failure and help children live a healthier life.\n\n【26】In conclusion， gene therapy has become a research hotspot and may be a potential treatment for the complete cure of Alport syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Currently， high fat and high protein are used as nutritional therapy for COPD， but there is often no improvement trend. Therefore， this time， we suggested that COPD was improved by ingesting platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks in addition to conventional nutritional therapy. Since COPD may cause lung cancer in the future， it is necessary to control the exacerbation of COPD. In general， cancer is caused by a large amount of active oxygen produced from lifestyle-related habits， especially bad eating habits. Therefore， in addition to improving nutrition， it is necessary to actively ingest antioxidant nutrients in order to appropriately remove active oxygen， which is said to increase the risk of cancer. Platinum-palladium containing soft drinks was invented by Japanese doctor Hideyo Noguchi. There are four types of active oxygen. Our research group at Tokai University has found that platinum-palladium has the ability to remove all four types of active oxygen. Platinum-palladium was found to be the only substance， as no other substance in the world has been identified that removes this entire reactive oxygen species. The improvement in COPD by taking platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks in addition to general nutritional therapy may reduce the risk of lung cancer.\n\n【2】Keywords： COPD； Lung cancer； Platinum-paladium-containing soft drinks； Functional nutrient water； Active oxygen； Antioxidant； AMPK\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】COPD is an abbreviation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and is a type of chronic respiratory disease. COPD is a disease characterized by shortness of breath by causing destruction and inflammation of the alveoli， as well as coughing and sputum， and irreversible progression. Many COPDs are often derived from smoking， but some can also be caused by environmental impacts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Currently， no effective treatment method has been established for COPD， and it is said that there is no choice but to inhale oxygen and maintain/improve QOL in conservative therapy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Epidemiologically， it is said to be the third leading cause of death in the world as predicted by World Health Organization (WHO) by 2030 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Epidemiological studies have also suggested that COPD has a high risk of developing lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Various treatments such as administration of steroids have been tried for COPD， but this time we report a case in which the symptoms of COPD improved in a patient who took platinum-palladium. In addition， prior to this case， Dr. Taro Shirakawa of Japan reported that when platinum palladium was administered to patients with COPD，improvement tended to occur in approximately 40% to 50% of patients.\n\n【5】What is platinum and palladium?\n\nPlatinum-palladium-containing soft drinks are sold as PAPLAL as soft drinks (functional nutrient water) in Japan. This is a colloidal form of platinum and palladium (A solution ofplatinum and palladium mixed at a ratio of 1：3)， which was invented by Hideyo Noguchi， a Japanese doctor. It is expected to have various effects such as induction of apoptosis of gastric cancer and colorectal|删除段之间换行|cancer and activation of NK cells (Both of no submission). Platinum-palladium is completely new functional nutrient water that has never been seen before. Platinum is a chemically extremely stable element and is used for various purposes. In the medical field，the complex is used as an anticancer agent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Other utilization methods focusing on the antioxidant effect of platinum have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Palladium is one of the platinum group elements and is widely used as a material for industrial products 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> and dental treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In addition， it has been reported that palladium has the effect of imparting reducing power to platinum involved in the reduction reaction again 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>，and attempts have been made to utilize a substance in which platinum and palladium are mixed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Due to the chemical reaction and specificity of both elements， a mixture of platinum and palladium is expected to be useful as a substance having a long-lasting antioxidant capacity as compared with the case of platinum alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. It is also known that platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks moderately remove all four types of active oxygen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. As far as the literature is concerned， there is no other substance that re-moves all four types of active oxygen (generally four types of superoxide anion radical， hydroxyl radical， H2O2， and singlet oxygen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>). Therefore， this time， we investigated how much AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase)， which is said to be related to the improvement of COPD， is activated by platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks. We also examined whether this would actually improve COPD.\n\n【7】Materials and Methods\n\n【8】Examination of AMPK activity with platinum-palladium containing drinks water\n\n【9】In this experiment， the CycLex AMPK Kinase Assay Kit(MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL Laboratories Co.， ltd. Tokyo， Japan) was used as per the standard method， and the PBS-added group was used for the AMPK activity in the platinum-palladium--containing drinks added group (final concentration 1%). As a control， a purchased human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) was used for comparative evaluation. In this kit， in order to measure the current amount of AMPK activity， the activity of AMPK was confirmed 1h， 12 h， and 24 h after the addition. In addition， the evaluation was performed statistically by the Mann-Whitney U test using statistical processing software (IBM SPSS Statistics Ver.26).\n\n【10】Results\n\n【11】Examination of AMPK activity by platinum-palladium\n\n【12】When AMPK activity was measured， Mann-Whitney U test was performed in all groups 1 h， 12 h， and 24 h after the addition and an increase in activity was observed at a significance level of 1% .\n\n【13】Examples of COPD improvement in platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks\n\n【14】Men in their 80 years' old\n\n【15】Height 162 cm， weight 52 kg\n\n【16】Smoking history： 15 cigarettes a day， 40 years.\n\n【17】COPD onset age： 70 years.\n\n【18】Underlying disease： Emphysema， hypertension\n\n【19】Current disease： COPD\n\n【20】Platinum & Palladium intake： 18 ml/day (6 ml/1 vial× 3\n\n【21】vial)\n\n【22】Duration： 18 months\n\n【23】Oxygen saturation： Sp02<90% (mean， 88%) before the start of treatment SpO2>98%， decrease of sputum， and better going up and down the stairs after using platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks.\n\n【24】Course\n\n【25】Before the start of treatment， oxygen was inhaled with almost no movement due to respiratory distress， but after the treatment， rehabilitation， andwalking became possible without oxygen inhalation. It is still in good condition. Therefore， it is considered that COPD has been improved.\n\n【26】Discussion\n\nIt was suggested that platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks(functional nutrient water) are an effective treatment method for COPD in this case. COPD is said to have a high risk of developing lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Therefore， it was suggested that the improvement of COPD in platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks this time may lead to the prevention of lung cancer. Currently， COPD is being treated with a focus on conservative therapy， with the intention of not exacerbating it， but it is difficult to improve it. However， since improvement of SpO2 was observed in this case， it is possible that lung function may be improved. The mechanism is still unknown， but we considered the possibility. Although COPD is often induced by smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， a large amount of active oxygen may be produced as an effect of smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. While active oxygen releases inflammatory cytokines and has a good side as a system to protect the body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， excess active oxygen adversely affects normal cells and causes lifestyle-related diseases， aging， COPD， etc. It is known 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks were used in this case， but since platinum-palladium causes moderate antioxidants as described above， it is possible that only unnecessary active oxygen was removed without removing even the necessary active oxygen. It is possible that this led to the improvement of COPD.

It has physiological activities such as protective action and is considered to be related to the maintenance of homeostasis of the living body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. HO-1 expression is reduced in patients with COPD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. It is possible that a large amount of active oxygen is produced by inflammation of various factors in the lungs， and as a result， the expression of this HO-1 is reduced. It is possible that the removal of active oxygen with platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks normalized the expression of HO-1， that is， the maintenance of homeostasis led to the improvement of COPD. It is considered necessary to study the expression of HO-1 in the future. When the activities of AMPK by platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks were con-firmed at the in vitro level， AMPK activity was confirmed at a significance level of 1% in all groups. AMPK(AMP-activated protein kinase) is an energy sensor in the body and is a serine/threonine kinase that works to maintain homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. It is said that activation of AMPK regulates energy metabolism and maintains energy homeostasis and is attracting attention as a potential therapeutic effect for metabolic diseases including type 2 Diabetes and cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The presence of energy is indispensable for humans to live， and the energy source is ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)， and when ATP is hydrolyzed and converted to ADP (Adenosine Di-Phosphate)， Energy is generated通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. By adjusting this ATP level， AMPK is expected to maintain homeostasis and be effective against metabolic diseases such as cancer， type II diabetes， and obesity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23-25\\]</u>. In other words， it is considered that the prevention of lifestyle-related diseases including cancer can be expected by increasing the activity of AMPK. It is thought that AMPK regulates metabolism by inhibiting the ATP consumption pathway. It has been reported that AMPK activity reduces abnormal inflammatory response and cell aging， leading to COPD treatment通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>， suggesting that platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks may play a part in improving COPD.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n\n【32】Although the actions of platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks (functional nutrient water) are largely unknown， there are many reports that COPD was actually improved. In the future， by pursuing the test values related to COPD and the action at the in vitro level and elucidating the mechanism， it is possible that it will become a COPD therapeutic drug in the future.\n\n【33】Institutional Review Board Statement\n\n【34】This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Hinokosei clinic\n\n【35】Ethics Committee (HKC\\N10012020)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is considered as a global public healthproblem and a deviant behavior. People of different ages are committing suicide COI every day around the world for different reasons. University students， who are supposed to be the future of a country， are also accepting this path of deaths. Bangladeshi undergraduate students are also becoming the victims of suicide every day. In recent times， suicide ideation among the university undergraduate students is increasing. This article reveals the prevalence of suicide among the university undergraduate students and the factors associated with suicide ideation among the university undergraduate students of Bangladesh. It also focuses on the impact of these suicides on the family and society. To overcome this grave situation， some precautionary steps have been recommended at the end of this article.\n\n【2】Keywords： Affected behavior； Behavioral health； Mental disorder； Psychology； Public health； Suicide\n\n【3】Introduction\n\nSuicide is a ninth leading cause of the death in America leading approximately 1.4% of the total deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Several studies over the world have observed that university students face multiple problems ranging from psychological to academic and financial to career and social concerns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is also observed that these problems become harder with time and cannot be easily resolved resulting they need to seek some professional help. However， in developing countries like Pakistan， India and Bangladesh， this scenario is more often due to lack of social awareness. Accordingly， around6% to 8% of students suffer through emotional issues during the course of their university studies通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Though the exact number of students who suffer from emotional problems cannot be easily established， especially in developing countries. Researchers have provided evidences that these students are at greater risk for academic and social challenges in a university environment and later in their practical adult life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Mental and behavioral disorders are estimated to account for 12% of the global burden of any disease. More than 40% of countries have no mental health policy and over30% have no mental health program 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. A number of factors are associated with suicidal ideation which includes depression， hopelessness， bullying， family divorce， parental psychopathology， parental death， low family income， interpersonal violence， psychiatric disorders， problematic technology use like Smartphone addiction， Facebook or internet addiction etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-9\\]</u>. In Bangladesh， the rate suicides among university students are increasing day by day. It has become a serious issue that is needed to be addressed. But there is lack ofawareness regarding this suicide ideation among university students. Some proper steps may decline this rate significantly. A study conducted among665 students of a university in Bangladesh by a classroom based convenience sampling method. The study of the result showed that the prevalence of suicidal ideation was 2.3% in the past 24 h，4.8% in the past 15 days， 6.9% in the past month， 14.7% in the past year， and 61.1% in the lifetime. The results also stated that being separated from partner， Facebook addiction， depression， anxiety and stress were the risk factors of past-year suicidal ideation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In a retrospective study from Bangladeshi press report found that most of the suicide victims are from public university students|删除段之间换行|(30.4%). It found that 17 students were from public university in a total of 56 Bangladeshi students suicide cases reported from January2018 to June 2019 in the Bangladeshi print media 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. A study in Jahangirnagar University among 407 university students aged between 18 and 27 vears stated that the 13.8% of the students have suicidal ideation during the past 12 months. A number of reasons were found to be responsible behind this scenario. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was found more in the female than the male in the study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Several studies show that the female suicidal ideation is more in percentage than the male. In a study of suicidal ideation among rural elderly in Shandong， China shows that the suicidal ideation varies gender wise. It is in fact found more in female than the male. The reason of finding more suicidal ideation in female was stated because of having lower life satisfaction and negativelife events which are more correlated with female than the male 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Other reasons that were found behind the suicidal ideation in the study conducted in Jahangirnagar University were being fifth year student， having a lower socioeconomic status， exposure to traumatic events， family suicide history and depression. Lower socioeconomic status of individual is more often influencing the university students to suicidal attempts. Most of the university students of Bangladesh belong to a lower or middle class family. They often struggle to manage their education costs. Besides they have to look after their families as well at a very early age. It often puts them under huge amount of pressure. A cross-sectional study from a rural community of Bangladesh stated that the parental lower socio-economic position enhances the suicidal ideation rate among the adolescents. Low monthly income and expenditure of the parents are associated with suicidal ideation of the adolescents and those who don't live with their parents are also found to have suicidal ideation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. A cross-sectional study from the Korean Community Health Survey 2013 confirmed that the suicide rate is higher among the people associated with lower socioeconomic status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. On the other hand， parental high expectations often put the university students under tremendous pressure. Parents always seem to expect more from their childrens. They want their children to have great academic results. Besides they often put their children's under pressure through expecting their bright and luxury future. The teachers also put a high load of academic pressure on them. Sometimes the university students do not find their teachers enough cooperative and helpful to share anything. This high expectation from their parents often puts so much stress and anxiety on them. That is how the depression takes place into them and results in suicidal ideation. However， the impact of these suicides on family and society is very shocking. It enhances the breakdown of family causing mental conflicts and depression among the family members. It creates a traumatic stress that induces other family members to commit suicide. Suicide is a social disorder and alarming situation for the society. It creates anarchy in the society and decreases the social status. That is why it is considered as a defame of the society通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Some of the suicide prevention steps includes raising awareness among university students regarding suicide， prevention program are needed to arrange besides raising awareness， prevention program should include student support centers， gatekeeper training towards mental health problems and suicide， screening， peer leadership training 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17-19\\]</u>. Besides，curriculum based interventions and internet based interventions may be beneficial in the prevention of university students suicide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Finally， the university administration should look after the mental conditions of each and every student alongside their financial crisis.\n\n【5】Conclusion\n\n【6】Students' suicide is really a tremendous shock for both the family and society. This study will help to find out the exact causes of the suicide of University students. This study finding will help to address the relation between suicide and student-teacher's relationship and other factors. It is believed that the suicidal ideations of university students can be declined by taking meaningful steps.

Through various studies Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) have been proposed but definitive studies are pending. A specific off-the-shelf preparation of Bone Marrow (BM)-derived MSCs，“MSC-FFM”has previously been described and is currently being tested in a multicenter trial. Nevertheless， more insight into the clinical application of“MSC-FFM”in different patient populations is needed. Especially in those with disease constellations that prompt Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) but that haven’t been studied as extensively yet.\n\n【2】We report the case of a 1-year-old girl with transfusion-dependent Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia (CDA) type 2 who developed severe multi-organ SR-aGvHD following allogeneic HSCT. The aGvHD reached an overall grade IV according to the Glucksberg grading system with severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage which led to admission to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). AGvHD progressed despite treatment with Cyclosporine A (CsA)， Methylprednisolone and Mycophenolate-Mofetil (MMF). Administration of weekly doses of“MSC-FFM” was initiated after 15 days (d) of futile methylprednisolone treatment and resulted in Partial Resolution (PR) at d+28 and Complete Resolution (CR) at d+34 after the start of MSC treatment. No toxicities were detected， and steroids were weaned on d+38 after the first dose of“MSC-FFM”.MMF was stopped on d+93 and CsA is being tapered. She shows a promising course of immune cell recovery and no chronic GvHD； she is a full donor chimera.\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (aGvHD) remains a challenging complication after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy (HSCT)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although the incidence and severity varies greatly the mortality ofaGvHD remains considerable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> especially with intestinal and/or liver involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Firstline therapy continues to be corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>， but in spite of their potent anti-inflammatory activity only about half of aGvHD patients experience CR through this Standard of Care (SOC)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3-5\\]</u>， and immunosuppressive treatment predisposes to various， especially infectious， complications通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Due to the multicausal dismal prognosis of SR-aGvHD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>， several strategies for secondary treatment are under investigation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， but so far not one of them could establish itself as SOC in young children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，7，9，10\\]</u>. In some quite the opposite appears true as they show potent toxicities and side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，8\\]</u>. This leaves an urgent need for new treatment strategies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Since their first description 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> MSCs have been studied extensively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.

Regardless， all studies describe their|删除段之间换行|favorable toxicity profile： application of MSCs was reported to be safe删除4-1:<u>7，8，12，21，22，25</u>.\n\n【7】Furthermore， ambiguous results have been published regarding the amount of resolution that can be achieved by MSC therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. On d+28 after start of MSC therapy 58% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> to over 80% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26-28\\]</u> of SR-aGvHD patients had improved； how much of this is attributable to the MSCs is， by necessity， debatable. The high variability was proposed due to different preparation techniques and donor heterogeneity， all affecting the potency of the cell product 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，29\\]</u>. By creating a MSC bank from pooled BM mononuclear cells of random BM donors Kuci et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u> established a standardized off-the-shelf cell product，“MSC-FFM”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>， which received national marketing authorization and was， applied clinically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. The encouraging results warrant further studies and application of this product 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27，30\\]</u>. Meanwhile multicenter trials have started.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】Herein， we report the case of a 1-year-old girl whose severe SR-aGvHD was treated with “MSC-FFM\". Past medical history is pertinent for intra-uterine anemia (minimal Hb 2.9 mg/dl) with hydrops fetalis requiring 2 intrauterine Red Blood Cell (RBC) transfusions (SSW21+4 and 28+6). She was born by Caesarean delivery after a concerning cardiotocography at 29 weeks. After birth bi-nuclearity of erythroblasts， increased ferritin levels and evidence of SEC23B mutation led to a rapid diagnosis of CDA type 2， which was managed conservatively with monthly RBC transfusions. Concurrently， she faced several other life-threatening complications of prematurity like an intraventricular hemorrhage and respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n【10】The ongoing transfusion dependency led to the early decision for HSCT with a conditioning regimen of Treosulfan (3× 12 g/m)， Thiotepa (2× 4 mg/kg Body Weight (BW))， Fludarabin (4×40mg/m²) and ATG (20 mg/kg BW). She was transplanted with a BM graft containing 7.66×10° CD34+ cells/kg BW of a 10/10 matched unrelated donor. As aGvHD prophylaxis our patient received CsA(initially 3 mg/kg BW)， as well as methotrexate (10 mg/m ) on d+1，+3 and +6 after HSCT.\n\n【11】Initially， a timely regeneration with thrombocyte and leukocyte take on d+23 and +24， respectively， was seen. Unfortunately， severe aGvHD compromised the engraftment， and led again to transfusion dependency of thrombocytes and RBCs until d+100 after HSCT.\n\n【12】One week prior to engraftment (d+15)， she developed aGvHD of the skin， prompting treatment with methylprednisolone (initially2 mg/kg BW) under which skin aGvHD worsened to generalized erythrodermia with strong pruritus (grade III by Glucksberg grading通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>)). The pruritus led to our patient developing rocking movements， which only ceased after administration of clonidine.\n\n【13】Signs of liver and Gastrointestinal (GI) aGvHD arose on d+29and progressed rapidly. Liver aGvHD reached grade III 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u> (d+40) with a bilirubin of up to 7.2 mg/dl and maximum liver transaminases of 304 U/l (GOT)， 810 U/l (GPT)， and GGT values of up to 1767U/l (d+27， 28， 51， respectively). Upper GI aGvHD was noticeable by frequent vomiting for which we implemented a feeding tube. Lower GI aGvHD presented with increased volumes of diarrhea and hematochezia (grade IV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u> on d+47-51). The overall grading of aGvHD reached grade IV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>(d+31-34 and +39-52). On d+21MMF (30 mg/kg BW) was added for aGvHD control without relevant therapeutic benefit， yet further progression of aGvHD.\n\n【14】On d+30 (d+15 after start of aGvHD and methylprednisolone treatment) a first dose of“MSC-FFM\"was administered； a total of six doses (2×10° cells/kg BW) were given at weekly intervals， meanwhile maintaining the triple immunosuppression. Subsequently， skin responded by d+44 and was in CR from d+48 onward (d+14 and+18 after first dose of“MSC-FFM”， respectively). Liver showed an objective response by d+46， CR by d+64 (d+16 and +34 after first dose of“MSC-FFM， respectively).\n\n【15】Parallel to the resolving skin and liver aGvHD she had an acute duodenal hemorrhage (Forrest Ib)， which was clipped and injected with suprarenin. Multiple ulcers and vulnerable mucosa were found in the immediate vicinity on endoscopy- consistent with aGvHD. Differential diagnoses like CMV were ruled out hereafter. The diffuse and heavy intestinal hemorrhage led to a five-day stay at the PICU. Although the intestinal bleeding was controlled， GI aGvHD reached CR only at d+64(d+34 after first dose of\"MSC-FFM\") ). From d+68 onward， first methylprednisolone was weaned， then MMF was discontinued (d+93) and tapering of CsA has already begun.\n\n【16】During her long hospitalization our patient developed additional complications in the form of infections， which were treated with various antibiotic regimens. Whilst receiving immunosuppressive treatment she had recurrent fevers and once a Staphylococcus haemolyticus was detected in her blood culture. Her CRP levels reached a maximum of 28.73 mg/dl. As the methylprednisolone was tapered and subsequently stopped， so did the infections. Her immune system shows a continuous increase in all cell lines.\n\n【17】Her nutrition buildup proved difficult， as she was losing weight despite eating adequate amounts even after CR of GI aGvHD.\n\n【18】She was discharged with additional parental nutrition but otherwise in good general condition. Today， the patient gained 2 kg BW， is in excellent clinical condition and free of acute and chronic GvHD at d+151 post-transplant， with her underlying disease being in remission and complete donor chimerism in all lineages.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】The case of our 1-vear-old patient with CDA warrants reporting as it represents a course of severe SR-aGvHD in a very young patient with a rare non-malignant disease. Severe SR-aGvHD has a devastating prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and as no SOC is currently available in this particular age group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> and second-line options carry several toxicities and side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，7，8，32\\]</u>， the need for new treatment options is immense.\n\n【21】MSCs have distinguished themselves in terms of efficacy and safety 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8，20，21\\]</u> and“MSC-FFM”in turn has erased the variable of cell donor heterogeneity and implemented an off-the-shelf product通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27，30\\]</u>. The absence of infusion-related toxicities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，33\\]</u> combined with the confirmed short- and long-term safety even after multiple infusions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> underline the advantage in heavily pre-treated patient populations.\n\n【22】So far， in clinical MSC studies patients with rare and non-malignant diseases like CDA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u> were enrolled less frequently通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，35，27\\]</u>，justifying the specific interest in this case.\n\nIn transfusion-dependent severe CDA allogeneic HSCT is the only curative treatment option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34，36\\]</u>. Yet， aGvHD is the main reason of death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. As our patient developed multi-organ SR-aGvHD the decision for treatment with “MSC-FFMwas made. Interestingly， MSCs seem more effective in severe aGvHD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>， as they are|删除段之间换行|to the Glucksberg grading system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.\n\n【24】activated by their inflammatory environment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Accordingly， an earlier administration during the acute phase of inflammation seems advantageous 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，14，27\\]</u>. Here， our patient received“MSC-FFM”on d+15 after the start of steroid therapy.\n\n【25】The d+28 after start of MSC therapy is perceived as predictive for survival as non-responders at d+28 rarely respond afterwards and most die 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21，27，30\\]</u>. In this case， our patient showed a very good overall PR on d+28， with CR of skin and upper GI tract. At this time， liver and lower GI aGvHD were subsiding but overall CR took one more week until d+34， which we still consider as fast in such a severe manifestation of SR-aGvHD. The rapid response of the skin and the protracted response of liver and gut are a known phenomenon通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.

Client was going through emotional breakdown 48 months ago and described symptoms consistent with emotionally unstable personality disorder mainly feeling of insecurity， abandonment， identity issues and variable mood. Client had difficulties relating with her young child due to her emotional state and started exploring over the internet for medications. Client tried various medications sourced over from the internet， felt well with Phenibut. She started initially with a single tablet and over few months to about 8 tablets a day due to change in tolerance and effectiveness. Client described feeling settle with emotional state， improved motivation， reduction in anxiety and improved relationship with her children. Client decided to reduce her Phenibut over period of few months and then relapsed with similar presentation in relation to her emotional state. She recommenced Phenibut and over 2 months started using 8 tablets daily to the point ofadmission to the hospital for detox. It is at the same time， client started using Amphetamines to complement effect of Phenibut. Client felt prior to the admission difficulties in coming off the Phenibut and illicit amphetamines and requested for detox.\n\n【7】Treatment\n\n【8】Diazepam wasCconsidered dueto structural analogue with to the neurotransmitter y-aminobutyric acid (GABA). A literature search revealed that， diazepam was used in similar cases before， though the evidence is not satisfactory.

The diagnosis is based on serological markers in the blood and cerebrospinal fluids. Cerebral imaging studies are encouraged for early detection as well.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Syphilis was first discovered in 1905 by the German zoologist Fritz Schaudinn and dermatologist Erich Hoffman 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The first outbreak of syphilis occurred in 1945 when Charles VII invaded Naples and his troops spread it through Europe. The disease is mostly spreads through sexual transmission通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum and involves multiple organ systems. In later stages of the disease， the Central Nervous System (CNS) is involved as well.

However， even though penicillin is available， the diagnosis ofneurosyphilis is not always easy to make and atypicalpresentations have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Syphilis cases have been rising over the last decade. 133，945 cases of syphilis of all stages were reported in 2020 while 41，655 cases are primary and secondary syphilis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The rate ofprimary and secondary syphilis has increased by 147% in the window 2016-2020 and 21% 2019-2020通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Acute syphilis can easily be misdiagnosed as primary psychiatric disorder as symptoms can mimic depression， anxiety， psychosis， delirium， cognitive changes with dementia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The described case below illustrates the challenges in diagnosing neurosyphilis in a complex patient with mental health and co-occurring substance use disorder.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\nA 37-vear-old male was referred to the dual diagnosis treatment center after a psychiatric inpatient admission related to substance induced psychosis in January 2020 . The patient had been in recovery ever since his discharge from the hospital and free of perceptual abnormalities. He denied any illicit substance use， continued to smoke tobacco about one pack per day. The patient was followed monthly due to active co-occurring psychiatric symptoms consisting of depressed mood，insomnia，lack ofenergyand motivation withloss ofappetite，mildweightloss and intermittent suicidal ideations. His medications were consistent of： Sertraline 250 mg daily， Aripiprazole 4 mg daily and Hydroxyzine 25 mg as needed up to three times a day for anxiety. The patient had initially reported the blurred vision during a visit in April删除4:<u> 2021</u>. He had described fuzzy outlines， at times with flashes of light and floaters. He was referred to an ophthalmologist with appointment being scheduled in July of 2021. He did attend the appointment and was informed to have dry eyes and was prescribed ophthalmic solutions. He did comply with thetreatment and noticed onlya minimal improvement. Due to persisting symptoms and his optic nerve appearing inflamed on examination， he received intraocular steroid injections. Over the course of the next several months his vision worsened to the point where he was unable to work and started having difficulties ambulating in his own apartment. At that time， he contacted his Primary Care Provider. In November 2021， he was found to have bilateral uveitis on exam and serum syphilis and Lyme testing were ordered and returned positive. He was referred to an infectious disease consult at the local hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital， the patient’s chief complaint was solely the blurry vision. The patient denied headaches， confusion， or any other neurological symptoms. The patient on ophthalmological exam|删除段之间换行|had prolonged bilateral posterior uveitis and rash. There were no signs of otosyphilis， focal neurologic deficits， or syphilitic meningitis. The serum syphilis screen showed syphilis IgG/IgM positive， RPR reactive， RPR titer删除4:<u> 128</u>. HIV 1+2 neg， Hepatitis serology negative， Chlamydia trachomatis， Neisseria gonorrhoeae negative. The patient underwent lumbar puncture.The Cerebrospinal-Fluid (CSF) appeared clear and colorless. The CSF showed elevated protein (54mg/dl)， white blood cells were elevated at 35/mmE， lymphocytic predominance (80%) versus neutrophils 3%， HIV nonreactive， HCV negative. The patient’s urine drug screening was positive for amphetamines， marijuana and patient reported crystal meth use a few days prior to admission. No brain imaging study was completed during hospitalization. Patient did have penicillin G challenge with monitoring in the intensive care unit due to history of allergy， with no reactions/side effects. The infectious disease consult recommended intravenous Penicillin G 24 million units'continuous infusion for 14days (2/5/22-2/18/22)， followed by Penicillin benzathine injection2/19/22 post-intravenous course. Patient had a Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC line) placed. Unfortunately， no home health nursing available for patient as he could not discharge safely to home or skilled nursing facility with PICC due to recent methamphetamine use. Patient remained inpatient to continue continuous intravenous antibiotics until completion of treatment on 2/19/22. He tolerated treatment well. Additionally， he was diagnosed with likely past Lyme disease infection with +IgG and negative IgM for Lyme and reported erythema migrans 2 years ago. Patient denied any symptoms of arthritis， joint swelling， or peripheral neuropathy. However， treatment was recommended per infectious disease to minimize risk of further manifestation. He received oral doxycycline during hospitalization， and this was prescribed to his pharmacy to continue until completed course. He was prescribed Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily through 2/24/22 (x 5 days， to complete 21-day course) to complete the treatment of Lyme.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】The rate of syphilis infections has been increasing over the last several years， especially in immunocompromised patients with AIDS/HIV. Neurosyphilis is a later stage of the disease when the central nervous system is affected. The spirochete Treponema pallidum can infect different areas of the brain such as meninges， brainstem， spinal cord or cerebellum， spinal cord， or vasculature. There are increasingly atypical presentations reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u> of neurosyphilis as in our case with isolated blurred vision but co-occurring psychiatric dual diagnosis presentation which complicated the diagnosis and delayed treatment.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】Patients with neurosyphilis can present with neurological or psychiatric symptoms. Utilizing the available serological screening tests for syphilis is important to make the diagnosis. Neuroimaging studies should be considered as well， and treatment should be initiated as soon as possible.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

After a failure to respond to plasmapheresis therapy， we proceeded with a bone marrow biopsy and fluorescent in situ hybridization， which supported formal diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes. Our case is an extremely rare presentation of a rare condition， as there have been no reported cases of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes presenting as thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura. This case highlights the importance of a high clinical index of suspicion for acute myeloid leukemia in patients who present with unexplained cytopenias and constitutional symptoms even when there are distracting symptoms and an absence of blasts on peripheral smear.\n\n【2】Keywords： Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura； Acute myeloid leukemia； Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia； Ttp； Aml； Myelodysplastic； Thrombocytopenia\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts， red blood cells， or platelets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Proliferation of abnormal cells in the bone marrow interfere with normal production of normal blood cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Classically， patients present with lethargy， easy bleeding and bruising， and increased risk ofinfection. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) is a rare blood disorder caused antibodies against the enzyme ADAMTS13， which results in the fragmentation of platelets by uncleaved von Willebrand multimers and subsequent formation of blood clots in microvasculature throughout the body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Classically， these patients present with low-grade fevers， anemia， thrombocytopenia， acute kidney injury， altered mental status， and schistocytes on peripheral blood smear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. We would like to present a patient whose clinical presentation aligned with TTP， but upon further investigation， was found to have a rare form of AML.\n\n【5】This is a 75-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status， non-bloody diarrhea， subjective fevers， and intermittent epistaxis， each of which had been present for the past two weeks. Past medical history was notable for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus， paroxysmal atrial fibrillation， anticoagulated with apixaban 5 mg BID， and hypertension. At this time， physical exam was notable for a lethargic， obese male in no acute distress， epistaxis from right nostril， 3/6 crescendo-decrescendo murmur in the right upper sternal border， hepatosplenomegaly，and petechiae scattered across the patient's bilateral lower extremities.\n\nComplete Blood Count (CBC) with differential was ordered on arrival， which revealed the patient's hemoglobin， mean corpuscular volume， and platelets to be 9.2 grams per deciliter (g/dL)， 78.7 liters per cell， and 11，000 per microliter (uL)， respectively. Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) was remarkable for a creatinine of 1.5 micrograms per deciliter (mg/dL)， which was increased from his baseline of 1.1 mg/dL. The patient was given one unit of platelets and the CBC was rechecked post-transfusion. The platelets had decreased from 11，000 per uL to 9，000 per uL. At this time， coagulation studies were ordered and found to the following： Prothrombin Time(PT) 17.1， Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) 36.5， D-dimer 1.67 micrograms per milliliter (ug/|删除段之间换行|mL)， fibrinogen 630 mg/dL， all of which were increased. Lactic Acid Dehydrogenase (LDH) and haptoglobin were both elevated at 605units per liter and 243 mg/dL， respectively. The patient's reticulocyte count was decreased at 0.008 cells per uL.\n\n【7】Non-contrast Computerized Tomography (CT) of the patient's abdomen featured non-specific hepatic nodules and splenomegaly. At this time， a peripheral blood smear was ordered， which was remarkable for 2%schistocytes without blasts.The patient underwent plasmapheresis treatment for suspectedThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) for a total of five days. The patient did not respond to therapy， as his platelets continued to oscillate between 8，000 and 12，000 uL.\n\n【8】After the plasmapheresis was completed， the decision was made to proceed with a bone marrow biopsy and fluorescent in situ hybridization， which was remarkable for a long arm deletion on chromosome 5， which supported a formal diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes. Throughout the entire hospital course，thepatient was given 11 units of packed red blood cells and 12 units of platelets for sustained anemia and thrombocytopenia， respectively.Due to the patient's age and comorbidities， the decision was made to treat him with a five-day course of decitabine， a low-intensity chemotherapy drug. On day 13 of his hospitalization， the patient and family elected for supportive care. On the morning of day14， the patient was pronounced dead due to complications from AML and subsequent treatment.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】The case described above is an extremely rare presentation of a rare condition. This case highlights the importance of a high clinical index of suspicion for acute myeloid leukemia in patients who present with unexplained cytopenias and constitutional symptoms even when there are distracting symptoms and an absence of blasts on peripheral. Since the patient presented with the classic pentad of TTP symptoms (fever， anemia， thrombocytopenia， acute kidney injury， and altered mental status) and 2% schistocytes were seen on peripheral blood smear， diagnosis of AML was consequently delayed.\n\n【11】Relying on the classic presentation of TTP symptoms is unreliable， as only 20% to 30% of patients present with the pentad 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Moreover， the presence of schistocytes is not specific for TTP. In fact， in TTP， schistocytes typically range between 3% to 10%. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> Schistocytes may also be seen in Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation(DIC)， Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS)， and malfunctioning heart valves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In our patient， increased haptoglobin， increased fibrinogen， and absence of bloody diarrhea made TTP，DIC，and HUS less likely， respectively. Moreover， the severely low reticulocyte count made malignancy or aplastic anemia much more likely. In retrospect， the patient's previously undiagnosed severe aortic stenosis was the likely etiology for the abnormal peripheral blood smear. Although the initial diagnosis of TTP was incorrect， the correct protocol was followed as plasmapheresis exchange transfusion is recommended in any patient with suspected TTP since mortality is as high as 90%without treatment通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Although AML is a relative rare disease， it is the most common acute leukemia in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Non-Hispanic white males have a higher incidence than other racial and ethnic groups and the median age at diagnosis is 65 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\nThe etiologies of underlying chromosomal abnormalities in|删除段之间换行|most cases of AML are largely unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The WHO 2008classification of AML categorizes the condition into subtypes， which aids in diagnosis and prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Our patient was found to have a5q deletion， which most often occurs in elderly patients with prior Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and is associated with rapid deterioration and poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Our patient's prognosis was especially poor considering he had metastatic lesions in his liver and spleen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Treatment of AML is largely based on the patient’s age， comorbidities， current functional status， and goals of treatment at time of diagnosis， as treatment is highly variable and may actually decrease life expectancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In patients with AML with deletions of chromosome 5g， there is insufficient data to predict the possibility of complete remission in elderly patients with comorbidities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. However， delaying treatment has been associated with a decreased rate of complete remission and decreased life expectancy by 3 to 5months in select patient populations.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-12\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】There have been no reported cases of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes presenting as thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura. Early diagnosis of acute myeloid in elderly patients is especially important due to the rapid progression of this disease. In summation， this case shows that acute myeloid leukemia should be under consideration in elderly patients presenting with unexplained cytopenias and constitutionalsymptoms， even in the absence of blasts on peripheral blood smear. It is important to diagnose acute myeloid leukemia in its early stages and manage it appropriately in order to prolong survival and increase the chances of complete remission.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The case of our patient is proof of this with a 5-year therapeutic errancy on chronic pain of the right shoulder for which medical treatments by rehabilitation and glenohumeral， subacromial and acromioclavicular infiltrations remained ineffective.\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】This is a 39-year-old female patient， with no history of upper limb trauma， followed up between2013 and 2018 for right scapular pain labeled \"tendinopathy and subacromial impingement\"\n\n【5】Medical treatments never relieved her pain： Physiotherapy，infiltrations of the acromioclavicular joint (very moderate effectiveness of xylocaine， ineffectiveness of corticoids) and scapulohumeral joint， analgesics， rest.\n\n【6】She was referred to the department for pain resistant to medical treatment： On examination， the shoulder was supple but painful， with normal active amplitudes， but with increased pain in anterior elevation. She had no long biceps pain or signs of frank subacromial impingement， but she had severe pain (VAS 7/10) on pressure of the distal part of clavicle. The cross arm test was inconclusive.\n\n【7】The shoulder X-rays showed a type 1 acromion with a CSA (Critical Shoulder Angle) of 31°， without reporting any coracoclavicular abnormality at first sight. The arthro-scanner performed on this patient found calcification of the trapezoid tendon at its clavicular insertion with an obvious coracoclavicular impingement.\n\n【8】A xylocaine infiltration test of this calcification was performed， which resulted in complete resolution of impingement pain. A resection of the sub-clavicular calcification was decided upon following a good response to the xylocaine test.\n\n【9】Under arthroscopy， using a lateral and anterior instrumental approach， a bursectomy of the subacromial joint was performed without going intra-articular： A preserved subacromial space was aW found. A dissection of the bursa was performed up to the inferior aspect ofthe distal 14 of the clavicle at the VAPR： evidence of a reduced coracoclavicular space (<5 mm). A per operative dynamic pressure operation on the clavicle confirmed a real coracoclavicular impingement.\n\n【10】Using a motorized cutter， abrasion of the sub-clavicular calcification located opposite the clavicular insertion of the trapezoid ligament was performed while preserving the conoid. A dynamic operation using postoperative clavicular pressure ensured that this conflict disappeared.\n\n【11】The postoperative follow-up was simple， with the arthroscopic entry points closed to the strips on Day删除4:<u> 1</u>. She was discharged on Day 1 with a rehabilitation protocol without any limitation of mobility. Force work was allowed after full recovery of the amplitudes joint.\n\nShe was seen in consultation at 3 weeks and 3 months with complete resolution of her pain， recovery of all passive and active range of motion without pain. The control radiographs did not reveal any acromioclavicular subluxation or dislocation and a disappearance of coracoclavicular|删除段之间换行|calcification.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】The coracoclavicular ligaments are remnants of the embryonic pro-coracoid cartilage 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In about 6% of normal subjects both ends of the pro-coracoid remain cartilaginous. The pro coracoid may ossify. When its clavicular portion undergoes this transformation， a tubercle is formed on the clavicle. If its lower portion ossifies， the two processes can form a joint (1% of shoulder X-rays).\n\n【15】Chen et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> report two most frequent causes of coracoclavicular calcification with trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， which has a rather punctiform appearance (36%) and chronic kidney disease， which has a rather tumors appearance (28%). Ankylosing spondylitis has also been reported as a cause of coracoclavicular calcification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. The patient presented in this case report had no such history.\n\n【16】Three types of calcifications have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>： Punctate calcifications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， ossifications with or without joint formation， and mass tumour calcifications.\n\n【17】In the literature， coracoclavicular pain is mostly reported and described in patients with a true \"coracoclavicular joint\"通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>， so the incidence varies between 0.04% and 27%. Like all joints，they could be affected by rheumatic arthritis or osteoarthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The case reported by Cheung et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> presents clinical characteristics like clinical case presented here. The pain was in front of the left clavicle on anterior rising of the arm.\n\n【18】As far as the treatment of this condition is concerned， the only cases described in the literature of this type of conflict have not been treated by arthroscopy. They were described at a time when arthroscopy was not very developed for shoulder. Treatment， when surgical， consisted of open resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3，6\\]</u>. The approach allowing access to the coracoclavicular space is difficult and invasive and does not allow good visualization of calcifications.\n\nThe current challenge is the early detection of these conflicts on clinical examination， as described in the literature， a painful and limited anterior elevation with normal glenohumeral abduction|删除段之间换行|seems to be a sign of coracoclavicular conflict because of a greater mobilization of the clavicle in these movements. X-rays， but especially CT scans with 3D reconstruction， are indispensable aids in the diagnostic process. The xylocaine test is also described as necessary in predicting a good surgical result.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】Coracoclavicular calcifications are rare conditions with very few cases described in the literature. This can lead to diagnostic difficulties and yet the sub-clavicular space is easily accessible by arthroscopy. The technique described in this article is simple and allows an efficient and rapid management. The functional and aesthetic damage remains intact compared to the open surgery described until now for this type of pathology.\n\n【22】Arthroscopy offers a real advantage in the management of symptomatic coracoclavicular calcification， but this clinical entity should not be overlooked in front of painful anterior elevation with normal glenohumeral joint on radiography.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We report a case of myoepithelial carcinoma arising in nasal cavity.\n\n【2】Methods： A 53-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of symptoms of nasal obstruction and epistaxis. Computed tomography revealed an enhancing mass occupying entire left nasal cavity， with obstructive sinusitis in paranasal sinuses. Medial maxillectomy was performed.\n\n【3】Results： Microscopic analysis revealed multi nodular tumor with solid， reticular， trabecular， and pseudoacinar growth patterns. Tumor cells were monomorphic round to oval cells， with eosinophilic cytoplasm and round hyperchromatic nuclei. Clear cells were rare. The tumor cells showed diffuse immunoreactivity for calponin， smooth muscle actin， p40 and p63， and immuno negativity for PLAG1.

Recently， EWSR1 gene rearrangement has been identified in salivary gland MCs， especially in clear cell and rhabdoid variants. Herein， we report an additional case of sinonasal myoepithelial carcinoma with ultrastructural and molecular study.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 53-year-old man was admitted with symptoms of nasal obstruction and epistaxis， anosmia， postnasal drip， and headache of 2-month duration. He had a history of chemoradiation therapy for poorly differentiated carcinoma of both nasal cavities 6 years earlier. Paranasal sinus computed tomography revealed a 4.2x3.1x2.7-cm enhancing mass occupying the entire left nasal cavity，with destruction of the nasal septum and involvement ofthe right nasal cavity . Obstructive sinusitis in the maxillary， sphenoidal，and ethmoidal sinuses were also present. Regional lymph node metastasis was not identified on CT scan. Fusion whole body F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) identified a hypermetabolic mass in both nasal cavities. Medial maxillectomy was performed for suspected nonkeratinizing carcinoma. Main mass resection including medial maxillary sinus wall， nasal floor， perpendicular plate and vomer was performed and other parts of maxillary sinus wall were reserved. Multiple resection margins were identified by frozen section during surgery， and all submitted resection margins were confirmed to be free of tumor.The resected mass consisted of multiple fragmented soft tissues. The cut surface of the tumor was grayish white， soft， and granular .\n\n【10】Microscopically， the tumor was a well-defined non-encapsulated multi nodular mass . It contained solid， reticular， and sheet-like structures， with trabecular and pseudoacinar growth patterns . Myxoid matrix occupied the intercellular spaces.\n\nThe tumor consisted of monomorphic round to oval cells， with eosinophilic cytoplasm and|删除段之间换行|hyperchromatic nudlei. Cytoplasmic clearing was not evident. The tumor cells showed mild nuclear pleomorphism， high mitotic activity (56/10 high-power fields) ， and perineural invasion . The peculiar growth pattern and intercellular myxoid matrix suggested myoepithelial differentiation. Immunohistochemical examination confirmed the myoepithelial differentiation by diffuse positivity for smooth muscle actin (SMA)(1：200， Dako， Glostrup， Denmark) ， calponin(1：1，000， Neomarkers， Califonia， USA) ， p40(1：100， Biocare， Califonia， USA) ， and p63 (1：200， Dako， Glostrup， Denmark) . Immunostaining for low-molecular-weight cytokeratin (LMW CK) (1：500， Cell Marque， Califonia， USA) and CD117 (1：400， Dako， Glostrup， Denmark) was performed for differential diagnosis. LMW CK-positive cells were|删除段之间换行|only sparsely identified ， and no CD 117-positive cells were present ， unlike in cases of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma or adenoid cystic carcinoma， respectively. Result of immunohistochemical staining for PLAG-1 (1：25， Novus， Missouri， USA) was also negative. Break-apart fluorescent in situ hybridization forEWSR1 was performed with commercially available probe (Vyvis， Downer’s Grove， IL， USA). The results were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy by scoring tumor cells at 1000 magnification field. We evaluated tumor nuclei in 5 fields and calculated average percent of split signals. The result of the space between two signals greater than two signal distance was considered a split signal and this interpretation was based on generally accepted guidelines of Vysis. In our case， 5 fields of total 1200 cells were counted for split signals， which comprised 6% in average . This result was interpreted|删除段之间换行|as negative for EWSR1 rearrangement. Electron microscopy was performed using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue， and revealed that the tumor included longitudinally oriented fine cytoplasmic microfilaments with focal dense bodies and pinocytotic vesicles . The diagnosis of myoepithelial carcinoma without EWSR1 gene rearrangement was determined. The patient received no more adjuvant treatment and has been well for 9 months after the operation.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Myoepithelial carcinoma (MC) is a rare epithelial tumor that can originate de novo， from benign myoepithelioma， or as carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. MC can occur in various sites throughout the body， including the breast， lung， head， and neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， but most cases (75%) arise in the parotid gland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Myoepithelial cells have dual features of epithelial and smooth muscle cells. When neoplastic， myoepithelial cells can appear as diverse cell types， including spindle，epithelioid， stellate， and hyaline. The characteristic architecture of myoepithelial carcinoma includes multilobulated， solid， reticular， pseudoacinar， and trabecular growth patterns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Different cell types and architectural patterns can be found within the same tumor. In general， determination of the myoepithelial nature of MC can be difficult by hematoxylin and eosin staining alone due to the wide variety of cellular and histologic features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Our patient had undergone chemoradiotherapy for the first diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma， and medial maxillectomy was performed for nonkeratinizing carcinoma.\n\nImmunohistochemistry is the best way to identify MC. On immunohistochemical staining， MC shows immunoreactivity for cytokeratin and at least one of the myoepithelial markers， smooth muscle actin (SMA)， glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)， CD10 and calponin，etc通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.Kaneetal.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>found that MCcellsin mostpatients were|删除段之间换行|immunopositive for vimentin， calponin， and S100 protein (positive in82-100% of cases). In other studies， SMA and p63 expression rates were less common (35% and 28%， respectively)， and Ki-67 labeling indices were low (4-10%). In our case， the tumor cells showed diffuse and strong immunoreactivity for calponin and p删除4-1:<u>40</u>. Moreover，tumor cells in our case showed very strong immunopositivity for SMA， p63， and high Ki-67 labeling index (50-60%) unlike cases reported in the literature. The PLAG1 (pleomorphic adenoma gene 1) is a proto-oncogene， and its chromosomal aberrations result in gene fusion with CTNNB1， CHCHD7， LIFR， and TCEA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> Transcriptional upregulation and the protein overexpression of PLAG1 had reported in case of pleomorphic adenomas and myoepitheliomas. Diagnostic value of PLAG1 immunostaining as diagnostic marker in salivary gland tumors is limited， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and immunohistochemical study about PLAG1 of myoepithelial carcinoma in salivary gland has not been reported， yet. In our study， the tumor cells showed immunonegativity for PLAG1. Electron microscopy has shown that myoepithelial cells include longitudinally oriented fine cytoplasmic microfilaments with focal dense bodies and pinocytotic vesicles， desmosome and intermediate filaments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> In our case， myofilaments typical of MC were identified by electron microscopy.\n\n【16】MC should be differentiated from adenoid cystic carcinoma， polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA)， and basaloid squamous cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，8\\]</u>. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is usually strongly positive for c-KIT (CD117) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> and our case was immunonegative for c-KIT. Cells of PLGA have bland edges， rare mitotic figures and are negative for myoepithelial markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In basaloid squamous cell carcinoma， tumor cells have minimal cytoplasm， and single cell necrosis and comedonecrosis are common， and the cells are immunonegative for S100 protein， SMA and GFAP通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.

The growth patterns were solid sheet like， trabecular， cord-like， and multinodular. Tumor cells were usually round to oval， with eosinophilic cytoplasm and mild nuclear pleomorphism.

This relatively slow progress might be related with absence of EWSR1 gene rearrangement. Since there was no evidence of metastasis， medial maxillectomy was performed but the lesion could not be completely excised. Although the patient has been well for 9 months after the operation， the probability of disease progression is supposed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

PRES is an uncommon complication of preeclampsia/eclampsia. The authors present a case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in patient of postpartum preeclampsia with unilateral papillary edema and pulsatile tinnitus， without seizures. The neuroradiological investigation observed the concomitance and/or development of a cavernous carotid aneurysm. Knowledge about PRES of postpartum patients is indispensable in everyday neurological practice. This condition should always be considered in pregnant with altered consciousness， visual abnormalities，increased blood pressure and headache，once seizures， as in our reported case， may be absent.\n\n【2】Keywords： Pregnancy； Brain diseases； Blood pressure； Ischemia； Infarction\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is a well-recognized， clinical and neuroradiological entity first described in 1996 by Hinchey et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is a rare disorder that is caused by endothelial dysfunction resulting in a failure ofautoregulation of the posterior circulation in the brain with associated edema and encephalopathy. The immune system is also considered to play a role in the development of this disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The PRES is a clinical and radiological entity associating varying degrees， headaches， impaired consciousness， seizures and visual disturbances to neurological and radiological abnormalities ofthe parietal-occipital white matter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 40-year-old right-handed woman， G2P1， without any pathological past history， with good prenatal care， with a normal prenatal analysis， blood pressure during the follow-up was normal， admitted for elective caesarean section at 38 weeks of amenorrhea. In post-partum， after 24 hrs of the caesarean section. The lady presented a severe abdominal pain， were to take abdominal ultrasound that found liquid in the cavity. She was referred to the surgical center， but in the abdominal inventory， nothing was found abnormal. Returned to the room without pain， only a little confused， being discharged 24 hrs later. After four days at home， she began to feel a headache， in which she noticed that the arterial pressure was elevated (180/110 mm of Hg) and noticed also that she had begun to swell the legs and the face. Simultaneously， she began to get confused， with tinnitus and seeing little with her left eye and lowering of the level of wakefulness. Her obstetrician started methyldopa 250 mg t.i.d. and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg b.i.d.， she had improvement of blood pressure levels and edema of the lower limbs， but not of clinical symptoms， such as tinnitus，left eye vision and mild mental confusion was requested which revealed increased lactic dehydrogenase， liver enzymes， but blood count was normal. The 24-hr urine test revealed proteinuria. After 40 days of the second surgery， as there was no improvement in pulsatile tinnitus on the left and left visual loss， the obstetrician referred to the neurologist. The examination revealed left papilledema， left eyelid ptosis and mild ocular hyperemia. We asked for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)， and an emergency cerebral arteriography， which revealed the presence of cavernous carotid fistula direct to the left， high flow that promoted circulatory \"robble\" in the cerebral hemisphere . She had been referred to the neurosurgery service that realized coaxial system using microcatheter and microguy， catheterizing selectively the fistula and with the release of decorative balloons； it was possible to occlude it without intercorrences. After two days， the symptoms improved.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is defined as a clinical and radiological syndrome characterized by elevation of blood pressure with a headache， nausea and vomiting， confusion， seizures， visual disturbances and radiological abnormalities of the parietal-occipital white matter. Although moderately common， PRES associated with postpartum is widely unknown and is poorly described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Its early diagnosis is important due to reversibility after prompt reduction of blood pressure. Delayed recognition andtreatment can cause a risk of a permanent brain injury通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Its pathophysiology remains controversial. Differential diagnosis includes cerebrovascular disorders and severe neurologicalconditions通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In this case report， we report a case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in a patient of postpartum preeclampsia. We also highlight the importance of rapid blood pressure control and radiological investigations， discuss the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations and identify the differential diagnosis of this rare condition.\n\n【9】Physiopathology\n\n【10】Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is a rare entity often associated with other diseases， including preeclampsia， eclampsia，hypertensive encephalopathy， and renal failure. Treatment with cytotoxic and immunosuppressive drugs， such as cyclosporine， tacrolimus， and interferon alfa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. Other reported causes are shown in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. PRES during postpartum and pregnancy it is commonly allied to predisposing factors such as preeclampsia and eclampsia. This clinical state is responsible for high indices of perinatal and maternal death， and preeclampsia can be aggravated by hemolysis， elevated liver enzyme levels， low platelet count syndrome (HELLP syndrome) during postpartum period in about one-third of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Table 1： Other reported cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3\\]</u>.\n\n| S.No  | Following organ transplantation  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1  | Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura  |\n| 2  | HlV syndrome  |\n| 3  | Shock， sepsis and infection  |\n| 4  | Blood transfusion  |\n\n【13】This syndrome is clinically featured by seizures， headaches， confusional states， vomitingvisual 1 abnormalities， nausea， consciousness disturbance and rarely focal sensory and motor neurological deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，6\\]</u>. Usually， seizures are generalized， tonic-clonic and precede all other manifestations， starting with occipital lobe， preceded by an aura 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Seizures are the dominant symptom通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， other manifestations include alterations in alertness activity， temporary agitation alternating with lethargy inconstancy， as coma and stupor. There also may be lower motor responses， and disturbances of vision such as visual neglect， hemianopia and cortical blindness (which can evolve to Anton’s syndrome， defined as the denial of blindness). Fundus examination and pupillary responses'abnormalities are uncommon， and only a low number of patients relate lower limbs in coordination and weakness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Laboratory results vary according to the different associated conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Despite the reversibility of these symptoms， they can persist if hemorrhage and ischemia are present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The pathophysiology of PRES remains uncertain and involves that a rapid elevation in blood pressure causes cerebral arterioles dilatation， ensuring a breakdown in cerebral auto-regulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier allows the displacement of fluid from the intravascular to interstitial compartments， resulting in vasogenic edema predominantly in the white matter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3\\]</u>. In cases of peripartum PRES syndrome， frequently there are other mechanisms associated， as hyperpermeability of capillaries during pregnancy， modulation of vascular tone with en dogenous vasopressor agents，and low levels of placental prostaglandins and cytotoxic factors， causing hypersensitiveness and endothelial dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. PRES occurs during puerperium rather than during pregnancy because fluid accumulation in this period increases the tendency for development of brain edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Parietal and occipital lobes are the most affected due to the amount of sympathetic innervation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Vertebrobasilar system is less supplied by adrenergic innervation， so the capacity of vasoconstriction is lower in posterior lobe in comparison to anterior cerebral areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. According to these hypotheses， the occipital topographic plan is the most susceptible to infarction and ischemia通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis of PRES in postpartum can be both clinical and radiological 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Lesions are best visualized with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)， which is the golden standard for diagnosis. T2weighted MR images， and especially on Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) acquisition， show diffuse hyperintensity involving the white matter of parieto-occipital areas， evidencing edema. T1 weighted images show isointensity to hypointensity. These abnormalities are often symmetricaland mayinvolve cerebellum，basal ganglia， frontal lobe， and brainstem in patients with serious clinical conditions. In unusual cases， grey matter can also be affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5\\]</u>. Computer Tomography (CT) is useful to detect hypodense lesions|删除段之间换行|of posterior leukoencephalopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However， CT abnormalities appear in 50% of the cases of PRES. MRI provides information about cerebral abnormalities earlier than CT and is an indispensable tool in differential diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The differential diagnosis of PRES during pregnancy and puerperium period is challenging and difficult to distinguish 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It includes eclampsia， ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke， idiopathic epilepsy， infections， vasculitis or other metabolic disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>. The distinction between cases of ischemic stroke and PRES is of paramount importance， due to the treatment of PRES recommends an instantaneous reduction of blood pressure levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Another fundamental differential diagnosis of PRES is progressive multifocal(PML) syndrome. Their imaging picture is similar， but seizures are infrequent. PML symptoms include gait difficulty， altered mental status， speech， and visual disturbances， which tend to deteriorate progressively and lead the patient to death within six months. These two pathological conditions may be distinguished on clinical grounds and neuroimaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Treatment\n\n【19】If promptly diagnosed and properly treated， PRES in postpartum is considered a reversible pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The primary treatment consists in control of elevated blood pressure， ischemia， infarct， and vasospasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. After resolution， patients who presented seizures do not develop chronic epilepsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) improves both seizures andhypertension， being the first-line therapy. Nonetheless， patients must be treated concomitantly with antihypertensive calcium antagonists 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Clinical outcomes related to this postpartum syndrome are generally favorable after immediate blood pressure control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Symptoms usually disappear in 3 days to 8 days and imaging abnormalities return to normal in a few weeks. However， PRES can culminate in a wide variety of clinical disorders when not appropriately treated， progressing to ischemia and infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5\\]</u>. About 5% to 12% of cases may evolve to irreversible brain injury with severe neurologic deficit and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\nOur patient presented confusion， headaches， decreased left vision， increased levels of liver enzymes， pulsatile tinnitus and absence of seizures. Tinnitus can be a consequence of an abnormal vascular structure and generated by the increase of turbulent blood flow， being present in high jugular bulb， intracranial hypertension， arteriovenous malformations and atherosclerosis of the carotid artery. When characterized by pulsatile tinnitus， may indicate a neurological pathology通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Because of the pulsatile nature oftinnitus，|删除段之间换行|it seems more likely that in the case report this symptom was caused by the increase of intracranial pressure levels frequently present in PRES syndrome conditions.\n\n【22】In the case report， our patient was administrated immediately methyldopa 250mg t.i.d. and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg b.i.d.， which improved blood pressure， levels， but not other clinical symptoms. Her MRI findings showed a cavernous carotid aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】In conclusion，knowledge about posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome of postpartum patients is indispensable in everyday neurological practice. This clinical condition should be always considered in pregnant with symptoms such as altered consciousness， visual abnormalities， increased blood pressure and headaches， once seizures， as in our reported case， may be absent. Diagnosis involves magnetic resonance imaging. PRES can be reversible if blood pressure levels are immediately treated. Delayed treatment usually may lead to ischemia and infarction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Several modifications were described but the operation is now following a standard surgical procedure， which was not modified since删除4:<u> 2003</u>. The latest results were recently published 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. Goals of surgical treatment are to improve symptoms and repair the pelvic support anatomy， more hard in a symptomatic relapse. There was no standardized procedure to treat these patients. Recurrences were treated either bylaparoscopy or by vaginal route. We placed the patient in lithotomy position with both arms near the body and the thighs spread moderately and bent upwards. After appropriate preparation and draping， we introduced a Foley catheter in the bladder and a Circular Anal Dilator (CAD) of PPH kit (Ethicon Endo Surgery) through the anus. The equipe position was： surgeon on the right side of the patient， first assistant to the left side of the surgeon， second assistant between patient's legs. The pneumoperitoneum was established via subumbilical open technique，and a 30°laparoscope was introduced. One 10 mm trocar was inserted under vision into the cross-between umbilical-transverse line in the right side and another 5 mm trocar was inserted symmetrically in the left side. In our step-by-step explanation of the surgery， using video (instructive video)， approved by the local Institutional Review Board of University Hospital of Bari， Policlinic of Bari， 1 operative unit of obstetrics and gynecology， all the crucial steps ofour surgical approach were visualized. According to the literature， this type of correction is for the first time described. Urodynamic studies， including uroflowmetry， cystomanometry， pressure flow study and residual urine volume， were performed before surgery.\n\nThe patient was a 54-year-old woman， affected by a multi compartment pelvic organ prolapse， arose after a previous laparoscopic lateral POPs performed 4 years ago， in another hospital. A5 mm skin incision was made on both sides at 2 cm above the iliac crest and 4 cm posterior to the anterior superior iliac spine. In the first step， was evidenced the previous mesh， and a complete adhesiolysis of fibrotic tissue on prevescical space was performed， followed by a subtotal hysterectomy. Uterine manipulator， left in place， was useful because it offers appropriate exposure of the posterior vaginal fornix and Douglas pouch. The vesicovaginal space was found between the bladder and the anterior vaginal wall in the fascia plane， after dissection of previous mesh edge， from anterior scar retraction zone and parametrium. If needed， the bladder was filled in a retrograde manner with 200 ml to 300ml of a blue-colored serum to facilitate the dissection. Posteriorly， the rectovaginal septum was opened distally to the perineal body and the anorectal junction. The promontorium was dissected， and the posterior parietal peritoneum was vertically incised on the right pelvic sidewall to the pouch of Douglas. Then the rectovaginal septum was dissected to the anal cap， while laterally exposing the puborectalis (levatorani) muscle on each side. Middle rectal vessels were coagulated. The vesicovaginal space was then dissected. The final step was the placement of anterior and posterior|删除段之间换行|meshes， which were fashioned on the anterior and posterior vaginal wall and cervical plane， after optimal mobilization of the apex of the vagina. Our team implanted the meshes to only 8 points： two on the puborectalis muscle on each side without tension； two on the anterior vaginal wall at the level of the bladder neck； and one on each side of the cervix for the reconstitution of the pericervical ring. The stitch fastened one of the two meshes to the anterior paravertebral ligament at the level of the sacral promontory， and the peritonization was complete. The operative time was of 133 minutes. Our technique was simple (owing to fewer laparoscopic stitches) with minimal operative difficulty. We have provided an adequate surgical management of relapse of multicompartment pelvic organ prolapse after lateral POPS， which constitutes a real challenge for urogynecologists 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Tissues were weakened and cleavage planes were difficult to find， but with our surgical reinforcement， we obtained a satisfactory tension and suspension with anatomical restoration. Posterior colpoperineorrhaphy was not associatedfor lack of perineal insufficiency. The patient was discharged two days after surgery. Follow-up at six month confirms the good functional and anatomic outcomes obtained with laparoscopic repair using mesh. We believe that our technique allows an appropriate surgical repair that often is difficult to obtain in a multicompartment POP relapse. With this approach， the excessive anteriorization of the vagina was decreased， which leads to the widening of the space of Douglas.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The vaginal atresia was the result of an injury of the birth canal that occurred during childbirth.\n\n【3】Conclusion： We present a rare case of acquired vaginal atresia resulting in a hematocolpos. It is of pivotal importance to inspect the birth canal for any injuries after childbirth. A woman’s recovery postpartum should always be observed by care givers. When the recovery is atypical or abnormal， physical examination or extra investigation should be considered.\n\n【4】Keywords： Amenorrhea； Vaginal atresia/vaginal obstruction； Hematometrocolpos/hematocolpos； Urinary retention\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Hematocolpos is an accumulation of menstrual blood in the vagina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. When a vaginal and cervical occlusion occurs， accumulation of blood in the vagina and uterine cavity is present. This is known as a hematometrocolpos 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Both conditions commonly present due to congenital anomalies通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It can also occur after injury of the vaginal wall， such as after an operation， radiotherapy， severe infection or childbirth. This is often referred to as acquired vaginal atresia or obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Acquired vaginal atresia is very rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Damage of the birth canal during labor occurs rather often通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. These injuries will heal in most cases with no to minor residual symptoms. It is important that an injury of the vaginal wall or perineum is recognized and treated correctly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. If an injury is not recognized and therefore not treated properly， it can lead to scaring of the vaginal wall and perineum， leading to vaginal stenosis or atresia. We report a rare case of complete vaginal atresia secondary to an injury during childbirth.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\nA 34-year-old woman， gravida 2， para 2， came to the emergency department after suffering for two days from abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant. She had a history of vaginismus. She delivered twice by ventouse because of non-progressive labor during the second stage and fetal distress. Both times a healthy infant was born. She had a normal recovery after her first delivery without any residual symptoms. After her most recent delivery， examination of the birth canal was challenging due to her vaginismus. It was difficult for her to relax and she experienced the examination as very painful. This made it difficult to repair the second-degree perineal rupture. The first days of the recovery of her perineal rupture were uneventful. During the first week's post-partum she developed urinary retention， which was treated by an indwelling urinary catheter. She also noticed difficulties with penetration during sexual intercourse. Her menstruation had not vet resumed， but she noticed monthly pain in the lower abdomen. She did not take contraceptives. During physical examination， she had diffused abdominal pain in the lower part of the abdomen without defense musculaire. During vaginal examination， an adhesion of the vaginal walls was seen， with normal external female genitalia. The abdominal ultrasound showed a spherical cavity|删除段之间换行|in the vagina . This led to the diagnosis vaginal atresia that resulted in a hematocolpos. During operation adhesiolysis was performed and a small ring of fibrous tissue was found. The hematocolpos was drained and the normal anatomy of the vagina was restored by excision of excess fibrous tissue and a surgical repair of the posterior vaginal wall. She had a good recovery. The use of vaginal pelottes and physiotherapy for relaxation of the muscles around the vagina was advised. After a couple of months normal vaginal anatomy was restored with normal menstrual flow and the capability of sexual intercourse. The urinary retention was also dissolved after the operation.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Injury of the birth canal during childbirth is common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. These injuries heal without complications if they are recognized and treated correctly. If not treated correctly， it can lead to scarring of the perineum or vagina. In rare cases， it can even lead to vaginal stenosis or atresia. It is important to have trained attendance at birth and a thorough inspection of the birth canal directly postpartum. If necessary， correct treatment of the lacerations has to be done 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Complete vaginal atresia postpartum is rare. Congenital causes of vaginal atresia have an incidence of 1 in 5.000-10.000 women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Acquired vaginal atresia is even less common and they are mostly caused by injuries， infections or radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. A hematocolpos is mostly caused by a congenital obstruction of the vagina， such as an imperforate hymen， transverse vaginal septum or an atresia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. These are also known causes of primary amenorrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Vaginal atresia is also described as a cause of secondary amenorrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Our patient was not breastfeeding； hence lactation amenorrhea was less likely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Probably as a result ofthe hematocolpos， our patient had an abnormal recovery with occurrence ofurinary retention. She had an indwelling urinary catheter for several weeks. The occurrence of urinary retention together with a hematocolpos is mostly described when an imperforate hymen is present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In this case report， we emphasize the importance of recognition of an abnormal recovery postpartum. Clues in this case were the amenorrhea， urinary retention and inability for penetration. When an abnormal recovery is suspected， physical examination and if necessary further investigation should be considered.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】In this case report we highlight the risk of a hematocolpos caused by vaginal atresia due to injuries of the vagina after childbirth. Therefore， we advise to carefully inspect the birth canal after childbirth and to be aware when a patient has an abnormal recovery. In those cases， additional physical examination should be considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Episodes of Acute Heart Failure(AHF) account for 1.76 million hospitalizations per year， which are associated with high rates of readmission and postdischarge mortality. The early postdischarge period following AHF-initiated hospitalization is a particularly vulnerable time. Also， identifying which patients are at highest risk of postdischarge mortality or readmission， and which patients may benefit from closer follow-up， is complex-as evidenced by the multitude of clinical risk scores developed for this purpose. Most mortality-risk models include advanced age， low blood pressure， low sodium concentration， and impaired renal function. However， clinicians should be aware that risk-stratification tools may not account for other established or emerging prognostic factors， which include the presence of organ damage， length of hospital stay， socioeconomic status， social and/or family support， and social stability. Each episode of acute decompensation leads to further deterioration of cardiac and kidney function and progression of HF，with hospitalization for AHF itself a strong predictor of subsequent death in patients with chronic HF. This underscores the importance ofefforts to avoid acute episodes through optimization of chronic HF management. Appropriate patient education， timely follow up， and effective treatment of comorbidities are important for postdischarge HF management. Moreover， Guideline-Directed Evaluation and Management (GDEM) of patients with HF should be optimized by awareness ofupdates and appropriate implementation of newly added therapies.\n\n【2】Keywords： Heart failure； Hospitalization； Comorbidity；Blood pressure； Dyspnea\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Heart Failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome resulting from structural or functional cardiac abnormalities and the body's compensatory mechanisms to maintain cardiac output 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Although typically characterized by shortness of breath， fatigue， and swelling， HF can vary in signs and symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Stable chronic HF is punctuated by acute episodes of decompensation in which signs and symptoms of HF gradually or rapidly worsen， eventually requiring urgent medical attention and typically hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Patients hospitalized with Acute Heart Failure (AHF) may be experiencing a worsening of previously stable chronic HF， namely Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF)， or present with new-onset (de novo) AHF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC； ClinicalTrials.gov identifier： NCT00005131) study， 53% of incident ADHF hospitalizations consisted of patients with a previous HF diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Inpatient morbidity and mortality rates for AHF vary based on the clinical presentation， patient characteristics， and socioeconomic status， with higher mortality for acute decompensated chronic HF than for de novo AHF通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\nWith an estimated incidence of 915，000 cases per year， AHF leads to approximately 1.8 million hospitalizations in the United States annually 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. Risk-standardized readmission rates for HF are higher than those for myocardial infarction or stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， with more than 20% of patients readmitted within the first 30 days after discharge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Based on large-scale registry data， the rate of in-hospital mortality in the United States ranges from 2.6% to 4.0%， and the risk for mortality remains high over the subsequent year . The immediate months postdischarge represent a particularly vulnerable period， with increased risks for readmission or death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-13\\]</u>. Each episode of acute decompensation leads to further deterioration of cardiac and kidney function， thereby contributing to progression of HF and decreasing chances of survival following another episode 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，14，15\\]</u>. Furthermore， hospitalization for ADHF is a strong predictor of subsequent death in patients with|删除段之间换行|Table 1： Patient outcomes in AHF registries in the United States.\n\n| Patient Outcome  | ADHERE \\[98，991  | OPTIMIZE-HF通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，29\\]</u>  | GWTG-HF\\[100，1011  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Patient Outcome  | N=105 3388 2001-2004  | N=48 612 2003-2004  | N=110 621 2005-2010  |\n| In-hospital mortality  | 4.00%  | 3.80%  | 2.60%  |\n| Readmission  | 30 day：22.1%\\ 1 year：65.8%\\  | 60 to 90 day： 29.6%  | 30 day： 22.9% to 26.3%# 1 year： 66.5% to 72.9%#  |\n| Post discharge mortality  | 30 day：11.2%\\ 1 vear：36.0%\\  | 60 to 90 day： 8.3%t  | 30 day： 4.3% to 6.3%# 1 year： 27.7% to 34.1%#  |\n| Death/hospitalization  | \\-  | 60 to 90 day： 36.0%  | 1 year： 72.3% to 78.0%#  |\n\n【7】\\Based on a subset of patients from ADHERE (N=79 508；2001-2006)， from a study comparing outcomes with those of non-ADHERE patients.\n\n【8】tData from follow-up cohort (N=5791)\n\n【9】chronic HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Thus， improved outcomes among patients with AHF are needed. The aim of this review is to examine how best to identify and manage patients with AHF at discharge who are at greatest risk for poor outcomes-particularly mortality or rehospitalization-to prevent episodes.\n\n【11】PatientsS2atHighestFRiskfor PoorAHF Outcomes\n\n【12】Clinical characteristics of patients with AHF\n\n【13】Data from United States-based registries have shown that most patients admitted for AHF were experiencing worsening ofpreviously stable chronic HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，16\\]</u>. Insights may be gained from these large-scale AHF registries regarding the characteristics commonly present in patients hospitalized for AHF. At equal rates among men and women， patients admitted for an AHF episode are typically older and present with cardiovascular comorbidities. Most patients have hypertension， nearlyone-half have coronary artery disease， and about one-third has atrial fibrillation .\n\nNoncardiovascular comorbidities， particularly diabetes mellitus， renal dysfunction， and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease， are also common in patients hospitalized for AHF . These conditions may impact the pathophysiological progression of HF and complicate HF treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Hypertension is the leading cause of HF with preserved ejection fraction (ejection fraction ≥50%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However， randomized clinical trials of HF have focused mainly on patients with reduced ejection fraction (ejection fraction≤40%)， and the clinical benefit of HF therapy has been demonstrated only in these patients 3|.\n\n【15】Understanding the precipitating causes of ADHF helps guide appropriate treatment and prevents acute events in patients with chronic HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Various precipitating factors (including ischemia， uncontrolled hypertension， and arrhythmia) for hospital admission that have been identified from AHF registries are shown in Table 2通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In the Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) registry， a significantly higher risk for 60 to 90 day postdischarge mortality was observed in patients whose hospitalizations for AHF were precipitated by ischemia/acute coronary syndrome (adjusted Odds Ratio (OR)， 1.52； 95% Confidence Interval (CI)， 1.20-1.93； P<0.001) or worsening renal function (adjusted OR， 1.46； 95% CI， 1.06-2.00； P=0.02)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.Other registries have shown that， among non-ischemic precipitants，renal dysfunction and infection adversely affect patients’long-term survival删除4-1:<u>19</u>.\n\n【16】Race is also a factor， with many HF admissions in black patients either being under recognized， undertreated， or outpatient medical management being undervalued. Over the next decade， it is projected that the proportion of black individuals with HF will grow at a faster rate than any other ethnic group and HF tends to occur approximately10 years earlier in black patients compared with white patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20-22\\]</u>. Black patients also have higher rates of chronic HF exacerbations， longer hospital stays， and a greater mortality rate compared with their white counterparts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，23，24\\]</u>. Unfortunately， major studies in HF were unable to enroll significant proportions of black patients andless than 25% of black patients received hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate， which is guideline-recommended for African Americans and shown to substantially reduce all-cause mortality and hospitalizations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25-27\\]</u>. These findings raise questions about the utility of therapies being indicated for particular ethnic groups to treat HF exacerbations. Management of HF in black patients could be improved by increased recognition and aggressive treatment of hypertension， which is more prevalent in black communities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u> and is a strong risk factor for HF in black patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Who is at increased risk of poor outcomes following hospital admission for AHF?： Established independent predictors of morbidity and mortality in patients hospitalized for HF have been reviewed elsewhere and， as noted in Table 3， include age， comorbidities， selected laboratory values，and race 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，17\\]</u>. Predictors of 30 day readmission among patients with HF have been examined in several studies： increased concentrations of B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and troponin， and a higher number of prior hospitalizations， have been associated with increased risk of hospital readmission； whereas the presence of comorbidities， such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension， have not been consistently linked with the risk of hospital readmission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30，31\\]</u>.\n\nAdditional factors， with some seemingly minor， may affect the outcomes of an AHF episode in clinical practice. For example， treatment-seeking behaviors have been observed as different between men and women， which may impact patient outcomes. Men typically defer seeking medical treatment， as evidenced by longer prehospital delays between the time of acute symptom onset and arrival at the emergencydepartment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>and delays between the onset of worsen ing symptoms and the time at which the patient contacts a healthcare provider 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Older age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>， the presence of depressive symptoms通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>，and non-ambulance transport to the hospital 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u> have also been shown to be independent predictors of longer prehospital delays. Such contributing factors have important implications regarding outcomes in patients with AHF.

In patients with cardiovascular disease， frailty has been associated with negative outcomes and high risks for HF-related readmissions通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40，41\\]</u>. Similarly， frailty has been linked with readmissions among patients who have received mechanical support devices， such as left ventricular assist devices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Another factor associated with increased risk for readmission after hospitalization for AHF is the distance between the patient's residence and the hospital. The increased risk of hospital readmission is proportional to the distance from hospital to home 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>. Increasing geographic remoteness has been shown to increase the risk of readmission in some， but not all， studies of postdischarge patient populations and in patients hospitalized for cardiac procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44-47\\]</u>. Thus， surveys among patients hospitalized for HF have observed that the most desired intervention was to locate appointments convenient to patients' homes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>. In urban communities with congested traffic grids， patients may have time limitations to their access to care 48，49J.\n\n【23】Risk stratification\n\nRisk stratification for patients with AHF has received increasing attention as hospitals seek to determine which patients may best be treated in the emergency department before being sent home， which require further observation， and which need to be admitted for hospital care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[50-52\\]</u>. Risk stratification for AHF may also help identify patients at greatest risk of hospital readmission or death who|删除段之间换行|will benefit from receiving more intensive follow-up after discharge. This section will discuss the practical risk stratification of patients based on their risk for poor AHF outcomes to determine appropriate medical therapy and follow-up care strategies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Initial evaluation\n\n【26】The initial patient evaluation is used to identify any precipitating factors and underlying conditions that may contribute to the patients'risk for poor outcomes using readily evaluable demographic and clinical characteristics. As discussed above， age， sex， race， systolic BP， and certain comorbidities have been found to be independent predictors of morbidity and mortality in patients hospitalized for HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> and should， therefore， be included in the initial patient evaluation. In addition， polypharmacy increases the likelihood of drug interactions， complicates dosing schedules， and results in reduced medication adherence， particularly in the setting of HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53\\]</u>； polypharmacy is an important contributor to patients’ risk for poor outcomes. Older patients with multiple comorbidities are especially susceptible to excessive medication burdens that increase their risk of side effects and drug interactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，54\\]</u>.\n\n【27】The impact of these elements on risks for poor outcomes postdischarge has been evaluated for patients with HF. Among the elderly， increased short-term mortality (i.e.， in-hospital or ≤ 30 days postdischarge) and risk for readmission has been a consistent finding通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30，31\\]</u>.Elderly (median age >75 years) patients with HF have had a rate of readmission or death of 26% within 90 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[55\\]</u>， and a 1-year mortality rate of nearly 50%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，54\\]</u>. Patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction are often elderly and at higher risk for poor outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56\\]</u>. Accordingly， increasing age has been used in many risk-prediction models for the combined end point of readmission or death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57\\]</u>.\n\nA greater burden of comorbidities increases the risk of 30 and90 day readmission for AHF， as demonstrated by composite indices， such as the Charlson score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30，55\\]</u>. Hypertension is present in more|删除段之间换行|than four-fifths of Medicare beneficiaries with HF， making it the most frequent comorbidity in HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Although readmission rates appear to be independent of presenting BP， elevated systolic BP at the time of admissionand discharge inpatients hospitalized withADHFcorrelates inversely with in-hospital and postdischarge mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29，58\\]</u>. In another study，bothabnormally low and abnormallyhigh systolic and diastolic BP levels at discharge were associated with increased rates of 1-year mortality following discharge for ADHF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[59\\]</u>. These results suggest that hospital discharge offers an opportunity to identify patients with low BP readings who may benefit from more frequent monitoring in addition to identifying patients with high BP readings who may benefit from escalated therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[59\\]</u>. Diabetes mellitus has been reported in approximately half of Medicare beneficiaries with HF in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>，and has been associated with poor long-term outcomes in patients hospitalized for AHF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，19，60\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Non-adherence to medication or diet and low health literacyalso negatively impact long-term survival following hospitalization for AHF.Medication non-adherencehas been identified as a precipitating cause of decompensation， albeit associated with reduced in-hospital mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，19\\]</u>. Unsurprisingly， non-adherence to follow-up care has been linked with increased readmission risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61\\]</u>. Similarly，lower health literacy has been found to be independently associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality， even after adjusting for demographic and clinical variables (P=0.001)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[62，63\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Based on the initial clinical evaluation， patients may be broadly grouped into 2 categories： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> low risk of poor outcomes； or 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> high risk of poor outcomes due to underlying comorbidities. Further evaluation may improve risk stratification； to be useful in clinical practice， any additional assessments must be simple to perform at the bedside. Risk-assessment tools： Multivariable predictive models calculate clinical risk scores by incorporating variables known to be associated with increased risk of an adverse outcome. In such models， relative weights are assigned to each variable to calculate an outcome probability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[64\\]</u>. The calculated clinical risk score may be used to estimate patient prognosis. Many risk-prediction tools have been developed to estimate risks for in-hospital mortality通用删除6(英):<u>\\[65-67\\]</u> and postdischarge mortality or rehospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58，68-70\\]</u> following admission for HF in the United States. A major limitation is the complexity of the calculations， which makes their use at bedside frequently impractical 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[65\\]</u>. The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline for the management of HF indicates that several validated multivariable risk scores can be useful to estimate subsequent risk of mortality in hospitalized patients with HF  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Although a heterogeneous set of variables has been incorporated into the predictive models， age， blood pressure， sodium concentration， and renal function are included in most 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[71\\]</u>. Natriuretic peptide levels are included in one； and the 2017 American College of Cardiology(ACC)/AHA/Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) update to the ACCF/AHA guideline states that baseline measurements of natriuretic peptides， cardiac troponins， or both， are useful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[72\\]</u>. These biomarkers may be effective when used in conjunction with clinical risk tools and will likely be integrated into new risk models 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[70，71，73\\]</u>.\n\nClinical risk-prediction tools have also been developed to estimate the risk of readmission following hospitalization for AHF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30，74\\]</u>. Although many established clinical predictors of HF readmission are available， a well-performing risk model has proven to be difficult to create 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30，74\\]</u>； ACCF/AHA guidelines note clinical risk|删除段之间换行|scores have not performed well in estimating the risk of readmission通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This difficulty may be related to the impact of factors beyond clinical and demographic patient characteristics on readmission risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[74\\]</u>. The use of clinical scores for risk stratification may best be considered as a supplement to， rather than replacement of， clinical judgment regarding decision making for individuals with HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[64\\]</u>. Furthermore， clinicians should take clinical factors not included in risk scores into consideration， such as end-organ damage. The presence of LVEF <40%， elevated cardiac troponins， which are markers of myocardial damage， and brain natriuretic peptides have been associated with increased in-hospital mortality， postdischarge mortality， and the composite of readmission and mortality in patients with AHF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[75，76\\]</u>. Abnormal liver function test results at baseline， or at any point during hospitalization， are predictive of mortality and HF rehospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[77\\]</u>. Another factor that has not been incorporated in most risk scores is the length of hospital stay， which has been associated with poor outcomes postdischarge for patients with AHF通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. A retrospective analysis of the Value of Endothelin Receptor Inhibition With Tezosentan in Acute Heart Failure Studies-1 and-2通用删除1(英):<u>(VERITAS-1 and -2； NCT00525707 and NCT00524433)</u> observed that longer lengths of hospital stay were associated with higher rates of 10-day readmission and 90-day mortality； these increased risks were mediated by the occurrence of in-hospital worsening HF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[78\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Nontraditional Risk Factors： Social elements in an individual patient’s life are also important for estimating the risk of poor AHF outcomes. Socioeconomic and psychosocial factors influence a patient's ability to adhere to their HF medication regimens and follow-up care， which may， in turn， affect long-term outcomes通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Indeed， among patients hospitalized for HF， having a lower socioeconomic status and being a recipient of Medicaid have been linked with higher risk of poor outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[79-83\\]</u>， as have broader factors， including living alone， lack of social and/or family support， and social instability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61，82，84\\]</u>. For these patient groups， risk models for predicting readmission may have only limited use in practice because the variability among stressful life experiences may outweigh the contributions of traditional risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Thus， when estimating postdischarge risk of poor outcomes， considering social determinants of health may be prudent and more intensive follow-up plans for high-risk patients may be necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61，82，85，86\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Management of AHF Postdischarge\n\n【34】The use of optimized Guideline-Directed Evaluation and Management (GDEM) for chronic HF is important following an episode of AHF to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. Ensuring that patients receive optimized GDEM postdischarge requires the development of an effective transition and follow-up plan before discharge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.In addition to the initiation and optimization of GDEM， the ACCF/AHA guideline recommends that clinicians address：通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the precipitant causes of HF decompensation and any barriers to care transitions； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> volume overload and symptomatic hypotension； 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> renal function and electrolyte abnormalities； 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> any comorbidities；通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> patient education， including self-care， emergency plans， and the importance of adherence； and 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> the need for palliative or hospice care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Unfortunately， this robust armamentarium of interventions is difficult to implement in routine clinical practice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[87，88\\]</u>. Therefore， multidisciplinary HF management programs are recommended for patients at increased risk for rehospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Risk stratification should guide postdischarge monitoring， follow-up， and the need for discharge to long-term-care facilities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，89\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Table 3： Clinical tools for predicting mortality risk in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated HF in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n| In-hospital mortality  |  | Postdischarge mortality  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Risk score  | Variables  | Risk score  | Variables  |\n| Adhere 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[65\\]</u>  | ·SBP·BUN ·Serum creatinine  | EFFECT： 30-day and 1-year mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[68\\]</u>  | ·Age ·Respiratory rate ·SBP ·Urea nitrogen ·Sodium ·Cerebrovascular disease ·Dementia·COPD ·Hepatic cirrhosis ·Cancer ·Hemaglabin  |\n| Optimize-Hf 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[66\\]</u>  | ·Age ·Heart rate·SBP ·Sadium ·Serum creatinine ·HF as primary cause of hospitalization·LVSD  | OPTIMIZE-HF： 60-day mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58\\]</u>  | ·Age ·Weight ·SBP ·Sodium ·Creatinine ·History of liver disease ·History of depression ·History of reactive airway disease  |\n| Gwtg-Hf 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[67\\]</u>  | ·SBP·BUN ·Sodium·Age ·Heart rate·Black race ·COPD  | ESCAPE：6-month mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[70\\]</u>  | ·Age ·BUN ·6-minute walk test·Sodium ·CPR/mechanical ventilation ·Diuretic dose at discharge·No beta blocker at discharge ·Discharge BNP  |\n\nADHERE： Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry； BNP： B-type Natriuretic Peptide； BUN： Blood Urea Nitrogen； COPD： Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease； CPR： Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation， GWTG-HF： Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure registry， EFFECT： Efficacy of Fluticasone Propionate/Farmoteral in COPD Treatment； ESCAPE： Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness； HF： Heart Failure； LVSD： Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction； OPTIMIZE-HF： Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure； SBP： Systolic Blood Pressure|删除段之间换行|Many advances have been made to the GDEM for chronic HF. Treatment for patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction is centered on diuretics to relieve congestion， neurohormonal antagonists (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors， angiotensin receptor blockers， beta blockers， mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists)， and devices to improve outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In addition， the use of vasodilator combination therapy has been recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality in black patients通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. A subgroup analysis of clinical trials from the 1980s to 1990s suggested that black patients had preferentially favorable clinical outcomes to vasodilator therapies that targeted the vascular endothelium (Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trials I and II) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[90，91\\]</u>. A randomized clinical trial designed to test this observation-the 2004African-American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT) found that Fixed-Dose Isosorbide Dinitrate/Hydralazine (FDIH) combination therapy added to ACE inhibitor therapy provided a robust reduction in the risk for hospitalization， mortality， and morbidity in a black patient cohort 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[88，92-95\\]</u>. Consequently， FDIH is strongly recommended for black patients with New York Heart Association classes III-IV HF with reduced ejection fraction receiving optimal therapy with ACE inhibitors and beta blockers， unless contraindicated (class of recommendation： I； level of evidence： A) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，72\\]</u>.\n\nMore recent therapeutic advances include the introduction of the Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitor (ARNI) sacubitril/valsartan， and ivabradine， a sinoatrial node modulator 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[72，96\\]</u>. The 2017 guideline update now recommends ARNI therapy as the preferred approach in suitable patients with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibition and who are receiving an ACEinhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker to further reduce both morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[72\\]</u>. In a randomized clinical trial， sacubitril/valsartan reduced the composite end point of cardiovascular death or HF|删除段之间换行|hospitalization by 20% compared with enalapril 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Additionally， in a randomized clinical trial in patients who were hospitalized for ADHF and were hemodynamically stable prior to initiating treatment， sacubitril/valsartan provided a greater reduction in levels of N-terminal pro-BNP than enalapril， with a greater reduction in N-terminal pro-BNP concentration evident as early as week 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[97\\]</u>. Furthermore， in this trial， the risk of the composite end point of serious clinical events (death， rehospitalization for HF， implantation of a left ventricular device， and listing for heart transplant) was significantly reduced i1nnpatients receiving sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril. To date， we can't be sure if the outcomes are mirrored in black patients as the representation in the study cohort was abysmal and included medicine practices that may differ between countries. Although the relative benefit of FDIH was more robust than suggested by ARNI therapy， the combination of ARNI and FDIH has not been tested， and the guidelines recommend careful monitoring of BP response. As such， it is unclear which agent to start first to achieve optimal evidence based outcomes. Ivabradine is recommended to reduce HF hospitalization for patients with symptomatic New York Heart Association class II-III stable chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction who are already receiving optimized GDEM and are in sinus rhythm with a heart rate ≥ 70 beats per minute at rest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[72\\]</u>.\n\nExciting new therapies are in the pipeline. Some study the benefit of treating iron in those with deficiency anemia. Some center on mechanical techniques such as Enhanced Extracorporeal Counterpulsation (EECP) that may show promise in oxygen delivery and enhanced exercise tolerance. Risk factor modification remains paramount. In particular， diabetes therapies with inhibitors of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 (SGLT2i) have reduced worsening HF requiring IV therapy， and cardiovascular death possibly as a class effect as demonstrated in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients with|删除段之间换行|HF. Additional outcomes of composite of hospitalizations for HF and cardiovascular death， a composite of worsening renal function， and the change in baseline to 8 months using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire are likely benefited with SGLT2i， but validation among ethnic groups and effect in new versus chronic HF remain elusive. Promising is that we see benefit irrespective of LV function， another testament to the drug class 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[102，103，104\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Conclusion\n\n【41】A wide range of demographic， clinical， and social factors place many patients at high risk for poor outcomes after hospitalization for AHF. Risk stratification is important to identify high-risk patients at hospital discharge who may benefit from more intensive outpatient management. Clinicians involved in the care of patients with AHF need to be aware that nontraditional risk factors and barriers to self-care， such as socioeconomic status， lack of social and/or family support， and social instability， should be taken into consideration along with established clinical risk tools and biomarker measurements to determine the appropriate intensity of follow-up care for their patients. Because each episode of hospitalization for AHF signals deteriorating function and increased risk of death， the optimal management of chronic HF to avoid acute decompensation is of paramount importance to minimize patient risks for poor outcomes. Proper identification of high-risk patients hospitalized for AHF prior to discharge helps ensure that they receive adequate follow-up and optimized GDEM to prevent hospitalizations and disease progression.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The Emergency Department has been identified by national organizations as an appropriate place to initiate smoking cessation treatment.\n\n【2】Methods： We utilized the Explorys database to identify smokers who utilized the Emergency Department for the years 2016to 2020. We queried the database for smoking cessation medications(MAT) including varenicline， bupropion， and nicotine replacement therapy. We identified characteristics associated with treatment.\n\n【3】Results： We reviewed 427，690 visits by adult smokers during the study period. Eight percent were over the age of 65 years. Twenty-one percent were prescribed smoking MAT. Patients prescribed MAT were more likely to be female and have asthma or COPD. African Americans were more frequently prescribed MAT than other groups. Self-pay patients were less frequently prescribed MAT. Patients with an acute exacerbation of asthma or COPD were prescribed MAT more often than those with those diagnoses without an acute exacerbation.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Within the limitations of this database， about 1/5 of ED smokers are prescribed MAT. Additional work on increasing this percentage is warranted.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Tobacco is the most abused substance in the United States. In 2015 it was estimated that the prevalence of cigarette use was about 15% of the United States population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The prevalence of tobacco use among patients who visit the ED is widely variable among the studies with numbers ranging from 26% to 41%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. One survey identified that about 70% of smokers in the US wanted to quit， about 55% attempted， however only about 7% successfully quit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Various forms of MAT for smoking are available and result in improved cessation rates. A prior review found that MAT along with counseling led to a 25% abstinence rate at 1 year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. A meta-analysis found that the use of MAT almost doubled the rate of cessation at 2 to 8 years after starting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Prior work has found that many Emergency Department patients indicate a desire to quit over the following 6 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\nA number of studies have investigated the role of emergency department intervention in smoking cessation. Prior evidence has indicated that interventions， generally involving trained counselors using motivational based interviewing techniques with or without medication assisted therapy leads to successful cessation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Several recent meta-analyses have found that emergency department-based intervention can lead to sustained abstinence up to 12 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. Not all studies have found a benefit to the initiation of MAT in the ED. One study placed subjects in two groups with one receiving a standard smoking cessation brochure and the other receiving Medication Assisted Therapy (MAT) along with other motivational resources 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. There was no difference in the overall decrease in cessation (13.2% control vs. 14.7% enhanced). In another study， patients were randomized to two groups with one receiving an American Heart Association pamphlet with the other receiving MAT and intensive counseling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The percentage of successful smoking cessation between the two groups was also similar at three months (10.4% control vs. 10.9%intervention). Based on evidence of the efficacy of ED initiated intervention， National emergency medicine organizations have advocated for tobacco control interventions to be initiated in the ED通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， providers in various settings have identified barriers to routine tobacco cessation counseling and intervention with six common themes involving lack of time， patient un readiness，inadequate resources，language and cultural barriers， patient non-compliance and inadequate cessation clinical skills by the provider 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Similarly， emergency physicians identify barriers related to time and|删除段之间换行|training as barriers to smoke cessation counseling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. While many emergency physicians ask about smoking， only about half of the time does that then result in cessation counseling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Studies specific to the Emergency Department setting have identified that providers are hesitant to conduct this training 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Many of the studies noted above were single center-based interventions or surveys. Given the health importance of smoking cessation and the national recommendations it is important to understand how emergency physicians are performing in initiating smoke cessation MAT. The purpose of our study was to evaluate a large database to assess recent performance in prescribing MAT.\n\n【9】Methods\n\n【10】The Explorys database is an IBM Watson Health product that utilizes a gateway behind each participating organization’s firewall. This collects a variety of data from the electronic health record， laboratory， and billing systems which is then de-identified and sent to the Explorys servers. The data then is standardized and available for searches using a cohort-based approach. The database contains information on millions ofpatients although the specific contribution of each health care system is not available. Prior work has validated the reliability of this approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【11】We queried the Explorys database for Emergency Department encounters from 2016 to 2020 listing a finding of smoking. So that we could identify prescribing by emergency providers， we excluded patients who were admitted or placed on observation status. Based on the age brackets available in the database we selected among adults age 20 years of age or older. The construct of the database did not allow us to specify any adult over the age of 18 without also including younger teenagers. The racial and gender characteristics are limited to those available in the database. We did not distinguish between the type and extent of smoking. Each study year from 2016 to 2020 was queried separately and then the results were summed. The database Wasqueried for prescriptions for bupropion， varenicline， and nicotine replacement therapy. We evaluated differences in baseline characteristics between those who were or were not prescribed one of these products. Those characteristics were limited to those available for selection in the database. We also evaluated differences in prescribing rates over the course of the 5-year study period.\n\n【12】Data was analyzed using Chi-square testing for categorical data. A Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated for changes in prescribing over the study period. The data is presented as the percentage and 95% confidence interval (in brackets). Our Institutional Review Board deemed this to not be human subiect research requiring their approval.\n\n【13】Results\n\n【14】We evaluated 427690 smokers of whom 91.2%(91.1 to 91.3) were from 20 to 65 years of age. There were more male (54.5%(54.4 to54.6)) than female patients. Nineteen (18.9 to 19.1) percent identified as African American and 11.8 (11.7 to 11.9) percent identified as Hispanic. A history of COPD was present in 10.2 (10.1 to 10.3) percent of the patients and 19.4 (19.3 to 19.5) percent had a history of asthma.\n\nOverall， 20.6(20.5 to 20.7) percent of patients were prescribed MAT. Fifty-three percent of the prescriptions were for nicotine replacement products， 49% were for bupropion， and 29 percent were for varenicline outlining that some patients received prescriptions for|删除段之间换行|Table 1： Comparison of patients prescribed or not prescribed MAT.\n\n|  | Rx for MAT  | No Rx for MAT  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age  |  |  | P<0.00001  |\n| 20-65 years  | 91%  | 92%  |  |\n| Over 65  | 10%  | 8%  |  |\n| Male  | 45%  | 57%  | P<0.00001  |\n| COPD diagnosis  | 21%  | 11%  | P20.00001  |\n| Asthma diagnosis  | 25%  | 18%  | P<0.00001  |\n| Hispanic ethnicity  | 5%  | 14%  | P<0.00001  |\n| African American  | 22%  | 18%  | P<0.00001  |\n| Self-pay insurance  | 24%  | 30%  | P<0.00001  |\n\n【17】more than one product.\n\n【18】The patients prescribed MAT were more likely to be in the younger age group and female. Hispanic identifying patients were less likely to receive MAT. African American patients were more likely receive MAT. Patients with COPD or asthma were more likely to receive MAT. Patients who were self-pay were less likely to receive MAT. Of the patients with COPD， 35.4% presented with an acute exacerbation. There was a significant increase in the prescribing of MAT to patients with an acute exacerbation (54%) versus those without an acute exacerbation (24%，p<.00001).Twenty-Four percent of the asthmatic patients presented with an acute exacerbation. Those with an acute exacerbation were more likely (62%) to receive MAT than those without an acute exacerbation (57%，p<0.00001).\n\n【19】We found a trend towards more frequent prescribing of MAT from 2016 to 2020 although this was not statistically significant(R=0.86，p=0.06).\n\n【20】Discussion\n\nWe have found that there may be additional opportunities to expand the Emergency Department prescribing of MAT. We are not aware ofsimilarlarge database analyses reporting onactual prescribing of MAT in the Emergency Department. There have been multi-center surveys assessing provider’s willingness to prescribe MAT. Once such multi-center survey found that prescribing for MAT was not an appealing option for emergency providers， reporting that about1/3 were willing to prescribe， although they were willing to ask about smoking status and refer for treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. While many emergency physicians identify health promotion as part of their responsibility， they also are not confident in their ability to change patient behavior通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Many ED patients are ready to change presenting either in the contemplative or preparatory stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Further， patients rate their|删除段之间换行|satisfaction with their ED visit higher when such interventions are offered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Although a small study， one survey found that only about% of ED patients who smoked were advised to quit and less than 10%were offered cessation assistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Educational interventions have been shown to increase tobacco counseling by emergency physicians. In one such study， a one-hour lecture increased the likelihood that emergency physicians would ask about smoking， refer patients to counseling， and document smoking cessation counseling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Prior studies have found that when the ED visit was due to a smoking related condition， physicians were more likely to engage in counseling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. This is similar to our results demonstrating that patients with lung disease were more likely to be prescribed MAT， particularly ifthey were there for an acute exacerbation ofthat disease. Women were more likely to receive MAT than men， consistent with other data reporting that cessation advice is more likely to be given to women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. This same study found that Hispanic or Latino participants were less like to receive counseling， similar our findings. Also， in that survey self-pay patients were less likely to receive smoking cessation advice， in line with our findings. We have found that African American patients were more likely to receive MAT. This is not consistent with prior studies， although it is consistent with data that African American patients make more attempts to quit per year than other groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24，25\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Emergency Department based studies of varying interventions have not found a difference in success rates based on age， gender， race， or insurance status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In a prior study from our group， we did not find a difference in smoking cessation success based on age or gender 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. We cannot determine from our data the reason behind the differences in MAT prescribing patterns. This database cannot differentiate between differences in prescriber patterns or patient acceptance of MAT prescriptions.\n\n【24】Limitations\n\n【25】This database query is reliant on the accuracy of the data inputted by the parent organizations. We cannot verify the accuracy of the smoking history. As the percent of ED patients reported to have a smoking history is on the low end of what has been provided in other studies， we may overestimate how many smokers received MAT. Whether or not physicians who document smoking history are more likely to prescribe MAT is not something that can be determined by this database. Bupropion can be used for other indications aside from smoking. We cannot determine the reason for the prescription from this database. We saw a lower number of ED visits in the database in删除4-1:<u>2020</u>. We cannot determine if this is from lower participation by the organizations that contribute data， or some other effect related to that particular year.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】Within the limitations of this database we find that there may be additional opportunities for emergency physicians to assist patients with smoking cessation.

To restore normal reproductive function， general health and well-being， we proposed to treat POF women with physiological Hormone Replacement Therapy(pHRT)， plus Melatonin (MEL) and Resveratrol (RESV).

We then started with a \"physiological-like\"schedule， consisting in mimicking a normal female cycle； i.e.， hormone doses and timing profile similar to the natural cycle. Because patient was thin， the lowest E， dose to obtain physiological E. levels was chosen. After a 3 month-pHRT combined with MEL (50mg/night) and RESV (100 mg/day) administration， peripheral hormone levels reached not only physiological values but also comparable to those seen on fertile stage， as well as a corresponding cervical mucus pattern and reported sense of “well-being\". Five months later， peripheral hCG and abdominal ultrasound confirmed spontaneous pregnancy， on time a healthy baby was born at term by natural delivery. Thus， pHRT and adjusted endogenous rhythm， due to MEL+RESV， could result in novel and multiple health women’s benefits. Therefore pHRT+MEL+RESV therapy should be strongly considered for treating POF/POI and perimenopausal women.\n\n【2】Keywords： Premature Ovarian Failure (POF)； Physiological Hormone Replacement Therapy ((PHRT)； Melatonin； Resveratrol； Chronotherapy； Menopause； Antioxidants\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Premature Ovarian Failure (POF)， a complex， heterogeneous and chronic female pathology， is characterized bylow E2 andhigh FSH peripheral levels before age 40 years通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and ranges 1% to 3% at reproductive age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

We now propose a treatment consisting in： Physiological HRT combined with|删除段之间换行|Clear evidence of a genetic background for POF and subfertility： Mother developed an early menopause (age 38 years)， two direct relatives (mother and sister) with autoimmune disease and 3 miscarriages interspersed with 3 born children being the last one naturally conceived under the herein reported treatment， pHRT+MEL+RES.\n\n【7】Melatonin (MEL) plus Resveratrol (RESV) that could help for POF/POI women with limited options to restore reproductive function.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 39-year-old patient， Caucasian， gravid 5 para 2 ， diagnosed as POF accordingly to E， LH/FSH peripheral levels (DPC， RIA kits) . She presented poor concentration， anxiety and mood swings， features that were previously misinterpreted. Family history： Early menopause， vitiligo and Graves disease， no evidence of autoimmunity， no abdominal surgery (normal HSG). Because patient's genetic background (50% Slovenian， maternal-line)， whom4.8% (approximately) display idiopathic POF in Slovenia， carrying a FRAXA pre-mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， indicating higher incidence than the generalwomen population (1%-3%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， genetic testtsSwere performed ruling-out this possibility (normal karyotype and 23/36CGG repeats in exon 1 of FMR-1 gen). She referred short-lasting cycles (24 days) since menarche， with appropriate duration for 8 to 9months after labor， but shorter cycles re-appeared.\n\nInitially， patient was advised to follow a contraceptive HRT because of two miscarriages. One-year later， due to intolerance， patient adopted an HRT (natural E2； 50 rg patches) during 28 days， and micronized P4 (200 mg ovules) throughout days 14h to 28h. Because fixed E， doses administration does not mimic E， blood levels seen throughout a physiological cycle， we chose to follow a more physiological schedule， meaning hormonal doses and elapsed time as in the natural cycle. Being she slim (1.65 m of height and 57 k of weight； BMI 20.94)， the designed protocol was adequate to mimic her menstrual cycle by using the smallest E， dose rendering circulating steroid levels closest to her own before diagnosis. Hormonal blood levels and detailed physiological HRT (pHRT) design are depicted in Table 1&2， respectively. A 28 day-cycle was accomplished， beginning with patches in progressive E， doses： 25， 37.5， up to reach 504g(mimicking ovulation peak)； thereafter， decreasing to 37.5 rg patch until cycle-ends. She received micronized P4 during the last 14 cycle-|删除段之间换行|days， and one-week hormone deprivation between cycles allowed menses. Due to severe mood changes， this free week was discontinued. Based on a chronotherapeutic approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， melatonin treatment (2h before bedtime) slowly increasing from 3 mg/night to 50 mg/night was indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. Potent OS inhibitor， Resveratrol (RESV) was also added to protocol (every morning， 100 mg) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u> to provide constant antioxidant milieu. After 3 months， peripheral hormonal levels achieved physiological values， comparable to those of a fertile stage . Thereafter， patient reported an expected sense of well- being， no-headaches， no-mood swings， with a normal pattern of cervical mucus. Despite complete relief of symptoms， treatment was suspended to analyze hormonal profile， and when found no-detectable E， peripheral levels， treatment was restored. Five months later， blood hCG level (125，637mIU/mL)andabdominal echography confirmed a9week-pregnancy， thus withdrawing MEL and RESV. Hormonal support continued by switching E， patches to pills (2 mg/day)， while keeping P4administration until reaching 12-weeks pregnancy . Finally， a healthy baby-girl was spontaneously delivered at term (3.93 kg，51 cm， Apgar 54 min： 10).\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】It is known that POF patients eventually ovulate and conceive(from 24% idiopathic POF patients， 4.4% achieve spontaneous pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>). Although few positive cases under HRT suggest that our proposal is more effective： Adjusted pHRT， plus chronotherapy could highly benefit fertility and pregnancy in POF patients wishing to conceive.\n\n【13】The evidence indicates that HRT is superior than contraceptive pills， for many reasons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， thus supporting pHRT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In fact， HRT has been indicated for years at fixed E， doses； conversely， following our protocol an average of normal hormonal female natural cycle is mimic.

As a consequence， the scheme begins with a low dose of E，\\ during the first week (1 patch of 25 pg)， continuing with a higher E， dose during the second week (37.5pg) up to reach a maximum dase of 50 pg of E， at the beginning of the3dweek (one 50 pg-patch)， thereafter decreasing to 37.5 pg-patch until the end of the 4th week. All patches were replaced every 3.5 days， for a total of 2 patches per week. Micronized Progesterone ovules (vaginal pessaries) were added every night beginning on the 14h (maximum E， blood level = the fake \"ovulation peak ). In this way， a 28 day-cycle was accomplished. Adopting a week of rest (no E， neither P) may be necessary or not depending on patient's response to treatment.\n\nIn this case， the lowest dose commercially available for E， transdermal patches， which delivers 25 pg/day ar 50 pg/day， although there are na reparts an patch|删除段之间换行|fractionation it was done in order to achieve the intermediate 37.5 ug dose by adding % patch to a full 25 pg patch. Still， it does not result clear from literature though|删除段之间换行|whether the patch fractionations (e.g. administering 0.25 or 0.5 patch) or different administration times (daily， weekly) are equivalent.\n\n【21】health 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> anduterine characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The so-called physiological Sex Steroid Replacement (pSSR) therapy resulted more effective than standard HRT (sSSR) in improving endometrial thickness and uterine volume， two important parameters to achieve and maintain pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， but do not reproduce physiological female cycle， a golden- goal\"of our applied treatment. In fact， it differs from ours in that neither takes into account women’s body type for E， dose nor in reproducing middle-cycle E， peak. Mimicking ovulation E， peak helps for developing a next period oocyte and sending correct feed-back signals within the HPO axis.\n\nFor reproductive medicine applications， this therapy may represent no risk， non-invasive first alternative for young women with POFwilling to conceive， instead of getting hyper-ovulation and ovary|删除段之间换行|exhaustion. Considering economic costs and the personal burden to avoid， because most patients will not accept egg/embryo donation， a first choice oftreatment like ours could be appreciated.\n\nAs far as short cycling， a previous study showed that women displaying early ovulation presented lower pregnancy rates than women with similar fertility problems but normal/late ovulation(28.1% vs. 59.4%， respectively) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Accordingly， although further research is needed， it is possible that our pHRT could：|删除段之间换行|1 Adjust cycle duration；\n\n2 Support follicular maturation and ovulation， and|删除段之间换行|31 Collaborate with endometrial thickness during luteal phase\n\n【25】By including MEL during pHRT could help to regain patient's normal circadian rhythm. Female hormonal levels oscillations through the menstrual cycle ensure fertility and proper functioning of several hormonal controlled systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. On this basis， it is accepted that around 40 years-age melatonin synthesis declines thus lowering peripheral MEL levels which affects circadian rhythm and sleep； moreover， adding MEL-therapy increases antioxidant defense thus ameliorating POF， a state characterized by a pro-oxidative ovary environment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and， in turn contributing with oocyte quality improvement. Previous data indicated that decreased ovarian reserve and premature ovarian aging， due to maternal undernutrition during pregnancy and lactation， increased endogenous OS and decreased antioxidant defense mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Otherwise， MEL offers anti-oxidant properties at the ovary level and upon a wide range of organs/tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23，24\\]</u>， even at higher doses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> in humans通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Melatonin’s antioxidant actions include non-genomic and genomic effects. Regarding the former， cattle oocytes cultured with melatonin show decreased cell ROS levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>； and immature mice GCs incubated with HO. demonstrated that melatonin protected luteinized GCs from OS in pre-ovulatory follicles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Regarding melatonin’s genomic effects， melatonin significantly increased implantation site number， brood size and endometrium thickness in mice at early gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u> by down-regulating E， but not P4 blood levels. This work showed that MEL up-regulated mRNA expression of HB-EGF (a growth factor involved in implantation) and its Receptor (EGFR) in blastocysts and， also uterus mRNA expression of Aanat， the melatonin's rate-limiting enzyme， increased while MT2was expressed on gestation day 2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. As a result， MEL treatment is a good candidate for protecting ovarian function and to improve fertility in enhanced OS-dependent reproductive pathologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. In humans， ovary-produced melatonin and MT2 contribute to follicular maturation and to preserve ovum integrity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.\n\n【26】It is accepted that midterm life’s ovary aging occurs while melatonin synthesis declines before FSH levels rise； indeed，melatonin treatment reduces FSH/LH peripheral levels in POF patients correlating with OS blood levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Melatonin benefits delays ovary aging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>， supporting that melatonin antioxidant-chronoregulator effects contribute to ovary protection. Additionally， melatonin treatment in peri-/post-menopausal women improves bone mineral density and turnover， and life quality in osteopenic postmenopausal women删除4:<u> 32</u>.\n\n【27】Normal aging implies free radicals’ accumulation producing DNA mutations， protein damage， telomere shortening and apoptosis. Increasing evidence demonstrate that resveratrol possesses anti-aging effects by influencing several signaling pathways， increasing anti-OS defense， and activating telomerase and SIRT1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，33\\]</u>. There are data documenting RESV antioxidant properties， including on OS-dysmetabolism， circadian clock， folliculogenesis， GCs luteinization通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u> and ovary damage by increasing AMH production and diminishing inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. In a DIO model， resveratrol alone and combined with melatonin counteracted increased body weight， glycemia， cholesterolemia， triglyceridemia， FFAs and hypertrophic adipocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. Given that SIRT's are markers of ovary aging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>， ovary reserve could increase by resveratrol. Because melatonin and resveratrol both modulate SIRTs in different cell types， it is plausible that sirtuins could play a key function in resveratrol and melatonin effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Conclusions\n\n【29】Our data support that this therapeutic approach，pHRT-MEL-\n\n【30】RESV， could benefit POF/POI patients wishing to recover normal reproductive function.\n\n【31】This work highlights the relevance of patient's medical history， including genetic assessment， for early and accurate POF/POI diagnosis. This combined therapy reproduces physiologicalhormonal levels and improves circadian rhythms by including antioxidant-chronotherapy， offering novel noninvasive treatment with multiple benefits for women’s health， even on different life-span stages.\n\n【32】In line with general recommendations on POI and menopause management，pHRT-MEL-RES could be applied in： 1) POF patients in order to give the hormonal axes a chance tobesynchronized， and try to conceive avoiding major interventions，2) elder POF/POI women(non-menopause) because pHRT+MEL could help to diminish peripheral FSH/LH levels， rise those E and preserve endometrium's architecture， protecting from OS by melatonin-resveratrol treatment should leave oocyte donation in unresponsive cases only，3) women at peri-menopause/early menopause onset provided that minimal hormonal dose， resembling their last physiological levels before decline. Moreover， the hormonal plus antioxidant protection could improve bone health， metabolism， psychological wellness and life-quality.\n\n【33】Summarizing， pHRT+MEL+RESV therapy seems effective when applied in POF， sub-fertile， women desiring pregnancy and in peri-menopause/early menopause women.

Primary spinal muscle cyst is a rare presentation. We report a case of hydatid cyst within paraspinal muscles presenting with cervical mass. The hydatid disease serological test was negative. Neither hepatic nor pulmonary cysts were found. Surgical resection was planned due to provisional diagnosis of muscular cystic neoplasm. During surgery， a cyst containing clear liquid was found. The cyst wall was excised and surgical field was irrigated with hypertonic saline. Postoperative pathological examinations revealed a muscular hydatid cyst.\n\n【2】Keywords： Hydatid cyst； Cervical； Muscle\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Hydatid disease remains an important health issue in livestock of developing countries where veterinary control is infrequent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Echinococcus granulosus and less commonly Echinococcus multilocularis are primary species responsible for hydatid cysts in humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. Humans act as an intermediate host and dogs as the final and definitive host 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The larval phase of Echinococcus penetrates the intestinal wall and is commonly transferred to the liver via portal circulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Consequently hepatic hydatid cyst is the most common. Primary soft tissue hydatidosis without hepatic or pulmonary involvement is a rare entity in hydatid disease. Especially paraspinal muscular involvement has been rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】We report a case of cervical paraspinal muscular hydatid cyst without identifiable hepatic or pulmonary hydatid involvement.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 40 -year old male came to neurosurgery department with one year history of a slowly growing occipito-cervical mass with mild pain on neck movement and no fever. Clinical examination revealed 7 cm× 7 cm x5 cm round swelling to be cystic and fluctuant with no local inflammatory response or spasm of the cervical muscles. Physical and neurological examination revealed no abnormalities. Chest X-ray and sonography of liver were normal. Serological testing for hydatid disease was negative. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed multilocular cystic lesion in right paravertebral region at C1-C2 level extending to posterior triangle， exhibiting low signal on T1W1 with high signal on T2W1 measuring 7.7 cm x 7.4 cm x 4.2 cm in size . The cystic lesion was round and well delineated by a wall that showed no enhancement after injection of contrast. Differential diagnosis of a cystic neoplasm or an infective lesion was made. Both clinical and laboratory examinations were normal. The patient underwent medical therapies including antibiotics， but his complains were not alleviated. His past history was unremarkable. The cyst was removed surgically through a posterior midline approach . Cyst was entered； it contained clear liquid. Multiple cysts were removed and the wall of the cyst was excised ； sent for histopathological examination. As precautionary measure the surgical field was irrigated with hypertonic saline to deal with spillage of cyst contents.\n\n【8】Histopathology revealed laminated membranes of hydatid cyst with surrounding reactionary inflammation (100X)， and squash smear shows laminated membranes ofhydatid (400X) too .\n\n【9】cited.\n\nThe patient was discharged under good surgical condition and Albendazole treatment was initiated in the early postoperative stage： 400 mg twice a day for 8 weeks. No recurrence was seen|删除段之间换行|at 6 months.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Primary hydatid cyst in soft tissue and muscles without hepatic or pulmonary cysts is extremely rare. A proposed explanation for this observation is effective filtering effect of hepatic and pulmonary circulation which traps the echinococcus larvae. In 10% to 15%of cases， however， larvae can escape from this filtering effect and form hydatid cysts in other organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Sener et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> provided an alternative mechanism for bypassing the hepatic and pulmonary circulation in formation of primary widespread spinal and paraspinal hydatid cysts. Based on presence of porto-systemic anastomoses in various anatomical locations， they proposed that the larvae penetrate the intestinal muscle and may directly enter the inferior vena cava system through small venous connections at the intestinal walls instead of entering the portal circulation. This mechanism probably explains the epidural location of hydatid cysts in our patient.\n\n【13】A palpable slow-growing mass is the most constant clinical finding in soft tissue hydatid disease. Symptoms related to their compressive effects on adjacent organs are another common finding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Overall， paravertebral muscular hydatidosis presents with non-specific symptoms such as edema， pain and tenderness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Thus physicians must be aware of this diagnosis in patients from endemic regions or with positive history of hydatid disease. Differential diagnosis includes congenital cysts， pseudocysts， cystic tumors， abscess and hematomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Our patient had mild pain on neck movement and was initially thought to be a cystic tumor on radiology.\n\n【14】MRI represents the gold standard for diagnosing spinal hydatid cyst. On MRI， hydatid cysts appear as well-circumscribed， cystic lesions， with CSF-like signal intensities. The cyst wall is usually thin and regular with no septations. The cysts are hypointense on T1-\n\n【15】weighted images. On T2-weighted images， they appear hyperintense with sharply defined， hypo intense cyst wall which shows mild enhancement following intravenous gadolinium， reflecting the vascularity of the pericyst in case of muscle hydatid cyst. But there is no contrast enhancement either in extradural or intradural hydatid cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【16】In our case serological tests before surgery were negative. Serological tests such as haemagglutinin， complement ffixation and ELISA may aid in diagnosis but are not positive in all cases of muscular hydatid cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Therefore complete reliance on serology for definitive diagnosis is not recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The hydatid cyst capsule may play a role in fast-negative results in serological tests because of isolation of the parasite from the host immune system by the cyst capsule. Another proposed explanation is inadequate Th-2 cell activation and cytokine production that is implicated in immunoglobulin expression in cystic echinococcosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Surgical removal is the most effective treatment of hydatid cyst通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Surgeon must be careful to avoid spillage of cyst to avoid fatal anaphylaxis， recurrence and multiple hydatidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. If presurgical diagnosis is hydatid cyst， preliminary aspiration and instillation of hypertonic saline (20%)， silver nitrate (0.5%)， formalin， and other chemical could be used to prevent seeding of the cyst contents and to inactivate the protoscolices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Therapy with nontoxic scolicidal agents or combination chemotherapy with Mebendazole is of therapeutic value in the treatment of patient with recurrence or a high risk contamination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. There was complete cyst removal with intentional aspiration of cyst contents and no spillage in the present case. Albendazole is suggested to be given post operatively for 1-3months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. We treated the present case with Albendazole for eight weeks postoperatively. The diagnosis of hydatid cyst is confirmed by histology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Histopathological evaluation shows three layer of hydatid cyst， the inner most germinal layer which is thin and translucent on gross. The embryonic tape worm， scolices develops from an out pouching of the germinal layer and form hydatid sand， setting into the dependent part of the cyst. The cyst fluid is crystal clear， as it is transudate of serum containing proteins and is therefore antigenic. The middle laminated membrane is white 2 mm thick and is easily ruptured. It is electively permeable to nutrients but not to bacteria. The outer layer or pericyst is a rigid protective layer with a few millimeters thickness， representing response of the hot to the parasite 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.Our case also demonstrates histopathological， a cellular， thick， lamellar cyst wall the surrounding host reaction， which I composed of the inflammatory fibrous tissue， form a dense pseudo capsule around the cyst confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】The case is a reminder that hydatid cyst should be kept in mind as differential diagnosis of cervical masses especially in countries where Echinococcus infestation is endemic. Imaging techniques， though sensitive cannot always pin-point the exact etiology of cystic lesion. Surgical resection is the goal and spillage of cyst content should be avoided.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

He presented in the Outpatient Clinic of Pneumology in January 2018 with complaints of weight loss， since 9 months before， and cough-syncope episodes following vigorous bouts of cough since 6 months before， with no fever or chest pain. He also reported hemoptysis since2 months before. He denied history of aspiration. Pulmonary auscultation revealed crackles in the left hemithorax. On investigation， chest- RX showed an opacification of the middle left hemithorax and chest-CT revealed a lingular consolidation with atelectasis . It was performed a bronchoscopy， with evidence of a white and necrotic plaque in the left upper division bronchi with signs of obstruction and bronchiallumen reduction， as also signs of mucosal edema and infiltration. The patient kept the recurrent symptoms initially described along the next 6 months， and there was also a radiological impairment in sequential chest-CT scan， with a higher extension of the lingular consolidation. It was performed a PET scan， with signs of metabolic activity in lingular consolidation (SUV maximum of 8，4).

Citellis abscess is infrequently encountered in patients with suppurative otitis media； the presence of LS in combination is a rare occurrence. Prior to the wide distribution of antibiotic use LS was an often-fatal condition. Though its prevalence has decreased in recent years， there has been a resurgence due to antibiotic resistance. Fusobacterium species have long been reported as the most prevalent organism in this disease. The presents of Proteus species as source pathogen has not been identified to date. Following early surgical and medical intervention the patient had a favourable outcome in this case. Difficulties in theatre time and access to imaging may have contributed to delay in diagnosis； however this did not lead to worsening morbidity.\n\n【2】Keywords： Lemierre's syndrome； Proteus mirabilis； Chronic otitis media； Citelli's abscess\n\n【3】Abbreviations\n\n【4】COM： Chronic Otitis Media； CT： Computer Tomography； ENT： Ear， Nose， and Throat； HIV：Human Immune Virus； Hb： Hemoglobin； LS： Lemierre’s Syndrome； PCR： Polymerase Chain Reaction； RNA： Ribonucleic Acid\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Chronic middle ear infections are the most important preventable cause of hearing loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Two cases of LS that have been reported in case reports in South Africa in the past 20 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Case Presentation\n\n【13】An 18-year-old male patient presented to a hospital in KwaZulu-Natal， South Africa； with a two-week history of a productive cough with yellow sputum with blood streaks， right sided pleuritic chest pain， fever， and rigors. He also reported a purulent left ear discharge with left anterior neck and posterior auricular pain. He has a medical history of multiple episodes of AOM that were treated with antibiotics at district level clinics in childhood. In 2012 he had Computed Topography (CT) that revealed chronic mastoiditis which was treated with prolonged antibiotics. He had recently tested negative for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and received all his vaccinations. This was his first hospitalization for this problem.\n\nHis vital signs on the day of admission revealed a temperature of 40.3C； a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with oxygen|删除段之间换行|saturation of 96% while breathing ambient air； a radial pulse rate of124 beats per minute； and a non-invasive blood pressure of 106/74mmHg.\n\n【15】His physical examination revealed lefttposterior auricular swelling with small posterior auricular lymph nodes as well as a tender， swollen left carotid-angle. He was pale however his cardiovascular examination was normal and there were no features of infective endocarditis. His respiratory examination revealed features of consolidation involving his right midzone and right lower zone， furthermore there was reduced breathe sound in both lung basis. His abdominal and central nervous system examinations did not reveal any abnormalities. He was diagnosed as septic chronic otitis media complicated by mastoiditis.\n\n【16】Case Management\n\nThe results of investigations done during this admission are summarized in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. Day one of admission， he was taken to theatre for radical mastoidectomy with incision and drainage. He received amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 1.2 g three times daily from|删除段之间换行|day one to three. On day three， his blood cultures grew P. mirabilis(PM) with sensitivity to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole， penicillin， cephalosporin and gentamycin. The amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was changed to ceftriaxone 1 g three times daily as he had worsening hyperbilirubinemia and cholestasis. On the fifth of his admission， his clinical condition had not improved despite directed antibiotics and surgical drainage； he still had tenderness and swelling at the left carotid angle with fever， dyspnea， tachypnea and on-going production|删除段之间换行|of blood streaked sputum. Four additional blood cultures and six sputum cultures were negative at this point. He was now assessed as worsening septicemia and his antibiotics was changed to piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin. Repeat imaging of his head， neck and chest was performed. The chest X-ray was repeated and it showed a cavity in right lower zone . The Computed Tomography (CT) scan found that there was reorganization of the abscess with transverse sinus thrombus . The CT scan ofthe neck and chest revealed rim enhancing collection in the soft tissues of the left peri-auricular region and deep neck tissues with an Internal Jugular (IJ) thrombus extending to the transverse sinus . The CT scan of the chest further revealed multiple lesions that were in different stages of breakdown with cavities . The transverse sinus thrombosis was an extension of internal jugular thrombus due to sepsis related thrombophlebitis and the distribution of his lung lesions suggest they were due to septic embolization from his primary site of infection. He was subsequently diagnosed with Lemierre’s syndrome secondary to COM complicated with mastoiditis and Citelli's abscess.\n\nOn day six， he was referred to Ear， Nose and Throat (ENT) department for emergency incision and drainage. His surgery was delayed because of the South African lockdown due to coronavirus prevention strategy. Surgery was performed on day eight after his initial presentation； he underwent drainage of post-auricular and Citellis abscess in theatre which evacuated fifteen milliliters (15ml) and twenty milliliters (20 ml) of purulent debris. His clinical condition showed marked improvement post-surgery. The respiratory symptoms and productive cough immediately ceased day one post-surgery. On the eleventh day of his admission， the intraoperative|删除段之间换行|specimen from two sites both cultured PM with similar sensitivity as his index blood culture from admission. The patient continued to improve and inflammatory markers normalized. The tazobactam/piperacillin 4.5 g three times daily was continued for 14 days and amikacin continued for 5 days after the drainage of abscess. During the course of admission， the patient had worsening ofthe mild anemia with Hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.2 g/dL that was seen at admission with a minimum drop to Hb of 8.1 g/dL. The anemia was a normocytic and normochromic anemia resulting from surgical blood loss， multiple blood sampling， and severe acute illness. The anemia gradually normalized after the septicemia had resolved. The lesions in his lungs improved with a six-week course of amoxicillin. He was counseled on anticoagulation and the decision was to continue anticoagulation tor 6 months.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Our patient had four positive cultures of P. mirabilis from different sites that were obtained at different times during his admission. P. mirabilis as an offending organism in LS is rare. Ninety percent of proteus infections are due to P. mirabilis， a gram-negative bacillus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This organism is considered to be a community acquired organism that is able to survive on solid surfaces 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. It is reported to be one of the common pathogens cultured in chronic middle ear infections and is also commonly cultured in patients with urinary tract infection in the setting of prolonged catheterization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，6，13，12\\]</u>. A systemic review from 2003 to 2019， found that P. aeruginosa， S. aureus， and P. mirabilis were there main reported pathogens associated with bacterial otitis media in the Sub-Saharan Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. P. mirabilis was found to be the culprit organism in 36%(18/50) adults with otitis media in Western Cape， South Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Furthermore P. mirabilis was also the most frequently cultured organism in a system review of 1，307 cases with otogenic brain abscess in 2018 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. During the initial stages of management， this Proteus organism proved to be a challenge in the treatment of the patient due to the uncertainty of whether the organism had resulted in the chronic mastoiditis or if it was a contaminant. This proved to be a challenge during the initial stages of management of this case. Due to LS being relatively rare， it was difficult to ascribe the patient's index clinical state being due to P. mirabilis infection and thus the choice to direct antibiotics as per cultures became an area of contention. In spite of five days of directed antibiotic therapy， the patient showed no clinical or biochemical improvement.\n\n【21】Prolonged antibiotics are suggested to be the mainstay treatment of internal jugular vein thrombosis in patients with LS. There is no suggested regimen of antibiotics as there has never been randomized controlled trials to assist with clear guidelines to the management of LS. Surgical removal of the thrombus was previously explored in the pre-antibiotic era but not in the post antibiotic era \\[6，71.\n\n【22】The presence of chest lesions and infiltrative liver function test with hyperbilirubinemia should alert treating physicians to explore the upper respiratory tract for a possible source of infection as delay in diagnosis can have near fatal consequences.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\nEarly diagnosis and initiation of antibiotics is key to the outcome of these patients. Knowledge about complications of middle ear|删除段之间换行|infections and Lemierre’s syndrome is vital for practitioners managing patients with middle ear infections.\n\n【25】Permission\n\n【26】The patient gave consent for the case report to be published.

Follow up is very important due to a markedly increased risk of pancreatic cancer. We report a case of a young man with episodes of acute recurrent pancreatitis， initially labeled as alcoholic related versus idiopathic but finally diagnosed ofhereditary pancreatitis due a mutation in cationic trypsinogen gene.\n\n【5】Keywords： PRSS1； Hereditary pancreatitis； Cationic trypsinogen； Genetic susceptibility； Recurrent acute pancreatitis\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Hereditary pancreatitis is a rare disorder that causes chronic pancreatitis in both children and adults with high penetrance in the relatives. There are different gene mutations and inheritance patterns related with recurrent acute pancreatitis in early adolescence， chronic pancreatitis in late adolescence or adulthood and a markedly increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Treatment of hereditary pancreatitis is similar to acute and chronic episodes and pancreatectomy could be an option in selected patients with severe pain due to chronic pancreatitis， especially in young adults. Here we report the case of a young man with recurrent acute pancreatitis with familial history of this pathology and a genetic base with hereditary pattern.\n\n【8】A 22-year-old man was admitted to our Internal Medicine Service because of abdominal pain radiating to the back， without fever， nausea or vomiting. He was first diagnosed with pancreatitis at the age of 19. Since then， he was admitted twice with acute pancreatitis episodes， related with heavy alcohol consumptions.\n\nThe day before admission he felt well and denied alcohol use. On examination of the patient， vital signs were normal and liver was not palpable but patient referred intense epigastric and hypochondrial pain during abdominal palpation. Laboratory findings showed white-cell， red-cell and platelet count normal， total bilirubin level of 1.3 mg/dL (normal value <1.2)， alkaline phosphatase level of 58 UA (normal value <150)， gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase of 14U/l (normal value <78)， aspartate aminotransferase of 24 U/l (normal value <45) and alanine aminotransferase of 24 U/l (normal value <72)， amylase of 1586 U/l (normal range 30-110 U/l) and lipase of 2927 U/l(normal range 8-78 U/l). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate， serum C-reactive protein， albumin level， serum triglyceride， IgA antibodies and IgG4 subtype level were within normal range. Antinuclear|删除段之间换行|antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed an enlarged and edematous pancreas with fat inflammation but without collections， necrosis areas or other complications supporting an acute pancreatitis not complicated with no evident cause. A moderate amount of free fluid was found in pelvis. There were no gallstones. Conventional treatments with intravenous fluids， analgesia for pain control and bowel rest were applied. Our patient improved in few days and he was discharged being asymptomatic.\n\n【10】A diagnosis of acute recurrent pancreatitis at an early age with no evident cause was made so， to complete the study， a family medical history was collected. We found that his father was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis at age 36 years with multiple acute episodes. With the suspicion of hereditary pancreatitis (HP) due to two members having clinically pancreatitis， we performed mutation analysis for serine protease 1 cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1). We identified p.Arg122Cys mutations in exon 3 of PRSS1 gene， which is a pathogenic variant related with autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis.\n\n【11】With the diagnosis of HP we strongly recommended avoiding smoking， alcoholic drinks， fatty foods， and physical and emotional stresses. Our patient doesn’t need multivitamins or pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.\n\n【12】During the subsequent months after the diagnosis was made， the patient developed two more episodes of acute pancreatitis not complicated， without evident cause. Since then， he has remained asymptomatic avoiding environmental triggers. Nowadays， our patient keeps rigorous ffollow-up in order to provide genetic counselling and prevent pancreatic cancer.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Hereditary pancreatitis (HP) is a rare condition defined as two or more individuals with pancreatitis in two or more generations of a family， with different pattern of inheritance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Several gene mutations have been described since first described in 1952 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Incidence of chronic pancreatitis is about 3.5-10 per 100000inhabitants and vear but incidence of HP still remains unknown. Clinical findings in patients with HP area similar to that non-genetic based， except for the age of disease onset. HP manifest at an earlier age than alcoholic or biliary pancreatitis and recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis， chronic inflammation， fibrosis， chronic pain and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer are characteristics of this disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. Diagnosis is suspected by clinical findings and medical and family history and confirmed by molecular genetic testing. HP is associated with mutation in cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1)，serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 gene (SPINK1) chymotrypsinogen C gene (CTRC) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>.\n\nAutosomal dominant HP is most often related with mutations in PRSS1with，atleast，80% ofpenetrance.PRSS1locateson chromosome7q35 and encodes trypsin-1 which is the most abundant isoform of trypsinogen in human pancreatic juice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5，6\\]</u>. PRSS1 pathogenic variants are found in 60%-100% of families with HP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，6，7\\]</u>. Different mutation and variants in PRSS1 have been described being R122H the most common. R122 is the primary autolysis site and constitutes a defensive mechanism against premature trypsin activation within the pancreas. R122H variant is determined by a G>A transition(c.365G>A) causing a missense substitution of histidine for arginine|删除段之间换行|in position 122 on exon 3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，6-8\\]</u>. Simon et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> describes that HP is caused by either a gain or a loss of trypsin function determined by the activation of recombinant Cys-122 mutant which alters stability ofcalcium binding loop andlead to an altered catalytic activity and an imbalance between protease-antiprotease equilibrium.\n\n【16】A high risk of pancreatic cancer has been described in HP patients above 40 vears old with an estimated ratio of cancer of 40to 60 compared with the general population， higher in smoking population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5，10\\]</u>. Genetic counseling to cancer prevention and early identification of advance precursor lesions using endoscopic ultrasonography associated to tomography is essential for the management of patients with HP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Treatment of HP (acute and chronic episodes) is similar to that non-genetic based. Pancreatectomy has been performed as a last resort to improve the quality of life in those with uncontrolled pain， particularly young adults and children and could be consider as a preventive technique associated to islet autotransplantation for selected patients at high risk of cancer. Finally， survival for HP patients is similar to general population when patients do not develop pancreatic cancer.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】Autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis is a rare， complex disease associated with genetic risk factors. Mutations of the cationic trypsinogen are the most common defects related to this entity and should be suspected in young people with unexplained recurrent-acute or chronic pancreatitis，especiallyiffamilial history of pancreatic disease exits， like in our case. Genetic counselling and early diagnose of pancreatic cancer are essential in the management and follow-upof these patients due to markedly increased risk of pancreatic cancer.\n\n【19】Learning Points\n\n【20】Autosomal dominanthereditarypancreatitis is a rare disorder caused by mutations in cationic trypsinogen gene.\n\n【21】Genetic testing should be considered in patients with unexplained recurrent-acute or chronic pancreatitis at early age and family history ofpancreatitis.\n\n【22】Hereditary pancreatitis patients have a markedly increased risk of pancreatic cancer so prevention and early diagnosis is essential during follow-up.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is considered as the third most common eyelid malignancy after basal and squamous cell carcinomas. It's almost exclusive site of occurrence is the eyelid but it has also been reported primarily in other sites， such as the parotid region. Among western population it accounts for <1 to 5， 5%， while in Asians it can be observed at about 31% to 39% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-7\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Sebaceous cells are predominantly present in meibomian glands of the tarsal plate， sebaceous glands of ocular adnexa (gland of Zeis)， sebaceous glands embedded in caruncle， brow and associated hair follicles of lid skin. The most common site of occurrence is the upper eyelid.\n\n【6】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【7】It has been reported as the great masquerader， due to its resemblance to other benign or malignant lesions. In the differential diagnosis chalazion， blepharitis， conjunctivitis， basal cell carcinoma， squamous cell carcinoma， leukoplakia， ocular pemphigoid and carcinoma in-situ must be concerned \\[1，5，8-101.\n\n【8】We report a case of a parotid metastasis originating from a carcinoma of the upper eyelid， diagnosed as sebaceous cell carcinoma. Diagnosis and treatment of this entity are described.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】4：1685.\n\n【11】An 80-year-old Caucasian woman presented in our clinic with a firm， painless， slowly enlarging mass at her right parotid area with normal overlying skin. The patient had no regional palpable neck nodes. She also presented with a diffused eyelid， thickening in the upper right eyelid， painful in pulpation.\n\n【12】In her medical history she mentioned type I diabetes under medication. The patient had no history of tobacco or alcohol use. In her surgical history， she mentioned excision of a mass of the right lower eyelid four years ago， diagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma of the skin of the eyelid， and which had been excised in whole， with histologically free margins ofexcision and depth invasion4 mm. The patient had taken no supplementary treatment for that tumor. Due to that history， the mass of the right parotid was considered to be a metastasis from the SCC of the eyelid.\n\n【13】cited.\n\nThe CT scans  and MRI of head and neck  indicated a compact mass|删除段之间换行|in the right parotid gland， with dimensions about 36 mm x20 mm. The regional lymph nodes were depicted normal.\n\n【15】Full staging wasperformedpreoperatively， in cluding radiographic control of the chest and ultrasound of the upper abdomen that revealed no distant metastasis.\n\n【16】Ophthalmic examination was also performed. Her visual acuity in the right eye was 1/10 in the central position and 2/10 peripherally， without diplopia， proptosis， and displacement of eye ball or limitation of extra-ocular movements. There was also extended conjunctival filtration. The left eye suffered from an operable senile nuclear cataract.\n\nUnder general anesthesia， a supraomohyoid selective neck dissection was performed， followed by a radical parotidectomy with sacrifice of the facial nerve and exenteration of the right eye ball. The periorbital muscles were left intact for potential prosthetic reconstruction and the deficit was closured with regional flaps|删除段之间换行|The histopathologic evaluation of the lesions revised the previous diagnosis of a squamous cell carcinoma and stated a diagnosis of a sebaceous gland carcinoma. This infiltrated the upper and the lower eyelid， either in situ  or invading the underlying stroma， showing well and poorly differentiated areas  and demonstrated a pagetoid spread to the bulbar conjunctiva . The excision was undertaken in histologically healthy margins. The lesion in the parotid gland proved to be a metastasis of the sebaceous gland carcinoma， demonstrating necrotic areas . An intraparotid lymph node， as well as a lymph node of level II in the neck dissection， among the total of 10 lymph nodes that had been dissected， were positive for metastasis of the above carcinoma.\n\n【18】C d\n\n【19】The patient underwent further radiotherapy and is under regular follow-up in the external unit of our clinic . There is no recurrence so far.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】Sebaceous carcinoma， Sebaceous GlanddCarcinoma (SGC)， sebaceous cell carcinoma and meibomian gland carcinoma are all terms used in the literature to malignant neoplasm of sebaceous origin. Sebaceous carcinoma is traditionaly classified into two groups： tumor arising from the ocular adnexa in the periocular area and those arising in the extraocular sites， which commonly involve the head and neck region， the parotid and submandibular glands， the external auditory canal，the trunk and laryngeal or pharyngeal cavities.\n\n【22】It is considered to be the third most common eyelid malignancy-after basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma-representing 1% to5.5% of all eyelid tumors. However， it is one of the most dangerous tumors， due to masquerading as inflammatory conditions， such as blepharoconjunctivitis， superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis or chalazion. It may also be misdiagnosed as other malignancies. The result is delayed diagnosis or wrong treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3，5，7-11\\]</u>.\n\n【23】In addition to its variable clinical appearance， a variable histologic appearance may also occur. As a result， delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis following biopsy is not uncommon. Evelid sebaceous gland carcinoma has a characteristic intraepithelial growth pattern， resulting from a pagetoid spread or a full-thickness replacement of the surface epithelium. The tumor may demonstrate well， moderately or poorly differentiated areas. The histologic examination may reveal a papillary or lobular growth pattern of neoplastic cells with evident sebaceous differentiation， or highly atypical neoplastic cells with prominent nuclear pleomorphism. Areas of necrosis and fibrosis are commonly found. The spread of the tumor in the form of infiltrating lobules， nests and cords is characteristic， perineural invasion is observed in about 20% of tumors， whereas vascular invasion is extremely infrequent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4，12-14\\]</u>.\n\n【24】The treatment of SGCs is adequate surgical excision with wide surgical margins and fresh frozen section controls. When the tumor diffuses the eyelid，orbital exenteration is required. Radical or selective neck dissection should be performed， to evaluate lymph node metastasis. Adjunctive radiotherapy or chemotherapy are necessary， depending on the stage of the tumor at the time of presentation， or when the surgical margins are diffused 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3，6，8，9，11，13，15，16\\]</u>.\n\nIn our case， the patient presented with a parotid gland metastasis. Given her history of a surgical excision of a squamous cell carcinoma of the lower eyelid 4 years ago， the parotid gland tumor was thought to be a metastatic SCC. Unfortunately， we had no chance to histologically reexamine the previous tumor， in order to clarify the incidence of misdiagnosis. In the histological examination of the present tumor in the eyelids， the characteristic features of a sebaceous gland carcinoma were observed. Furthermore， the tumor in the parotid gland demonstrated the same features， and was proven to be a metastasis of the above carcinoma， while metastases in two regional lymph nodes were also noticed. In the literature，there are only 3 cases reported with metastasis to the parotid gland， while the tumor most commonly metastasizes to the lymph nodes|删除段之间换行|SGCs have a high incidence of recurrence. Recurrence is a major problem and can be at the same site or at a different location. It is difficult to say whether it is a true recurrence or instead a new tumor， due to the multicentric nature of SCG. Well- differentiated tumors have a better prognostic outcome in compare to the poorly differentiated. Confirmation of pagetoid spread is another bad prognostic factor. Other adverse prognostic features include the involvement of both upper and lower eyelid， tumor size more than10 mm， orbital extension and infiltration of blood vessels and/or lympatics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3，7，8，10\\]</u>.\n\nMetastasis can occur by continuous growth， lympatic spread or hematogenous spread. The most common sites of continuous growth|删除段之间换行|is the orbit， the periaucular area and the parotid gland， as well as the regional lymph nodes of level I and II. Rarer is distant metastasis to the lung， pleura， liver， brain， pericardium， lips， ethmoid sinus and skull. The overall mortality rate is 5% to 10%， while in cases of metastasis the rate may go up to 25% and up to 41% in cases where the duration of symptoms lasts more than six months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3，8，9，11-14\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
