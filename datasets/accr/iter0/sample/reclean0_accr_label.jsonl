Its diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms； however， adequate anamnesis and imaging studies are required to reach definitive diagnosis. A four-year old preschool female patient was admitted at our hospital because of pain， progressive abdominal distension， and hematemesis in 6 occasions. Gastrointestinal barotrauma was diagnosed based on clinical data， imaging study and abdominal radiograph. The patient was subjected to asepsis and antiseptic procedure. Subsequently， an incision was made in the mid supra umbilical region that permitted access into the peritoneum. The peritoneum cavity was distended， and a perforation of 1 cm in diameter on the gastric body with an erosion of 5 cm on the muscular layer was found. The perforation was closed in two planes with vycril 3-0 simple and Lemberg stitches. Cephalosporin and metronidazole were started to treat abdominal sepsis. Six days after the surgery， oral route feeding was started and it was well tolerated. The patient showed good evolution. She was discharged after 13 days without complications. Currently， there is no algorithm for the management of gastrointestinal barotrauma. The management solely depends on the experience and skills of the interdisciplinary team in charge of the case.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Acute abdominal pain； Barotrauma； Gastric perforation； Pediatrics**\n\n【17】**Abbreviations**\n\n【18】**BT： Barotrauma； ABP： Arterial Blood Pressure； GBT： Gastrointestinal Barotrauma； BR：Breathing Frequency； CBG： Capillary Blood Glucose； HR： Heart Rate； NSAID： Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs； PICC： Pediatric Intensive Care Unit**\n\n【19】**Introduction**\n\n【20】**Barotrauma (BT) is a tissue lesion produced by a change in gas volume pressure in the body compartments， due to modifications in the ambient pressure. The gas pressure in any body compartment should be equal to the ambient pressure. In distensible body compartments， e.g the digestive tract， the imbalance in this equation can occur with ease. In such compartments， this situation can cause tissue rapture and bleeding when the free-flow of gas in and out of the compartment is blocked. BT diagnosis is usually clinical， and can be supported by imaging studies and adequate anamnesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Gastrointestinal Barotrauma (GBT) is a rare entity. It should be suspected based on the clinical presentation of the patient， particularly when there are predisposing factors such as the consumption of flatulent foods. The definitive diagnosis is reached with imaging studies portraying extraluminal free air and/or a fluid pool 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Perforation by GBT is an infrequent event in children. Most of the cases reported in children had been in the newborns with previous risk factors e.g. suffocation， prematurity， ischemia， congenital absence of gastric muscle or increased intraluminal pressure.Other causes of gastrointestinal perforation in pediatric population are peptic ulcer， nasogastric tube， positive pressure ventilation， eosinophilic gastritis and traumatic gastritis such as that occurring in the case of Heimlich maneuver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Gastric perforation should always be considered in all cases ofacute abdomen as possible diagnostic entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A four-year old preschool female patient was admitted in our hospital for presenting pain and progressive abdominal distension. Previously， she was healthy. The incidence presented 3 h**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Radiograph on admission showing extraluminal accumulation of free air in subdiaphragmatic region with displacement of lung base and upper hemiabdominal viscera.**\n\n【24】**Figure 2： Perforation of 1 cm in diameter on gastric body and erosion of 5cm in the muscular layer.**\n\n【25】**following the placement of a lighted air compressor hose in her mouth. Subsequently，she began with hematemesis， which occurred in6 occasions. In the ward， she was subjected to physical examinations， which reported the following： Heart Rate (HR) 128 bpm， Breathing Frequency (BR) 29 rpm， Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) 145/128mmHg， Oxygen Saturation (O，Sat) 96%， abdominal circumference49.5 cm and Capillary Blood Glucose (CBG) 313 mg/dl . Neurological examination revealed a tendency of drowsiness and Glasgow 14 due to discordant speech. At the circulatory level， signs of blotchy skin and integument was appreciated， while ABP was above99 percentile. In addition， there were excoriations of approximately 3cm on the chin， and the mouth cavity had traces of blood and perioral cyanosis. She was experiencing shortness of breath (dyspnea). The abdomen was distended， stiff and without bowel movement (lack of peristalsis)； thus， underlying peritoneal irritation. In addition， there was generalized tympanism. Data from laboratory tests reported leukocytosis， mild asymptomatic neutrophilia and hypernatremia. Abdominal radiograph was performed， and this revealed abundant gas in the gastric chamber.**\n\n【26】**Diagnosis and managemeni**\n\n【27】**Based on the clinical and imaging study data， intestinalperforation was diagnosed. Management was begun with prophylactic antibiotic therapy. The initial management consisted on administration of crystalloid solution at basal requirement， prophylactic antibiotic therapy and Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID). An inter-consultation was requested， and the patient was examined and evaluated by Pediatric Surgery Service. In the service， she was**\n\n【28】**Figure 3： Perforation of 1 cm in diameter on gastric body and erosion of 5cm in the muscular layer.**\n\n【29】**subjected to evacuating paracentesis with the objective of achieving abdominal decompression. Subsequently， diagnostic-therapeutic laparotomy was performed due to her condition.**\n\n【30】**Description of the surgical technique**\n\n【31】**The patient was subjected to asepsis and antiseptic procedure. Subsequently， an incision was made in the mid supra umbilical region that permitted access into the peritoneum， finding this to be distended. The abdominal cavity was checked and abundant collection of gastric fluid was found. This was eviscerated and drained. The area was explored without finding damage at the level of small intestine and colon . The stomach was explored and a perforation of 1 cm in diameter on the gastric body with an erosion of 5 cm on the muscular layer was found. The perforation was closed in two planes with vycril 3-0 simple and Lemberg stitches. Orogastric tube was inserted and left in position under direct vision.22cc air was introduced to corroborate the absence of leakage through hydropneumatic maneuvers. Penrose drainage was placed， and a second right subclavian central catheter was installed using the modified technique of Seldinger on the first attempt without eventualities. The patient was transferred to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) after the surgery where she stayed 6 days without any need of aminergic management. She was extubated with adequate respiratory automation. Due to surgical findings， antibiotic therapy based on 3 generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) and prophylactic metronidazole against abdominal sepsis were started. Six days after the surgery， oral route feeding was started and this was well tolerated. The patient showed good evolution during her stay in the PICU， and was moved to the ward of Pediatric Surgery Service to continue her recovery. She was discharged 13 days after admission without complications.**\n\n【32】**Discussion and Conclusion**\n\n【33】**Gastric perforation is an entity that is seen in both adults and children. The origin is attributed to different causes depending on the age of the patient. In adults， the most frequent causes of gastric perforation are peptic ulcer， obstructions， sepsis， traumas and neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In children， the etiology is even more complex for the age. In newborns， the causes that have been described are prematurity， defects in the gastric muscular wall， and the use of invasive or non-invasive ventilator 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In preschool-age， the entity is infrequent， and it is usually due to peptic ulcer， trauma， aerophagia or use of medications such as corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Iatrogenic gastric perforation， e.g.， closed trauma provoked by the placement of nasogastric tube could be another cause. In addition， increased**\n\n【34】**distension of the stomach due to positive pressure ventilation can result to gastric perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Apparently， the present case was a trauma caused by increased distension of the stomach due to positive pressure ventilation caused by the lighted air compressor hose that she placed in her mouth. However， when positive pressure ventilation occurs without tracheal intubation， it can cause increased cryopharyngeal pressure， leading to an increased dilatation of the stomach and increased intragastric pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. This mechanism gives rise to barotrauma， including pneumothorax and gastric rapture seen in less than 5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In the present case， the decrease in venous flow， probably caused by increased intragastric pressure， could have caused ischemia or infarction of gastric wall and thus， conditioned the gastric perforation. Gastric rapture has a mortality rate of 30% to 70%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>， in children aged 3 to 5 years. It is more frequent in the female sex. Anatomically，an incidence of the lesion has been reported in the minor coverture of the stomach owing to the lesser elasticity and due to the absence of folds in the gastric mucous membrane in this area通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Gastric rapture due to barotrauma is a rare and urgent entity. The suspicion should be based on the mechanism of the injury. Only in this form， we could offer prompt intervention， and prevent acute abdomen as well as avoid complications such as chemical peritonitis， sepsis and multiorgan failure. Currently， there are no statistical data on gastric barotrauma injuries， as well as algorithms for the management of the entity. Therefore， the management of the case depends purely on the experience and skills of the emergency team as well as on the surgeon in charge of the case. Despite being rare， it is an entity potentially lethal in preschool age， and in which good prognosis can be achieved if treated promptly. Moreover， in all cases of acute abdomen， this entity should be considered in differential diagnosis.**\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

SFTs are rare， with an incidence of 0.2/100000/year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Pelvic SFTs are even rarer， with only about 34 cases available on PubMed database(using the search terms \"solitary fibrous tumour\"， \"pelvis\")\\[2，3，7-25\\]. The 1 reported case of pelvic SFT occurred in the bladder and was published in 1997 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Other pelvic structures included： Seminal vesicles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， mesorectum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， perianal space \\[2，3，8\\] and other non-well specified pelvic areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13-18\\]</u>. Radiologic findings are non specific for GIST 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>， and they are often misdiagnosed with GIST.**\n\n【29】**Accurate preoperative diagnosis was evoked in 3 reported cases， where biopsy was performed in 2 cases \\[7，8\\]， and 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> F-FDG PET/CT with ultrasound guided biopsy were performed in one case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Some authors have described obstructive symptoms， such as pollakiuria通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>， urinary retention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> and constipation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. It's Noteworthy to mention that in 3 reported cases， hypoglycaemia was the alarming symptoms and was secondary to IGF-2 secreting cells. SFTs generally show benign behaviour. A recent large retrospective study， where 110SFT cases were reviewed， 10 year metastasis free rate was 55%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Predictive signs of malignity include： necrosis， high mitotic activity， cellular atypia and large tumors. Even though， the absence of these features would not preclude metastasis or recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Surgery with curative intent is the best treatment option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. While Liver SFTs are treated with 1 cm negative margin resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>， surgery with curative intent would be also the best treatment option for pelvic SFTs \\[2，3，7-25，27\\].**\n\n【30】**In some cases， neoadjuvant chemoradioterapy preceded surgical resection. To the best of our Knowledge， none of the previously reported anorectal cases were treated laparoscopically. In one case， excision was carried out during laparotomy， and in another one trans-sacral resection was adopted.

Braches oftrigeminal and facial nerve serve as the most common conduit for the process to occur. However features of nerve involvement are not unique to tumor spread alone. Opportunistic infections， inflammatory disorders and primary nerve tumors also exhibit similar imaging feature.**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Perineural tumor spread refers to spread of tumor to a distant location from its primary site using the nerve as a conduit. It is different from perineural nerve involvement which refers to nerve involvement at the site of disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Commonly vehicles for this process to occur are branches of facial and trigeminal nerve， however involvement of other cranial nerves have also been reported in past literature \\[2，3\\]. MRI is the modality of choice to identify features of nerve involvement， which include nerve enlargement，enhancement， destruction of the foramina through which it spreads and secondary features， which occur as a result of muscle denervation. These features are however not unique to tumor spread alone. Pathologies such as opportunistic infections， inflammatory disorders and primary nerve tumors also exhibit similar findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Perineural spread of disease is associated with poor prognosis and high rates of recurrence in malignancies and refers to aggressive version of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. A prior study revealed that in a series of 38 patients with perineural spread only 13%of radiology reports had mention ofperineural spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Mention of perineural spread can impact management in head and neck pathologies especially in cases of malignancies， where treatment would change from surgery alone to include wide field radiation， surgical resection and neoadjuvant chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Here we present a case of histopathologically proven squamous cell carcinoma involving the buccal mucosa who presented to our department for staging workup.**\n\n【14】**Case Presentation**\n\n【15】**A 39 years old male with no past significant history， no known co-morbid， presented to ENT O.P.D with complaints of nasal blockage， ear ache and numbness in facial region from 2 months.

He was further referred to department of radiology for MRI and PET CT scan as part of staging workup.**\n\n【16】**Figure 1： Axial T1 weighted images axial Section， showing abnormal hypointense Lesion (arrow) involving the left nasopharyngeal soft Tissue protruding into the nasopharyngeal Airway and the nasal cavity anteriorly.**\n\n【17】**Figure 2： T2 weighted image through base of Skull hyper intense signals in the abnormal Lesion involving left nasopharyngeal soft Tissues (arrow).**\n\n【18】**Figure 3： T1 post contrast image axial section shows heterogeneous enhancement within this lesion.**\n\n【19】**Figure 4： T1 post contrast image axial section， reveals enhancement extending along the branches of trigeminal nerve (arrow) up to the region of cavernous sinus (curved arrow)， involving the dura (arrow head)， without intra axial extent.**\n\n【20】**Imaging findings**\n\n【21】**MRI brain with contrast examination findings： Axial T1 image reveals a hypointense abnormal signal intensity lesion involving the left nasopharyngeal soft tissues which appears heterogeneously hyperintense on T2 weighted axial image (Figure2).

Since squamous cell carcinoma is the most common head and neck tumor， it results in highest number of cases with perineural spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【32】**Typical imaging features of perineural tumor spread are nerve enhancement and thickening which are well recognized on MR imaging along with abnormal uptake on FDG pet scan however these features are not unique to tumor spread alone and can be seen in infective， inflammatory and primary nerve pathologies as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.

We present a large epiphrenic diverticulum with clinical andpathological features ofa true diverticulum in apatient with achalasia， which was misdiagnosed as a hiatal hernia.**\n\n【15】**Clinical Sum mary**\n\n【16】**A 67-year-old female who had undergone a transabdominal Heller myotomy for achalasia in1973 presented with a 2-year history of progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids， regurgitation， cough， pneumonia and weight loss of 10 lbs. Chest Computed Tomography (CT) without oral contrast at an outside hospital showed a 10 cm pouch filled with debris above the lefthemidiaphragm， diagnosed as a paraesophageal hiatal hernia. The patient was treated with proton pump inhibitors without response. She was then referred by a pulmonologist to thoracic surgery for respiratory symptoms attributed to aspiration caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease and a hiatal hernia.**\n\n【17】**The videoesophagram at our center showed a dilated esophagus with absence of peristaltic contractions. The distal esophagus was angulated and was connected to a 10 cm pouch in the left hemithorax. The narrowing in the distal esophagus above the pouch resembled the gastroesophageal junction. The pouch was round and filled with debris. The stomach was decompressed and was entirely located in the abdomen. The pouch in the chest mimicked a large paraesophageal hiatal hernia as shown in Figure 1. CT scan with oral contrast showed a pouch filled with debris above the left hemidiaphragm， shown in Figure 2A，2B. Upper endoscopy revealed that the distal esophagus had transformed into a large， round pouch filled with copious fermented food， shown in Figure2C. A repeat endoscopy after 3 days of clear liquid diet， under general anesthesia to protect from aspiration， revealed a large pouch and no evidence ofhiatal hernia， shown in Figure 2D. There were no dual lumens， one into the diverticulum and one into the stomach， as are usually seen in a false/pulsion diverticulum. Biopsies of the cavity showed squamous mucosa. A motility catheter placed under endoscopic guidance showed absence of esophageal contractions and failure of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter consistent with achalasia. Because of the history of prior Heller myotomy via a midline laparotomy and potential adhesions， and the size of the diverticulum， the procedure was planned as a thoracotomy， diverticulectomy and possible partial fundoplication.**\n\n【18】**A left posterolateral thoracotomy in the 7h intercostal space revealed a distended diverticulum with retained contents， shown in Figure 3A. A nasogastric tube was passed for decompression. There were dense adhesions between the diverticulum and the pericardium， left lower lobe， aorta and diaphragm which were divided. The diverticulum was a large pouch in continuation with the distal esophagus and seemed to contain all esophageal lavers. There were dense adhesions between the esophagus and aorta which continued beyond the gastroesophageal junction possibly as the result of prior myotomy， but there was no visible plane of myotomy in the chest. The adhesions were divided and a completion Heller myotomy was performed distal to the diverticulum， extending beyond the gastroesophageal junction. The diverticulectomy was performed over a 48 French bougie using an endo GIA stapler and the staple line was imbricated with interrupted stitches. As the result of adhesions at the level of gastroesophageal junction in the abdomen， no partial fundoplication was performed. Endoscopy showed an easy access into the stomach， no retained food in the esophagus and no evidence of leak. Pathology showed presence of all three layers， including mucosa， muscular layer an adventitia， which confirmed the presence of a true diverticulum in figures Figure 3B，3C.**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： The barium esophagram shows a misread gastroesophageal junction (arrowhead) above a true epiphrenic diverticulum (arrow).**\n\n【20】**Figure 2：A，B) Axial and coronal views of the CT scan showing a 10 cm pouch filled with debris. C) Initial upper endascopy showing a large pauch in the distal esophagus filled with faod and fluid with paor visibility and a connection with the stomach at the level of the gastroesophageal junction (arrow). D) Repeat endoscopy after 3 days of clear liquid diet and under general anesthesia shows a clearer view of the esophageal pouch with squamous mucosa， only one exit inferior to the pouch via the gastroesophageal junction(arrow) and no evidence of hiatal hernia.**\n\n【21】**Postoperative video esophagram showed obliteration of the pouch， an easy passage of contrast into the stomach and noleak. The patient was started on a clear liquid diet on postoperative day one and was discharged home on a full liquid diet for two weeks. She was seen in our clinic on postoperative day 21， doing well， tolerating PO intake and had gained 2 lbs. She was instructed to have soft diet and advance to regular diet as tolerated. She will be followed in three months and one year after surgery in our clinic.**\n\n【22】**Discussion**\n\n【23】**Epiphrenic diverticulaare false diverticuullaa composed1of esophageal mucosa， caused by a hypertensive or non-relaxing lower esophageal sphincter and associated motility disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. In contrast， true diverticula are composed of all esophageal layers and are usually associated with mediastinal inflammatory processes such as tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【24】Figure 3： A) Intraoperative view of a large epiphrenic diverticulum with adhesions to the left lower lobe. B) Resected 10 cm epiphrenic diverticulum with 5 mm thickness. The external surfaces were congested and indurated. The mucosa showed alobulated architecture with focal hemorrhagic stippling. C) Pathology slide shows a true diverticulum with adventitia (top arrow)， muscular layer (middle arrow)， and squamous mucosa (bottom arrow).\n\n【25】**Symptoms associated with an esophageal diverticulum could be similar to a hiatal hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In our case， an unusual presentation of a true diverticulum as a roundpouch below the presumed gastroesophageal junction， resembling a hiatal hernia， made the diagnosis more complex. The anatomical location which was thought to be the gastroesophageal junction was probably caused by the combination of distal esophageal angulation and an outflow resistance created by the distended diverticulum filled with retained contents， creating a proximal a high-pressure zone. In parallel， the presence of the diverticulum， a marker of outflow resistance is probably the result of an incomplete myotomy and/or scar tissue at the level of gastroesophageal junction， creating a distal high-pressure zone. The presence of all three esophageal layers in the pathology specimen which proves the presence of a true diverticulum， confirms that the diverticulum did not consist of an out pouching of the mucosa usually seen in patients with epiphrenic diverticulum， but more likely because of gradual dilation of the distal esophagus with all its three layers， possibly as the result of an incomplete Heller myotomy. The rare presentation increases the diagnostic complexity， hence the reason for misdiagnosis as a paraesophageal hiatal hernia.**\n\n【26】**This case emphasizes the importance of a thorough assessment of patients with esophageal disease. Particularly a true diverticulum without evidence of an inflammatory process in the mediastinum， an unusual location of the presumed gastroesophageal junction， and the transformation of the distal esophagus into a large true diverticulum mandated a comprehensive evaluation. The use of complementary diagnostic tools allowed correct diagnosis and treatment of a raretrue epiphrenic diverticulum， misdiagnosed as a hiatal hernia， which was treated via left thoracotomy， diverticulectomy and completion Heller myotomy with good outcome.**\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

They have been found in various areas including the base of tongue， esophagus and pancreas and have required bedside procedures， endoscopy or open surgery to remove them. Some have been conservatively managed.**\n\n【16】**Clinical Presentation： We report a case of a 61-year-old lady who presented to the emergency department after eating grilled salmon with CT evidence of esophageal perforation with the distal end of the wire immediately posterior to the right common carotid artery. This was removed endoscopically， and the wire bristle passed through the small bowel and colon safely.**\n\n【17】**Conclusion： This case demonstrates again the dangers of wire brushes in food preparation and the importance of careful inspection of the wire brush prior to usage and the food before consumption.**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**Foreign body ingestions are a relatively common presentation to the emergency department with coins being the most common ingested item in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and fish bones being the most common in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

Moreover， they are difficult to see， easily get attached or embedded into food and have been found difficult to localize and visualize by the clinician making them a challenge to treat.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 61-year-old lady presented to the emergency department having felt something catch in her throat immediately after eating a salmon steak that had been cooked on a grill. Her husband had cleaned the grill with a wire brush recently. This is on a completely unremarkable medical history. She was on no regular medications， did not smoke and did not have significant alcohol intake.**\n\n【23】**She did not have any signs of airway distress however she complained of pain over the right side ofher neck especially with swallowing saliva. There was no subcutaneous emphysema on palpation. An X-ray noted a thin linear dense obiect placed horizontally in the post-cricoid esophagus. It measured 34mm in length，half a millimeter in width.**\n\n【24】**This was followed up with a CT scan which found a foreign body perforating the right lateral esophagus with its distal tip immediately related to the posterior aspect of the right common carotid artery . There was no hematoma around this site. Flexible endoscopy under general anesthesia found only a small section of the metallic bristle still within the lumen of the esophagus. Removal was attempted with an endoscopic biopsy forceps however this proved difficult due to the angle in which it was embedded into the esophageal wall and the short segment of wire available for manipulation. After multiple attempts the portion of wire within the lumen of the esophagus was no longer visible on endoscopy.**\n\n【25】**There was concern that the wire had been pushed in deeper into the neck tissue so a CT neck with contrast was performed to assess its position and exclude damage to any vascular structures. Fortunately， this found that the foreign body was no longer in the neck and there was no sign of a bleed at its previous site. An abdominal X-ray found that it had been pulled out of the esophagus**\n\n【26】Figure 1： 34 mm wire bristle in cervical esophagus.\n\n【27】**Figure 2： Attempted endoscopic removal of bristle.**\n\n【28】Figure 3： Wire bristle found to have dropped into stomach.\n\n【29】**and had dropped into the stomach .

Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) closure in cases of coexisting left ventricular dysfunction and/orleft valvular disease carries the risk ofpulmonary congestion，hence implantation of a fenestrated device is a therapeutic option in these cases. We present a symptomatic 74-year-old patient with a large secundum ASD and concomitant moderate to severe mitral regurgitation， pulmonary hypertension， as well as severe tricuspid regurgitation. After thorough analysis of possible treatment options by the Heart Team， atranscatheter ASD closure by using a self-fabricated fenestrated CeraFlex ASD occluder (LifeTech Scientific Co.，Shenzhen， China) was performed. This led to a significant reduction of the tricuspid regurgitation and amelioration of patient symptoms. This unique case underlines the feasibility， safety and efficacy of a hand-made fenestrated device for ASD closure in patients with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Atrial septal defect； Mitral regurgitation； Tricuspid regurgitation； Pulmonary hypertension； Fenestrated occluder device**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) constitutes a congenital heart lesion commonly found not only in the pediatric population but also in adults， mainly because they may remain asymptomatic until adulthood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. When symptoms develop， they usually present as exertional dyspnea， fatigue or palpitations indicative of cardiac arrhythmia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. If left untreated the ASD may lead to right heart failure. Recent guidelines recommend ASD closure in cases of enlargement of the Right Ventricle(RV)， provided there is no irreversible Pulmonary Hypertension (PHTN) or Left Ventricular (LV) disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Elderly people with ASD frequently have concomitant LV disease and PHTN due to comorbidities such as left chamber valvular disease or arterial hypertension leading to LV diastolic dysfunction. This carries the risk of acutely developing congestive heart failure after ASD closure and renders the benefit of the procedure in this population uncertain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-6\\]</u>. Most recent data suggest that ASD closure， even at an advanced age， can lead to favorable cardiac remodeling as well as to functional class improvement， mentioning however that partial occlusion with a fenestrated device could be better tolerated in selected patients with significant LV disease/PHTN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-11\\]</u>.**\n\n【18】**We report the management ofan elderlypatient， inoperable by conventional surgical techniques， with a large secundum ASD and elevated LV filling pressures due to moderate to severe Mitral Regurgitation (MR).**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**A 75-year-old woman was admitted to our Center complaining of severe dyspnea on exertion and swelling of lower extremities. Her past medical history included permanent atrial fibrillation， a known large secundum ASD， chronic kidney disease and a recent hospitalization for dyspnea which responded to intravenous diuretics. On admission， physical examination revealed a 3/6 systolic murmur at the lower sternal border， bilaterally decreased breath sounds， a palpable liver and severe lower limb edema. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with right axis deviation and a narrow QRS. NT-proBNP levels were remarkably elevated (3.236 pg/ml- upper limits 125 pg ml). Transthoracic (TTE) and Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) confirmed the presence of a secundum ASD with a significant left to right shunt and prolapse of the anterior mitral valve leaflet**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram views showing a large secundum atrial septal defect (A)， with left to right shunt (B)， prolapse of A2 scallop of the anterior mitral valve leaflet (C) leading to a moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (D).

The RV was dilated with moderately reduced systolic function \\[RV systolic excursion velocity(RVS) 8 cm/sec\\]， while the Left Ventricle showed preserved Ejection Fraction (LVEF 55%) and D-shape morphology due to volume overload . Furthermore， severe TR was documented(EROA 0.4 cm)， caused by dilation of the tricuspid valve annulus and volume overload dueto the presence ofthe ASD .Right-heart catheterization showed mainly post-capillary PHTN (mean pulmonary artery pressure 38 mmHg， wedge pressure： 25 mmHg， pulmonary vascular resistance 3.17 and 2 WU pre and post oxygen administration respectively) and a hemodynamically significant ASD with a calculated Qp/Qs of 2.1. Coronary angiography revealed minimal non-obstructive CAD. Being a high surgical risk patient for combined intervention on mitral，tricuspid valve and ASD (Euroscore II 8.54)， the Heart Team suggested the transcatheter management. An initial intervention for tricuspid regurgitation was considered redundant due to its secondary nature. Transcatheter mitral Edge-to-Edge Repair (TEER) was also rejected as a first-line therapeutic option because of the expected instability of the clip delivery system**\n\n【28】**Consequently， ASD closure was decided as a first-line of intervention， with possible transcatheter mitral/tricuspid repair later， if needed. Following latest guidelines， a balloon occlusion testing with simultaneous right atrial， pulmonary arterial， Pulmonary Capillary Wedge (PCWP) and left ventricular measurements was conducted before ASD closure revealing a 7 mmHg (from 23 to 30mmHg) increase in PCWP without signs or symptoms of pulmonary oedema . However， due to the elevated wedge pressure， it was decided to use a fenestrated device. The fenestration was self-fabricated by creating a 4 mm-diameter hole in the 22 mm CeraFlex occluder device that was chosen . The device was placed uneventfully.**\n\n【29】**Results**\n\n【30】**After the procedure， the patient remained in good clinical condition without signs or symptoms of LV decompensation. TTE performed on the first postoperative day revealed a whiff of left to right flow through the created hole. Two months later the patient reported remission of the peripheral oedema and significant clinical improvement (now being in functional NYHA I class).

They stress however that creating a fenestration in the occlusion device may prevent such abrupt hemodynamic changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.**\n\n【40】**ASD with significant left to right shunt has been related to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality and current evidence suggests that all ASDs associated with RV dilatation should be considered for closure irrespective of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The recent guidelines state that closure can improve patient's clinical and functional status at any age， particularly when it is performed by catheter intervention通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Moreover， recent developments in closure devices have rendered the transcatheter approach as the treatment of choice in these cases通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12-14\\]</u>.**\n\n【41】**Patients with ASD and PHTN must be carefully evaluated by right heart catheterization and Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR) must be calculated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Generally， in patients with PVR <5 Wood Units(WU)， ASD closure is considered safe and associated with a favorable prognosis and a gradual decrease in PHTN. However， even when PVR is <5 WU， patients with PHTN undergoing ASD closure have worse outcome compared to patients without 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Partial occlusion with fenestrated devices has also been suggested as an option in these patients with promising results \\[9，16\\]. In a recent review the efficacy of fabricated devices was reported in more than 40 patients with LV dysfunction and/or PHTN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However， none of these published cases had concomitant severe MR and in none of them a CeraFlex occluder device was used， as in our case.**\n\n【42】**In patients with LV dysfunction， ASD closure can lead to acute hemodynamic changes， increased LV filling pressures and pulmonary congestion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In these cases， a balloon occlusion test before the actual closure for pressure reassessment is recommended， in order to decide among complete， fenestrated or no closure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. There are no clear recommendations on how to interpret the balloon occlusion test results. Most authors agree that an increase in PCWP of more than**\n\n【43】**TEERiiss aaprocedure of evident safety and efficacy for symptomatic patients with severe MR， who are judged inoperable or of high surgical risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Although performed through a transeptal**\n\n【44】**approach， the coexistence of a large ASD， as in our patient， creates special technical problems leading to instability of the clip delivery system. In a published case report of a patient with concomitant mitral regurgitation and ASD， the access to the left atrium for clip delivery was achieved not through the defect but via a separate transseptal puncture posteriorly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. A similar approach was entertained in our patient but was considered as non-attainable due to the small dimensions of the posterior septal wall.**\n\n【45】**Overall，theoptimaltreatment for our， inoperablebyconventional means， elderly patient with large ASD， coexisting moderate to severe MR and severe TR as well as a dilated RV， was debatable. After rejecting transcatheter intervention for mitral regurgitation and based on the above-mentioned evidence， ASD closure was decided as the first-line of treatment， with the possibility of a later TEER through the occlusion device. Considering the results of the balloon occlusion test， we opted for a self-fabricated fenestrated device in order to unload the left chamber pressures. The best way of creating a fenestration in the occlusion device as well as its optimal size have not yet been clarified. In previous reported cases fenestrations were made with a fixed surgical opening in the device's nitinol mesh or with the placement of a stent to ensure long term patency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In our patient， following the example of other operators， we decided to manually fenestrate the CeraFlex device， accepting the possibility of gradual endothelization with eventual closure， which is not necessarily unfavorable.On the one hand its closure may lead to further decrease of PHTN， while on the other hand it may decrease the possibility of a paradoxical embolism \\[9，16\\]. Judging by the significant clinical improvement， at least in the short term， our therapeutic approach is justified.**\n\n【46】**Conclusion**\n\n【47】**This case report suggests that transcatheter use of a self-fabricated fenestrated CeraFlex occluder in an inoperable elderly patient with combined secundum ASD， moderate to severe MR and severe TR seems to be feasible， safe and offers clinical improvement.**\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

While the procedure is more common in the Pediatric age group， it is also quite common in the adult population for problems such as recurrent acute pharyngitis and chronic tonsillitis， suspicion of malignant disease， and refractory halitosis. There are many well-known adverse outcomes of tonsillectomy. However， hypocalcaemia and hypoparathyroidism are not well described.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 28-year-old female presented to emergency department with a chief complaint of bleeding coming from her pharynx eight days after having an uncomplicated tonsillectomy. Herhemoglobin level was 84 g/L， likely indicating significant blood loss (there was no preoperative hemoglobin for comparison， as the patient was healthy and did not receive a preoperative or postoperative blood count). The patient was not coughing or vomiting any blood， was not bleeding anywhere else， and did not have any fever. The patient was taken to operating room， where a pumping vessel was visualized between the right-sided oropharyngeal muscles and subsequently cauterized with suction. Several sutures of 3-0 vicryland 3-0 chromic were placed in a figure-of-eight. Besides minor blood lost during the procedure， 200 mL of swallowed blood was aspirated from the stomach via nasogastric suction.**\n\n【17】**Two hours postoperatively， the patient complained of new-onset tingling in her fingers. She did not have any other symptoms of hypocalcaemia such as perioral tingling or numbness. Her serum calcium level returned at 6.9 mg/dL (reference 8.5 to 10.5 mg/dL). The patient received one gram of calcium gluconate intravenously which resolved her symptoms. Twelve hours post-operatively， more complete labs were drawn which showed a serum calcium level of 8.3 mg/dL， phosphate2.6 mg/dL (reference 2.5 to 4.5)， magnesium 1.5 mEq/L (reference 1.3 to 2.1)， total 25-hydroxy vitamin D 12.2 ng/mL (reference 25.0 to 80.0)， parathyroid hormone level 9.5 pg/mL (reference 14to 55.7 pg/mL)， thyroid stimulating hormone 0.25 IU/mL (normal 0.35 to 4.01)， free T3 2.6 pg/mL(reference 2.8 to 4.4)， and free T4- 0.83 ng/mL (reference 0.61 to 1.37). The patient had not been transfused any blood at any time (as her hemoglobin was always above 85 g/L)， nor did she receive any intravenous fluids other than Ringer's lactate， which at our hospital， contains 200 mg (2.7mEq) of calcium chloride per liter and would be expected to forestall any hypocalcaemia.**\n\n【18】**Outcome and Follow-Up**\n\n【19】**The patient was discharged two days afterwards and did well without any further symptoms. At**\n\n【20】**the time of discharge， total serum calcium level was 8.11 mg/dL. One month after discharge， her serum ionized calcium level was checked in lieu of the total calcium， and it returned 1.13 mMol/L (normal 1.1to 1.3). TSH was normal 1.17 uIU/mL， and hemoglobin level was marginally low at 11.9 g/dL.**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**Include a very brief review of similar published cases：**\n\n【23】**Although about 1.5% ofadults are reported to have bleeding after tonsillectomy and 20% of adults have some other complication such as pain， postoperative nausea and vomiting， delay to oral intake， or airway obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， to the best of our knowledge， hypocalcaemia following tonsillectomy is not typical. It is quite common for physiological stress to cause thyroid hormone abnormalities， but this hasn’t been as recognized with parathyroid hormone levels. We suspect that the bleeding and cauterization in the proximity of the parathyroid glands may have interfered with parathyroid function and resulted in hypocalcaemia.**\n\n【24】**Studies sshowed that rats _P_ post-parathyroidectomy have demonstrated survival benefit after implantation of differentiated human tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. So，putting these two things together， tonsil and parathyroid mesenchyme may have related origins**\n\n【25】**Learning Points**\n\n【26】**Hypocalcaemia occurs oftentimes after neck surgery and can have many etiologies， such as blood transfusions (blood**\n\n【27】**anticoagulants such as citrate may chelate calcium)， volume repletion with intravenous fluids which do not contain calcium (such as sodium chloride)， and sepsis.**\n\n【28】**The most common cause of chronic hypoparathyroidism is an injury to the parathyroid glands， such as head and neck surgery.**\n\n【29】**This case is unusual because tonsillectomies are not typically associated with acute hypocalcaemia or hypoparathyroidism.**\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

William’s Syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental， multisystem genetic disorder characterized by distinctive personality traits， facial dysmorphisom(elfin facell) and congenital cardiac defects， of which supravalvular aortic stenosis is the most common lesion found.

WS is a rare familial multisystem disorder occurring in 1 per 20，000 live births.**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**William’s Syndrome (WS) is a rare but well recognized neurodevelopmental disease affecting the connective tissue and the central nervous system. It also affects cardiovascular system and eye. The syndrome was first described in 1961 by Newzealander JCP Williams \\[1，2\\]. It is caused by deletion of about 26 genes from the long arm of chromosome 7 and it occurs 1 in 7，500 to 1 in20，000 live birth \\[3，4\\]. The underlying molecular mechanism is a submicroscopic chromosomal deletion involving the elastin gene (ELN) at 7q11.23 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It is present at birth and affects boys and girls equally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. WS having infantile hypercalcamia， hoarseness of voice， hyperacusis， endocrine abnormalities， growth retardation， orthopedic problems and renal abnormalities may also be associated \\[6，7\\]. Due to variability in the clinical findings， diagnosis is usually made during mid-childhood when the characteristics facial features， cognitive profile and cardiac findings become more apparent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Beuren in 1964 independently described the syndrome noting also typical dental anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【14】**Case Presentation**\n\n【15】**A 7-years old boy diagnosed Williams Syndromeby clinically with the help ofsome investigations. This boy actually referred from eye hospital for preoperative (Dacrocystorhinostomy/DCR operation) cardiac consultation. The child was having large forehead， small chin， puffiness around the both eyes， nose upturned， long philtrum looks like-elfin faciesll associated with malocclusion of multiple teeth with Dental carries. He was of low IQ as he was in the same class for 3 years with stunted growth， height 125 cm， weight 22 Kg. Precordial examination revealed systolic thrill and systolic murmur (Grade-4/6) in the base of the heart.**\n\n【16】**His past history was not contributory except for few episodes of respiratorytract infections since childhood. In the other family members， evidence of congenital anomaly or mental retardation was not found. According to primary symptoms， clinical finding such as dysmorphic facies， cognitive disorder and congenital supravalvular aortic stenosis， dental mal-occlusion and eye problem(Lacrimal duct not patent)， WS was the first diagnosis.**\n\n【17】**Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> leads ECG shows normal findings. Echocardiogram showed normal chamber size， normal aortic valve leaflet but supravalvular aortic stenosis due to narrowing of ascending aorta (PPG128mmHg) & prolapse of anterior mitral leaflet ， other valvular structure and pulmonary artery were normal. Other laboratory parameter， like Hb%， ESR， Serum Calcium level was normal. We suggest a more attention for evaluating heart murmur in childhood period， especially when the patient has abnormal facial features or mental problem .**\n\n【18】**Figure 4： Normal ECG tracing.**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： Elfin faces.**\n\n【20】**Figure 2： Echocardiogram shows supravalvular aortic Stenosis & MVP.**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**Williams’s syndrome is a rare familial multisystem disorder occurring in 1 per 20，000 live births. It is characterized by congenital heart defects (CHD)， Skeletal and renal anomalies， cognitive disorder， socialpersonality disorder and dysmorphic facies. WS is characterized by the triad， supravalvular aortic stenosis (AS)， mentalretardation and elfin facies. In addition， mild microcephaly， neurologic dysfunction， auditory hyperacusis， narrowing of the peripheral systemic and pulmonary arteries， inguinal hernia， strabismus， epicanthic folds， abnormalities of dental development， high prominent forehead may be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In addition to typical facial features， patients with WS have a characteristic ebullient personality profile that is classically referred to as the cocktail personality. Patients with WS are hypersocial and garrulous and have a relative verbal strength that belies a mean IQ of 50 to 60 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Patients 50% to 90% meet diagnostic**\n\n【23】**criteria for anxiety disorder， attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder， or phobic disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Children with WS are overly social and outgoing， inappropriately friendly to adults and unwary of strangers. Hypercalcemia， which was a prominent features in the report of Bongiovanni et al.， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> has been reported to occur in up to 50% of patients with WS but this usually resolves without intervention in the first two years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. WS babies typically have a low birth weight and are often diagnosed as failing to thrive. Cardiovascular defects are the most common cause of death in patients with WS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Structural cardiovascular abnormalities occur in about 80% of all WS patients and are present in up to 93% of WS patients presenting in the first year of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Although a number of cardiovascular abnormalities are common to WS， the majority consist of some form arterial stenosis. Three anatomical types of supravalvular AS are recognized. The most common is the hourglass type， in which marked thickening and disorganization ofthe aortic media produce a constricting annular ridge at the superior margin of the sinuses of Valsalva. Uniform hypoplasia of the ascending aorta characterizes the hypoplastic type. Genetic studies suggest that the familial anomaly is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with variable expression. The typical appearance is similar to the elfin facies observed in the severe form of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【24】**Williams Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder-so rare， in fact， that few people have ever heard of it. Special care needs to be taken when children with WS are given anesthesia. Little babies will come up to you， they will stare into your face and it will be hard to actually disengage from that stare explained Helen Tager-Flusberg whose**\n\n【25】**lab at Boston University studies the social behavior of children with WS. Genetic diagnosis is confirmed by micro-array analysis& also by the Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization (FISH) test. Multi-specialty approach is needed. WS cannot be cured， but the ensuing symptoms， developmental delays，learning problems & behaviors can be treated. Correction of cardiac defects， cognitive behavior therapy， avoidance of extra Calcium & Vitamin D these are the treatment options.**\n\n【26】**Conclusion**\n\n【27】**We present a particular case of Williams Syndrome with low IQ， congenital supravalvular aortic stenosis， stunted growth， eye problems， defective dental enamel and mal-occlusion of multiple teeth. More than 99% ofindividuals with the clinical diagnosis of WS have this contigous gene delation， detected by FISH.**\n\n【28】**We should keep in mind and give more attention for evaluating heart murmur in childhood，especiallywhen the patient has abnormal facial dysmorphisom or mental retardation.**\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Mild asymmetric arthritis， increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and positive anti-nuclear antibodies raised the suspicion of a connective tissue disease and corticosteroids were started， with initial clinical improvement. Respiratory study revealed mild fibrosis on CT-scan and an obstructive ventilatory defect， interpreted as tuberculosis sequelae. Weeks later， the patient developed proximal muscle weakness and solid dysphagia. Normal muscle enzymes， the exclusion of a demyelinating disease， electromyography and muscle biopsy suggested a non-inflammatory glucocorticoid-induced myopathy， with clinical improvement following prednisone-tapering. A heliotrope rash appeared three months later. The diagnosis of dermatomyositis， with interstitial lung disease and of amyopathic subtype was then clear. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants were started， with initial clinical worsening and readmission for large pneumomediastinum， but subsequent improvement. Cancer screening was negative.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Amyopathic dermatomyositis； Interstitial lung disease； Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**We present the case of a 68-year-old Caucasian woman admitted to the hospital for an acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and constitutive symptoms. She had a relevant past medical history of treated pulmonary tuberculosis (PT) and was not taking any medication. Her brother suffered from psoriasis.**\n\n【17】**The patient presented erythematous scaly cutaneous lesions on elbows，bilateral edema ofwrists， arthritis of distal and proximal inter-phalangeal joints of right hand’s second finger， bilateral fine crackles on lower lung fields and no other relevant findings. Pulmonary embolism was excluded and pulmonary computed tomography (CT) showed sub-pleural linear opacities at left superior lobe， fibrotic striae at pulmonary bases， cystic bronchiectasis of right pulmonary base and centrilobular micronodules at inferior pulmonary lobes .**\n\n【18】**Laboratory studies revealed mild lymphopenia， negative C-reactive protein， elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (89 mm/hour) and positive anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)(1/1000， speckled pattern). Muscle enzymes (creatine kinase， lactate dehydrogenase， aldolase and myoglobin) and further immunologic results were normal. Microbiological exams were all negative. Echocardiography and bronchoscopy were normal and both bronchoalveolar and bronchial lavage fluids were negative for malignant cells and microbiologic testing. No antibiotics were prescribed. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) showed a mild obstructive ventilatory defect which， again with the imaging changes， was attributed to PT sequelae.**\n\n【19】**Constitutive symptoms， joint involvement and analytic results raised the suspicion of a connective tissue disease (CTD)，stillundifferentiated， and the patient was started on oralprednisone(40mg daily) with clinical improvement. Two weeks after being discharged， she was observed at the outpatient clinic. She complained of fatigue and developed a severe and predominantly proximal muscle weakness， as well as solid dysphagia. Serum levels of muscle enzymes remained normal. Electromyography was normal， cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was not compatible with demyelinating disease and deltoid muscle biopsy presented non-inflammatory changes and suggested a glucocorticoid-induced myopathy (GIM). Prednisone was tapered and subsequent clinical improvement on muscle strength supported the diagnosis of GIM； the patient continued tapering prednisone.**\n\n【20】**Three months later， a heliotrope rash appeared  and the diagnosis of dermatomyositis**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： Pulmonary CT-scan on first admission， showing sub-pleural apacities， fibrotic striae and centrilabular micronadules.**\n\n【22】**Figure 3： Thoracic high resalution CT-scan on second admission， showing pneumomediastinum(a) and sub-pleural fibrasis (b).**\n\n【23】**(DM) with interstitial lung disease (ILD) was established， as well as its amyopathic subtype. The patient was started on oral prednisone(1mg/kg/day)and oralazathioprine(1.5mg/kg/day).Cancer screening was negative.**\n\n【24】**One month after the diagnosis of amyopathic DM (ADM)， the patient was readmitted for syncope. Pulmonary CT scan showed a marked worsening of structural changes and a spontaneous pneumomediastinum . Azathioprine was switched to cyclophosphamide (CPA) and a first intravenous pulse (0.6g/m) was given. A slight decrease of the pneumomediastinum was documented by additional CT scans. The patient remained clinically stable and was discharged； a next IV pulse of CPA was programmed within one month. Two weeks after the second pulse of CPA， the patient was readmitted for a larger spontaneous pneumomediastinum， with cervical subcutaneous emphysema， that clinically improved after supplemental oxygen and absolute resting**\n\n【25】**After 12 monthly pulses of CPA， the patient was able to perform her daily life activities without supplemental oxygen. The control CT scan showed a similar degree of pulmonary fibrosis， no worsening of structural changes related to ILD and no pneumomediastinum. The patient performed a six-minute walk test without significant desaturation.**\n\n【26】**Discussion**\n\n**ADM is a rare but well-recognized subset of DM (approximately20% of cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is characterized by biopsy-confirmed cutaneous manifestations of classic DM occurring for six months or longer， with no clinical evidence ofproximal muscle weakness and no serum muscle enzyme or other muscle testing abnormalities 2|.**\n\n【28】**This case represents a diagnostic challenge. In the beginning， the constitutive symptoms， joint involvement， positive ANA and increased ESR raised the hypothesis of CTD， although the patient did not fulfill any classification criteria for a specific disease. In this context， and after excluding active infection， glucocorticoids were prescribed. Pulmonary disease was first interpreted not as ILD but as a consequence of PT sequelae， after excluding pulmonary infection and according to patient's previous history and PFT.**\n\n【29】**The patient developed muscle weakness after beginning oral prednisone. This fact， again with normal muscle enzymes， normal electromyography， histological findings and clinical improvement few weeks after prednisone tapering， allowed the diagnosis of GIM. GIM is a frequent but often underestimated adverse effect of steroid treatment， being more common in elderly patients and appearing few weeks to several months after corticotherapy introduction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Corticoid doses correlate positively with the likelihood of developing myopathy and with a faster onset of weakness. GIM eventually resolves if steroid therapy is discontinued.**\n\n【30】**In this patient， and after steroid discontinuation， the appearance of a single clinical sign - the heliotrope rash - permitted the whole reinterpretation of clinical data. This case reinforces that clinical suspicion is extremely important and differential diagnosis must be actively explored， even if rare， especially if they can course with rapidly progressive clinical deterioration； it also illustrates that“clinical picture” can change within time， so patients should be closely followed.**\n\n【31】**ADM diagnosis was established： the initial cutaneous lesions on elbows (Gottron’s sign) were present for more than six months， with no clinical evidence of inflammatory myositis as described above(classical DM myopathy improves with steroids) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. We have not found any report of concomitant ADM and GIM on literature search.**\n\n【32】**ILD has been reported in 13% of ADM patients， being frequently**\n\n【33】**rapidly progressive and potentially fatal and requiring intensive management \\[1，5\\]. NSIP is most commonly reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Anti-CADM-140 antibody might be a risk factor for the development of ILD in ADM patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. ILD can precede the diagnosis (18-20% of patients)， appear simultaneously or develop later 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this patient， ILD was present from the onset of skin lesions but was misinterpreted. Early treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and additional immunosuppressive agents may result in improved outcomes for some patients. Several case series attest the benefit of CPA， being reserved for severe or refractory cases given its serious toxicities \\[4，5\\].**\n\n【34】**Managing this patient’s disease course was challenging. At the time of ADM diagnosis， she started high-dose corticosteroids plus azathioprine but the delay regarding her first admission may be associated with a worse outcome.

This is a case report of a 58-year-old middle-aged man diagnosed with early-stage stomach cancer. The previous physical examination of the patient found that the gastric horn was scattered in the ulcer focus. Endoscopic ulcer sampling was performed on the gastric horn mucosa， and the result was adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent accompanying laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for distal gastric cancer.

The liver and spleen were untouched， and the hepatojugular reflux sign was negative. No positive signs.**\n\n【17】**Auxiliary examination： Total abdominal male CT spiral scan+ enhanced CT indicated that the gastric wall of the gastric antrum was slightly thickened and strengthened， and further examination was recommended.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， GC includes five main types of adenocarcinomas， including adenocarcinoma of the form， tubular adenocarcinoma of the kidney， mucinous adenocarcinoma， low viscosity and mixed adenocarcinoma， as well as other rare entities. The most common histopathological subtype is renal tubular adenocarcinoma， which can be divided into two grades of highly differentiated adenocarcinoma or moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. As an important subtype in moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma， CRA hasIreceivedincreasing attention as a specific histological GC subtype due to its unique clinicopathological and molecular manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-6\\]</u>. According to Yasuko Fujita et al.， immunohistochemical staining of GRA showed that TP53 mutation (especially c.529\\_546del mutation) and a variety of AI were closely related to CRA carcinogenesis in clinical cases and molecular analysis. In terms of clinicopathological and molecular findings， CRA was an independent entity of GC. Despite the characteristic histology of CRA， little is known about the molecular**\n\n【24】**characteristics ofCRA\\[7，8\\].It can be seen that immunohistochemistry has certain diagnostic significance， and MUC-2， MUC-5AC， and MUC-6 are usually mixed in immunohistochemistry， or can be expressed in intestinal type alone. The expression of P53 was usually stronger or negative than that of normal tissues. Ki67 showed a high proliferation index. The diagnosis of \"crawling\" gastric cancer is relatively difficult. According to Japanese researchers such as Haruta Y， it is necessary to take multiple endoscopic examinations to obtain sufficient evidence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The problem lies in the fact that these lesions cannot be detected under endoscopy. The patient is indicated as adenocarcinoma by endoscopy for the first time， and biopsy is usually performed to diagnose enterosis or atypical hyperplasia after the discovery. The most common type of gastric cancer can only be followed up by endoscopists. Such cases are actually quite common， but the early diagnosis is too difficult， and most of them are developed to the later stage of mixed component cancer to be clear.\"Creeping gastric cancer is characterized by small cell atypia， which is easy to cause missed or underdiagnosis， especially in biopsies. In addition， although the \"crawling\" gastric cancer has a glandular tubular structure， which is equivalent to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma， it is prone to low adhesion cancer regions， suggesting that this tumor may be more aggressive， although it is a**\n\n【25】**Figure 3：A： the postaperative specimen shows superficial concave or superficial flat patterns thraughout the tumor area.

In this case， the patient was diagnosed with early-stage cancer， the tumor invaded the submucosa， stage T1， and the latest postoperative treatment plan was not found for crawling cancer.

Placental and autopsy investigations confirmed in-utero transmission of disseminated congenital HSV-2 infection without any maternal history of HSV.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Congenital HSV； Extreme prematurity； Hydops-fetalis**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**An extremely premature male infant was born at 25 weeks gestation by an emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress. The mother was a 23-year-old primigravida. Her prenatal laboratory tests were negative for any sexually transmitted infection including syphilis， gonorrhea， chlamydia， human immunodeficiency virus， and group B Streptococcus. She was immune to rubella. She had no current or past history of genital or oral Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection.**\n\n【17】**At 17 weeks of pregnancy，the mother was admitted with vaginalleakage of dark amniotic fluid followed by fever (38.9 Co). She was treated with antibiotics including ampicillin，clindamycin， and azithromycin for chorioamnionitis and threatened loss of pregnancy. Expectant management was successful as pregnancy progressed without further leakage of amniotic fluid to 25-week gestation. Mother reported decreased fetal movements during her clinic visit at 25-week of gestation. She was admitted to the hospital for fetal monitoring. She was not in preterm labor and membranes of amniotic sac were intact. Fetal biophysical profile of 3 out of total 10 (1 for heart rate， 2 for amniotic fluid)， indicative of poor fetal well-being prompting delivery by an emergency cesarean section. Membranes were ruptured in operation room at delivery. Apgar scores were l and 3 at 1 and 5min， respectively. Infant required resuscitation at birth with endotracheal intubation， mechanical ventilation，external cardiac compressions and administration of epinephrine.**\n\n【18】**At birth， the infant appeared hydropic with generalized body-wall edema， protuberant， firm abdomen due to severe hepatosplenomegaly with liver margin reaching 2 cm above the pelvic brim and ascites. The infant was large for gestational age with a birth weight of 1，090 gm primarily because of diffuse edema. Soon after birth， diffuse bullae developed over extensive areas of the skin covering the face， arms， chest， and abdomen that progressed to diffuse sloughing of the skin (Figure1). These quickly became hemorrhagic. By four hours of life， the infant developed profuse bleeding from the endotracheal tube， orogastric tube and insertion sites of umbilical catheters. Laboratory tests showed disseminated coagulopathy that was treated promptly with infusions of fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate followed by platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia. Continuous infusion of dopamine and dobutamine were administered to treat hypotension. Broad spectrum antibiotics including ampicillin and gentamicin were administered for suspected sepsis. In view of infant's critical condition， empiric antiviral medication， acyclovir (15 mg/kg/dose divided every12 h) was added despite negative maternal history for HSV. Ancillary laboratory studies revealed thrombocytopenia (platelet count =30，000/mm’)， leukocytosis (white blood cell count =81，600/mm)，and high concentrations of serum transaminases (Aspartate Transaminase，AST>10，000U/L， Alanine Transaminase，ALT=972U/L). Bacterial cultures of blood and fluid specimen from dermal bullae were negative. However， HSV-2 was detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction test (PCR) in specimens obtained from blood， mouth，hemorrhagic skin bullae， rectum and placenta. Despite all supportive treatment， infant did not survive beyond the first day of life.**\n\n【19】**Figure1： Atypical diffuse hemorrhagic vesicobullous lesions in a critical hydropic prematureintantbborn at 25-week gestation with hepatosplenomegaly.**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**HSV infection in neonates has devastating consequences with high mortality and morbidity despite treatment with acyclovir 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Mother in our case did not experience any genital lesions during the pregnancy or around the time of birth. The epidemiological data do support that 70% of congenital HSV infection cases present with no preceding maternal history of HSV. Furthermore，congenital HSV in extremepremature infants， as in our case， can present in non-classical manner with atypical presentation1-3.**\n\n【23】**It was unusual in our case that although there was vaginal leakage of two-day duration at 17 wk. of gestation， subsequent fetal ultrasounds indicated that ruptured membranes had sealed with re-accumulation of amniotic fluid. Amniotic membranes remained intact from 17 wk. onwards until theywere ruptured artificially during cesarean section. Amniotic fluid was light yellowish to dark brown in color reflecting in-utero infection. As is usual practice， in most of these cases， includingours，appropriate antibiotics were administered to mother following prolonged vaginal leakage of amniotic fluid at17 wk. of gestation but she was not screened for HSV at that time. Clearly antibiotics can only be beneficial if the intrauterine infection is of bacterial origin. As reported recently， microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity can occur due to microorganisms other than bacteria where viral infection can play a role in pregnancy loss or early neonatal death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. We believe that in our case， HSV was inoculated into feto-placental unit at 17-wk. of age when the mother experienced amniotic fluid leakage. Although pregnancy progressed subsequently in asymptomatic manner， congenital viral infection reactivated**\n\n【24】**when the mother began experiencing decreased fetal movements. As described in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， this assertion is further supported by the placental pathology in our case which showed areas of focal opacification with degradation ofamniotic membranes and chorionic villi and necrotizing inflammation with stromal cell necrosis of umbilical cord and fetal surface. The HSV DNA PCR was also positive for HSV-2 from placenta that was trans-abdominally delivered in sterile manner trans-abdominally during Cesarean section 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【25】**While congenital HSV infection presents most commonly as either Skin， Eyes and Mucosal disease (SEM) or CNS infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>， our case presented with the least common variant， as the disseminated disease with hepatosplenomegaly and hydrops. As in our case， HSV infections can have atypical presentation in premature infants attributable to an immature immunologic response to the virus通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Typically， cutaneous HSV is described as vesicular or pustular eruptions with erythematous base 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Our case rapidly developed diffuse，large hemorrhagic bullous lesions coalescing together within a matter of few hours of birth， progressing rapidly with sloughing of skin (Figure). This was highly unusual and unique presentation. The lesions appeared somewhat similar to infants presenting with scalded skin syndrome， aplasia cutis congenital or congenital bullous dermal disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A somewhat similar case of vesiculobullous lesions in a 27-week-gestation preterm neonate with HSV has been reported before but unlike our case， active recurrent genital lesions of HSV were present in the mother prior to delivery in that case \\[2，3\\]. The findings of leukocytosis and hydrops with severe hepatosplenomegaly in our case were also consistent with previous rare reports of neonatal HSV disease and with in-utero transmission \\[1，3\\].**\n\n【26】**The presence of fever with premature prolonged rupture of membrane as in our case without any evidence of a bacterial infection highlights the need to investigate an alternative infectious etiology. It is prudent to have a high index of suspicion for HSV in such cases and to screen mothers for HSV-2 in addition to screening for bacterial infection. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics has provided guidelines for the management of neonatal HSV among those with maternal history of HSV and for those with primary and recurrent exposure， screening for HSV during pregnancy is not yet routine practice in the United States specifically in the absence of positive maternal history of HSV infection or in the absence of perinatal exposure. As most cases of neonatal HSV infection occur following cervical viral shedding without any clinically detectable genital lesion， universal maternal screening for HSV serology is warranted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The epidemiologic data suggesting a rise in the prevalence of neonatal HSV infection because more HSV-1 sero-negative individuals are entering sexually active age group combined with the changing sexual practices， the need for universal maternal screening is even more important. In addition， continued adherence to measures preventing vertical transmission from mother to neonate in the presence of known maternal history， including maternal treatment and prophylaxis with acyclovir， may check potential future increase in neonatal herpes infections. Trans-placental passage of acyclovir has been shown to offer protection to the fetus against maternal viremia； however， justification of its use in preventing neonatal HSV in the absence of documented maternal HSV infection remains unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Additionally， various prototypes for both therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines are being developed but none has yet been proven effective for mass use. Continued investigations to analyze cost-based efficacy of vaccines against genital herpes maybe justifiable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**Conclusion**\n\n【28】**In-utero transmission of HSV-2 with absence of maternal history of HSV and with absence of premature perinatal rupture of membrane as in our case is rare. Our case highlights the importance of considering HSV infection in pregnant women presenting with intra-partum fever without a clear bacterial etiology， and screening all mothers for HSV even in the absence of history or in the absence of active genitallesions. Congenital HSV infection continues to exert high mortality and morbidity in neonates. The outcome is even more severe among extremely premature infants often resulting in loss of pregnancy during first or second trimester. Our case also highlights the rare form of cutaneous， systemic presentation with hydrops in extreme premature infants. Empiric and early treatment with acyclovir should be considered particularly in a sick premature infant with unique vesicobullous lesions even in the absence of maternal history and in the absence of history of exposure to HSV because of very high mortality. There is a need for continuing research on identifying newer strategies for screening and treatment of HSV during pregnancy so that in-utero HSV transmission to the fetus can be prevented even in asymptomatic women with subclinical infection.**\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

A cure or recovery from these symptoms is almost impossible to achieve. In this case， the positive results from treatment with Rosa Schmid essential joint oil is described. This is the second， recorded successful treatment against peripheral neuropathic pain in the feet in the Netherlands.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Neuropathy； Feet； Rosa Schmid joint oil； Case study； Lyme infection**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n**In his article in the Dutch Journal for Phytotherapy， Gerben Hoogsteen 通用删除7(英):<u>(2017)</u> describes a phytotherapeutic treatment of neuropathic pain in a woman’s right foot 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In this case， Rosa Schmid's essential oil for joints was used. After three months of use， the pain decreased from 9to7on a VAS scale. It proved to be a sustainable form of pain relief. She could care for her feet better， walk more easily and， in addition to attaining an executive position， her social life became more active 1|.**\n\n【20】**I also suffered from peripheral neuropathy on both feet. I discussed my symptoms with Gerben Hoogsteen. He knew of no other studies into the benefits of this treatment and could not guarantee that the treatment would be suiccessful in my case.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**I was not aware that I had contracted a Lyme infection through a tick bite in Mexico in 2004. While viewing historical sites， I crouched under some bushes to see the sculptures better. A day later， I had two swollen red spots on my right upper arm. I had never heard of Lyme disease. The swelling increased and I squeezed blood out of them every couple of days. The spots became smaller， but remained visible. I ignored them and travelled back to the Netherlands after several weeks， via the US. I could see something black in the red spots. I squeezed much harder whereby they bled profusely and then the black dots were gone. Later one of the red spots also disappeared. Sometimes I squeezed it hard again and then it would bleed lightly for a few days. I stopped squeezing and forgot about it. One red spot remained visible for years. Newspaper articles led me to believe that it could be a case of Lyme disease \\[2，3\\].**\n\n【23】**Diagnosis**\n\n【24】**My feet gradually became numb， like I was walking on little cushions. They also hurt， walking became more difficult and it caused me to become more unstable on my feet. I regularly felt like I had a fever， the same feeling as when you have the flu. I often felt tired， like I was constantly walking uphill. My fingers also became less sensitive. To numb the pain and to fall asleep， I started drinking more and more white wine. Meanwhile， I had gathered from newspaper articles that there was little I could do to improve my condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Walking became increasingly painful. It became harder to drive a car because I couldn’t find the clutch with my left foot and I had difficulty pushing down hard enough to shift gears. For two years I stopped driving altogether， which limited my social life**\n\n【25】**Neurological Treatment Plan**\n\n【26】**I was referred to a hospital in D， to a neurologist whom my family doctor knew and trusted. He recognized my symptoms， particularly the emotional mood swings. Blood tests revealed a Lyme infection. A lumbar puncture showed that the infection was also located there， in the spine， whereby**\n\n【27】**the infection could manifest itself more easily and more frequently. I could take an intensive and lengthy course of antibiotics lasting for months， travelling to the hospital every day， spending an hour there and back， in addition to waiting times in hospital. The neurologist retired and handed my case file over to his successor. Itried to get an out-patient procedure in a Rotterdam Hospital， in the city where I am living， but that proved impossible， and all the tests would have had to be repeated. I was busy and couldn’t free up a whole month. Wim Kohler in the NRC (31 March 2016) convinced me of the limited effectiveness of these courses of antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. I decided to forget about it， and that proved to be fortunate.**\n\n【28】**The Total Treatment Plan**\n\n【29】**When consulting my family doctor on a different matter， he saw that I had difficulty walking and asked what the treatment in D. had yielded. I told him that I hadn't followed his advice because I didn't believe in a treatment consisting of a long-term course of antibiotics. After considerable discussion， we were convinced that something had to be done， as my condition was deteriorating all the time. He could determine this by manually inspecting my feet. It was very painful and I couldn’t tell which toe he was touching while blindfolded.**\n\n【30】**I was referred to the Havenziekenhuis (Harbour Hospital) in Rotterdam. A pro-active female neurologist understood what the problem was. That reassured me. She repeated the blood tests and the lumbar puncture. This confirmed Lyme disease but did not show any infection in the spinal fluid. She tested and discussed with me all the other factors that could influence the neuropathic symptoms： my kidney function was not optimal， my B6 levels were extremely high， I had never had chemotherapy， there were no diabetic issues， and she urged me strenuously to stop drinking， which I did. Later， in a second consultation， it appeared that these factors were all under control. She told me that the symptoms in my feet may lessen at some point， but that they would never disappear completely.**\n\n【31】**I felt that my Lyme disease was taken seriously for the first time that I had to learn to live with it and that because it had been so long since the initial incident； hardly any treatment was possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. My symptoms did lessen a little， but the floating， instable feeling while walking remained. I explored the therapies in the Expertise Centrum Maastricht (The Netherlands)， the infectious illnesses clinic at Radboud-UMC Nijmegen (The Netherlands)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， and finally also the phytotherapy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【32】**Treatm ent with Rosa Schm id Essential Joint Oil**\n\n【33】**I read the article in the Dutch Magazine for Phytotherapy(NTvFT，2017) about the Rosa Schmid essential jointoil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. I had researched in my carrier Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) earlier in cancer cases. I am sceptical about the healing powers of CAM， certainly with cancer， but I do believe in that CAM can relieve some symptoms， as is also shown through studies. I decided not to rule out the possibility that the essential oil might be able to help me. The oil is prepared from a great many plants and has been used successfully in treating arthrosis (articular degeneration) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【34】**I decided to set up a sort of experimental study with myself. Because my left foot bothered me the most， I decided to first treat only myleft foot with the essential oil. I did that at night before I went to sleep (wearing a sock in bed) and in the morning too (with a sock as well， obviously). I treated my right foot with Cetaphil， a moisturizing**\n\n【35】**cream (including the socks).**\n\n【36】**I continued with this therapy for about one year. I felt that there was improvement； my left foot became warmer and more sensitive； it felt less like I was walking on a ‘cushion'with that foot. It became easier to use the clutch while driving. My family doctor tested my feet once again. I had less pain when he touched my feet and I could localize where he pricked my toes. Thus， I personally observed and experienced these improvements. After a year， I started treating both my feet with the Rosa Schmid essential joint oil and I continue to do so every evening.**\n\n【37】**Discussion**\n\n【38】**Firstly， numb， painful feet seem to be a result of Lyme disease. After a long period of time has passed， very little can be done to correct this 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However， untreated Lyme infection is not the only cause of neuropathic symptoms and complaints.Other causes include an elevated vitamin B6 level， insufficient function of the kidneys， and copious amounts of alcohol， in addition to illness-related factors， such as diabetes and chemotherapy treatments for cancer. Careful neurological testing can trace these factors. Only one of these is Lyme disease. The implications of this insight have not yet been studied sufficiently and thus cannot yet be treated effectively \\[2，3，5\\].**\n\n【39】**Secondly， using the essential joint oil by Rosa Schmid can help in treating peripheral neuropathic pain in the feet. A separate treatment ofthe two feet yielded systematic insights into the effect ofarticulation oil. It is a subsequent study of the case study described by Gerben Hoogsteen， in which I have confirmed his results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. More research is needed into the effect of the oil， also in podiatric pain symptoms as a result of Lyme disease.**\n\n【40】**In the third place it is of course the question whether the decline in symptoms in the feet and the increased quality of life can solely be attributed to the joint oil. I continue to use the oil in the evening during the day， this has been replaced with a foot cream. The pain and insensibility have decreased drastically； walking is much easier， as is climbing stairs， which is confirmed by others. I can bike again with ease and take long car rides， although I now drive an automatic， which fit better to my still a bit insensitive foot. My subjective quality of life rose from a 6 to an 8. Undoubtedly， a placebo effect was also present because I was aware of the positive results of the description of the treatment by Gerben Hoogsteen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. At this point， it is still an N=2 study. Perhaps more studies into the benefits of the use of this essential joint oil can be found.**\n\n【41】**Conclusion**\n\n【42】**The history of this treatment of neuropathy due to Lyme disease at the feet shows that the joint oil by Rosa Schmid may decrease the complaints and improve the quality of walking， and by that the quality of life. However， so far it is only a N=2 study. It needs more studies in a strict controlled experimental setting. Although the actual results are promising. It may be concluded too that this experimental treatment is also applicable for neuropathic feet complains caused by diabetes and chemotherapeutical treatment of cancer.**\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

She had been using the drug for seven months at a dose of 800 mg daily for a chronic interstitial cystitis. Although an attempt was made to taper the medication to discontinuation， severe urinary pain impeded this process， and the patient could only accept a reduction in dose to 600 mg daily. Nonetheless， the hemoglobin improved from 9.1 g/dl to 10.4 g/dl after just one month on the lower dose. Several months later， while still taking 600 mg daily， the hemoglobin continued to improve to11.9 g/dl.**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Phenazopyridine hydrochloride (DPP) is a urinary analgesic used to treat patients experiencing pain，burning， urgency， or frequency caused by lower urinary tract mucosa irritation. These maladies may be due to infection， trauma， surgery， endoscopic procedures， imaging studies， or catheters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. PPD is able to ease patients' discomfort by providing a local anesthetic effect on the urinary tract mucosa. However， the precise mode ofaction of DPP is unknown.**\n\n【16】**DPP is found in a medication called AZO， and is sold over the counter in many states. The recommended dose for adults is 200 mg three times a day after meals for a maximum of 2 days in patients with normal renal function. While there is no definitive dose adjustment for renal impairment， drug labeling states that “the dose must be lowered in those with impaired renal function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>”.**\n\n【17】**DPP (2-6-Diamino-3-Phenylazo Pyridine) is hepatically metabolized via hydroxylation to produce 2，3，6-triaminopyridine， or aniline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is also excreted unchanged， as shown in Figure1. The ease with which DPP can be acquired as an OTC product sets the table for patients suffering complications from longer term use of this drug. It has been reported that chronic use can cause hemolytic anemia in the elderly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， those with G6PD mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， those with mild renal failure通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， and others \\[5，6\\]. This case report will demonstrate yet another example of chronic DPP use leading to hemolytic anemia.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**A 68-year-old woman with history of type 2 diabetes， hypertension， hyperlipidemia， hypothyroidism， osteoporosis， obstructive sleep apnea， previous pulmonary emboli， migraines， and interstitial cystitis was experiencing onset of shortness of breath， nausea， decreased appetite， dizziness and diarrhea over several weeks. In July of that year， her primary care provider found that she had a progressing case of anemia of unknown etiology.**\n\n【20】**The patient then contacted a pharmacist for a medication consult on August 16h， 2020. The pharmacist perused her medications， labs， and problem lists. Based on her labs from early August， as well as her history of recently beginning dailyhigh dose DPP， the pharmacist suspected she might be experiencing DPP-induced hemolytic anemia. The patient reported she had been taking two 100mg DPP tablets four times daily since January 2020. Clinically relevant labs included： Hgb of 8.7 g/dl， an MCV of 110 fL， haptoglobin of <10 mg/dl，LDH 383 U/L， a reticulocyte count of 295(11%)， and normal iron labs. The pharmacist recommended that she be referred to a hematologist for a complete work-up and diagnosis. At the behest ofthe pharmacist， she attempted to gradually taper off the DPP. However， this process was stalled because of the exacerbation of urinary pain at the lower doses.**\n\n【21】**By 9.1.20， the patient had managed to reduce the dose of DPP to 200 mg TID and had her first**\n\n【22】**hematology visit. Her lab results at that visit yielded a Hgb 9.1 g/dl MCV of 108 fL， haptoglobin <10， mg/dl and LDH 267 U/L， all which suggested hemolytic anemia. Due to negative Direct Anti-globulin Tests (DAT) also done at that time， hematology felt they had ruled out autoimmune hemolytic anemia. As a result， the suspicion of DPP-induced anemia was strengthened.On 9.10.20， a decrease in the DPP dose from 200 mg TID to 200 mg BID was attempted. However， it was not successful， and 200 mg TID dose was resumed. During this time， she also visited a urologist in an attempt to find other remedies**\n\n【23】**toward relieving her interstitial cystitis- related pain.**\n\n【24】**At the time of her second hematology appointment on 9.29.20， she was still taking DPP 200 mg TID. However， at the slightly lower dose， the patient's labs showed some improvement. Her Hgb was increased from 9.1 to 10.4 g/dL， MCV decreased from 108 fL to 103fL， haptoglobin increased from <10 mg/dl to 23 mg/dl， LDH dropped slightly from 267 U/L to 256 U/L. As a result， the hematologist concluded that there was no emergent need to completely taper her off the medication. Therefore， the patient wished to continue on DPP200 mg TID. On 10.30.20， hydroxyzine was attempted to treat her bladder spasms， but resulted in no appreciable effect.**\n\n【25】**Finally， at a follow-up visit on 6.2.2021， the patient was still on both DPP 200 mg TID and Levsin 0.125 mg Q4-6h as needed for pain. Results showed an Hgb increase to 11.9 g/dL， an MCV decrease to92.7 fL， and all other lab results in normal ranges. The hematologists chose to not repeat haptoglobin or LDHlevels.

As previously mentioned， the drug is hepatically metabolized via hydroxylation to form aniline and its congeners . Of course， the higher the dose， the higher the concentrations of these oxidizing metabolites. At some critical individual-specific“threshold”level， the oxidizing effect of the aniline derivatives exceeds the endogenous reducing capacity of the enzymes within the host's RBCs. This then results in the net increased catabolism of hemoglobin and the clinical manifestation of hemolytic anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【33】**In this case， the anemia was quite significant on 800 mg a day of DPP. The hemoglobin fell below 9 g/dl； and， the patient possessed symptoms of systemic hypoxia. Meanwhile， over a period of a few months， reducing the DPP dose 600 mg a dayyielded an improvement nthiee hemoglobin to 11.9g/dl withLSsome commensiirate improvements in other labs and exercise tolerance. The findings of a low haptoglobin and elevated LDH in this case were other classic characteristics of hemolytic anemia， and these normalized as early as late September . Initially， it was hoped that the drug could be stopped altogether， but the continuance of urinary symptoms precluded the patient from doing this. This case shows that， in patients who do symptomatically require longer term daily use of DPP， a small reduction in dose could possibly reduce the magnitude of a drug-induced hemolytic anemia.**\n\n【34】**There have been several published reports of hemolytic anemia from the use of DPP in the literature . Previous cases have shown an association of hemolytic anemia with chronic use of this drug in the elderly population， those with renal impairment， and those with G6PD mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-6\\]</u>. The patient in this case was 68years old with multiple comorbidities， but she had normal renal function. A G6PD test was not done. The hematologists confirmed**\n\n【35】**the pharmacist's suspicion through their clinical experience and the use of serial labs such as the hemoglobin， haptoglobin， LDH， and elevations in MCV levels. What made this particular case so unique was the stark difference in the magnitude ofthe anemia seen between the 800 mg and 600 mg daily doses.**\n\n【36】**Although DPP is not labeled for long term use， there are patients who can find no other modality for controlling bladder pain. All patients on long term DPP should be monitored for hemolytic anemia， especially if on higher doses. However， if hemolytic anemia does occur， a complete discontinuation ofthe medication may not be necessary.**\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\. Actavis Totowa LLC.

DiagnosisilsSbased on determining the presence of hemolyticanemia， thrombocytopenia， and the presence of schistocytes in the peripheral blood smear and damage to internal organs - most commonly the kidneys. Liver involvement as the main symptom of the disease is rare， making it difficult to recognize.**\n\n【14】**Case Presentation： We present a case of a 65 year old woman whose clinical picture was dominated by weakness， vomiting， jaundice， disturbances of consciousness， as well as characteristics of liver and kidney damage. Laboratory tests showed typical features of hemolytic anemia Hgb 9.3g%， high LDH， low haptoglobin， thrombocytopenia 116x109/l， signs of renal damage： creatinine3.6mg/dl， and elevated bilirubin level 5.5mg/dl. Manual differential blood smear stated 6% to8% schistocytes. Establishing a diagnosis was possible after genetic testing， which showed only a heterozygous polymorphism in the promoter of the factor H gene. Eculizumab was not an option(lack of registration in Poland)， thus other methods of treatment were sought (infusions of plasma， plasmapheresis and corticosteroids).**\n\n【15】**Conclusion： Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is not always acute. For carriers of the mutated gene， the image of the disease may be incomplete and precede in a chronic way that delays diagnosis. Hepatic manifestation of aHUS is casuistic in medicine and probably results from damage to the vascular endothelial cells in small hepatic vessels.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Thrombotic microangiopathy； Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome； Complement factor H mutation； Case report**\n\n【17】**Abbreviations**\n\n【18】**aHUS： Atypical Hemolitic-Uremic Syndrome； STEC-HUS： Diarrhea-Associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome； TTP： Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura； HGB： Hemoglobin； HCT：Hematocrit；RBC： Red Blood Cell Count； ALT： Alanine Transaminase； AST： Aspartate Transaminase； PLT： Platelets； INR： International Normalized Ratio； DD： Dimer D； ATIII： Antithrombin III； anti-LKM1： Anti-Liver-Kidney Microsome 1； ANCA： Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody； ANA： Antinuclear Antibody； SMA： Smooth Muscle Antibody； antidsDNA- anti-double stranded DNA； MRI： Magnetic Resonance Imaging； PET： Positron Emission Tomography； LDH： Lactate Dehydrogenase； CC3： Complement Component 3； FFP： Fresh Frozen Plasma； anti-MASP2； CFH：Complement Factor H； MCP： Membrane Cofactor Protein； CFI： Complement Factor I； CFB：Complement Factor B；THBD： Thrombomodulin； ADAMTS 13： Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif； member 13； MLDPA： Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification； DGKE： Diacylglycerol Kinase ； SLE： Systemic Lupus Erythromatosus； HELLP：Syndrome Hemolytic Anemia； Elevated Liver Enzymes； Low Platelet Count； DIC： Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation； TMA： Thrombotic Microangiopathies； anti-CFH： Autoantibodies against Complement Factor H； EMA： European Medicine Agency**\n\n【19】**Background**\n\n【20】**Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare disease associated with excessive complement activation \\[1，2，3\\]. Subsequent endothelial damage and disseminate coagulation lead to hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. These symptoms lie at the center of thrombotic microangiopathies： aHUS， diarrhea-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Eculizumab， a monoclonal antibody against compliment component 5， is the new standard of care for aHUS. As eculizumab was not registered in1Poland during patient’s hospitalization， other methods of treatment were sought (plasma infusion， plasma exchange and glicocortycosteroids). Following case of aHUS is unique for the predominance of liver symptoms and the chronic clinical course.**\n\n【21】**Presentation Case**\n\n【22】**We present a case of a 65-year old woman，Caucasian race， body weight of 56 kg， who was admitted to Tertiary Nephrologic Center with postprandial vomiting， recurrent vertigo and general asthenia. Clinical examination revealed xanthochromia and liver enlargement(5 cm beneath the ribcage). Three years prior to first hospitalization a routine examination during a surgical provision of left arm fracture revealed a bilirubin level of 2 mg/dl. No chronic diseases in patient medical history. At the age of 31 patients gave birth to a healthy daughter， with no complications during pregnancy and childbirth. During present hospitalization laboratory tests showed： anemia(hemoglobin HGB 9.3g/l， hematocrit HCT 27%， red blood cell count RBC 2.84x1012/l)， kidney and liver dysfunction (creatinine3.6 mg/dl， urea 72 mg/dl， bilirubin 5.5 mg/dl， alanine transaminase ALT 20 U/l， aspartate transaminase AST 46 U/l， moderate thrombocytopenia (platelets PLT116x109/l) and the following coagulation disorders： prolonged international normalized ratio(INR)， an increased D-Dimer and a decreased antithrombin 3 value(ATIII). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed an oval focal lesion in the left liver lobe (decreased echogenicity， 14 mm in diameter) and numerous cysts in the right liver lobe. In CT scan， in both lobes of the liver visible several outbreaks of ~8mm in diameter. Liver was slightly enlarged， with a reduced coefficient of extinction (approx. 45J.H.)， Figure 1. During the diagnostic process no biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted due to thrombocytopenia and the presence of a metal plate in the left arm， Figure 2. A whole body Positron Emission Tomography (PET) showed no intensified glucose uptake. Tests for viral and autoimmune hepatitis and other autoimmune disorders were carried out (for systemic lupus erythematosLS， dermatomyositis，antiphospholipid syndrome， systemic vasculitis)： anti-doublestranded DNAA(anti-dsDNA) antibodies， lupus anticoagulant， Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) anti-liver-kidney microsome1(anti-LKM1)， Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA)， Smooth Muscle Antibody (SMA). No antibodies were found. Moreover， the patient suffered from recurrent episodes of impaired consciousness during hospitalization. A computer tomography of the head visualized a fresh cerebral ischemia in the right cerebral hemisphere， Figure 3. Furthermore， despite blood transfusions anemia and thrombocytopenia intensified. The presence of schistocytes in the blood smear (6% to 8%)， an increased level of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) and reticulocyte count and an almost undetectable level of heptoglobin suggested hemolytic microangiopathic anaemia. Considering the entire clinical picture， a diagnosis of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： CT scan.

Blood serum was collected and showed a decreased complement component 3 (CC3) activity 80 mg/dl (90 to 180)； and normal ADAMTS13 activity - 93% (N 40% to 130%). Shiga toxin was negative. Because of the deteriorating clinical condition，therapy was started. The infusions of 500 mg methylprednisolone for 3consecutive days were followed by 40 mg of oral prednisone bringing a temporary improvement. Additionally， a total of 24 units of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) were infused. The clinical state improved， without renal replacement therapy a diuresis of over 2 liters per day was achieved with a slight deterioration ofliver function.**\n\n【26】**The patientWas repeatedly hospitalized foorr impaired consciousness accompanied by anemia and a decline of kidney and liver function manifested by hepatic encephalopathy and dehydration. The patient received repeated therapeutic plasma exchanges. Three plasmaphereses were performed， each exchanging4 liters of plasma with FFP bringing no improvement to the clinical state. Due to the ineffectiveness of treatment (plasmapheresis， steroids， FFP transfusion)， recurrent relapses of aHUS and lack of targeted therapy with eculizumab， (not available in Poland at that time)， the patient was offered a participation in a phase 2 clinical trial examining the safety of the monoclonal antibody anti-MASP 2(OMS721-TMA-001，NCT02222545). Change in levels of creatinine， haemoglobin， bilirubin**\n\n【27】**and platelets over time are shown on Figure 4. Genetic testing was performed to assess the most common mutations associated with HUS/TTP development . Testing was performed in The Clinical Research Center for Rare Diseases“Aldo e CeleDacco”， Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research， in Italy. No**\n\n【28】**cerebral ischemia in the right cerebral hemisphere.**\n\n【29】**mutations were found by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of Complement Factor H (CFH)， Membrane Cofactor Protein(MCP)， Complement Component 3 (CC3)， Complement Factor I(CFI)， Complement Factor B (CFB)， Thrombomodulin (THBD)， a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1motif， member 13 (ADAMTS13)， diacylglycerol kinase e (DGKE) genes. A heterozygous polymorphism c-332T>C in the promoter of complement factor H gene was found by Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). The mutation is associated with aHUS development.**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n【31】**Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare disease with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per million 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>. Various complement abnormalities and excessive coagulation lead to consumptive thrombocytopenia. Hemolytic anemia is caused by damage to erythrocytes caused on their way through the narrowed vessels. The disease is associated with renal function impairment： 60% of children and 80% of adults eventually require renal replacement therapy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Neurological (impaired consciousness， stroke， focal deficits and epileptic seizures) and cardiac involvement is present in 10%to 30% of cases \\[5，8\\]. The main symptom in our patient was liver malfunction， renal involvement. Hepatic manifestation of aHUS may**\n\n【32】**Figure 4： Patient's clinical course.**\n\n【33】**have been a result of hemolysis in the endothelium of hepatic vessels and subsequent organ ischaemia. Only about half of the patients with typical presentation of aHUS have identifiable complement factor mutations. Our patient had no mutation of complement factor H but was heterozygous for the polymorphism c.-332C>T in the promoter of CFH gene. Such abnormality has already been identified in other patients with aHUS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Patient was a carrier of the mutated gene， and this could be a reason for a milder and more chronic course of disease and subsequent difficulty in establishing diagnosis of aHUS. In order for the syndrome to develop a combination of factors must coincide：a mutation， predisposing haplotype and a triggering factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Around 50% of aHUS cases are preceded with a gastrointestinal or upper respiratory tract infection \\[5，11，12，13\\]. Other triggering events include pregnancy， cancer and use of medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. No associated trigger was found in the presented case.**\n\n【34】**Diagnosis of aHUS must be differentiated with other thrombotic microangiopathies. Hemolytic anemia， thrombocytopenia and acute renal insufficiency， fever and a possible central nervous system involvement are associated with HUS in the course of E. coli O157infection.

Treatment of aHUS presents an even greater challenge， especially if plasma exchanges are ineffective. It is advisable to search for new genes associated with aHUS/TTP. In justified cases， specific diagnosis is possible only after genetic testing， especially for a long period of illness when the symptoms are not spectacular. aHUS is rare syndrome with poor prognosis. Approximately 70% of patients die； it requires dialysis or developing chronic kidney disease within a year after diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19-20\\]</u>.

Hyperplastic polyps typically arise in stomach in a background of chronic gastritis and are the second most common gastric polyps通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Large polyps can have superficial ulceration orhemorrhage. Hyperplastic polyps usually develop within the body or antrum. It is believed that they represent an exuberant regenerative response of the gastric foveolar cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Hyperplastic polyps rarely progress to gastric carcinomas； malignant transformation however， although rare is well documented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A75-year-oldwoman with a recent cardiac ischemia was admittedinourhospital for a cardiologic check-up； clinical and laboratory examination detected a severe normocytic normochromic anemia(Hb 5.6g/dl). The patient reported recent hematochezia. A colonoscopy and an upper endoscopy were performed， the latter showing a bleeding protruding lesion in the gastric fundus， measuring about 2.5 cm in diameter. Thelesion appeared soft， partly ulcerated with fibrin deposition consistent with bleeding . Biopsies of the lesion were submitted to the department of pathology for histologic evaluation. Colonoscopy didn’t show relevant alterations.**\n\n【18】**Histological examination of the gastric biopsies showed hyperplastic polyp mucosae with heavy inflammatory infiltrate. Foveolar hyperplastic pits showed isolated foci of high grade epithelial dysplasia characterized by globet cells with depolarized and hyperchromatic nuclei within the basal membrane.**\n\n【19】**Although there was no evidence of infiltrative cancer， considering the severe anemia， the hemodynamic instability， the endoscopic appearance and size of the lesion， the patient was submitted， prior informed consent， to total gastrectomy. Before the gastrectomy procedure， the patient was submitted to CT scan resulted negative for other pathologies or distant metastasis. After surgical procedure the patient was discharged on the 10h post-operative day in good general clinical condition.**\n\n【20】**Definitive histology was performed on the surgical specimen. The stomach showed a 2.5 cm in diameter reddish protruding lesion in the fundus， at 1 cm from the proximal resection margin. The lesion was totally sampled according to the Japanese rules for gastric cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> embedded in paraffin. 3 um thick sections were cut for standard histology and immunohistochemical studies.**\n\n【21】**Histologically， the polypoid lesion was characterized by a proliferation of the surface foveolar**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： Endoscopic image of gastric polyp.**\n\n【23】**cells lining exaggerated，elongated， and distorted pits that extend from the surface deep into the lamina propria with mucosal expansion. The glands developed extensive infoldings， branching in bizarre ways producing either a serrated appearance or dilated cysts，occasionally quite prominent. Smooth muscle fibers arborized in the lamina propria. Mucosa appeared edematous， infiltrated by single atypical discohesive epithelial elements， and characterized irregular and pleomorphic nuclei， eccentrically placed， with evident nucleolus， and ample eosinophilic cytoplasm and sporadically with classical signet-ring morphology. Plasma cells，lymphocytes and eosinophils were also present . Neutrophils were especially prominent in surface ulcerated areas； vascular proliferations resembling granulation tissue developed superficially near areas of inflammation. Within the foveolar hyperplastic lining there were areas of dysplastic changes as seen in the bioptic samples， with low and high grade intraepithelial neoplasia with features of signet ring cell .**\n\n【24】**Immunohistochemistry was performed by the streptavidinbiotin method. The antibodies used were mouse monoclonal antibodies against Pan-cytokeratins (clone MNF116) and CD68 (clone PG-M1) all from Dakocytomation， Denmark. Sections were treated with LSAB2 (Dakocytomation) and reaction product was revealed by3-3-Diaminobenzidine (DAB). Sections were counterstained with haematoxylinDiscohesive atypicalepithelial elements resulted positive for Pan-CK and negative for CD68 at the immunohistochemical**\n\n【25】**analys .**\n\n【26】**Diagnosis of gastric carcinoma， poorly cohesive type， arising in hyperplastic polyp was made. Extensive sampling of other regions of the stomach showed atrophic， follicular， active and micro-erosive chronic gastritis of severe grade， associated to extensive type I and II intestinal metaplasia.**\n\n【27】**Discussion**\n\n【28】**Hyperplasticpolyps are a quite common form of gastricpolyps通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. They develop around gastric remnants， ulcers， or gastroenterostomy stomas. It is believed that they represent an exuberant regenerative response of the gastric foveolar cells. Rare polyps are large and simulate carcinoma. Most hyperplastic polyps arise on a background of chronic gastritis. Atypia is either absent or minimal and if present is of regenerative in nature. Neutrophils are especially prominent in ulcerated areas. Vascular proliferations resembling granulation tissue develop superficially near areas of inflammation. These reparative changes may resemble low-grade dysplasia or adenomas.**\n\n【29】**Hyperplastic polyps rarely progress to gastric carcinomas with an incidence of no more than 2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. It is generally acknowledged that hyperplasticpolyps do not transform in carcinoma， although they may occasionally be associated with gastric cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>. The appearing of adenomatous and dysplastic foci， followed by the cancerous lesion is considered to be related to the size and macroscopic type of the hyperplastic polyp 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Anyways， an association of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or signet ring carcinoma with hyperplastic polyp is reported， with particular regard to familiar form\\[7，8，10-16\\]. From a review of the literature， only 4 cases of signet ring carcinoma arising within a gastric hyperplastic polyp were reported\\[12，13，15，16\\]. One of them describes a case of multifocal signet-ring carcinoma in an inverted hyperplastic polyp 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【30】**Our case report a poorly cohesive gastric carcinoma with combined signet ring cells and pleomorphic eosinophilic cells， raised in a gastric hyperplastic polyp and associated with foci of foveolar high grade dysplasia in the surface epithelium. The latter was the only worrying feature observed at the time of endoscopic sampling of the lesion. Accuracy in endoscopic sampling and histological examination are critical points to reveal pre-neoplastic changes and allow do not miss underling invasive carcinoma.**\n\n【31】**This case emphasizes the importance for endoscopists to obtain extensive bioptic sampling from gastric polyps，especially ifassociated with chronic gastritis， in order to allow an adequate histological examination. Reactive hyperplasia need to be accurately screened to rule out foveolar dysplasia. The microscopic evidence of foveolar dysplasia (type 2 gastritis associated dysplasia) strongly suggests a close observation of the patient being the finding a precursor lesion of invasive neoplasia.**\n\n【32】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【33】**Dr. G.

Although there are many treat options， they can only relieve symptoms， but not can modify the disease. Moreover， conventional treatment has limitations because of its adverse events. Therefore， it is necessary that development of Disease Modifying OA Drugs (DMOADs) with low adverse effects. To evaluate the effects of Membrane-Free Stem Cell Extract (MFSCE) on the clinical signs and cartilage regeneration of OA dogs. Thirty privately owned dogs with OA were separated into two groups；placebotreated group (n=6)， MFSCE treated group (n=22). All dogs were injected MFSCE or placebo once a week for 4 weeks in intra-articular. To evaluate the symptoms， dogs and owners were visit hospital at day 0， 7，14，21， and 28. The effect of MFSCE on pain relief was evaluated using pain score and pain at palpation score. Both symptoms were improved in MFSCE treated group while no significant changes in placebo treated group after 4 weeks treatment. The effect of MFSCE on physical function improvement was evaluated using behavior score， standing score， walking score， lameness score， and weight bearing score. All symptoms were improved in MFSCE treated group while no significant changes in placebo treated group after 4 weeks treatment. The effects of MFSCE on joint structure were evaluated using radiographic score. Joint structure was improved in MFSCE treated group while no significant changes in placebo treated group after 4 weeks treatment. There were no changes on general symptoms， symptoms of lesion， adverse events or general symptoms that can be occurred by injection，hematological parameter， and urinal parameters. Overall， these results， MFSCE could be the first-in-class DMOAD.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Osteoarthritis； Membrane-free stem cell extract； Adipose-derived stem cells； Anti-inflammatory drugs**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Arthritis， defined as the disease affect to joints， is commonly occurred in both human and animals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Clinical symptoms of arthritis are included swelling， deformities， pain and stiffness of joint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Dogs show high prevalence of arthritis due to excessive exercise， injury， and genetic predisposition. It was reported that 25% of 77.2 million dogs has arthritis in United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Arthritis is separated via etiology to Osteoarthritis (OA)， Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)， Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)， Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and Septic Arthritis (SA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is reported that， OA， chronic joint degenerative disease， is most common disease among the arthritis in dogs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>. Pathological symptoms of OA shown to be various symptoms such as progressive loss and destruction of articular cartilage， inflammation of synovium， and degeneration of ligaments and menisci of the knee etc.，通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【17】**There are some treatment options to treat the OA in dogs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Weight loss， exercise modification， and physical therapy can use as non-pharmaceutical therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In the severe dogs， surgery can be used for treatment. For the pharmaceutical therapy， Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs(NSAIDs) were used as standard therapy. However，NSAIDs has some limitations because of its adverse effects such as gastrointestinal ulceration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. There are other pharmaceuticaloptions such as diacerein， corticosteroids，and hyaluronic acid. However，these pharmaceuticals also had limitations because they had also adverse effect and they been only relieving symptoms but not modifying disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Therefore， many studies are conducted to development of alternative products which enhanced efficacy and safety.**\n\n【18】**The stem cell， which considered for new therapeutic strategy of OA， defined as undifferentiated**\n\n【19】**multipotent cell \\[10，11\\]. Among the various stem cells， Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (ADSC)， which divided from human adipose tissue， has been gotten attention because of its various advantages such as accessibility and abundance compared with other stem cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Recent studies have provided some evidence that ADSCs are effective in the treatment of OA. Kriston-Pal et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> reported that intra-articular injection of allogenic ADSC with hyaluronan into OA dog shown the effect of lameness improvement and hyaline-type cartilage regeneration. However， there are some limitations such as instability of chondrocyte-like phenotypes， limited replicative lifespan， etc.，\\[14-201. To overcome these limitation， various studies in progressed.**\n\n【20】**To overcome limitation of stem cell therapy， we developed Membrane-Free Stem Cell Extract (MFSCE)， which consist with252 peptides using patented technology about removing the cellular membrane of ADSC and purifying the peptides. In the previous studies， we identified the anti-inflammatory effect and cartilage regenerative effect of MFSCE in Interleukin-1a (IL-1a) induced OA in vitro model using rat primary cartilage cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Moreover， MFSCE has shown the anti-inflammatory and regenerative effect in golf-injury patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. However， the effect of MFSCE on OA in canines not yet identified. In the present study， we evaluated the effect of MFSCE on OA through change of clinical sign in dogs. We also evaluated the adverse effects of MFSCE through change of general sign， hematological sign and urinalysis in dogs.**\n\n【21】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【22】**Preparation of MFSCE**\n\n【23】**The MFSCE was provided from T-Stem Co.， Ltd. (Changwon， Korea). The preparation was manufactured as previously described通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Human ADSCs were separated from human adipose tissue which donated from healthy female aged twenties. All donors had to complete blood test for check compatibility. ADSCs were cultured in5% CO2 and 37°C condition. ADSCs were harvested at the passages of 5 to 7 to using for MFSCE. Cells membranes were removed using ultra sonication and centrifugation，and intracellular peptides，named MFSCE， were collected using filtration. The aqueous solution of MFSCE was further lyophilized and stored in powder form. Non-toxicity of MFSCE， the final product， was identified via 9 safety tests performed by the Good Laboratory Practice accreditation authority.**\n\n【24】**Experimental design**\n\n【25】**The study was conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All owners were required to sign an informed consent form for the clinical trials before enrolling their animals in the study. The protocol was approved by the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency of Korea.**\n\n【26】**Twenty-eight dogs with spontaneous occurred OA were enrolled in the study. To OA was evaluated using radiographic and clinical sign. Dogs that had other knee disease， treated with NSAIDs or corticosteroids within 14 days before enrolment， or pregnancy or likelihood of becoming pregnant during the study were excluded. For ethical reasons，dogs were analgesictreated or excluded from the study according to change of general symptoms or symptoms of lesion， and occurring infectious disease and adverse events. Characteristics of dogs which completed the study were shown in Table 1. There are no significant differences of characteristics between placebo and MFSCE groups at TO.**\n\n【27】**Dogs were separated into two groups； placebo treated group**\n\n【28】**(n=6)， MFSCE treated group (n=22). The MFSCE treated group was injected with 100 mg/2 mL of MFSCE (dissolved with phosphate buffer solution (PBS)) in intra-articular while placebo treated group was injected with 2 mL of PBS in intra-articular.

All clinical symptoms related with OA such as pain， physical function and radiography were significantly improved after 28 days treatment. Even so， no changes in any general symptoms， adverse events， hematological parameters， and urinalysis parameters were seen after 28 days treatment.**\n\n【95】**In the present study， we evaluated the various clinical symptoms with reference of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities(WOMAC) osteoarthritis index for identify the effect of MFSCE on OA. WOMAC which is consist with 24 questions for evaluate the pain， stiffness， and physical functioning of joint， is the most widely**\n\n【96】**identified in OA. Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) is the proteolytic enzymes whichare occurred cartilage destruction through degradation of collagen，aggrecan，and various proteoglycans in OA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39-41\\]</u>. It was reported that MMP-3andMMP-13were increased in OA通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>.MMP-13 is the main proteinase which is directly related with degradation of collagen， aggrecan and proteoglycans in OA cartilage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>， while MMP-3 can help the MMP-13 to degrade cartilage components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>. In the previous study， it was identified that MFSCE decreased MMP-3 and MMP-13 gene and protein level in IL-1a induced OA in vitro model 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Furthermore， we also identified that MFSCE inhibited the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KB) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway which are regulated the MMP levels \\[21，45\\]. Therefore， it was suggested that MFSCE may inhibit the progress of OA through inhibition of MMPs. Another molecular mechanism which related with cartilage formation is SRY-type high-mobility group box-9 (SOX-9) which is control chondrogenesis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. SOX-9 expressed in pre-chondrogenic mesenchyme and fully differentiated chondrocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[47\\]</u>. It was reported that the expression level of SOX-9 was lower in OA chondrocytes \\[48，49\\]. Moreover， overexpression of SOX-9 in explant cultures of OA articular cartilage increased collagen and proteoglycan expression level similar with normal cartilage \\[50，51\\]. Therefore， it was considered that increasing SOX-9 expression is important treat target for cartilage regeneration通用删除6(英):<u>\\[52\\]</u>. In the previous study， MFSCE increased SOX-9 gene and protein level in IL-1a induced OA in vitro model 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Therefore， it was suggested that MFSCE may promote cartilage regeneration through increasing SOX-9 level. In conclusion， MFSCE may improve the OA through not only inhibit the progress of OA but also increase the cartilage regeneration.**\n\n【97】**Many researches for the Development Disease-Modifying OA Drug (DMOAD) were progressed； however， it was still not developed because OA has complex pathogenic mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53\\]</u>. It was reported that， stem cell can promote cartilage regeneration by various mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[54\\]</u>. It also has been reported that transplanted stem cells can replace the damaged cartilage through differentiate to target cell 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[55\\]</u>. Recently， it was identified that stem cells can be affect to cartilage regeneration through release the paracrine molecules such as growth factor and thrombospondin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56\\]</u>. Furthermore， stem cells can modulate the immune response through release the cytokines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57\\]</u>. However， although the stem cell had attention as a new DMOAD， there are still some limitations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. To treat OA using stem cells， it has to be attached on the lesion， and has to be differentiated and proliferated. However， these processes are affected by various factors such as cell condition， growth condition， amount of stem cell and other endogenous factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[54\\]</u>. Moreover， stem cell can be differentiated unexpected cell because of its multi-potentiality\\[58，59\\]. Because of these various limitations， stem cell therapy has been difficulties to development. In the present study， we evaluated the cartilage regenerative effect using radiography. As shown in Figure 10， joint structure was improved and cartilage was regenerated28 days after MFSCE treatment. We suggested that MFSCE may act as paracrine factor released from stem cell to regulate cartilage regeneration and immune response. Moreover， we identified that MFSCE did not shown any toxicity performed at the GLP institution(data not shown). Therefore， MFSCE may alternate the stem cell therapy because it overcomes the limitations of stem cell therapy.**\n\n【98】**In this study， we found that 4 weeks treatment of MFSCE not only improve clinical sign of OA but also regenerate cartilage with no significant adverse effects. In addition， previous studies have**\n\n【99】**confirmed the mechanism of action of MFSCE on OA， and the non-toxicity. Therefore， MFSCE could be the first-in-class DMOAD.**\n\n【100】**Author Contributions**\n\n【101】**Conceptualization， Y.S.K.， J.O.L. and T.H.K.； methodology， S.E.H. and G.S.K.； formal analysis； Y.S.K.， J.O.L. and T.H.K.； writing-original draft preparation， Y.S.K.， J.O.L. and T.H.K.； writing-review and editing， S.E.H.； supervision， G.S.K.； project administration， Y.S.K.， J.O.L. and T.H.L.

A few reports of mite infestations in the human ear exist in the literature.**\n\n【15】**Case Report： A 58-year-old man presented with bilateral tinnitus and itching. Otoscopic examination revealed mite infestations in both ears. The infestation was cleared with otic 2% acetic acid solution.**\n\n【16】**Conclusion： We report the rare case of an infestation of mites and their eradication with otic acetic acid drops.**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Accidental entry of a foreign body in the ear canal is a common occurrence in an otolaryngology practice. Otoacariasis is a very peculiar and rare variant of this condition wherein the foreign body in question is an arthropod of the Acari subclass， be it a mite or a tick 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The literature reports a relatively frequent incidence of animate foreign bodies in the human ear， particularly ticks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-5\\]</u>. Mite infestations in the human ear on the other hand， is an extremely rare phenomenon \\[1，6\\]， with a handful reported cases since 1977 \\[1，6-8\\]. The most common presenting symptoms are usually itching， otalgia and a foreign body sensation. Otorrhea， evidence of otitis externa and tinnitus are less frequent presentations. Treatment consists of relieving the patients of their itching and pain， by killing the infesting mites. Suggested methods include washing the ear canal with warm saline， instilling mineral oil， lignocaine or 70% ethanol \\[1，4，6\\]. Scabicidal substances like crotamiton 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> can also be used.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**A 58-year-old male patient presented to the otology clinic with the chief complaint of tinnitus in the left ear of one month duration. He describes the tinnitus as sudden， persistent and of the buzzing type. The patient also reported mild ear itching bilaterally. There was no subjective hearing loss， recent noise exposure， otalgia or ear discharge. The patient had undergone tympanoplasty twice in the right ear with a canal wall down procedure. On otoscopic examination， crawling mites were observed filling the left external auditory canal. The ear canals were slightly erythematous，but otherwise dry . The right ear showed a wet and inflamed mastoid cavity with granulation tissue. It also was littered with mite eggs and adult mites . Both ears were syringed with warm saline. He had mild vertigo while syringing the right ear. A thereafter topical acetic acid ear drop (2%) was applied for 2 weeks. Otoscopy at follow-up clinic 2 weeks after the commencement oftreatment showed complete eradication ofthe mites in both ears.**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**Mite infestation in the human ear is an extremely rare phenomenon. Storage and dust mites are implicated in a significant number of cases reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. We could not recover any of the mites from the ear canal to conduct a closer examination. The video-otoscopic examination however clearly revealed mites in the dozens， translucent， crawling in both external ear canals and in the right wet mastoid cavity. We obtained the expert opinion of the parasitologist at our Medical Center to further identify the mites. The typical ovoid， smooth， translucent body and the four pairs oflegs are reminiscent ofthe Chortoglyphidae or Acaridae families of mites. A tentative classification ofthe observed mites would be Chortoglyphus Arcuatus， based on the work of Collof and Spieksma通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> . Chortoglyphus Arcuatus is a storage mite frequently found in barns and food storage sites， but can also be found in house dust samples all around the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Our patient did not have any significant travel or workplace history. It is very plausible to speculate that the source of contamination is mite-infested furniture at home. It is clear from their great number and the**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Erythematous right auditory canal with numerous mites swarming around.**\n\n【24】**Figure 2： (a) Left Inflamed wet ear littered with mites. (b，c) Shows two mites stuck together.**\n\n【25】**presence of eggs that the mites were able to survive and reproduce in the ear canal rich in shed skin and keratin. Obviously， the wet mastoid of the right ear cavity is not a reason for the presence of the mites since the other ear is dry and intact. It is certainly odd that the patient presented with tinnitus， an infrequent presentation. Indudharan“et al.”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> explain how the presence of a tick in the ear can cause tinnitus and even facial nerve paralysis by releasing neurotoxins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The mechanism behind our patient's tinnitus might be akin to that hypothesis， although there’s no evidence for it in the literature. While there's no established treatment for intra-aural mites， it seems that the common strategy consists of submerging them in warm saline or ethanol. The literature also mentions other treatment modalities from scabicidal ointments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> to topical hexacholorocyclohexane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Acetic Acid (2%) otic solution seems to have worked successfully in the eradication of mites in our patient， and we are suggesting its usage as a treatment modality.**\n\n【26】**Conclusion**\n\n【27】**We report the case of a 58-year-old man who presented with bilateral tinnitus and ear itching. Further otoscopic examination revealed infestation of mites in both ears. The mites were storage mites or the Chortoglyphidae family and were successfully eradicated with otic 2% acetic acid drops.**\n\n【28】**Figure 3： Pictorial representation of Chortoglyphidae mites from Colloff and Spieksma.**\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Although uncommon in human microflora， infections with Myroides bacteria have been observed. Due to increasingly advanced technologies in the detection of microorganisms， more number of these infections has been identified. Most cases of Myroides infection appear to occur in immunocompromised patients or patients who have existing comorbidities. So far， the documented infections are soft tissue related， ranging from mild cellulitis to fulminant necrotizing fasciitis. However， cases of endocarditis，bacteremia， UTI，pneumonia，and one case of ventriculitis in an infant due to Myroides bacteria have been reported. Here we present a case of a 52-year-old man presented with increased twitching， muscle spasms and shaking after a fall with head and left foot injury. Physical exam was significant for diffuse tetany，tremors， and chronic stasis dermatitis with a 10 cm x10 cm ulcerated weeping ulcer on the lateral aspect of the right ankle overlying the lateral malleolus extending to the dorsum of the foot. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain suggested ventriculitis/meningitis with pus in the posterior horn of the ventricles. Blood cultures grew Myroides species. Antibiotic therapy was optimized to Levofloxacin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam based on sensitivities. There are few cases published on Myroides species related infections， but most were related to cellulitis or diabetic foot ulcer. Our case is unique because the patient is diagnosed with Myroides bacteremia， which is rare presentation， with ventriculitis/meningitis， an extremely rare phenomenon.**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**The bacterial genus Myroides is a gram negative bacilli found ubiquitously in nature， isolated from both soil and bodies of water 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

His past medical history includes end stage renal disease， diabetes mellitus， history of endocarditis with AICD infection and removal， peripheral vascular disease with chronic cellulitis with multiple debridement's， osteomyelitis of the left foot with hallux amputation. He also described weakness and inability to walk with feelings of his legs giving out from under him. He was discharged from the hospital five days prior to presentation for right lateral foot wound debridement.**\n\n【17】**His initial vital signs were stable. Physical exam was significant for diffuse tetany， tremors， and chronic stasis dermatitis with a 10 cm ×10 cm ulcerated weeping lesion on the lateral aspect of the right ankle overlying the lateral malleolus extending to the dorsum of the foot. Labs demonstrated leukocytosis with white blood cell count of 12.5， left shift with 85% neutrophils， mild anemia with hemoglobin of 9， and electrolyte abnormalities consistent with a hemodialysis patient. Patient received hemodialysis and the foot wound was sutured closed. CT head was completed and demonstrated diffuse atrophy out of proportion for age. Two days later， the patient had a witnessed grand mal seizure， aborted with 1mg of Ativan. Levetiracetam was added to his regimen for seizure prophylaxis. Patient remained postictal and was altered the following day. Two days following， patient complained of severe headache during hemodialysis and was unable to complete it. MRI**\n\n【18】**brain suggested ventriculitis/meningitis with pus in the posterior horn of the ventricles. Patient's antibiotics regimen was changed to empiric broad spectrum for suspected meningitis which included Ampicillin， Ceftriaxone， Vancomycin， and also a dose of Amikacin and Acyclovir were given. Patient remained afebrile， but altered. On day 7， patient spiked fever 100.8F. Blood was cultures grew Myroides species， detected using Biofire PCR. Speciation was unable to be performed. Antibiotic sensitivities of Myroides showed resistance to Amikacin， Ceftriaxone， Cefepime， Aztreonam， Gentamycin， and Tobramycin. Susceptibly to Ciprofloxacin， Levofloxacin，Meropenem and Piperacillin-Tazobactam. Based on the sensitive， Cefepime was changed to Piperacillin-Tazobactam. On day 9， LP was performed and CSF analysis demonstrated protein 138， WBC 163， Lymphocytes88， neutrophil 10%， glucose 56. H. simplex negative. Culture was negative， suggesting a partially treated bacterial ventriculitis or aseptic meningitis. Antibiotic therapy was optimized to just Levofloxacin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam.**\n\n【19】**Discussion**\n\n【20】**First discovered in 1923， the genus was originally identified as Flavobacterium due to their unique fruit-like odor in culture medium. However， later speciation in the 1990s led to the name change. The bacterial genus Myroides is a gram negative rod found ubiquitously in nature. It has been isolated from both soil and bodies of water 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although uncommonly found in human microflora， and previously thought to be non-pathogenic， although very rare， human infections with Myroides have been observed， and due to increasingly advanced technologies in the detection of microorganisms， there has been an increased number of these infections observed. Based on literature review， less than 70 cases of Myroides infection have been reported. Three species have been identified as causing human infection：Odoratus， odoratimimus， and injenensis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Case reports have demonstrated that these bacteria can cause significant morbidity and mortality \\[2，3\\]. These bacteria have the capability of being particularly pathogenic due to their ability to form a biofilm \\[5，6\\].**\n\n【21】**Most cases of Myroides infection appear to occur in those who are immunocompromised or have existing comorbidities. Most documented infections are soft tissue， ranging from mild cellulitis to fulminant necrotizing fasciitis \\[7，8\\]. However， other cases of endocarditis， bacteremia， UTI， pneumonia， and one case of ventriculitis have been reported \\[1，91.**\n\n**Treatment of Myroides can be particularly difficult owing to its intrinsic antibiotic resistance. Most isolated strains are resistant to Beta-lactam antibiotics， while its sensitivity to quinolones， aminoglycosides， and1Ssulfamethoxazoleare variable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. This resistance is thought to be related to its production of metallo-beta-lactamases1|.**\n\n【23】**This patient was particularly interesting in several circumstances. First the patient developed bacteremia. In literature， only 6 cases of bacteremia have been reported， 4 of which were related to cellulitis or diabetic foot ulcer. This patient possessed was not only a diabetic， but complicated with bilateral chronic cellulitis and ulcer. Patient presented following traumatic injury to foot， which may have initiated seeding of the bacteria in the blood. Additionally， a**\n\n【24】**chronically infected lower extremity with disrupted skin barrier not only provides a nidus for propagation on the bacteria，but also a route to the blood stream.**\n\n【25】**Additionally， this case is unique in that the patient also developed ventriculitis. Ventriculitis can be secondary： Meningitis-bacterial and viral， Cerebral abscess with intraventricular rupture， Catheter-related-shunt or EVD related， Head trauma， Cerebrospinal Fluid(CSF) leak， Complication of neurosurgery， Complications of intrathecal chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【26】**Although the CSF did not demonstrate any organism， with given radiographic evidence of abnormal enhancement/debris in the lateral ventricles compatible to meningitis and ventriculitis， and the patient had been receiving antibiotic therapy for more than 9 days before the LP was completed， it could be likely partially treated meningitis.

Adult intussusception accounts for 5% of all cases of intussusception and 1% to 5% of all cases of intestinal obstruction with ileocolic intussusception being the most common type in adults and there are few reported cases of jejunojejunal intussusception. Feeding Jejunostomy (F) is a simple surgical procedure for enteral nutrition， but it can develop complications that may require re-exploration and can be life-threating. Common complications include mechanical ones such as tube migration or dislocation， infection， gastrointestinal symptoms， fluid and electrolyte imbalances. However， intussusception is a rare complication. Herein， we presented a patient with gastric cancer who had received subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth-II reconstruction and feeding jejunostomy， and then developed jejunojejunal intussusception following the placement of feeding tube into the jejunum.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Intussusception； Feeding jejunostomy； Gastric cancer； Subtotal gastrectomy； Bilroth-II reconstruction**\n\n【17】**Key Messages**\n\n【18】**Unlike in the pediatric population， intussusceptions in adults are usually caused by a pathological lead point and the placement of an intestinal tube for feeding purposes has been rarely reported as a cause of intussusceptions. Here， we showed the rare case of jejunojejunal intussusception following the placement of feeding tube.**\n\n【19】**Introduction**\n\n【20】**Intussusception is defined as the proximal bowel invaginating into the distal bowel. Feeding Jejunostomy (FJ)， inserting a tube in proximal jejunum surgically， is for enteral nutrition. About90% of the intussusceptions in adults， a definitive organic lesion causing intussusceptions presents. The postoperative intussusceptions are a special entity that can be idiopathic， or associated with mucosal，intramural or extrinsic causes； the placement of a long intestinal tube for feeding purposes has been seldom reported as a cause. Here， we demonstrated that a case of adult intussusceptions caused by the placement ofthe feeding tube and discuss the diagnostic process and management.**\n\n【21】**A 60-year-old female， diagnosed with gastric cancer， received laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy plus Billroth-II reconstruction and feeding jejunostomy in February， 2022. After surgery， she received adjuvant chemotherapy (mFOLFOX4) and supplementary enteral nutrition from feeding jejunostomy. Unfortunately， she developed intermittent vomiting for one week in April， 2022. Associated symptoms were nausea，anorexia，intermittent abdominalpain and absence of defecation. At first， she came to our emergent department. The laboratory studies showed leukocytosis， elevated CRP (C-Reactive Protein) and acute kidney injury. The abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) demonstrated target sign over proximal jejunum by axial plane  and pseudo-kidney sign by sagittal plane . In the high suspicion of jejunojejunal intussusception， exploratory laparotomy was performed. Intraoperatively， it revealed jejunojejunal intussusceptions and the lead point was kinked tip of the FJ . Enterolysis with reduction of intussusceptions were performed  and the feeding jejunostomy was taken-down ； thereafter， her symptoms gradually improved and she was uneventfully discharged from our hospital. Currently， she receives regular adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX4) for gastric cancer and no more episodes of adhesive bowel obstruction nor intussusceptions have been found so far. In summary of this case， the tip of feeding tube acts as the leading point during a peristaltic wave. An illustrated picture is**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： The contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) (A) Axial view at the region of the start of intussusception (red arrow). A bowel loop with its mesentery is seen entering into the adjacent bowel lumen. A target sign was shown. (B) Sagittal view showed the pseudo-kidney sign (red arrow).**\n\n【23】**Figure 2： Intra-operative image. An antegradejejunojejunal intussusceptioon.**\n\n【24】**Figure 3： Introperative image. Mamunal reduction of the jejunojejunal intussueception was demonstrated and showed the feeding tube (red arrow).**\n\n【25】**shown as Figure 5.**\n\n【26】**Discussion**\n\n【27】**Enteral feeding is a preferable route for perioperative nutrition due to its trophic effects on the intestine， causing less bacterial translocation and low infective complications for patients with a disease of the upper digestive tract. FJ is a surgical procedure for enteral feeding and it is indicated as an additional procedure during a major upper gastrointestinal surgery， ifa complicated postoperative recovery is expected. There are many techniques， including open longitudinal Witzel，Stamm， needle catheter technique， percutaneous endoscopy and laparoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However， it is not free from complications and some studies have quoted the complication rate could be up to 53.6%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Jejunojejunal intussusceptions are one such**\n\n【28】**Figure 4： Take-down of feeding tube and reconstruction of the jejunum with end-to-end anastomosis.**\n\n【29】**complication rarely reported in the medical literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. One series evaluating complications following jejunostomy tubes detected an intussusception rate of 1% in contrast radiographs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【30】**Intussusception is defined as the telescoping of the proximal segment of the gastrointestinal tract within the lumen of the adjacent segment. The presentation of adult intussusception may be revealed by more chronic or vague abdominal pain (71%)，nausea and vomiting(68%)， abdominal distension with partial obstruction (45%)， or a palpable mass at physical examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Adult intussusception also differs from the pediatric one in that it is most often associated with a pathological lead point. Depending upon the site of the lead point， they can be classified into entero-enteric， ileocolic， ileocecal， and colocolic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The placement of an intestinal tube for feeding purposes has been rarely known to cause intussusception， accounting for only1% of all cases of intussusceptions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Different theories have been proposed for intussusception caused by the placement of feeding tubes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The theories included that 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the tip of the feeding tube acting as the leading point and dragging the proximal segment over the distal segment during a peristaltic wave. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> retrograde peristalsis of the jejunum during episode of vomiting. 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the injecting force from the pump during feeding possibly dragging the bowel， causing**\n\n【31】**intussusception. 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> poorly built patients having reduced fatty tissue in the omentum and mesentery， which may allow the free movement of the bowel causing a predisposition to intussusceptions； and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> an increased caliber or a longer length of the feeding tube used in the bowel segment possibly producing intussusception due to distal tip migration. The diagnosis of FJ tube-induced intussusceptions is challenging as the clinical presentation is mostly nonspecific with no obstruction to the jejunostomy feeding. Moreover， the patients might be asymptomatic in 20% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. A Contract-Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) of the abdomen is the most sensitive imaging modality to detect intussusception. Imaging features suggestive of intussusception are a target or sausage-shaped soft tissue mass enveloped within an eccentrically located area of low density， referring to a bowel within bowel configuration. Additionally， it can provide other important information such as length and diameter of the intussusception， possible lead point， the type and location of intussusception， the presence of strangulation or partial or complete bowel obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A short segment or transient intussusception caused by the FJ tube can be managed conservatively by changing the tube to a standard or short tube over a guidewire under fluoroscopic guidance or reduction by injecting air or contrast material through the tube； however， cases with long segment persistent intussusception with features of partial or complete obstruction or features of strangulation required operative intervention. Definitive management is the surgical exploration and manual reduction， or resection of the intussusception segment based on the intraoperative findings and bowel viability. Nevertheless，there is no single established management strategy and the decision should be individualized for each patient as per clinical scenario 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**A jejunojejunal intussusception is a rare complication following FJ； additionally， it is often nonspecific and requires a high index of suspicion. CECT is the most sensitive tool for diagnosing and detecting any complications. Though a conservative approach can be tried for simple transient cases， definitive surgical intervention is required for cases with obstruction or strangulation.**\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Citellis abscess is infrequently encountered in patients with suppurative otitis media； the presence of LS in combination is a rare occurrence. Prior to the wide distribution of antibiotic use LS was an often-fatal condition. Though its prevalence has decreased in recent years， there has been a resurgence due to antibiotic resistance. Fusobacterium species have long been reported as the most prevalent organism in this disease. The presents of Proteus species as source pathogen has not been identified to date. Following early surgical and medical intervention the patient had a favourable outcome in this case. Difficulties in theatre time and access to imaging may have contributed to delay in diagnosis； however this did not lead to worsening morbidity.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Lemierre's syndrome； Proteus mirabilis； Chronic otitis media； Citelli's abscess**\n\n【15】**Abbreviations**\n\n【16】**COM： Chronic Otitis Media； CT： Computer Tomography； ENT： Ear， Nose， and Throat； HIV：Human Immune Virus； Hb： Hemoglobin； LS： Lemierre’s Syndrome； PCR： Polymerase Chain Reaction； RNA： Ribonucleic Acid**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Chronic middle ear infections are the most important preventable cause of hearing loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The global burden of chronic otitis media is between 65 to 330 million \\[11.**\n\n【19】**The intracranial complications of otitis media include meningitis， brain abscess， otitic hydrocephalus and lateral sinus thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Extracranial complications include mastoiditis， with or without cholesteatoma through contagious spread. Other complications are encountered less commonly and the list includes labyrinth fistulae， facial nerve palsy， and subperiosteal abscesses of the mastoid \\[1，2\\].**\n\n【20】**Subperiosteal abscess pathways can occur by direct inflammatory spread from the overflowing mastoiditis into nearby spaces and muscles attached to the temporal bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.

This is a rare occurrence and is not well document in literature \\[3，4\\].**\n\n【21】**Lemierre’s Syndrome (LS) is a rare complication resulting in septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein that is associated with ear， nose and throat infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. This syndrome was labeled a \"forgotten disease”in the 1980's because of the widespread introduction of antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. This is a lethal syndrome with a 90% mortality rate when left untreated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Successful treatment of LS depends on early detection and treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-10\\]</u>. The number of cases has increased over the years demonstrated by a systematic review of LS in 2009 that reviewed 114 cases globally with ages of occurrence ranging between two months to 78 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In 2016， Johannesen and Bodtger did a five-year review of cases with LS and found 137 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This increase in number of cases of LS is due to a change in pattern of antibiotic prescription， as well as an increase in the incidence of antibiotic resistance \\[6，7\\]. A definite diagnosis of LS is made on bases of a recent pharyngeal illness； complicated by septic emboli； thrombosis of internal jugular or blood cultures of Fusobacterium necrophorum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The thrombophlebitis ofthe internal jugular is associated with septic embolization’s commonly to the lungs \\[6，7\\].

Two cases of LS that have been reported in case reports in South Africa in the past 20 years \\[10，11\\].**\n\n【24】**Case Presentation**\n\n【25】**An 18-year-old male patient presented to a hospital in KwaZulu-Natal， South Africa； with a two-week history of a productive cough with yellow sputum with blood streaks， right sided pleuritic chest pain， fever， and rigors. He also reported a purulent left ear discharge with left anterior neck and posterior auricular pain. He has a medical history of multiple episodes of AOM that were treated with antibiotics at district level clinics in childhood. In 2012 he had Computed Topography (CT) that revealed chronic mastoiditis which was treated with prolonged antibiotics. He had recently tested negative for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and received all his vaccinations. This was his first hospitalization for this problem.**\n\n【26】**His vital signs on the day of admission revealed a temperature of 40.3C； a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with oxygen**\n\n【27】**saturation of 96% while breathing ambient air； a radial pulse rate of124 beats per minute； and a non-invasive blood pressure of 106/74mmHg.**\n\n【28】**His physical examination revealed lefttposterior auricular swelling with small posterior auricular lymph nodes as well as a tender， swollen left carotid-angle. He was pale however his cardiovascular examination was normal and there were no features of infective endocarditis. His respiratory examination revealed features of consolidation involving his right midzone and right lower zone， furthermore there was reduced breathe sound in both lung basis. His abdominal and central nervous system examinations did not reveal any abnormalities. He was diagnosed as septic chronic otitis media complicated by mastoiditis.**\n\n【29】**Case Management**\n\n【30】**The results of investigations done during this admission are summarized in Table 1. Day one of admission， he was taken to theatre for radical mastoidectomy with incision and drainage. He received amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 1.2 g three times daily from**\n\n【31】**Figure 1： Lung cavity with a fluid level in the right lower zone of a patient with Lemierre's syndrome.**\n\n【32】**Figure 2： CT scan showing transverse sinus thrombosis and left sided peri-auricular abscess collection.**\n\n【33】**Figure 3： Citelli's abscess in an 18-year-old with chronic mastoiditis： (green arrow heads).**\n\n【34】**day one to three. On day three， his blood cultures grew P. mirabilis(PM) with sensitivity to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole， penicillin， cephalosporin and gentamycin. The amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was changed to ceftriaxone 1 g three times daily as he had worsening hyperbilirubinemia and cholestasis. On the fifth of his admission， his clinical condition had not improved despite directed antibiotics and surgical drainage； he still had tenderness and swelling at the left carotid angle with fever， dyspnea， tachypnea and on-going production**\n\n【35】**of blood streaked sputum. Four additional blood cultures and six sputum cultures were negative at this point. He was now assessed as worsening septicemia and his antibiotics was changed to piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin. Repeat imaging of his head， neck and chest was performed. The chest X-ray was repeated and it showed a cavity in right lower zone . The Computed Tomography (CT) scan found that there was reorganization of the abscess with transverse sinus thrombus . The CT scan ofthe neck and chest revealed rim enhancing collection in the soft tissues of the left peri-auricular region and deep neck tissues with an Internal Jugular (IJ) thrombus extending to the transverse sinus . The CT scan of the chest further revealed multiple lesions that were in different stages of breakdown with cavities . The transverse sinus thrombosis was an extension of internal jugular thrombus due to sepsis related thrombophlebitis and the distribution of his lung lesions suggest they were due to septic embolization from his primary site of infection. He was subsequently diagnosed with Lemierre’s syndrome secondary to COM complicated with mastoiditis and Citelli's abscess.**\n\n【36】**On day six， he was referred to Ear， Nose and Throat (ENT) department for emergency incision and drainage. His surgery was delayed because of the South African lockdown due to coronavirus prevention strategy. Surgery was performed on day eight after his initial presentation； he underwent drainage of post-auricular and Citellis abscess in theatre which evacuated fifteen milliliters (15ml) and twenty milliliters (20 ml) of purulent debris. His clinical condition showed marked improvement post-surgery. The respiratory symptoms and productive cough immediately ceased day one post-surgery. On the eleventh day of his admission， the intraoperative**\n\n【37】**Figure 4： Left internal jugular vein thrombus： (green arrow heads).**\n\n【38】**Figure 5： Multiple bilateral lung lesions with cavitation in an 18-year-old immunocompetent male with Lemierre's syndrome.**\n\n【39】**specimen from two sites both cultured PM with similar sensitivity as his index blood culture from admission. The patient continued to improve and inflammatory markers normalized. The tazobactam/piperacillin 4.5 g three times daily was continued for 14 days and amikacin continued for 5 days after the drainage of abscess. During the course of admission， the patient had worsening ofthe mild anemia with Hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.2 g/dL that was seen at admission with a minimum drop to Hb of 8.1 g/dL. The anemia was a normocytic and normochromic anemia resulting from surgical blood loss， multiple blood sampling， and severe acute illness. The anemia gradually normalized after the septicemia had resolved. The lesions in his lungs improved with a six-week course of amoxicillin. He was counseled on anticoagulation and the decision was to continue anticoagulation tor 6 months.**\n\n【40】**Discussion**\n\n【41】**Our patient had four positive cultures of P. mirabilis from different sites that were obtained at different times during his admission. P. mirabilis as an offending organism in LS is rare. Ninety percent of proteus infections are due to P. mirabilis， a gram-negative bacillus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This organism is considered to be a community acquired organism that is able to survive on solid surfaces 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. It is reported to be one of the common pathogens cultured in chronic middle ear infections and is also commonly cultured in patients with urinary tract infection in the setting of prolonged catheterization \\[1，6，13，12\\]. A systemic review from 2003 to 2019， found that P. aeruginosa， S. aureus， and P. mirabilis were there main reported pathogens associated with bacterial otitis media in the Sub-Saharan Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. P. mirabilis was found to be the culprit organism in 36%(18/50) adults with otitis media in Western Cape， South Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Furthermore P. mirabilis was also the most frequently cultured organism in a system review of 1，307 cases with otogenic brain abscess in 2018 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. During the initial stages of management， this Proteus organism proved to be a challenge in the treatment of the patient due to the uncertainty of whether the organism had resulted in the chronic mastoiditis or if it was a contaminant. This proved to be a challenge during the initial stages of management of this case. Due to LS being relatively rare， it was difficult to ascribe the patient's index clinical state being due to P. mirabilis infection and thus the choice to direct antibiotics as per cultures became an area of contention. In spite of five days of directed antibiotic therapy， the patient showed no clinical or biochemical improvement.**\n\n【42】**Prolonged antibiotics are suggested to be the mainstay treatment of internal jugular vein thrombosis in patients with LS. There is no suggested regimen of antibiotics as there has never been randomized controlled trials to assist with clear guidelines to the management of LS. Surgical removal of the thrombus was previously explored in the pre-antibiotic era but not in the post antibiotic era \\[6，71.**\n\n【43】**The presence of chest lesions and infiltrative liver function test with hyperbilirubinemia should alert treating physicians to explore the upper respiratory tract for a possible source of infection as delay in diagnosis can have near fatal consequences.**\n\n【44】**Conclusion**\n\n【45】**Early diagnosis and initiation of antibiotics is key to the outcome of these patients. Knowledge about complications of middle ear**\n\n【46】**infections and Lemierre’s syndrome is vital for practitioners managing patients with middle ear infections.**\n\n【47】**Permission**\n\n【48】**The patient gave consent for the case report to be published.

Al-Atrache Band Gibbs J_ _Department of Surgery， Jersey Shore University Medical Center， USA_**\n\n【10】**Abstract**\n\n【11】**Littoral cell angioma is an uncommon primary vascular neoplasm of the spleen. It is made up of littoral cells that line the red pulp's splenic sinuses. Netra Rana et al. reported littoral cell angioma to be a benign incidental lesion. Only after histopathology and immunohistochemistry testing can a final diagnosis be made. Immunohistochemistry is a useful tool in diagnosing littoral cell angioma because it can demonstrate the distinct hybrid endothelial-histiocytic phenotype of littoral cells， which aids in making an accurate diagnosis. We present a rare etiology of splenic neoplasm treated with splenectomy. To our knowledge， there are only a few cases reported in the medical literature.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Littoral cell angioma； Splenomegaly； Splenectomy**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Littoral Cell Angioma (LCA) is an uncommon primary vascular neoplasm ofthe spleen seen in the red sinus shore cells of the Reticuloendothelial System (RES) and was first discovered by Falk et al. in 1991 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. The major clinical manifestation is isolated splenomegaly of unknown etiology and the diagnosis practically demands splenectomy. Splenectomy because the diagnosis of Littoral cell angioma is confirmed via a histological study. In this article， we would like to report a rare case encounter of splenic vascular neoplasm.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 60-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension， sarcoidosis，lower leg edema and prior history of thyroid disease presents to the office for possible splenectomy consideration. In 2021， the patient underwent a Computer Tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis to investigate cholelithiasis. During this scan， multiple splenic lesions were incidentally discovered， along with isolated splenomegaly of 18 cm in greatest dimension， without associated hepatomegaly. The patient has not experienced any symptoms related to these findings， such as weight loss， fatigue， nausea， vomiting， diarrhea， constipation， pain， fevers， chills， or vision changes. She underwent extensive testing to try to determine the cause of these findings.**\n\n【17】**The tests included Complete Blood Count (CBC)， Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)， Lactate Dehydrogenase(LDH)， uric acid，Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme(ACE)，HIV/HEP panel， Computer Tomography of the thorax (CT thorax)， and flow cytometry， all of which were negative. Due to her inconclusive laboratory results she underwent a splenic biopsy. The report demonstrated the presence of numerous polymorphous lymphocytes in a background of scattered spindle cells with mild atypia. Laparoscopic splenectomy was recommended to her.**\n\n【18】**Discussion**\n\n【19】**Primary tumors of the spleen are divided into two categories， lymphoid tumors and nonlymphoid tumors \\[4，5\\]. The most common non-lymphoid tumors are vascular tumors， which can be either benign or malignant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Benign vascular tumors include hemangioma，lymphangioma， hemangioendothelioma， and Littoral Cell Angioma (LCA). Since its first cited case in 1991 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， only29 cases of LCA have been described in the literature， owing to its exceeding rarity.**\n\n【20】**LCA tumors share a unique， soft tissue capsule morphology. While derived from the red pulp sinuses lined by endothelial cells， these capsules express both endothelial and histiocytic antigens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Due to this， LCA tumors have both immunophenotypic and morphologic features that differentiate them from other benign splenic tumors， including their expression of CD68 and Lysozyme macrophage markers and FVIII and CD31 endothelial markers， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【21】**Littoral cell angiomas can occur in all age groups but typically present in middle age with nonspecific complaints ofabdominal pain and splenomegaly on sonographic and CT imaging. The appearance of splenic LCA varies widely， ranging from multiple blood-filled nodules grossly to solitary lesions that engulf the entire parenchyma of the spleen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Microscopically， canonical findings of LCA include aggregates ofeosinophilic globules， likely derived from phagocytosed red blood cells， lymphocytes and plasma cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Treatment of LCA is open or hand-assisted laparoscopic total splenectomy with tissue preservation for histologic analysis.**\n\n【22】**Of the 29 documented cases of LCA， 9 have been associated with other cancers， including visceral epithelial malignancies (colorectal adenocarcinoma， renal and pancreatic adenocarcinoma) as well as other liquid and solid cancers including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma， unspecified tumors of the liver and brain， epithelial ovarian cancer and a non-small cell lung cancer \\[6，8\\]. Given its diverse presentation， a thorough workup for a second visceral neoplasm may be necessary in these patients， although no predictive genetic or molecular associations have been found.**\n\n【23】**Conclusion**\n\n【24】**The incidence of tumors of the spleen are rare when compared to that of tumors of other visceral organs. Littoral cell angioma represents a rare， benign vascular tumor of the spleen that usually presents as non-specific abdominal pain and is typically diagnosed by histology. Although these tumors are benign， their association with other visceral neoplasms is still under investigation.**\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

CP is observed in 0.2%-0.4% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. They generally have experienced pericardial trauma or inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Despite its poor prognosis when untreated， CP is potentially curable. Surgical pericardiectomy can be performed at low operative risk. Cardiologists should have a high index of suspicion for CP in patients presenting with predominant right-sided heart failure(HF)， particularly when accompanied by a history of cardiac surgery， pericarditis， and/or pericardial effusion. Transthoracic two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography are usually the first diagnostic tools in the evaluation of HF and can reliably identify CP in most patients by the characteristic real-time motion of the heart and hemodynamic features. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging provide incremental data for the diagnosis and management of CP and are especially helpful when clinical or echocardiographic findings are inconclusive. Cardiac catheterization has been the gold standard for the diagnosis of CP but may not be necessary if non-invasive tests demonstrate the diagnostic features of CP. Catheterization should then be reserved for selected cases or for assessing concomitant coronary disease. Although most patients with CP require pericardiectomy， anti-inflammatory therapy may be curative in patients presenting with subacute symptoms， especially when evidence of marked ongoing inflammation is seen.**\n\n【14】**Conventional Surgery**\n\n【15】**Surgical pericardiectomy is a potentially curative intervention. Gillaspie and colleagues reported a 20-year experience with isolated pericardiectomy performed at Mayo Clinic between January1993 and December 2013 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In that study， 355 patients had undergone pericardiectomy for CP. Radiation-related cases were excluded. Radical resection-defined as removal of anterior， inferior， and left lateral pericardium posterior to the left phrenic nerve-was most commonly performed， with an overall mortality of 2.5% among the 355 patients. The authors referred to specific patients who had constrictive pericardium and epicardium. They recommended that a tight epicardial peel should be left on non-contiguous islands. They did not indicate how many cases required the additional procedure. Certainly， though， some of those with thickened epicardium would have required additional attention. Repeat surgery for constrictive pericarditis is associated with 7%thirty-day mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Constrictive epicardial thickness might lead to the repeat surgery.**\n\n【16】**Waffle Procedure**\n\n【17】**The waffle procedure， performed by incising the tight fibrotic epicardium in a crosshatched manner， releases the epicardial constriction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. A survey of the English-language literature since1983 for references to the waffle procedure applied to relieve constrictive pericarditis yielded 10articles and/or abstracts. Eight of the articles/abstracts originated in Japan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-12\\]</u>. There is no clinical**\n\n【18】**evidence，however， that Japanese people with constrictive pericarditis tend to develop epicardial thickening. Nine of the articles/abstracts were published as case reports \\[4-6，8，9，11-14\\].**\n\n【19】**The waffle procedure is performed with electric and/or sharp dissection. Matsuura and Kanda used an ultrasonic scalpel \\[11，12\\]. Three techniques are used in our institution and are chosen on a case-by-case basis. Yamamoto and Shiraish compared cases of isolated pericardiectomy with cases of pericardiectomy in conjunction with the epicardial waffle procedure \\[7，10\\]. The authors concluded that the waffle procedure improved diastolic function in patients with epicardial thickening and that it was effective in patients with persistent epicardial constriction. We have chosen to apply the waffle procedure in patients with constrictive pericarditis associated with thickened epicardium.**\n\n【20】**Conclusions**\n\n【21】**Constrictive pericarditis is sometimes associated with constrictive epicarditis. Extensive epicardiectomy is not easy， and the waffle procedure can be used to relieve the hemodynamic status produced by the constriction.**\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

However， it is uncommon the association of the infiltrate with specific renal histopathological alterations， such as a Granulomatous Interstitial Nephritis (GIN)， with severe kidney function impairment. We describe a patient with progressive TP53 mutated CLL who developed acute renal failure due to leukemic infiltration associated with GIN during treatment with ibrutinib， the new inhibitor of the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase. After stopping ibrutinib， the patient obtained a complete remission with high doses of prednisone plus chemoimmunotherapy， but recently he underwent relapse treated now with venetoclax plus prednisone.**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Chronic LymphocyticLeukemia (CLL)。alow grade malignancycconsistingof CD5+CD23+CD200+ small Blymphocytes， is the most frequent leukemia in the western world. The treatment landscape for CLL is rapidly evolving. Combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens like FCR (Fludarabine， Cyclophosphamide， Rituximab) and BR (Bendamustine， Rituximab) have been the frontline therapies for CLL， whereas Chlorambucil remained the standard frontline therapy for older patients (65 years or older) with CLL until recently \\[1，2\\]. Targeted therapy with small molecule inhibitors against Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) such as ibrutinib and acalabrutinib are playing a major role for treatment of patients with either treatment-naive or refractory/relapsed CLL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>.**\n\n【19】**The Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib showed an impressive and sustained Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) benefit both in first line and in relapsed or refractory CLL. Nevertheless， patients with specific high risk features like TP53 mutations showed a trend toward shorter PFS， and altogether， only half of the enrolled patients were still receiving ibrutinib at the end of the observation period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Here， we report a peculiar case of acute renal failure associated with leukemic infiltration and Granulomatous Interstitial Nephritis (GIN) occurring in a CLL patient with TP53 gene mutations， refractory to ibrutinib in first line， but subsequently responding to chemoimmunotherapy.**\n\n【20】**In February 2014， a 59-year-old male patient presented with asymptomatic widespread lymphadenopathy (cervical， axillary， supraclavicular， mediastinal and inguinal) and splenomegaly(18cm onimaging). His white cell count was higher than normal with differential count showing 16.0x10/L lymphocytes. The immunophenotypic study carried out on peripheral blood lymphocytes by flow cytometry showed a CD19+/CD20+/CD5+/CD23-/CD200+ homogeneous phenotype with a IGL-Lambda clonal restriction， confirming the diagnosis of atypical (CD23-) CLL. The prognostic biomarker CD38 was negative (10% of positive CLL cells). FISH analysis revealed the deletion of the long arm ofchromosome 13 (del13q-) and the deletion ofthe short arm of chromosome 17 (del17p-). Clonal mutations of the TP53 gene were also found (variant allele frequency， VAF， 78%， mutation on exon 8 c.916C>T，p.R306X). This pathogenic variant is denoted TP53 c.916C>T at the cDNA level and p.Arg306Ter (R306X) at the protein level. The substitution creates a nonsense variant， which changes an Arginine to a premature stop codon (CGA>TGA)， and is predicted to cause**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： A and B) Immunophenotype of the B lymphocytes shows CD5 C) and CD20 D) positivity.

Variable heavy chain genes of Immunoglobulins (IGHV) status resulted as unmutated， i.e. below the established cut-off of 2% of IGHV mutations (1.7%IGHV3-482). In April 2016， the patient presented a rapid increase in peripheral lymphocytosis (100.0×10/L)， massive increase in mediastinal， abdominal lymph nodes， splenomegaly (24 cm on imaging) and B symptoms. A total Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) scan， showing low Standardized Uptake Values (SUV) ruled out Richter’s syndrome transformation. Therefore， the patient started first-line treatment with oral ibrutinib in monotherapy at the dosage of 420 mg/d， according to the ESMO2016 guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. During the first month of treatment the patient showed discrete increase in total lymphocyte count and then a rapid decrease in the following three months. The values of hemoglobin and platelet remained stable as well as the hepatorenal function. A clinical and imaging re-evaluation of the disease carried out in July showed stable disease. In August 2016， the patient suddenlypresented fever above 38°C together with lumbago and widespread bone pain. Creatinine (3.57 mg/dl)， Azotemia (112 mg/dl)， Proteinuria (0.22 gr/dl) were abnormally increased and the patient was hospitalized for the onset of an acute renal failure. Ultrasonography showed a volumetric increase of both kidneys associated with parenchymal alterations. An immunoassay screening (IgA levels， C3 and C4 complement components) was negative for autoimmune disorders. Therefore， a renal biopsy was performed showing moderate peritubular and intratubular interstitial infiltrates by a clonal subpopulation of small CD20 and CD5 positive B-lymphocytes lacking CD23， Cyclin D1and CD10 expression . The histopathology was also characterized by a population of CD3+T lymphocytes and by a large， non-necrotizing chronic granulomatous phlogosis . No glomerular or tubulointerstitial immune complex deposits were detected by immunofluorescence (not shown). The peripheral blood immunophenotype performed by flow cytometry showed a CD20+/CD5+/CD23- and CD200+homogeneous B-lymphocyte population， The FISH analysis and the TP53 mutations confirmed the same**\n\n【23】**picture of the onset. After exclusion of a tuberculous or sarcoidotic nature of renal granulomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， the patient stopped ibrutinib and started therapy with methylprednisolone at the dose of 1 mg/Kg body weight obtaining a partial resolution of the renal failure. Afterwards， the patient was discharged from the hospital with prednisone therapy. In September 2016， he resumed oral therapy with ibrutinib at the standard dose of 420 mg per day. However， a certain degree of chronic renal failure (Creatinine 2.4 mg/dL， Azotemia 141 mg/dL)， Anemia (Hemoglobin 11 g/dL)， peripheral B clonal lymphocytosis(45.0×10/L)， superficial and inner adenopathies persisted. For this reason， in October 2016， the patient discontinued therapy with ibrutinib and started chemoimmunotherapy according to the R-CHOP scheme (Rituximab 375 mg/m’， Cyclophosphamide750 mg/m， Vincristine 1.4 mg/m， Doxorubicin 50 mg/m’ and Prednisone 40 mg/m²) for a total of six cycles， which was successfully completed in February 2017. During this second-line therapy， the renal function showed a remarkable improvement and creatinine levels were only slightly higher than normal (about 1.5 to 1.7 mg/dL). The imaging re-evaluation， performed with TC total body， did not show either lymphadenopathies or splenomegaly. Therefore， the patient achieved a complete remission of the disease. In June 2019， the patient showed disease recurrence with increasing lymphocytosis(35.0×10/L)，numerous superficial and inner lymph node swellings， splenomegaly， fair kidney failure (Creatinine 2.0 mg/dL) and bone marrow lymphocytic infiltrate. For this reason， in July 2019， the patient started treatment with venetoclax， an oral Bcl-2 inhibitor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， and prednisone， which is ongoing.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**Cases of GIN associated with kidney leukemia infiltrate are uncommon. Sometimes they may occur with acute kidney failure pictures that improve under corticosteroid treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-14\\]</u>. Our patient developed GIN framework associated with leukemic infiltrates leading to an acute renal failure during treatment with ibrutinib. According to the current literature， granulomatous reactions may be caused by concomitant mycobacterial infections and rare tumors including malignant lymphomas \\[15，16\\]. The participation of T cells， as in our case， in granulomatous reactions is well established， but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been yet elucidated. Noteworthy， Interleukin (IL) 17， a cytokine secreted by T-lymphocytes has been established as an important factor in T-cell-mediated IFN-gamma production and granuloma formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Moreover， the pathogenesis of GIN in patients with CLL/SLL is unknown. There is great evidence that CLL patients have T-cell dysfunction which contributes to infectious and auto-immune complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The fact that our case of GIN was accompanied by CLL interstitial infiltration suggest that GIN may be a local hypersensitivity reaction to tumor-derived antigens， which may stimulate antigen-presenting cells to produce cytokines involved in granulomatous inflammation， such as IL-12， IL-18 and/or IL-27 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Moreover， our patient had not evidence by immunofluorescence of monoclonal protein or immune-complex-type deposits， providing evidence against paraprotein-mediated or immune-complex-mediated interstitial nephritis. In our patient， both the kidney function and the hematological disease improved on high dose steroids and on CLL-directed Chemoimmunotherapy(R-CHOP). It may be hypothesized that the refractoriness to ibrutinib with the subsequent GIN may be partly due to the above mentioned pathogenic variant of the TP53 mutation. B-lymphocyte clone had an immunophenotypic pattern (CD23-/CD200+/Cyclin D1-/CD10-)**\n\n【26】**that excluded mantle cell lymphoma (Cyclin D1 negative)， follicular lymphoma (CD10 negative) and marginal lymphoma (CD200+). It is possible to suppose that it is an atypical CLL refractory to ibrutinib. The vast majority of CLL patients respond to ibrutinib， as reflected by the aggregate observation of PR， CR or prolonged stable disease with nodal response despite peripheral lymphocytosis. However， there are currently no upfront clinical biomarkers to predict sensitivity or resistance to ibrutinib therapy in CLL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Finally， it may be hypothesized that this clone of expanded B lymphocytes CD23-CD200+ infiltrating the kidney may have caused the histopathology of the GIN as well as the clinical picture of the next renal failure. Noteworthy， ibrutinib， by depressing some populations of B lymphocytes in CLL， may allow the expansion of other non-sensitive clones which are responsible for kidney damage as in this case. This assumption may be indirectly supported by the fact that the subsequent R-CHOP chemotherapy， eliminating the clone both in the peripheral blood and in the kidney， brilliantly resolved renal failure and allowed to obtain complete remission of the disease. This is the first CLL case reported in literature in which the appearance of GIN is described during therapy with ibrutinib.

Here is a case of a 34-year-old lady， with gestational age of 28 weeks， who presented with an abrupt appearance of Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) treated in a tertiary care hospital. The initial unusual presentation with an enlarged protruding right eyeball was quite a puzzle. Non-resolving Unilateral (U/L) proptosis and sustained mastitis led to a Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) discussion for the management of the pregnant patient. Ultimately through a chain of investigations， the culprit was detected and most importantly the patient agreed to receive the antenatal combined chemotherapy with R-CHOP regime instead of labor induction or postponing treatment until term delivery. Afterward， during the early chemotherapy period at32+ weeks， a healthy premature baby was delivered smoothly by the vaginal route， weighing 1，510g with a good Apgar score. Later in the course， postnatal Intrathecal Chemotherapy (ITC) was administered as the patient's sensorium was affected due to lymphoma infiltration to the Central Nervous System (CNS). The patient’s symptoms were relieved quite a bit as soon as the therapy ensued. But unfortunately， due to an aggressive refractory malignancy， it could not be controlled and the patient survived a year after the diagnosis. We believe that MDT plays a pivotal role in establishing the diagnosis and tailoring treatment of such rare， complicated and challenging obstetrical cases. Therefore this aspect should always be taken into account as early as possible for speedy decision-making for obstetrics cases with atypical Signs and Symptoms (S/S).**\n\n【27】**Keywords： Lymphoma； Pregnancy； Antenatal chemotherapy； Multidisciplinary analysis**\n\n【28】**Abbreviations**\n\n【29】**BL： Burkitt Lymphoma； PBBL： Primary Breast Burkitt Lymphoma； NHL： Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma； MDT： Multidisciplinary Team； CNS： Central Nervous System； B/L： Bilateral； USG：Ultrasonography； MRI： Magnetic Resonance Imaging； IHC： Immunohistochemistry； DWI：Diffusion-Weighted Imaging； CT： Computed Tomography； NICU： Neonatal Intensive Care Unit； PET-scan： Positron Emission Tomography scan； G-CSF： Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor； MIP： Maximum Intensity Projection； HIV： Human Immunodeficiency Virus； OS： Overall Survival**\n\n【30】**Introduction**\n\n【31】**Lymphoma in pregnancy is rare with an incidence of 1 in 6，000 births \\[1，2\\]. PBBL is an extremely rare， highly aggressive tumor， growing in pregnancy with an incidence rate of 0.04% to 0.5%. Average-age of onset is 55 years but seldom seen at age <35 years. Stages I & II have good prognosis of about 90% if treated timely， but in more advanced stage when CNS is involved survival reduces**\n\n【32】**to as low as 0% to 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-22\\]</u>. Literature reports 21 cases of PBBL associated with pregnancy， 16 were diagnosed during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-15\\]</u> and 5 in lactation \\[4，16，17\\]， with mean age of 29.9 years (ranging15 to 42). Out of 16 cases diagnosed during pregnancy， 11 were in3d trimester， whereas 4 and 1 in 2nd and 1s trimester， respectively. The reported OS among 21 cases was <1 month in 9，<6 months in4 and one case had 10 month survival. Whereas， 6 were disease free at 12+ months after aggressive treatment. Pregnancy complicated with Lymphoma is extremely challenging to manage， partly by fact that it's thought to be untreatable， and partly by the patient's fear of antenatal-chemotherapy being harmful to her baby. We report the first case from China， for PBBL diagnosed in the 3d trimester. Our patient mindfully accepted to undergo antenatal-chemotherapy. Initially，R-CHOP regimen was started， and meanwhile， a premature healthy baby was delivered. Later， postnatally ITC was added for CNS infiltration and more potent drugs including R-DA-EPOCH regimen were used for this nasty cancer. R-CHOP regimen is considered safer in 2n and 3 trimester except for increased risk for preterm delivery通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Thus， current recommendation for treatment of BL depends on the time of presentation in pregnancy， nature of the disease， and patient preference 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.**\n\n【33】**Case Presentation**\n\n【34】**A 34-year-old pregnant patient (G P.A ) was admitted to our inpatient in 28h week of gestation with unresolved Bilateral (B/L) swollen breasts and extensive right proptosis for three weeks. The initial outpatient treatment opted for mastitis and inflammatory pseudotumor， and remained futile. Therefore， inpatient admission was advised to assess her thoroughly to catch the culprit. On clinical examination， vital signs were normal， there was obvious right proptosis without tenderness， and B/L breasts were diffusely swollen， without redness or palpable lump. The gravid uterus was palpated with fetal touches， along with a hard density mass mimicking the fetal head， on the left side of the uterus. Mild physiologic edema was noted on the lower extremities. Patient gave the history of viral hepatitis 10 years ago which was effectivelytreated and two Cesarean-Sections (CS) 10 and 7 years ago and had two healthy daughters. At admission， her hemoglobin level was 100 g/L， white cell count 7.6×10/L and platelet count was 280x10/L. The viral markers suggested chronic HBV carrier status， but HIV & Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) were negative. The obstetric-Ultrasonography (USG) showed an intrauterine single alive fetus and an uneven hypoechoic mass measuring 15.2 cm x9.8 cm (clear boundary and regular shape) was observed on the left side of the uterus， probably a uterine fibroid. The breast color Doppler USG， showed B/L inflammatory changes along with axillary accessory breast tissue， importantly swollen axillary lymph nodes with size of 1.3 cmx0.6 cm on right and 1.2cmx0.5cm on the left. The result of the binocular (magnetic resonance imaging) MRI. Treatment for symptomatic relief went in vain， besides only aggravating her signs and symptoms. Therefore， it prompted MDT discussion (Obstetrics and Gynecology， Infectious Diseases， Breast Surgery， Neurology， Ophthalmology) for management and to dig out for unknown disease. Relevant examinations proposed by each department were carried out to detect the root cause of her condition. Breast MRI was suggested but as it needs prone positioning， alas to rely on USG， wherein findings remained the same. However， current obstetric USG showed increased size of left sided mass to 16.7 cm x 11.6 cm and， another mass with regular shape measuring 12.2cm x 9.0 cm seen on right of the uterus， both masses appeared with unclear boundaries and abundant blood flow signals. It was opted**\n\n【35】**to take a biopsy of the right axillary mass under local anesthesia with patient's consent.The microscopic histopathologic and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results of the core biopsy confirms the diagnosis of BL. To know more precise characteristics of the masses， abdominal MRI was performed； chest CT-scan was ordered to see the metastatic status and chemotherapeutic consideration. As it was quite clear what the patient was going through， hence the MDT， now including a hematologic oncologist recommended， preferably postponing the cesarean section if patient agrees and to start the combined chemotherapy immediately. The patient was risk-stratified as high intermediate based on the International Prognostic Index score**\n\n【36】**Once everything was made clear to the patient about her diagnosis of BL and treatment options， she chose antenatal chemotherapy. The prophylactictreatment of entecavirwas given priorto commencement of chemotherapy. Pretreatment with dexamethasone and Polyene phosphatidylcholine was given and R-CHOP regimen was started. As soon as the therapy was initiated， the patient responded well， proptosis and breast swelling reduced remarkably.**\n\n【37】**Chemotherapy became a challenge when the patient developed short lived psychosis just before baby's birth， anticipating that lymphoma had infiltrated CNS causing Lymphomatous meningitis. Pregnancy-related symptoms were aggravated (shortness of breath， palpitations) due to ongoing chemotherapy. Meanwhile the patient developed neutropenia after the 2u-chemo cycle， and went into labor and vaginally delivered a premature (32+2 weeks) alive and healthy baby weighing 1，510 g with Apgar score 8 and 10 at 1 and 5 min respectively，without any apparent anomaly. The baby was transferred to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for prematurity. ITC was added on day 1 followed by R-CHOP regimen for positive CSF report(presence of white blood cells， cue protein， andlactate dehydrogenase71.0 U/L) clarifying the infiltration. ITC worked well and psychosis symptoms disappeared quickly. When patient developed Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) after 2nd cycle， she was rehydrated， urine alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate， febuxostat to lower uric acid， furosemide for diuresis， and hypertonic sugar with insulin to promote potassium transfer to cells， were administered to further prevent the occurrence of TLS. For raised liver enzymes， reduced glutathione injection and human serum albumin were added. The post chemotherapy myelosuppressive period of neutropenic fever， was managed with antibiotics， blood products and recombinant human Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) to rescue leukocytes. However， as the patient's condition remained unchanged with subsequent chemo， the bone marrow biopsy was taken. Further， a more potent drug Etoposide was added to the regimen for refracto PBBL. Later in the course of aggressive therapy when the patient did not show any improvement， Positron Emission Tomography (PET-CT) examination was performed， which revealed the distant spread sign of failed treatment. Patient requested to stop chemotherapy except only for the symptomatic relief. By now she had completed11 cycles of systemic chemotherapy and 25 ITC injections but unfortunately being very aggressive nature of the malignant tumor is metastasized abruptly making it difficult to control and required further chemotherapy. Patient was encouraged to continue treatment but she abandoned and died due to multi organ failure after 6 weeks， with an overall survival of 12+months.**\n\n【38】**Comments**\n\n【39】**non-pregnant women. Currently， there is no evidence that pregnancy accelerates development oflymphoma， but some say， its pathological type in pregnancy seems more malignant therefore gives poor prognosis. Misdiagnosis is common， often due to atypical clinical manifestations or considering otherwise physiological pregnancy-related changes making it difficult to distinguish from hyperhidrosis of lymphoma so delaying diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Some risk factors induce the occurrence of malignant lymphomas， such as infections including EBV， HIV， ionizing radiation etc 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Our patient had a history of infection with HBV， was adequately treated but it's highly suspicious whether this chronic infection was a predisposing factor of this attack? BL affecting pregnant women requires prompt diagnosis and should be managed immediately with an aggressive therapeutic approach. Ideally， for patients with limited early disease， pregnancy should be terminated and radiotherapy be started when diagnosed in the first half. While in the second half， combined chemotherapy can be started antenatally， and radiotherapy be added after the fetus is born 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Our case presented in the 3r trimester， diagnosis was delayed for 3 weeks due to atypical symptoms but multidisciplinary approach helped greatly. Even though termination of pregnancy by cesarean-section was an option to ensure timelyaggressive treatment， as the prognosis of the premature newborn is good， but our patient preferred antenatal-chemotherapy. On the other hand， to avoid fetal exposure to radiation， several imaging examinations are restricted，so it further delays the diagnosis and the best time for therapy is missed. Therefore， it is suggested that for pregnant women with unexplained fever， fatigue， bleeding tendency or abnormally increased blood cells， and progressive anemia， further relevant tests， even bone marrow testing should be considered. Quality of prenatal examinations should be improved for early detection of disease to ensure timely treatment. In past， it was believed if pregnancy with lymphoma is diagnosed， labor should be induced immediately， the main reasons were， and active treatment with low molecular weight cytotoxic agents in the 1 trimester has potentially negative effects on the fetus通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.Complications predictable for 2n and 3r-trimester are fetal or neonatal death，preterm delivery， low birth weight， and severe bone marrow suppression secondary to disease and treatment endangers mother and fetus at any time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. But so far there is no conclusive evidence that induction of labor is beneficial for prognosis. Therefore， if the condition itself is not critical， it is worth taking the pregnancy to the middle and late stages of pregnancy under close monitoring通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Our patient exhibited significant respiratory depression and altered sensorium， but her condition stabilized when ITC was started. Therefore， the author personally prefers to terminate pregnancy onc the organ dysfunction occurs in middle and late stages of pregnancy. Despite the possible complications the overall advantage of the treatment is clear； hence the current recommendation is to administer chemotherapy with continuation of pregnancy.**\n\n【40】**Conclusion**\n\n【41】**Managing lymphoma in pregnancy poses significant diagnostic and treatment challenges. Additionally， treatment related decisions require a balance of feto-maternal risks posed by tumor and its therapy on a case-to-case basis.**\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Several theories have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of Schmorl’s node. It can be asymptomatic or it can result in a back pain. It can be isolated findings， or it can be associated with horizontal intervertebral disc herniation.**\n\n【10】**Case Report： We present a case of symptomatic SN associated with horizontal intervertebral disc herniation in a 41 years male presented with complaints of low back pain radiating to the right buttock.**\n\n【11】**Conclusion： Most cases of symptomatic Schmorl’s nodes respond to conservative treatment， however， several surgical intervention options can be used for refractory cases.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Schmorl's node； Symptomatic； Back pain**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Schmorl Nodes (SNs) are a type of vertebral end-plate lesion， in which the nuceus pulposus of the intervertebral disc herniates through the vertebral endplate into the body of the adjacent vertebra 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【15】**The Intervertebral disc consists of three parts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>： First； the central part or the nucleus pulposus， which is the gelatinous layer of a hydrated collagen-proteoglycan gel， mainly type II collagen， acts as a shock absorber. Second； the outer part or the annulus fibrous consists of several laminated layers of fibrocartilage made up ofboth type I and type II collagen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. The annulus fibrous contains the nucleus pulposus and it helps to distribute pressure evenly across the disc which prevents damage to the underlying vertebral endplates. Third； Vertebral end-plate， which is the upper and the lower surface of the vertebral body， consisted of hyaline cartilage， mostly type II cartilage， it anchors the intervertebral disc and it help to distribute the pressure across the vertebral body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【16】**SNs mainly seen in the thoracolumbar spine， this is because of increased rotational motion and low disc to vertebral ratio in this region \\[6，7\\].To differentiate， spinal discherniation is either vertical as in SNs (intervertebral protrusion of the nucleus pulposus)， or horizontal as in intervertebral herniation through a weakened annulus fibrosus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>**\n\n【17】**SNs can be an isolated finding， or it can be associated with intervertebral disc herniation. We reported a case of a middle-aged man who presented with a back pain， imaging studies showed both SNs and intervertebral disc herniation.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**A 41 years old，Middle Eastern， male， presents to our clinic with chronic back pain. The pain is progressively worsening，located at the right and left lower back， having a sharp quality， radiated to both legs (above the knees)， having a severity rated as +7/10 (10= worst)， being intermittently present and associated with marked limitation of physical activities， sleep disturbance， myalgia， paresthesia， lower extremities numbness and weakness. The pain worsens with prolonged work， rising in the morning， and walking upstairs. The pain decreases with rest， exercise， massage， and pain killer medications. The patient used NSAIDs and acetaminophen to improve the pain.**\n\n【20】**On examination， the patient is obese，BMI=31.24.On the lumbar spine， there was a decrease in strength and pain on deep palpation and on movement. Spinal flexion， extension， and rotation were intact. Neurological exams are normal.**\n\n【21】**Spinal X-ray showed nodular lucent lesion within L4. Abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast**\n\n【22】**reveals 2.1 cm lytic lesion within the L4 vertebral body appears to demonstrate sclerotic margin within the L4 vertebra， representing a Schmorl's node. MRI without contrast showed the following： At L3/L4 level， there is fluid collection in the facet joints， a left subarticular annular tear and a circumferential disc bulge measuring 4 mm producing moderate stenosis of the bilateral lateral recesses touching the bilateral L4 nerve roots and moderate bilateral neural foramen stenosis touching the bilateral L3 nerve roots. At L4/L5 level， there is fluid in the facet joints. At L5/S1， there is a mild disc space narrowing and asymmetric circumferential disc bulge， to the left measuring 4.5mm producing moderate stenosis touching the bilateral S1 nerve roots and moderate left neural foramen stenosis touching the bilateral left L5 nerve root. There is also abnormal strengthening of the normal lumbar spine curvature suggesting muscle spasm.**\n\n【23】**The patient was started on pain controlling medications(acetaminophen and ibuprofen)， heat pack， massage， and follow up. In addition， the patient instructed to maintain regular exercise and diet for weight loss.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**SNs developed as a result of the weakening of the vertebral endplates which can be due to acute， chronic， or embryogenic processes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Acute processes include traumatic events， resulting in the occurren ce of SNs because ofthe axialpressure， as in motorcyclists accidents and gymnasts \\[10，11\\].**\n\n【26】**Chronic processes include a degenerative process， and the autoimmuneprocess. Chronic degeneration of the vertebral endplate， such as in osteoporosis， Paget’s disease， hyperparathyroidism， infections， tumors， and Scheuermann's disease， leads to weakening vertebral endplate and disc herniation into the vertebral body and development of SNs \\[6，9，12，\\]. The intervertebral disc (avascular tissue) exposure to the vertebral body (well-vascularized tissue) triggers an immune response. Therefore， the autoimmune process is not direct but results from other degenerative processes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**SNs can also be developed because of an error during embryogenesis. The interruption in the movement of the notochord， under the influence of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) gene， from the vertebral body to the intervertebral disc and formation the nucleus pulposus， can leave a space in the vertebral body resulting in herniation of the nucleus pulposus and formations of SNs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.**\n\n【28】**SNs are more common in males than in females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. It can be asymptomatic and found as an incidental finding， or it can be presented as a lower back pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The gold standard modality to diagnose SNs is the MRI. According to the analysis of MRI imaging by Takahashi and et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> in symptomatic cases， the cause of the pain in SNs is because of the herniation of the nucleus pulposus into the bone marrow of the vertebral body， which leads to inflammation and edema. However， the inflammatory radiological signs were not found in asymptomatic cases. Also， the MRI helps to rule out malignant bone lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. On Computed Tomography (CT scan)， SNs appears as a lytic bone lesion. The role of Plain radiograph in the diagnosis of SNs is limited； it cannot detect the inflammatory radiological signs； however， it can detect the calcification around the SNs \\[171.**\n\n【29】**Conservative treatment， including pain medications， exercise， weight loss， bed rest， heat pack， massage and physical therapy is the first-line treatment for disc herniation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Several modalities**\n\n【30】**of intervention can be used in cases unresponsive to conservative treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， such as Lumbar spine fusion surgery of vertebral endplate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， rami communications nerve block by injecting 2mL of 1% mepivacaine and 10 mg of triamcinolone at gray ramus communications on each side \\[12，20\\]，Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha(TNF-a) blockade infusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>， and Percutaneous fluoroscopy assisted vertebroplasty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.**\n\n【31】**In rare cases， SNs can precipitate infection. Kim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u> reported a case of symptomatic SNs refractory to conservative treatment， and subsequent imaging showed enlargement of the cystic lesion. After surgical intervention， the histopathological report revealed osteomyelitis.**\n\n【32】**Meralgia paresthetica， a condition causing numbness and pain on the anterolateral thigh because of compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>， can be misdiagnosed as spinal disc herniation(horizontal or vertical)， as both pathologies can be presented simultaneously， especially in obese patients， and careful physical exam can help to differential both cases.**\n\n【33】**Conclusion**\n\n【34】**SNs can be presented as an incidental and asymptomatic finding or it can be presented as chronic back pain， it can be presented as a solitary lesion of the vertebral end-pale at the thoracolumbar region， or it can be associated with horizontal disc herniation. First line treatment is conservative treatment， including physical therapy， weightloss， and pharmacological treatment； however， several surgical intervention options can be used in refractory cases.**\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**l.

Invasive mole， also known as chorioadenoma detrusens， is one such entity which involves trophoblastic tissues， penetrating deep into the myometrium， and at times， involving peritoneum， adjacent parametrium or vaginal vault. They are locally invasive but generally lack tendency to develop wide spread metastasis. Classic presentation of invasive mole is history of amenorrhea， bleeding per vaginum and pain abdomen. However， it may present as massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage， following uterine perforation. We report a rare case of chorioadenoma detrusens， presenting as massive hemoperitoneum in a nulliparous woman， in which， a challenging decision of conserving the uterus was taken in low resource settings.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**A 25-years-old nulliparous female was referred from a small public hospital to the casualty department of a tertiary care hospital， as a case of ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The patient had history of dilatation and curettage done four months back in view of missed abortion at eight weeks gestation， in a private hospital. No histopathology had been sent. Patient remained asymptomatic for one month and developed bleeding per vaginum thereafter. She assumed it as menstruation， though pattern of bleeding was different from normal. After five days of bleeding， she developed acute pain in abdomen for which she consulted the public hospital. There， her ultrasound showed normal size uterus with endometrial thickness of 12 mm. Bilateral ovaries were normal，however， increased vascularity in bilateral adnexa and mild amount of heterogenous collection in pouch of Douglas was noted. The BhCG levels came out to be 2，97，198 IU. With these reports， patient was referred to our hospital.**\n\n【21】**On admission， patient was conscious but had signs of hypovolumic shock (blood pressure of80/60 mmHg， pulse rate of 130 bpm to 140 bpm). She had severe pallor. Abdominal examination revealed a distended and tense abdomen with tenderness in lower abdomen. Vaginal examination showed minimal bleeding， closed external OS and fullness in fornices. Uterine size and bilateral adnexa could not be assessed due to tense abdomen. Paracentesis showed non-clotting blood. Patient was taken for laparotomy immediately.Operative findings showed hemoperitoneum of 1000cc， uterus enlarged to 10-12 weeks size with a rent of 2 cm ×1 cm on fundus with torrential bleeding through it and grape-like vesicles popping from it. Two more thin uterine blebs (2 cm x1 and 4 cm**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： Uterus enlarged to 10 to 12 week's size with a rent of 2 cm x1cm on fundus with torrential bleeding through it， held by Green Armytage Forceps.**\n\n【23】Figure 2： Grape-like vesicles popping from the rent in uterus.\n\n【24】**x4 cm)， bluish in color， representing thinned out myometrium， were seen on the anterior and right lateral surface of uterus on the verge of rupture . Bilateral fallopian tubes were normal but bilateral ovaries enlarged with theca-lutein cysts. A clinical diagnosis of invasive mole or choriocarcinoma was made. Keeping in mind， the nulliparous status of patient， uterine conservation seemed to be important. However， risk of rupture of the blebs was a prime concern. Moreover， there was a possibility of inability to achieve hemostasis. The patient's husband was explained about the gravity of situation and requirement of relaparotomy if she bleeds again. Hemostatic sutures were applied on the rent and bleeding was controlled. The protruding grapelike tissues was sent for histopathologic examination. Intraperitoneal drain was inserted due to risk of subsequent rupture of the blebs leading to hemoperitoneum. As ultrasound revealed no mass in uterine cavity， no evacuation was attempted.**\n\n【25】**Patient remained stable in postoperative period with her stitches and drain removed on 84 postoperative day. Her histopathology showed hyperplastic trophoblasts， generalized cystic degeneration of chorionic villi and presence of molar villi within myometrium. Her BhCG had fallen to 56，781 IU/ml by 8th post operative day. No metastasis found in her chest X-ray and USG whole abdomen. Oncology consultation was done. After reviewing all reports and prognostic scoring (=7) patient was put on multiple agent chemotherapy (EMACO) on outpatient basis by oncology department； patient discharged with proper contraceptive and follow up advice. She received eight cycles of EMACO. Weekly BhCG follow up was done and it was found to be 1.5 IU/ml after 20 weeks follow LP.**\n\n【26】**Discussion**\n\n【27】**Invasive moles comprise of 15% cases of gestational trophoblastic**\n\n【28】**Figure 3： Two more thin uterine blebs (2 cm x1 cm and 4 cm x4 cm)， bluish in colour， representing thinned out myometrium， were seen on the anterior and right lateral surface of uterus on the verge of rupture (Shown by arrow).**\n\n【29】**neoplasia. They almost exclusively originate from partial or complete mole. Indicative signs of disease are persistent unexplained metrorrhagia or abnormal ultrasound appearance (large size uterus for gestational age and theca-lutein cyst >6 ml)， non-normalization of serum βhCG at 6 months after evacuation of hydatiform mole or massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. These are definitely diagnosed on the basis of myometrial invasion on histology.**\n\n【30】**Management of invasive mole basically depends on two factors-prognostic scoring of GTN and parity of patient. Low risk GTN includes both non-metastatic and metastatic GTN with prognostic score <7. In patients with stage one disease， the selection oftreatment primarily depends on whether patient desires to retain fertility. If patient does not want to preserve fertility hysterectomy with adjuvant single agent chemotherapy is performed as primary treatment. But in patients wanting to preserve fertility， management solely rests on chemotherapy.**\n\n【31】**Mitani et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> proposed partial resection of uterus for young women if invasive mole presents with hemoperitoneum. Five women have been reportedly treated this way and four of them delivered healthy babies with cesarean section. Local uterine resection together with bilateral internal iliac artery ligation to combine hemostasis with preservation of fertility has been reported by Goldstein et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Atala et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> reported a case of chorioadenoma detrusens with uterine rupture where trophoblastic tissue invaded broad ligament and right ureter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Hysterectomy followed by chemotherapy was done although it could not save the patient. In our case， the nulliparous status of patient along with point source of bleeding which could be easily controlled by hemostatic sutures deferred us from hysterectomy. Nonetheless there was further risk of uterine perforation through those thinned out blebs but we undertook that risk and left an intraperitoneal drain to watch for any further episode of hemoperitoneum. Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE) is an alternative and has been reported by Shen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> to successfully control internal hemorrhage caused by invasive trophoblastic disease. But UAE was not an option for us， as the facility is not available in our setting. If available， preoperative or immediate postoperative UAE could have been an option in our patient， as it would have alleviated the risk of further hemorrhage to an extent. In patients with stage one disease who desire to retain fertility chemotherapy is preferred option with excellent remission rates. Though a case has been reported by Sunesh et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> where local uterine wedge resection following uterine evacuation without any chemotherapy cured the patient.**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**nulliparous patient and hysterectomy should only be opted as last resort. Conservative approach should be considered.**\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\. Mackenzie F， Mathers A， Kennedy J.

She had no symptoms of numbness， weakness， or pain in her extremities. Noobvious abnormality was detected through neurological examination. Cervical X-rays， computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. MRI revealed a lesion in the middle part of odontoid process without involvement of the spinal cord (Figure1). Laboratory findings were within normal limits. Surgeons and radiologists all tend to the diagnosis of tumor after a heated discussion in our department. In order to confirm the character of the lesion， a biopsy surgery through anterior approach was performed. To our surprise， pathological tissue hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining supported a diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia. Considering the patient had no obvious neurological abnormality， the cervical stability was not affected and the character of benign tumor， the patient was treated with conservative method with regular follow-up.

The psammomatoid juvenile ossifying fibroma (PsJOF) is a variant of JOFs， occurring as extragnathic lesions in the sino-nasal and orbital bones. PsJOF is rarely seen in the jaw bones， with slight male predominance and mean age of occurrence between16-33 years. PsJOF are central lesions manifesting radio-graphically as a radiolucent， mixed or radiopaque lesion which depends on the degree of calcification giving a ground glass appearance. PsJOF is histologically characterised by the presence of psammoma bodies which are concentric， lamellated calcified structures.

An incisional biopsy was performed and histopathological diagnosis of Juvenile Ossifying Fibroma (psammomatoid type) was given . Excision ofthelesion followedby curettage followed by reconstruction was performed. Post-operative assessment with follow-up of the patient showed no evidence of recurrence (Figure11).**\n\n【42】**Discussion**\n\n【43】**Benjamin in 1938 designated the term “osteoid fibroma with atypical ossification” of the frontal sinus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Later， Gogl coined the term “Psammomatoid juvenile ossifying fibroma” of the nose and paranasal sinuses \\[9，10\\]. PsJOF was first classified as a benign neoplastic fibro osseous lesion by WHO in 1995. Though， the exact aetiology of the disease is unknown， it has been demonstrated the presence of non-random chromosome break points at Xq26 and 2q33resulting in translocation is responsible for this swelling to develop3.**\n\n【44】**PsJOF is an extragnathic variant， commonly occurring in sinus， orbit and fronto-ethmoid bone and rarely seen in the jaw bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The average age of occurrence for PsJOF is between 16-33 years with**\n\n【45】**a slight male predilection \\[4，6\\]. On the contrary， one of our case reports the occurrence of PsJOF in the mandible of an elderly female patient. PsJOF manifests as an asymptomaticbony-hard swelling， the duration and extent of which may vary depending on the site and aggressiveness of the lesion \\[11，12\\] but our case presented clinicaly， as a chronic asymptomatic extensive soft tissue growth in the mandible. Another case reports， a unique gnathic variant in a young adult occurring in maxilla in combination withaneurysmal bone cvst. Simultaneous occurrence of the two lesions in the maxilla makes the case distinct. Though previous literature states similar case report in the mandible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>， none has so far been reported in the maxilla.**\n\n【46】**Radio-graphically PsJOF may manifest as radiolucent， mixed or radiopaque lesion which depends on the degree of calcification giving a ground glass appearance \\[9，13\\]. Root displacement is appreciated in benign lesions \\[4，13\\]. Whereas， aggressive lesions cause root resorption， expansion of bone， cortical thinning and perforations通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Thus our cases represent the aggressive variants of PsJOF. Radio-graphically， Fibrous Dysplasia and Ossifying fibroma can be distinguished， in which the former has a poorly defined margin whereas the latter has a well-defined margin. However PsJOF is not capsulated， but is separated from the surrounding bone by radiopaque borders， and this finding is helpful in differentiating it from fibrous dysplasia \\[14，15\\].**\n\n【47】**Though histopathologic diagnosis is confirmatory， it is based on the presence of the psammoma bodies， which are spherical cementum like bodies present in abundance \\[16，17\\]. Soopta “et al.\"通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> suggested that longer the duration of PsJOF， more will be the number of psammoma bodies in the histopathological examination通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.**\n\n【48】**Enucleation and curretage is the preferred modality oftreatment， for benign lesions. For tumours with aggressive nature， resection is preferred with a 5 mm margin. Maxillary lesions are more difficult to remove completely because of the quality of bone and larger size of the lesion at the time of presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.**\n\n【49】**PsJOF are aggressive lesions with varied clinical presentations and high recurrence rate (30-58%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Thus， earlier the diagnosis， lesser will be the degree of bone destruction and better will be the prognosis.**\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

The purpose of this case report is to establish the multi-disciplinary approach to rehabilitation in a novel patient case. The report establishes the safety and importance of rehabilitation interventions during two phases ofthe patient’s critically complex medical course.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation： A 50-year-old male diagnosed with advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis that required ECMO support as a bridge to lung transplantation. During the pre-transplantation phase， the patient suffered significant decline leading to the development of right-sided heart failure and acute kidney injury. The severity of his medical condition required multiple re-configurations of the ECMO circuit to maximize cardio-respiratory support. Rehabilitation interventions were implemented during both pre- and post-transplant stages with emphasis placed on a multi-disciplinary approach to delivery of interventions.**\n\n【20】**Outcomes： On day 50， the patient underwent successful bilateral lung transplantation. During both phases，there were no adverse events during anyrehabilitation session. In addition， the patient progressed from fully dependent in the initial stages to a modified independence state at hospital discharge. The complicated and novel case (IPF developing right sided heart failure requiring multiple cannulation strategies) demonstrates the feasibility and importance of physical therapy to improve pre-transplantation status as well as maximize outcomes following surgery.**\n\n【21】**Discussion： There is limited evidence describing rehabilitation interventions for critically ill patients requiring ECMO support. This case report confirms that physical therapy can be safely implemented in the most complex cases. The case report also attempts to show the importance of implementing physical therapy to best prepare the patient for transplantation surgery.**\n\n【22】**Introduction**\n\n【23】**Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support (ECMO) is a therapeutic intervention utilized for patients suffering from cardio-respiratory failure. ECMO， the highest level of life support， allows for different perfusion strategies to temporarily support patients as they recover or to facilitate as a bridge to transplantation (heart or lung) \\[1，2\\]. ECMO provides cardiorespiratory support by facilitating gas exchange and perfusion through a device outside the body. Cannulas placed in large caliber veins direct deoxygenated blood to the membrane oxygenator outside the body. The oxygenator replenishes oxygen and removes carbon dioxide through the juxtaposition of airflow and blood across a semipermeable membrane. The blood is then returned through a different channel (either in the same cannula - double lumen cannulation， or in a different cannula - two single lumen cannulae). A pump (commonly， a centrifugal pump in adults) assists the flow through the circuit and may also， in Veno-arterial (VA) ECMO contribute directly to the generation of an arterial pressure gradient； this promotes adequate systemic perfusion. VenoVenous (VV) ECMO(drainage from and return to the venous system) is used primarily for respiratory support in acute respiratory failure to manage refractory hypoxia， hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis or both 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Comparatively， VA ECMO is used for hemodynamic support in patients with decompensated heart failure who may also have respiratory compromise \\[1，2\\].**\n\n| **Table 1： Physical therapist initial systems review.**  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **System**  | **Findings**  |\n| **Cognition**  | **Responses to name with eyes opening； reduced communication； limited command following； decreased attention/arousal**  |\n| **Musculoskeletal**  | **BUE and BLE = PROM WFL**  |\n| **Neuromuscular**  | **Bilateral shoulders = 1/5 grossly** **Bilateral elbowS=3-/5** **Bilateral grip=3-/5Bilateral ankles=3-/5** **Unable to accurately assess hip and knee MMT due to decreased arousal (grossly 1/5 for bilateral hip and knee strength)**  |\n| **Integumentary**  | **Stage ll sacral pressure ulcer -interventions being performed by wound care Nurse.**  |\n| **Kansas Functional Outcome**  | **1/28**  |\n\n【25】**Abbrevations： BUE： Bilateral Upper Extremities； BLE： Bilateral Lower Extremities； RUE： Right Upper Extremity； LUE： Left Upper Extremity； PROM： Passive Range Of Motion； WFL： With Functional Limitations.**\n\n【26】**ECMO interventions arehigh-risk， invasive procedures undertaken in critically-ill patients. A multi-center randomized controlled trial (CESAR) in the UK compared ECMO with conventional mechanical ventilation for severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The CESAR study suggested that ECMO was associated with an improved rate of survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The collaboration of the multidisciplinary team is essential to maximizing the benefits of ECMO therapy. However，ECMO is not without its complications. The nature ofthe devicepresents multiple risks including hemorrhage， extremity ischemia， thrombosis， infection， and pump/oxygenator failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Complications also arise from the complexity of treating a critically-ill patient including prolonged immobility， use of sedation， and long term mechanical ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>. To address these issues， early mobilization has been identified as a key intervention. Recent research has established that early mobilization has many benefits including improved survival rates， prevention of multi-organ system failure， prevention of pressures ulcers and reduction in long-term， critical illness related to neuromuscular dysfunction \\[5，6，8，-12\\]. Rehder et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> found that “awake ECMO\"patients had improved survival rates， reduced wait-times to transplant surgery and notably shorter post-transplant length of hospital stay. Furthermore， it has been suggested that pre-transplant conditioning is an important predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients who undergo ECMO therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**Early mobilization in patients requiring ECMO is possible through improvements in technology. The introduction of the Avalon double lumen cannulas， improved portability， and enhanced membrane oxygenator design has allowed patients to mobilize easier and with reduced risks. The use of ECMO has allowed facilitated a reduction in the need for mechanical ventilation and sedation in patients with ARDS， allowing them to engage in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) as well as rehabilitation exercises.**\n\n【28】**Rehabilitation in the form of physical therapy may improve physical functioning and conditioning； this is likely to better prepare critically ill patients for either organ transplant or return to baseline functioning prior to critical illness. The complexity of cannulation strategies， disease types and patient demographics present a challenge in terms of validating physical therapy interventions in patients receiving ECMO therapy. Furthermore， evidence supporting physical therapy interventions with patients on ECMO is limited. Case reports， however， can provide insight and confirm the need for early physical therapy interventions with this select population.**\n\n【29】**The purpose of this case report is to describe safe and effective physical therapy interventions utilized to treat a patient with end-stage pulmonary disease as he awaited transplantation (on ECMO)**\n\n【30】**and in the post-transplant recovery phase. The patient case is a novel case due to the complexity of the patient's pre-transplant medical condition requiring multiple re-configurations of the ECMO circuit due to his deteriorating medical condition including onset of right-sided heart failure. The physical therapy plan ofcare required ongoing modifications as cannulation strategies were adjusted to provide continued support in the face ofprogressive cardiopulmonary disease.**\n\n【31】**Clinical Findings and Hospital Stay**\n\n【32】**A 50-year-old male with significant past medical history of COPD and histoplasmosis was hospitalized in February 2014 for pneumonia and then transferred to the University of Kentucky on April 5，2014. Initially， he required high-flow supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation； however， in spite of significant support， he continued to become progressively more hypoxemic. An extensive workup including clinical assessment，radiographic picture， and bronchoscopy results were consistent with a new diagnosis of advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Due to the patient’s clinically deteriorating lung function and likely candidacy for lung transplantation， the patient was brought to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to initiate Veno-Venous (VV) ECMO. This was performed with a size 27 French Avalon cannula inserted through the right internal jugular vein with a goal of bridging the patient to lung transplantation. After cannulation， the patient developed an Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) with etiology of acute tubular necrosis likely a combination of low flow (flow of approximately 4.2 Liters) and high vancomycin levels； he eventually required continuous renal replacement therapy and intermittent hemodialysis which complicated mobility as well. He underwent a tracheostomy on day 5to help with ambulation on ECMO and his kidney function continued to worsen. On day 12， due to concerns for right heart failure (Table1) and continued less than optimal oxygenation， he was transitioned to venoarterial-venous (VAV) ECMO with cannulation in the left femoral artery with a 17 French cannula to provide enhanced systemic perfusion and support； this ultimately provided an additional two liters of flow. On day 15， he was transitioned to venovenous-arteria\\](VVA) ECMO with de-cannulation of the left femoral arterial cannula and placement of a right axillary arterial 22 French cannula. This promoted enhanced mobility with few limitations to walking except use ofthe right shoulder.**\n\n【33】**Onday55，heunderwentbilateralorthotropiclungtransplantation whichwas complicated by bleeding of the left hemithorax necessitating re-exploration of the surgical site and administration of favor VII. Due to this complication， the patient was left with an open sternotomy which was closed on post-operative day 3. This limited the patient to passive range of motion only during that time. Also，**\n\n【34】Figure 1： ECMO Mobility Interdisciplinary Team.\n\n【35】**The multidisciplinary team is essential to the safety of ambulatory ECMO programs and the success of therapy interventions aimed at preventing deconditioning**\n\n【36】**prior to transplant so that post-transplant outcomes may be optimized.**\n\n【37】**during that time， there was concern for subclinical seizures (clinically， a change in mental status with abnormal EEG findings of generalized slowing and intermittent bifrontal and right fronto-temporal sharp waves). On day 58，he returned to OR for pleural washout， closure of the sternum， and therapeutic bronchoscopy. During recovery phase of transplantation， he required frequent therapeutic bronchoscopic procedures to clear secretions daily initially and moving out to every other day. On day 106， his tracheostomy was removed and he was discharged from the hospital the next day.**\n\n【38】**The Incorporation _Cof_ Physical12and OccupationalTTherapy Interventions to Promote Mobility**\n\n【39】**This patient required ECMO for irreversible end-stage respiratory failure as a means of bridging to lung transplantation. Physical therapy interventions are vital to prepare for a successful surgery and promote recovery following surgery to minimize deconditioning and optimize functional status. Physical therapy in the postoperative period is equally as important to the success of the patient with emphasis placed on restoring independence and functional mobility.**\n\n【40】**In the bridge to transplant and recovery stages， the goal of physical therapy interventions is to optimize physical functioning in order to maximize medical outcomes and quality of life following discharge from the hospital. The severity of this patient's illness presented multiple barriers to rehabilitation. First， safety is a primary concern in all phases of hospitalization. This is further emphasized when a patient is receiving ECMO therapy. Ensuring safety of the ECMO patient requires a well-coordinated multidisciplinary approach with the assistance of many care providers . Effective communication with all involved parties is essential to ensure safe and effective therapy. Collaboration to ensure the ECMO circuit is constantly monitored to decrease risk of an adverse event is essential. Potential risks include dislodgement of a thrombus during physical activity， mal-positioning of cannulas resulting in decreased flow， and the accidental disengagement of cannula connections that could result in massive hemorrhage and distributive shock. These risks can result in fear or uncertainty of the multidisciplinary team； thus， extensive training and troubleshooting of problems is required of all professional working with patients on ECMO. Figure 1 describes how the Mechanical Circulatory Support (MCS) team organized ECMO**\n\n【41】**mobility.**\n\n【42】**Additionally， early mobility is further restricted by placement of certain arterial cannulations. For example， this patient had a femoral arterial cannulation present initially which limited hip flexion； hip flexion can occlude the cannula preventing blood flow to the distal extremity and the body overall. This occurred in this case study and was one reason for fewer PT interventions prior to transplantation. In most cases supine interventions can still be conducted but are not preferred to exercises that involve standing and walking because upright exercise engage all of the muscles，promote trunk control and improve strength.**\n\n【43】**Furthermore，the placement of arterial cannulations in areas such as the axillary artery can limit ROM ofthe upper extremities，resulting in decreased strength and deconditioning that affects independent activities of daily living. This cannulation limited occupationaltherapy treatments to the fullest extent for this particular patient. Thus， the rehabilitation plan of care must be fulfilled in a way that addresses cannulation sites to promote safety and optimizing treatment.**\n\n【44】**Physical Therapy Examination**\n\n【45】**The initial physical therapy evaluation was conducted on day 6 (two days after initiation of ECMO support). In addition to the physical therapist， a perfusionist， nurse， and a nursing care technician were present for initial examination to monitor the patient and ECMO circuit. The patient was able to follow commands， but required constant verbal and tactile cues to maintain alertness； he was repeatedly distracted by fatigue and inability to keep his eyes open. He communicated with hand and facial gestures as he was unable to vocalize due to tracheostomy placement. The patient required dependent assistance to perform rolling in bed as well as moving from supine to sitting at the edge of the bed. Once in the sitting position， he had difficulty maintaining control of his trunk and head without support from the therapist. The patient remained sitting for twelve minutes with vital signs stable， but had severe difficulty maintaining arousal， requiring repeated stimulation. The physical therapist determined that the patient could not safely attempt standing due to severe weakness， fatigability， and difficulty maintaining arousal. In addition， muscle manual testing was difficult to fully assess； he had significant weakness throughout. This signifies the weakness and deconditioning from reduced mobility from initial hospitalization in**\n\n【46】**Table 2： Physical and occupational therapy treatments prior to bilateral lung transplantation.**\n\n| **Physical and Occupational Therapy Treatments Prior to Bilateral Lung Transplantation**  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Date**  | **Manual MuscleTesting Results**  | **Time standing(minutes)**  | **Kansas University PT AcuteCare Functional OutcomesScore**  | **Barthel Activities ofDaily Living Index**  | **Therapist Comments**  |\n| **5/5/14**  | **BUE： 3/5** **BLE： 4/5**  | **0**  | **12/28**  |  | **Difficulty with balance， coordination，decreased strength and significant activityintolerance**  |\n| **5/9/14**  | **BUE： 4/5** **BLE：4/5**  | **0**  |  | **20/100**  | **Improved strength；** **No resistance with right shoulder**  |\n| **5/20/14**  | **BUE： 3/5BLE： 4/5**  | **3**  | **9/28**  |  | **Right shoulder flexian limited due toarterial axillary cannula**  |\n| **5/23/14**  | **RUE proximal： 4/5RUE distal： 5/5** **LUE proximal： 4+/5LUE distal： 5/5** **BLE：4/5**  | **3**  |  | **30/100**  | **Right shoulder flexion limited due taarterial axillary cannula**  |\n\n【48】**This is a timeline of physical and occupational therapy treatments prior to bilateral lung transplantation on 5/28/14. The pt. was originally cannulated for veno-venous(WV) ECMO in the left internal jugular vein on 4/9/14. On 4/17/14， there was an additional arterial cannula added in the left femoral artery which was later taken out in exchange for the placement of a right axillary artery cannula placed on 4/20. Femoral cannulations limit mobility including any activity where the body is greater than30 degrees and axillary artery cannulations limit range of motion (ROM) of the left arm which is where it is typically placed. The Kansas University Physical Therapy(PT) Acute Care Functional Outcomes Score was scored by a physical therapist. The higher the score on the Kansas University PT Acute Care Functional Outcomes Score means the patient is able to physically function at a higher level. The Barthel Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Score was scored by an occupational therapist. The higher the score out of 100 on the Barthel ADL score，the less functional impairment of the patient's ADLs they have.**\n\n【49】Abbrevations： BUE： Bilateral Upper Extremities； BLE： Bilateral Lower Extremities； RUE： Right Upper Extremity； LUE： Left Upper Extremity.\n\n【50】**The initial assessment revealed that his functional mobility was severely impaired due to severely decreased activity tolerance from poor cardiopulmonary function. Prolonged immobility (~37 days immobility： 6 days in our hospital plus 31 days at transferring facility) resulted in significant weakness and reduced physical functioning. Based on his initial physical therapy evaluation combined with evolving medical condition， the patient was a poor candidate for lung transplantation. An intensive physical therapy plan was developed and implemented to improve his candidacy in preparation for lung transplantation. An updated plan was established following surgical interventions to focus on interventions to maximize independence and functional mobility.**\n\n【51】**Therapeutic Interventions**\n\n【52】**Pre-transplantation interventions (Bridge phase)**\n\n【53】**During the pre-transplantation phase or bridge phase physical therapy interventions focused on tolerance to activity to improve overall physicality. Initially the patient engaged in bed mobility tasks and sitting upright at the edge of the bed with assistance. Progression to standing interventions were delayed as the patient presented with severe weakness， deconditioning， and a femoral arterial cannula which prevented this. The physical therapist gradually progressed interventions by reducing the assistance level with tasks in bed and during sitting upright， thus maximizing patient work load. The therapist continued this progression until the patient demonstrated improved core and trunk strength in the sitting then standing positions. The first standing interventions lasted only a few seconds and the patient required substantial assistance to achieve and maintain erect， upright position.**\n\n【54】**In addition to sitting and standing interventions in the bridge phase， the therapist emphasized therapeutic exercises to increase tolerance to activity and improve strength. The therapist encouraged the family to assist the patient with performance of these exercises three times per day， providing written instruction and verbal feedback. These exercises focused on gross movements of the arms and legs to improve global strength and cardiovascular function. Exercises were crucial on days when the physical therapist was not**\n\n【55】**available to incorporate mobility into the daily plan of care. In the bridge phase， mobility other than rolling in bed was deferred multiple days due to evolving medical condition including development of right-sided heart failure with patient requiring changes in location of cannulation， femoral cannulas， femoral central lines， decreases in alertness， worsening of kidney function and hemodynamic instability. His right-sided heart failure included severe dilatation of the right ventricle and pulmonary artery resulting in an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 50 mm Hg to 60 mm Hg. The patient also had peripheral signs including peripheral edema， hepatic steatosis， and borderline splenomegaly. See Table 2 for a summary of interyentions.**\n\n【56】**Post-transplantation interventions (Recovery phase)**\n\n【57】**Following surgery， the patient was severely debilitated with significant weakness. During the immediate postoperative period， the patient was critically ill requiring extensive medical interventions including vasopressor support to maintain adequate blood pressure and subsequent perfusion. After sternal closure and washout， the patient's clinical condition began to improve each day， allowing for increased participation in daily physical therapy interventions. The patient engaged in a variety of rehabilitation interventions including bed mobility training， transfer training， gait training， therapeutic exercises， balance training and activity tolerance training. Given the duration and complexity of his critical illness， the patient had to re-learn how to perform many ADLs such as bathing， dressing， toileting， hygiene， eating and transferring. The physical therapist utilized a variety of strategies for learning including the cognitive and psychomotor domains. Strategies included verbal and tactile cues as well as demonstration ofactivities with teach back methods.Learning was evaluated using return demonstration of psychomotor skills and limiting feedback as time progressed to allow the patient time to reflect on importance of skills learned； this utilized the affective learning domain.**\n\n【58】**During the recovery phase， the patient followed a gradual progression pattern that was positive in nature. Each therapy session， the patient demonstrated improved strength and tolerance translating to less assistance. For example， after transplantation， the patient required max assistance of two people to perform one sit**\n\n【59】**Table 3： Physical and occupational work post bilateral lung transplantation.**\n\n| **Physical and Occupational Therapy Treatments Post Bilateral Lung Transplantation**  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Date**  | **Manual Muscle Testing Results**  | **Ambulation (feet)**  | **Kansas University PT Acute CareFunctional Outcomes Score**  | **Barthel Activities of Daily Living** **Index**  |\n| **5/30/14**  | **Not able to pertorm；** **LUE moves vs. gravity** **Moving right side spontaneously**  | **0\\***  | **0/28**  |  |\n| **5/31/14**  | **Bilateral hands 2-/5** **Right elbow 1/5** **Left elbow：2-/5** **Bilateral shoulders： 1/5** **Bilateral hips and knees： 0/5** **Right ankle： 2-/5** **Left ankle： 0/5** **BLE：4/5**  | **0\\***  |  | **0/100**  |\n| **6/11/14**  | **Bilateral shoulders： 3-/5** **Bilateral elbow：3/5** **Bilateral grips 3+/5** **RLE： 3+/5** **LLE： 3-/5**  | **50**  | **11/28**  |  |\n| **6/18/14**  | **Left shoulder 3-/5** **Right shoulder： 3/5** **Bilateral elbowS： 3/5** **Bilateral grips： 3+/5** **BLE： 3/5**  | **N/A**  |  | **30/100**  |\n| **6/24/14**  | **Bilateral shoulders： 3/5Bilateral elbows：3/5** **Bilateral grips： 3+/5** **BLE：3+/5**  | **370**  | **19/28**  |  |\n| **7/2/14**  | **RUE： 3/5** **LUE： 2+/5** **BLE： 3+/5**  |  |  | **60/100**  |\n| **7/5/14**  | **RUE proximal： 3/5** **RUE distal 3+/5** **LUE proximal 3-/5** **LUE distal 3/5** **BLE： 3/5**  | **600**  | **19/28**  |  |\n| **7/16/14**  | **Full functional movement：** **BUE=BLE**  | **1，000**  | **24/28**  |  |\n\n【61】**This Table describes the timeline of physical and occupational therapy treatments post bilateral lung transplant on 5/28/14. The patient returned from the operating room on 5/28/14 with an open sternotomy due to intraoperative bleeding. He returned to the operating room on 6/1/14 for sternal closure and pleural washout of the left chest which limited physical and occupational therapy treatments beyond passive range of motion. The Kansas University Physical Therapy (PT) Acute Care Functional Outcomes Score was scored by a physical therapist. The higher the score on the Kansas University PT Acute Care Functional Outcomes Score means the patient is able to physically function at a higher level. The Barthel Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Score was scored by an occupational therapist. The higher the score out of 100 on the Barthel ADL score， the less functional impairment of the patient’s ADLs they have. occupational therapy treatment due to the inability of the patient to perform certain range of motion (ROM).**\n\n【62】\\*Denotes that the patient only participated in passive ROM at that point in time.\n\n【63】**Key： BUE= bilateral upper extremities； BLE=bilateral lower extremities； RUE=right upper extremity； LUE=left upper extremity； PT=physical therapy**\n\n【64】**to stand transfer. Two weeks after surgery， the patient could stand with moderate assist of one person. Once the difficulty of standing decreased， the therapist initiated bed to chair transfer training. This intervention expanded upon sit to stand transfer with the addition of pivoting to a chair. This eventually evolved to side to side and forward steps from the bed to the chair. This was a significant milestone as this allowed him to sit upright in a chair for extended periods， but also marked the beginning of gait training. This has great implications for his respiratory status postoperatively as it allowed him to properly expand the lungs and participate in pulmonary hygiene with physical exercise.**\n\n【65】**As time progressed， walking became an important component of the patient's physical therapy. Ambulation demands global strength， tolerance to activity， coordination， and balance. Once the patient demonstrated the strength to participate in ambulation， the therapist shifted focus from tasks in the sittingposition to maximizing his ability to walk. The patient， once again， gradually improved his ambulation distance as the days passed. Initially， he required support of a thoracic walker with multiple rest periods to travel a total of fifty feet. Goals for ambulation were communicated to the multidisciplinary team to promote recovery for the patient including the use of nursing and**\n\n【66】**ancillary staff. At discharge， the patient successful performed 1000feet of ambulation using a rolling walker and only contact guard assist for safety. See Table 3 for the patient’s physical and occupational therapy milestones.**\n\n【67】**Post transplantation， therapeutic exercises were used in adjunct to the patient’s daily session of therapy that included ambulation. A detailed， progressive exercise program was established including upper and lower extremities exercises performed at least three times a day. These exercises focused on isolated muscle strengthening due to severe weakness in the patient’s hips， shoulders， and core. The therapist also initiated and coordinated care to include exercises against manual resistance or a resistive exercise band. Patient confidence and motivation to perform the home-exercise plan was crucial to his adherence to his therapy regimen during the recovery phase. As the patient’s functional mobility improved， the therapist initiated higher-level exercises such as standing dynamic balance exercises.**\n\n【68】**The patient had very little cardiopulmonary reserve and reduced muscular endurance both pre and post-bilateral lung transplantation.**\n\n【69】**Activity tolerance training was implemented into every session not separately as it is in some circumstances. The patient participated in physical therapy interventions at minimum five times per week as well as daily activity and exercises driven by nursing and family during both stages pre- and post-transplantation. Nursing and family provided interventions were directed by the therapists. In addition to physical therapy， the patient received interventions focused on strength and activity from an occupational therapist. After discharge， the patient repeatedly stated his thankfulness for the ability to perform simple task such as brushing his teeth or washing his hair with the occupational and physical therapist. The use of the multidisciplinary team as well as role identification for the patient’s family seemed to optimize the patient's experience and allow him to grow both physically and mentally. Particularly， nursing staff and the family focused on mental well-being； they served as a major source of psychosocial support for the patient in his journey to recovery. Close communication and education delivered by the physical therapist positively influenced the patient's strength and tolerance both pre and post-transplant. Task completion improved as the need for rest breaks slowly dissipated. As the patient grew more tolerant of activity， his confidence increased. The patient seemed to gain more self-efficacy as well which also greatly improved his tolerance to activity because he believed he could achieve the goals set forth before him.**\n\n【70】**In regards to functionality， the patient improved his score on the Kansas Functional Outcome Measure from a 1/28 on initial PT evaluation to a 24/28 at discharge. In addition， the patient was performing bed mobility， transfers， and ADLs with modified independence； this was a significant improvement from dependency at initial evaluation. During his final PT intervention， the patient performed 1，000 feet of gait with an assistive device， on room air with no rest breaks and no assistance.**\n\n【71】**It is important to note that during the patient’s physical therapy program， no adverse events occurred during any activity. Both phases of rehabilitation were performed in a safe， controlled environment with a strong emphasis on communication between the multidisciplinary team. Additionally， physical therapy interventions did not result in the worsening or acute changes of the patient's medical condition at any point in time. As the patient progressed， the therapist increased the difficulty of intervention to appropriately challenge the patient's functional status and mobility. As the patient progressed， the proper number of staff and care providers was available. This often included a one to one ratio of the primary nurse to the patient in addition to physical rehabilitation technicians， nursing care technicians，therapists (both physical and occupational)， perfusionists， andl respiratory therapists.The multidisciplinary involvement of this patient was essential to his success in therapy while on ECMO as well as post transplantation.**\n\n【72】**Conclusion**\n\n【73】**This case reports demonstrates how a fifty-year-old patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was able to safely ambulate while on ECMO and how that therapy improved his functional status post-transplant. Although his medical course was complicated by right-sided heat failure， physical therapy interventions proved effective and did not result in any adverse events or negative unintended consequences in regards to his medical condition. This case shows how a well-integrated physical rehabilitation program contributed to the patient's improved physicality， activity tolerance， and self-efficacy in regards to physical activity.**\n\n【74】**The methodology used in this case is based on evidence that suggests physical rehabilitation can be successful in patients who require ECMO support suffering from advanced lung disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Furthermore， clinicians have noted that therapy can be safe and effective for patients awaiting lung transplantation； however， there is limited research in this population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. As the use of ECMO increases， more evidence is needed to support mechanical circulatory support(MCS) programs in their development of ambulatory ECMO teams. Identification of how therapy is initiated， communicated to the interdisciplinary team， and implemented with the assistance of multiple disciplines can set a foundation for the development of such programs. The determination of valid and reliable tools to track physical progress in this population would also be beneficial. Therefore， it is important to identify trials， tribulations， and lessons learned so that the care of patient’s on ECMO therapy may be improved.**\n\n【75】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【76】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**l.

One such case of a neonate is presented， illustrating the key imaging features and importance of serial neuroimaging.**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**Born at 28 weeks， the patient underwent a septic workup for leukocytosis on day of life 7， without a source of infection found， including CSF analysis. The leukocytosis persisted despite 3weeks of broad antibiotic therapy. A head ultrasound obtained at day of life 36 showed complex bifrontal heterogeneous intra-axial masses/collections. Noncontrast MRI showed imaging features consistent with cerebritis with cortical/sub-cortical white matter edema and a polygonal-shaped intracranial abscess in the left frontal region. On serial imaging， there was continued growth of the intra-axial collections， so the patient was transferred to a children's hospital for continued care.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**As demonstrated in this case， serial neuroimaging in the setting of persistent leukocytosis is important even with negative CSF studies. Such imaging can detect complications of meningitis/cerebritis， such as extra-axial collections， intra-axial abscesses， midline shift， hydrocephalus， and even pneumocephalus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. While CSF may be negative， CK meningitis/cerebritis should be suspected if the characteristic polygonal abscess formation is seen. Early imaging findings of cerebritis include increased echogenicity of the subcortical periventricular white matter on head ultrasound and a complex appearing， intra-axial mass as cerebritis progresses and an abscess**\n\n【26】**Figure 1： Head Ultrasound： Hyperechoic intra-axial collection/mass is seen in the left frontal region.**\n\n【27】**develops. On MRI， T2/FLAIR hyperintense signal is present in the cortical gray and subcortical/deep white matter in cerebritis， and diffusion restriction， upon development of an intra-axial abscess. If contrast is administered， rim enhancement is seen with an abscess.**\n\n【28】**Conclusion**\n\n【29】**FamiliaritywithhCitrobacter meningitis/cerebritiIsSandit complications is important， as there is a high mortality rate and risk of long-term CNS damage in neonates. Even if CSF fluid does not grow the organism， it should be suspected if the characteristic appearance is seen. Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment.

Aberrant FAM83D expression was reported in multiple cancers. Here， we summarized the latest researches of FAM83D in recent five years， and discussed the relationship of FAM83D and cancer diagnosis， development and prognosis， aiming to provide new perspectives for the research of FAM83D in tumors.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： FAM83D；Malignant tumors； Tumor biomarkers**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**The FAM83D gene (Family with sequence similarity 83 member D)， also named as CHICA or C200rf129， is located on chromosome 20 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. FAM83D is relative highly expressed during cell division，playing critical roles in mid-plate formation， regulatingthelocation ofhuman Chromokines in Kid to spindle during metaphase and sister chromatid separation \\[2，3\\]. Loss of FAM83D leads to dysfunctional spindle， failure of chromatid separation and consequential generation of aneuploidy. Furthermore， researchers have found that FAM83D was co-expressed with many known mitosis-related factors， including Aurora-A， Aurora-B， Plk-1， Plk-4，Cdc20，Cdk1，Nek2， Geminin and CENP protein family， in types of cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. FAM83D belongs to FAM83 protein family (FAM83A-H)， whose functions had long been elusive. The proteins in FAM83 family share a common Domain of Unknown Function 1669 (DUF1669)， which has weak homology to Phospholipase D 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Phospholipase D has been widely investigated in cell proliferation and differentiation. Besides， database analysis showed that the expression level of FAM83D is negatively correlated with overall survival time in various types of cancers. Therefore， FAM83D is tightly related to cell division and may be correlated to cancer development. Here， we summarized the updated cancer-related studies of FAM83D and discuss the possibility of FAM83D as biomarker or target in cancer diagnosis or therapy.**\n\n【17】**FAM83D and Lung Cancer**\n\n【18】**Up to date， three independent researchers investigated the relationship of FAM83D expression and lung cancer development. First， through analysis of TCGA LUAD (Lung Adenocarcinoma) datasets， Shi R found that compared to adjacent normal tissues， LUAD tissues showed significant upregulation of FAM83D expression and higher FAM83D expression related to higher DNA ploidy， corresponding well to previous in vitro study that loss of FAM83D leads to aneuploidy. Besides， higher FAM83D expression was associated with shorter survival time. Finally， they performed in vitro assay and showed that FAM83D deficiency inhibited lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1299 proliferation and mobility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Similarly， Yin C found elevated FAM83D expression levels in high invasive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and in the distant metastasis of clinical samples. Interestingly， they illustrated that FAM83D promoted Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in BEAS2B NSCLC cells but not in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cells， implying the discrepancy of FAM83D functions in different NSCLC cells. Additionally， they showed that FAM83D knockdown increases A549 and H1299 sensitivity to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The latest article concerning FAM83D and lung cancer found that circFOXM1 promote NSCLS development by sponging miR-614， and FAM83D was one of the targets of miR-614. Consequently， they conclude that circFOXM1/miR-614/FAM83D axis may regulate lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis in clinic and cell proliferation and progression in vitro and in vivo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【19】**FAM83D and Digestive System Cancer**\n\n【20】**In total， four independent researches concerned the relationship of FAM83D and liver cancer.**\n\n【21】**Table 1： Summary of the rale of FAM83D in cancers.**\n\n| **Cancer type**  | **No. of literaturereported**  | **In vitro**  | **In vivo**  | **Pathway regulated**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Lung**  | **3**  | **OE： promote growth， mobilityKD： increase sensitivity to cisplatin**  | **Higher expression in cancer tissues and** **relatec to shorter OS.**  | **influencing CCND1，CCNE1** **expression**  |\n| **Liver**  | **4**  | **OE： promotes growth， colonytormation.** **KD： inhibits growth， colonyformation； inhibits stem cancercells growth and self-renewal.**  | **Higher expression in cancer tissues； positive** **correlation with AFP， TNM stages， PVTTpresence， recurrence rate， Negative with** **OS， PFS.

Soon afterwards， Lin B got the similar results by analyzing 150 clinic samples collected between 2006 and 2013 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Additionally， they found better outcomes of patients with lower FAM83D after liver transplantation. More recently， another research confirmed the role of FAM83D through analysis of TCGA and GEO (33006， 45436，84402) datasets， demonstrating that compared to adjacent normal tissues， liver tumors exhibited higher FAM83D expression， and the higher FAM83D levels implied worse DFS and OS， higher recurrence rate and mortality and more advanced AJCC stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Their results indicated that FAM83D may serve as one independent marker for liver cancer progression diagnosis and survival times 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In vitro， Wang D. et al compared 30 liver cancer samples and corresponding adjacent normal tissues and found no differences in expression levels of FAM83A， FAM83B and FAM83C except for FAM83D. Besides， FAM83D levels were elevated in most liver cancer cell lines compared to normal liver cells. Moreover， FAM83D over expression promoted proliferation and colony formation of Hep3B and Focus cell， while FAM83D knockdown inhibited that of SK-hep-1 and YY-8103 cells通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Lin B reported FAM83D deficiency inhibited liver cancer stem cell growth and self-renewal in vitro， as well as tumor growth and tumor metastasis in mice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. As to pancreatic cancer， only one literature stated that FAM83D levels were up-regulated in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) no matter in TCGA datasets or in collected clinical samples， and related to poor prognosis. Meanwhile， in vitro assay showed that FAM83D knockdown inhibited the growth and increased the gemcitabine sensitivity of PDAC cells BxPC3 and SW1990 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Apart from digestive glands， FAM83D were also related to digestive tracts cancer development. Firstly， one group described FAM83D and esophageal cancer， revealing higher FAM83D expression in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) tissues**\n\n【24】**compared to adjacent normal tissues and tightly correlated to poorer clinical outcomes. Furthermore， FAM83D deficiency inhibited ESCC cells ECA109 and KYSE30 growth and increased their radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Secondly， two articles reported FAM83D expression is positively related to Gastric Cancer (GC) cells HS-746T， AGS and SGC-7901 growth， invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo. Besides， clinical samples and database analysis showed that FAM83D upregulation was observed in GC tissues and celllines， and implicated poor prognosis of GC patients \\[15，16\\]. Thirdly， two groups studied the role of FAM83D in Colorectal Cancer (CRC). One reported that FAM83D over expression may promote HCT-15 and HT-29 cells proliferation and invasion in vitro 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The other study found that FAM83D levels are upregulated in clinical CRC samples and in CRC cells lines. Besides， FAM83D knockdown inhibited proliferation， colony formation， migration and invasion of HCT116and SW480 CRC cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.**\n\n【25】**FAM83D and Female Reproductive System Cancer**\n\n【26】**In the year of 2019， two groups conducted the research about FAM83D and ovarian cancer. Both groups reported higher FAM83D levels in cancer tissues than normal tissues. Besides， patients with higher FAM83D levels exhibited shorter OS and DFS times and more advanced stages. One of the researches proposed that FAM83D may serve as an effective marker to distinguish low malignant potential tumor from invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. Like in other cancer types， FAM83D over expression promoted growth， migration and invasion of ovarian cells in vitro \\[19，20\\]. Similar to ovarian cancer， two groups researches indicated that FAM83D is one ofthe genes that up-regulated in Endometrial Cancer (EC)， and higher expression was related to more advanced stages. It is worth to note that they showed that FAM83D levels in patients’blood would be a efficacious marker to predict the EC prognosis \\[21，22\\]. Through database mining， four studies dig out the correlation between the expression of FAM83D and breast cancer. Zhai X reported that FAM83D expression was negatively associated with the recurrence-free survival in Triplet-**\n\n【27】**Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) samples by analyzing GSE45827， GSE38959， GSE65194 datasets from GEO， while another research found FAM83D was associated with poor relapse-free survival and OS of Luminal A type of breast cancers by analyzing dataset GDS2250 \\[23，24\\]. Furthermore， RNA-seq data from GEO showed that FAM83D was one of the most highly regulated genes in TNBC通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Additional two studies reported that FAM83D was upregulated in breast cancer tissues and related to poor DFS regardless of breast cancer classification \\[26，27\\]. Besides， in vitro assays showed that FAM83D over expression promoted human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC and MCF10A) transformation， migration， invasion and Anchorage-Independent Growth (AIG) . One the other hand，knockdown of FAM83D in breast cancer MDA468 and BT549cells dramatically inhibited cell growth and invasion \\[26，28，29\\].**\n\n【28】**Conclusion**\n\n【29】**Above， we summarized the role of FAM83D in multiple types of cancers with clinical data and laboratory in vivo and in vitro research data. To get one step further， we compressed all the key information in one table . In the table， we involved the reported cellular pathways that FAM83D may regulate in cancer cells. Collectively， up to date， FAM83D has been reported critical roles to cell proliferation， migration and invasion in nine types of cancers. Through high throughput screenings and validations， the downstream regulating factors/pathways of FAM83D have been identified. Meanwhile， several studies indicated upstream factors that may regulate human FAM83D expression， including circFOXM1/miR-614 axis， miRNA-495 and promoter methylations. However， we found no relationship between promoter methylation status and FAM83D expression levels in mice tissues during development， implying different regulating mechanisms in different physiological or pathological conditions. As one protein that tightly related to mitosis and had highly correlational expressions with CYCLINB1， FAM83D was intensively investigated these years for its mechanisms in regulating cellular behavior. Prospectively， FAM83D may serve as one effective biomarker for cancer diagnosis or prognosis. Furthermore， given that FAM83D deficiency inhibited proliferations and migrations of in many types of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo， it has the potential to be one promising target for cancer therapy. Further studies of FAM83D may focus on three aspects： 1) how it regulates cell division or chromatin separation；2) how it regulates downstream factors or cellular pathways and what is its biochemical features. 3) More retrospective and prospective clinical study to validate its role as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis and its mutations landscape in cancer cases.**\n\n【30】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【31】**This research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China， Grant numbers： 31800682 and The Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China， Grant numbers： 18KJB180019.**\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

The most common clinical presentations are severe chest pain， dysphagia or odynophagia and mild hematemesis. The common risk factors are blunt， penetrating or iatrogenic injuries， Valsalva maneuver and antiguagilan medication， in literatures spontaneous cases have also been reported.**\n\n【20】**Discussion： IEH is a very rare event of esophagus and submucosal esophageal bleeding which can present with acute onset of chest pain， dysphagia or hematemesis and can mimicking some acute cardiopulmonary diseases. These can result in a delayed or even missed diagnosis IHE. Past medical history is very important in such situation. Thus， a high index of suspicion IHE is needed to make the diagnosis and provide the appropriate and best management.**\n\n【21】**Keywords： Intramural； Hematoma； Esophagus**\n\n【22】**Introduction**\n\n【23】**Intramural Hematoma of the Esophagus (IHE) is emergency esophageal condition and more common among old people who are taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although the incidence of this event is a rare， Today's it is recognized in early stage because of with modern radiological and endoscopic procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>.IHE dived as spontaneous or secondary and iatrogenic procedural as endoscopy or intraesophageal echocardiography. Secondary causes are traumatic problem. foreign body， sever Valsalva maneuver， lifting heavy weight material， huge bulky bolus swallowing， severe vomiting， nasogastric tube， upper gastric endoscopy or ERCP， nasotracheal intubation and transesophageal echocardiogram 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-8\\]</u>. Most patients present with at least two of the symptoms in IHE (IHE) usually presents as a sudden and sever onset of a chest or retrosternal pain， and mild hematemesis， and dysphagia or odynophagia. In past medical history ofpatients， there may be a violent retching， vomiting or instrumentation procedure of the esophagus. A history of foreign body swallow rarely may be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-7\\]</u>. In physical examination there are not any specific findings except tachycardia and pallor in the face of patients. It is very important to distinguish IHE from any cause of acute cardiac pain； anticoagulant therapy may worsen the conditions. If the patients present with dysphagia or odynophagia these symptoms can help to exclude significant cardiac reasons from the IHE \\[6，8，9\\]. A PA chest X-ray may show pneumomediastinum， pneumothorax， widening of mediastinum and pleural effusion \\[1-3，10-13\\]. In acute myocardial infarction， dissection of aorta， and thromboembolism of pulmonary artery.

The primaryand quicklyinvestigation is CT scan with intravenous contrast because CT-scan available in most clinic and centers and is non-invasive tool. Oral contrast study of the esophagus with barium swallow and CT-scan will show multiple flling defects in the lumen of the esophagus. The CT-scan usually shows a thickening of esophageal wall with compression lumen of esophagus or obliteration of the lumen by a large hematoma.

Herein we want to show our experiences in management of IHE.**\n\n【25】**Case Presentation**\n\n【26】**A 65-vear-old male man referred to our hospital with sever retrosternal， chest pain， dysphagia， and mild hematemesis. Six hours prior to admission， he was lifting a big sack full of rice and developed acute onset dysphagia with retrosternal pain difficulty swallowing food epigastrium tenderness and increase salvia mix with blood. Four hour later， he developed sudden onset sharp retrosternal chest pain associated with mild bright red blood hematemesis in our hospital. Before lifting the sack of rice， He denied having any problem as odynophagia， abdominal pain， nausea， vomiting or fever. In emergency room， his blood pressure was 14/82 mmHg and pulse rate 100 p/m. On physical examination of head and neck， chest and abdomen was normal. Laboratory finding showed hemoglobin12 g/dl， hematocrit 36%， platelets 350，000/uL coagulation profile was normal. BUN was 21 mg/dL with serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL.**\n\n【27】**Figure 3， 4： CT-scan of the chest show (IHE) middle portion of esophageal and leakage of blood to pleural space.**\n\n【28】**Figure 5， 6： CT-scan of the chest show (IHE) lower portion of esophageal and EGJ whit hematoma.**\n\n【29】**Figure 7， 8： Oral contrast swallow showed esophageal luminal narrowing at upper， middle， lower and EGJ of esophagus with mural thickening of esophagus and a soft tissue density extending to lesser curvature of stomach concerning for esophageal hematoma without perforation.**\n\n【30】**Electrocardiogram (EKG)， CPK-mb and troponin was in normal range. CT-scan of chest with oral and intravenous contrast showed esophageal narrowing at the upper，middle and distalpartofesophagus lumen and also show mural thickening and a soft tissue density in the esophagus which extending to the lesser curvature of stomach due to esophageal hematoma . CT-scan of abdomen with oral and IV contrast showed circumscribed hyperdense structure in the distal esophagus concerning for an intramural esophageal hematoma and extending inferiorly to the proximal portion of stomach (Figure5，6).

With this conservative management， his and in this time his diet was advanced to clear liquid four days after improved of symptoms， he underwent barium swallow. We performed an oral contrast imaging for transmural perforation or Extravasation of oral contrast extraluminally. intravenous and oral contrast showed esophageal luminal narrowing at the distal third with mural thickening and a soft tissue density extending to the gastroesophageal junction due to esophageal hematoma (Figure7) and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed a blue like**\n\n【31】**Figure 9， 10： Esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed a blue color at the distal third of the esophagus and a non-bleeding ulcer at the distal esophagus and proximal stomach and narrowing the lumen of esophagus.**\n\n【32】**discoloration at the distal third of the esophagus and a non-bleeding ulcer at the distal esophagus and proximal stomach and narrowing the lumen of esophagus due to hematoma .

A review of literatures which shows the average age of patients is 58.8years and some peak of age are greater or around the 70 years. IHE is slightly more frequent in females’ patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Our case age was65 vears old and was male. The causes Intramural hematoma of the esophagus are abnormal hemostasis， vomiting， trauma， iatrogenic trauma， coagulation disorders， anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs and hemostasis disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Antiplatelet drug are not the cause of IHE but can aggravating factors and can increase extension of the hematoma \\[1，4，7，8，14\\]. Valsalva maneuver vomiting， sever coughing， sever sneezing， swallowing big compact or bulky bolus foods， or lifting a heavy weight material are others cause of IHE \\[1，7，8\\]. The mechanism of IHE is a sudden change and increase in intrathoracic and esophageal pressure during swallowing or vomiting \\[1，3，7，9\\]. In our case， lifting a heavy weight sack of rice was the cause of the precipitating factor and the located of IHE was in the upper，middle and lower third portion of the esophagus and EGJ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. Distal of esophagus in (83%) of cases is commonly the site of injury in IHE. The reason is the absence of striated muscle in this portion and this region is support by some organ such as trachea and heart and by the fiber of the muscularis in the gastroesophageal junction of stomach \\[1，4，5，7\\]. The middle third of the esophagus is involved in78% and the proximal third involve in 27%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The mucosal tearing are usually transverse and submucosal hematoma can rupture in the esophageallumen \\[1，5\\]. In our case the upper， middle and lower third of thoracic esophagus and proximal portion of stomach was involved. Other causes of IHE are direct injuries are endoscopic procedure interventions， ingested food and other matter or external injury of the chest wall \\[1，3，7，19\\]. Case reports show IHE can present after varix sclerotherapy， esophageal balloon dilatation， pill and foreign body impaction or traffic trauma and accidents \\[1，4，9\\]. Aortoesophageal fistula is a rare life-threatening cause of IHE \\[6，9，10\\]. Secondary causes of IHE are foreign body ingestion， esophageal malignancies， corrosive esophagitis and penetrating ulcer due to trauma \\[1，4，7，8\\]. In 19% of cases， the cause IHE are unknown and no risk factor is**\n\n【35】**described. Esophageal motility disorder can produce an intramural hematoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The clinical presentation of patients is chest pain in(84%) of patients， dysphagia or odynophagia in (59%)， with minor hematemesis in (56%) of patients. Ninety percent of patients have only one ofthese symptoms， seventy-nine present have two or more of symptoms and one third have all of symptoms \\[1-4，6\\]. The chest pain is usually is sudden， severe and retrosternal as our patient had severe chest pain， dysphagia， odynophagia and mild hematemesis， epigastric pain occasional radiating to the back \\[1，2\\]. The hematemesis occurs after rupture of the hematoma through the esophageal mucosa \\[3，4\\]. Clinical finding in some patients show low blood pressure，tenderness of epigastrium or low-grade fever \\[1，3\\]. But in our case we did not find any clinical sign as fever and low blood pressure. The differential diagnosis of IHE includes esophageal disease as Boerhaave，Mallory-Weiss Syndrome (MWS) and motility disorder \\[6，9\\]. A complete transmural rupture of the esophagus in distal portion due to sudden increase of intraesophageal pressure， during sever vomiting or cough， blunttrauma， child birth， straining and weightlifting， intraesophageal pressureincrease \\[6，9\\]. In MVS after vomiting， the patient present with lower thoracic chest pain and subcutaneous emphysema usually in the neck. A longitudinal mucosal tear at the gastroesophageal junction occur in MVS following severe cough， retching or forceful vomiting MVS occur and the usual symptom is hematemesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The prognosis is good with supportive care and treatment \\[6，9\\]. IHE can also be misdiagnosed with peptic ulcer perforated and acute pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Other differential diagnosis are ischemic heart disease， dissection， rupture or dissection of thoracic aorta or pulmonary embolism and pneumothorax \\[1，3，9，10\\]. Electrocardiogram， chest X-ray and laboratory tests as CK-MB， troponin， dimer and amylase and lipase can help for diagnosis of cardiovascular respiratory disorder and pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. For diagnosis of IHE medical historically， barium or Gastrografin swallow study of esophagus \\[1，3，9，10\\]. But today’s， CT-scan of chest or MRI of chest and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy are used\\[2，9，11\\]. Endoscopic ultrasonography are sometime performed and recommended \\[1，2，9\\]. Historically， for evaluation of IHE， Barium or Gastrografin swallow was the first choice of radiological imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. This imaging showing an long segment of tubular filling defect with smooth border or showing the dissection space or the lumen filling with contrast in the esophagus \\[1-3，16\\] to days CT-scan of chest is the first rapid and noninvasive radiological investigation of choice and can rule out other thoracic pathologies\\[1，4，16\\]. CT-scan of chest usually shows symmetric or asymmetric esophageal wall thickening of the esophageal wall \\[2，4\\]. The other imaging for invagination is MRI. MRI show a mass of intermediate signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted image and also shows the extension of the hematoma in several planes and can differentiate esophageal lesions from mediastinal masses or pathologies \\[15，16\\]. Esophagogastroscopy usually shows a large blue or purplish lesion in the posterior portion of esophagus \\[4，5，9，13\\] or sometimes show mucosal erosions， ulcerations or necrosis \\[5，9-11\\]. Endoscopic ultrasonography can helpful to show underlying intramural orluminal esophageal tumors or vascular lesions \\[9，11，13\\]. In our case， after roll-out the cardiovascular problem， our performed a CT-scan of the chest and esophagoscopy with carefully that showed the same lesions as described in our cases presentation. Treatment is conservative with no oral food or drink intake， with intravenous fluid and correction of any coagulopathy， then a progressive give the patients fluid and soft diet \\[1，2，4\\]. Antibiotics are not used routinely， except for rare cases of infection in the submucosal layer \\[1，4\\]. Surgery is contraindicated in IHE except for esophageal perforation in the pleural or mediastinum**\n\n【36】**space， uncontrolled hemorrhage or complicated abscess \\[6，10，12\\]. If spontaneous resolution do not happen， endoscopic incision of the mucosal layer has been described \\[6，10，12\\] prognosis is very good and resolution happen about 2 to3 weeks full recovery happen in (75%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15-18\\]</u> like in our case. Mortality has been reported after thoracotomy or in very ill whit cardio-pulmonary patients \\[1，4\\]. Recurrent massive bleeding was reported in some case reports and this bleeding managed with arterial embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In achalasia recurrence of bleeding was reported \\[1，19\\]. The IHE can be followed by endoscopy or endoscopic ultrasonography \\[9，10，13\\].**\n\n【37】**Conclusion**\n\n【38】**In conclusion， IEH is a very rare event of esophagus and submucosal esophageal bleeding which can present with acute onset of chest pain， dysphagia or hematemesis and can mimicking some acute cardiopulmonary diseases. These can result in a delayed or even missed diagnosis IHE. Past medical history is very important in such situation. Thus， a high index of suspicion IHE is needed to make the diagnosis and provide the appropriate and best management.**\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive AML is considered to have a good prognosis when using tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the course of treatment.**\n\n【16】**Hereby we report a case of a 27-year-old male with FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive eosinophilia-associated AML， resistant to imatinib， dasatinib as well as intensive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The course of our patient's treatment is not consistent with the reports of most authors.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**_Citation：_**\n\n【19】**_cited._**\n\n【20】**A 27-year-old male was diagnosed in December 2013 as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) FAB M4. In Peripheral Blood (PB) leukocytes is was 113 G/l with 58% of myeloid blasts infiltration， anemia and thrombocytopenia. He did not have peripheral lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Cytogenetics showed normal male karyotype with no chromosomal aberrations in FISH. CBFB-MYH11， BCR-ABL1， FLT3-ITD， NPM1 and c-kit were excluded in RT-PCR. The diagnosis was preceded by mild megaloblastic anemia. As induction chemotherapy the patient received DAC regimen (daunorubicin，cytarabine， cladribine) and he achieved hematological Complete Remission(CR)， however， with eosinophilia observed both in BM and PB smears. Eosinophilia as a reaction has been ruled out. Identification of FIP1L1-PDGFRA by RT-PCR was performed using material from the diagnosis (PB) and the time of remission assessment (BM). Both specimens were positive. Then the patient received HAM (high dose cytarabine/mitoxantrone) chemotherapy. One month later the patient experienced progressive leukocytosis with eosinophilia. Immunophenotype of BM showed 63% myeloid blasts infiltration， and then imatinib 400 mg daily was administered. After one month， the patient achieved hematological CR and the treatment continued with imatinib 200mg daily. After four months， the patient reported general symptoms. His leukocytosis reached 27G/L with eosinophilia. BM was infiltrated in 94% by myeloid blasts with positive FIP1L1-PDGFRA， and then dasatinib 100 mg daily was started. The therapy was complicated by severe pneumonia， oral candidiasis， Clostridium dificile infection and enteropathy. The patient achieved hematological CR and then the search for a donor for allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplantation (allo-HSCT) began. After three months， another relapse was noted with leukocytosis 70 G/L and BM infiltration by 24% of blasts with no eosinophilia. CLAG-M (cladribine， cytarabine， filgrastim， mitoxantrone) reinduction chemotherapy was administered. The patient achieved hematologic CR and received allo-HSCT from an unrelated donor. A reactivation of CMV infection was a problem after the transplantation. After four months， a relapse was documented with 30% of BM infiltration. At this time， BM cytogenetics showed complex karyotype including del (17p) and RT-PCR revealed the presence of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion. The patient received DAC reinduction chemotherapy. The second rescue， haploidentical stem cell transplant from the patient’s brother as a donor was carried out. Despite intensive supportive care the patient died due to pulmonary infection in +13day after procedure.**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n**FIP1L1-PDGRA mutation is extremely rarely detected in AML通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. This fusion gene generates protein complex， which acts like tyrosine kinase and causes constant proliferation ofeosinophils from progenitor cells despite lack of ligand. The mechanism is analogous to BCR-ABL1 mutation in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). Furthermore， FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene is proved to be about100-fold more sensitive to inhibitors oftyrosine kinase enzymes than BCR-ABL1. That is why it is possible to treat patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive AML-Eo with lower doses ofimatinib with success\\[1，2，5\\]. Nevertheless， a resistance to imatinib might occur related to the acquisition of the T674I mutation in most cases， which is analogous to BCR-ABL1 T315I mutation in CML or because of D842V mutation1-5|.**\n\n【23】**We know that several descriptions of the course of treatment of patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive AML， whose treatment with TKIs was suiccessful. Barraco et al. described 41-year-old _patient with FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive AML-Eo， BCR-ABL1， CBFB-MYH11，RUNX1-RUNXITI， KIT D816V negative who was treated_ using imatinib 100 mg to 200 mg daily. The patient achieved hematologic， cytogenetic and molecular response without side effects通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Metzgerold et al. presented in their paper seven patients with eosinophilia and FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene. Five of them were diagnosed as AML and two others as lymphoblastic T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. All patients were treated using imatinib 100 mg to 400 mg daily and all of them achieved hematologic and molecular CR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【24】**In this case we observed resistance to imatinib， dasatinib， intensive chemotherapy and allo-HSCT with fatal outcome in our patient. Undoubtedly， the course of the disease of our patient is different compared to most previous reports. Sorour et al. had similar observation in the case of a 25-vear-old male with FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive AML-Eo and myelodysplasia resistant to imatinib. In the beginning the patient received FLAG-Ida induction， and reached CR. Subsequently， imatinib 400 mg daily was given， and patient underwent allo-HSCT. Six months after transplantation BM was positive for FIP1L1-PDGFRA and imatinib 400 mg to 600 mg was ordered. After 12 months AML relapsed with the presence of D842mutation， which is known to be resistant to imatinib， so sensitive to dasatinib and he was started with dasatinib treatment， which was not tolerated and the patient died. Authors suggested that the outcome of this kind of AML is not as good as previously thought 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Our patient’s case was probably preceded by myelodysplasia and the course of treatment proved to be relapsed and ultimately refractory. Other authors described a case report of a patient FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive with AML-Eo， treated with imatinib 100 mg daily. After five months of therapy the relapse and T674I mutation were revealed. A patient received sorafenib 400 mg daily and underwent allo-HSCT with hematologic and cytogenetic remission. Unfortunately， the patient died because of respiratory failure five months after the transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【25】**In conclusion， we suggest performing the identification of FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene in all patients with diagnosis of AML and eosinophilia.

The pedigree analysis highlighting the index patient and her heterozygous， asymptomatic offspring is shown in Figure 2A.**\n\n【64】**Availableliteraturesuggeststhat c.1776delC may cause a frameshift of the open reading frame at position p.593， leading to a premature stop codon after 15 changed amino acids (p.Phe593Serfs\\*16)， hence inducing nonsense mediated decay. The NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) detected c.1776delC once in 8，246 alleles of European-American background with unclear putative relevance.

Further immunoblot analyses confirmed the absence of ABCA1 in PBMCs**\n\n【70】**derived from the index patient. Her offspring had a lower expression of ABCA1 as compared to healthy controls . Finally， FPLC analysis of plasma from the index patient and her offspring confirmed pathological cholesterol distribution among different lipoproteins， mainly reflected by reduced HDL-C levels .**\n\n【71】**Discussion**\n\n【72】**Tangier Disease (TD) is an autosomal recessive disorder defined by significantly reduced levels of plasma HDL-C， typically leading to an accumulation of cholesterol esters in tissue. Common clinical features include lipid laden tonsils， intestinal lipid storage， recurrent peripherall neuropathy， hypocholesterolemia，and abnormal chylomicron remnants \\[13，14\\]. Patients with TD are expected to have Loss of Function (LOF) mutations in both alleles of the ABCA1 gene12，15.**\n\n【73】**Here we report on a 50-year old Caucasian patient with features typical of TD including splenomegaly and peripheral neuropathy. Laboratory studies showed undetectable plasma HDL-C， decreased total cholesterol and ApoA11 concentrations， elevated plasma triglycerides and thrombocytopenia. Histological findings of a surgically removed hamartoma of the chin showed deposition of fat droplets and infiltration with foam cells. Genetic analysis of the index patient revealed a compound heterozygosity for a novel mutation(c.1776delC) as well as an already known mutation (c.1824delG) affecting the ABCA1 gene， leading to the above mentioned clinical phenotype typical of TD. The offspring， both heterozygous for the already described c.1824delG， showed no clinical evidence for TD and had normal laboratory findings. Of note， cholesterol efflux from peripheral monocytes was significantly reduced in this family of three， however most markedly in the heterozygous index patient.**\n\n【74】**The human ABCA1 gene on chromosome 9q22-q31 contains50 exons and spans 150kb 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， and at present， over 200 ABCA1mutations have been identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Variants in the ABCAI gene can result in a broad spectrum of biochemical abnormalities， leading to many different clinical phenotypes in TD patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.**\n\n【75】**The exact clinical and biochemical significance of this novel mutation at position c.1776delC remains unclear， as both offspring were heterozygous for the previously described mutation at position c.1824delG.Also，unfortunately， no additional medical information is retrievable from the index patient's parents. Our findings suggest that the novel mutation may lead to a premature stop codon， yielding a non-functional protein reflected by absent ABCA1. As a consequence of that， HDL-associated components may be reduced， especially cholesterol and ApoA1， as was observed in the index patient.**\n\n【76】**Available literature suggests that heterozygous relatives of TD patients may present with an intermediate TD phenotype characterized by aberrant laboratory， but normal clinical findings. Typical laboratory findings may include HDL-C concentrations amounting to 50% of those of healthy age- and sex-matched controls通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Of note， impaired cholesterol efflux capacity， as detected in the offspring of our index-patient， might be associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease even in heterozygous patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. These findings clearly underline the importance of raising clinical awareness towards not only patients presenting with obvious clinical and laboratory aberrations typical of TD， but also towards respective clinically asymptomatic relatives. These patients may present with only mild laboratory aberrations in need of more frequent or thorough follow-up investigations to avoid long-term complications**\n\n【77】**and severe cardiovascular disease.**\n\n【78】**In summary， this case-study expands the knowledge on mutations causing TD. We were able to characterize the impact of a novel ABCAlmutation on cholesterol efflux capacity， a major pathway in HDL particle synthesis and RCT. The findings of this report suggest that even asymptomatic relatives of patients affected by TD may benefit of thorough work-up and regular follow-up visits to avoid long-term complications.**\n\n【79】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【80】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**l.

The lack of recognition of this uncommon complication of herpes zoster， which is easy to diagnose， may lead to the multiplication of complementary studies. The prognosis for this complication is good and usually without sequela. The main characteristics of the syndrome are outlined.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Abdominal pseudo hernia； Herpes zoster； Segmental zoster paresis**\n\n【19】**Introduction**\n\n【20】**Herpes zoster is caused by the activation of varicella-zoster virus in the dorsal-root ganglia. The sensory abnormality is a predominant symptom of herpes zoster virus infection， whereas， motor neuropathy， although uncommon， can also occur in this infection. Segmental zoster abdominal paresis is one of the rare motor complications， mimicking an abdominal hernia. But unlike from the real abdominal wall hernia， it needs no surgery. Here， we report a case with an abdominal protrusion， with typical skin lesions due to Herpes zoster (Hz).**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 50-year-old woman presented with pain on the right side of her lower abdomen for three days， sometimes radiating to the right lumbar fossa. She noticed abnormal swelling on the right side of her abdomen， with hyperesthesia. She had a history of thyroid cancer with surgery in 2020. The patient had no other comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus or hernias. One month earlier， she had received her second injection of SPIKEVAX vaccine against COVID-19. The examination in the supine position  triggered a pain with pressure on the McBurney point. On standing examination， a prominent bulge 10 cm to 15 cm in diameter was present on the right side of the abdomen . The area was hyperesthetic to the touch. Abdominal reflexes were absent on the right side. Skin examination showed a papular， erythematous lesion in the right lumbar region， suggestive of herpes zoster. Treatment with valaciclovir and pregabalin was initiated. Routine laboratory tests were normal， and HIV serology was negative. An abdominal CT scan was performed， which showed no evidence of a Spigelian hernia in the right anterolateral abdominal wall. Thoracic and lumbar MRI showed no lesions in the anterior horn of the spinal cord.**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Examination in supine and standing position.**\n\n【24】**Discussion/Conclusion**\n\n【25】**In 1895， Taylor described for the first time a segmental abdominal zoster paresis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Since then， only a few similar cases have been described. Herpes zoster mainly affects the sensory nervous system and motor deficits are uncommon and mainly involve the muscles of the head. Abdominal pseudohernia due to segmental denervation is rare， probably because of overlapping innervation. The pathogenesis is thought to be due to a direct viral infection spreading from the dorsal root ganglion to the cells of the anterior horn. Abdominal wall paralysis can be caused by a variety of conditions affecting the peripheral nerves that innervate the abdominal muscles， including Hz， diabetes， lumbar disc herniation or spinal cord injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In1972， Thomas recorded 1，210 patients with a diagnosis of Hz \\[31.Of these patients， only 61 had segmental zoster paresis， most of them with cephalic zoster.

Usually， the herpetic rash preceded the development of pseudohernia with a mean delay of 3.5 weeks. Of**\n\n【26】**the 36 patients， 23 had a complete recovery， with a mean time of4.9 months and a maximum of one year. It should be kept in mind that this rare complication of herpes zoster has a good prognosis， and usually recovers without sequela； therefore， physicians should reassure the patient， limit further studies， and avoid unnecessary surgery.**\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

With the diagnosis of AHCM， She was started on Beta Blocker for 3 months but she developed severe bradycardia. She was then referred to Mayo clinic at Arizona where she underwent septal myomectomy.**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n【31】**Epidemiology**\n\n【32】**Ethnically， AHCM accounts for 13-41% of all variants of HCM among Asian individuals， whereas the prevalence among non-Asians is < 5%. Of all the HCM patients in Japan the prevalence of AHCM was 15%， whereas in USA the prevalence was only 3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> However， much of these epidemiologic data are derived from studies conducted in the early 1990s， and the exact prevalence of AHCM in non-Asians may be underestimated due to diagnostic unawareness as well as the**\n\n【33】**Systoly.**\n\n【34】**heterogeneous appearance on trans-thoracic echocardiogram， the most frequently utilized diagnostic modality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【35】**Diagnosis**\n\n【36】**Most patients with AHCM are diagnosed incidentally or with mild symptoms including fatigue， fainting， chest pain and palpitation， although cases were reported with symptoms of angina， myocardial infarction， heart failure， atrial or ventricular fibrillation. In patients presenting with severe symptoms， apical myomectomy can be done\\[3，4\\].**\n\n【37】**The diagnostic criteria for AHCM include demonstration of asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy confined predominantly to the LV apex. This hypertrophy must present with an apical wall thickness >=15mm and a ratio of maximal apical to posterior wall thickness 21.3. This can be based on either echocardiogram with or without contrast medium. Such medium improve endocardial border visualization or cardiovascular resonance imaging (CMR)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【38】**Th1ee _F_ preferredinitialimaging test is 2 trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Image quality can vary however， as it is dependent on many factors including body habitus and the skill of the sonographer to focus on the left ventricular apex. When the baseline images are suboptimal， a contrast echocardiogram may be utilized depicting a“spade-like”configuration ofthe apical segment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Other imaging modalities have been proven useful such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging. This modality usually presents with three distinct findings1) an increased apical tracer uptake， 2) a spade-like configuration of the LV chamber， and 3) the “Solar Polar\" map pattern. This presentation may be seen in 75% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【39】**AHCM can be diagnosed accurately with Cardiac computed tomography(CCT)， and the cardiac anatomy， function and coronary artery are also assessed simultaneously. CMR is a valuable tool for diagnosing this entity and it tends to be the modality of choice when echocardiography produces suboptimal images. Furthermore， CMR can accurately measure the myocardial wall thickness， the left ventricular mass， the left atrial volume， and also search for apical aneurysms and myocardial scarring/fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【40】**Typical features of apical HCM include： audible and palpable fourth heart sound， indicating LV relaxation impairment， large negative T waves on EKG particularly in the left precordial leads，“Spade-like” configuration of the left ventricular cavity at end-diastole on imaging， and associated apical wall motion abnormalities which may include hypokinesis and aneurysm formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>**\n\n【41】**Treatment**\n\n【42】**Regarding management， AHCM are treated like most HCM patients. Symptomatic patients are primarily treated medically that include the use of beta blockers， nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as well as antiarrhythmics including Amiodarone and Procainamide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【43】**Beta-blockers have empiricaly been administered to AHCM patients. Numerous studies investigated the effects of beta-blockers on AHCM patients and reported symptom improvement. The beneficial effects might be driven by sympathetic suppression of heart rate， ventricular contractility， and stiffness. However， the long-term benefits of beta-blockers in HCM patients are still unknown. Although a cohort study reported that massive doses of propranolol improved symptoms and long-term survival， this is not standard procedure. Kim et al found beta-blocker use was significantly associated with lower overall death but not lower cardiac death. In other studies， beta-blockers reduced left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and ventricular tachyarrhythmia. It is difficult to determine the benefits of beta-blockers in HCM patients because the agent，dosage， and duration were not consistent in all patients. Kim et al strongly suggested that observation without medical attention for apical HCM patients might in fact be harmful. Further randomized trials should be conducted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【44】**Surgical septal wall reduction is rarely done as AHCM almost never cause Left Ventricular outflow obstruction. Our patient is among the few treated surgically. Risk stratification for ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death is the same as for other patients with HCM，but apical HCM is typically associated with a low risk and almost never requires Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator placement for primary prevention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【45】**Prognosis**\n\n**Apical HCM has better mortality prognosis than other forms of HCM but it is still associated with a relatively high rates of significant cardiac events. Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in North American patients is very similar to that in Japanese patients， is not associated with sudden cardiac death and has a benign prognosis in terms of cardiovascular mortality. However， one third of APHCM patients may develop unfavorable clinical events and potentially life-threatening complications， such as myocardial infarction， arrhythmias， and stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In one study where 105 patients with AHCM， with a mean age of 41 years， were followed for close to 14years， the total cardiovascular mortality rate was 1.9% and the overall estimated survival was 95% at 15 vears. The study also showed that30% of patients experienced serious cardiac complication， most commonly atrial fibrillation (12%) or myocardial infarction (10%)|12，13.**\n\n【47】**Conclusion**\n\n【48】**We presented a rare case of AHCM which was treated surgically. Symptomatic patients are primarily treated medically mostly by Beta blocker. Very few patients may need surgical management. This made our patient among the very few who underwent surgical intervention due to outflow obstruction and severe bradycardia. Thus counseling and management of patients with APHCM should be planned and followed accordingly.**\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Acknowledgment**</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**We are indebted to Dominic Robine， DO， FACC， Cardiologist at Mountain View Hospital， Las Vegas - Nevada， USA for his continuous support and advice.

Plication of the mesenteric folds comprising the hernia sac may help decrease recurrence and seroma rates but additional studies are needed to elucidate this further.**\n\n【17】**Keywords：Internal hernia； Paraduodenal hernia； Laparoscopic repair； Technique**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**Internal hernias， which are a result of bowel protrusion through a normal or abnormal intra-abdominal mesenteric defect， are relatively rare but comprise approximately 1% of all small bowel obstructions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Paraduodenal hernias are the most common form of congenital internal hernias， accounting to approximately 40-50% of the total 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. Paraduodenal hernias are thought to be a congenital defect of rotation and improper fusion of the mesenteric leaflets during fetal life that creates small defects through which the bowel herniate s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> and can be either right or left sided. Left sided are the most common， comprising 75% of all reported cases. Most patients describe a history of chronic intermittent colicky abdominal pain but can also present acutely with a small bowel obstruction.**\n\n【20】**Diagnosis is often delayed and difficult due to the intermittent herniation and egress of bowel， a low index of suspicion and non-diagnostic imaging. As a result， many patients proceed to the operating room for exploration due to continued symptoms without a formal diagnosis and a majority undergo open exploration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Due to the rarity of this condition， there is no consensus regarding standard of care for the surgical treatment of these hernias. Few cases with laparoscopic repair have been described but we report a successful laparoscopic repair of a left sided paraduodenal hernia with a modified technique involving plication of the hernia sac along with a literature review to establish the feasibility of a laparoscopic approach for repair of these hernias.**\n\n【21】**A 36 year old female presented with a one year history of intermittent crampy abdominal pain that resulted in several visits to the emergency department. The episodes were associated with nausea and non-bilious vomiting but she denied any history suggestive of strangulation. All**\n\n【22】**imaging studies done during these episodes over a period of several years were non-diagnostic except for one CT scan with oral contrast which revealed a large internal hernia to the left of the duodenum under the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV)， consistent with a left sided paraduodenal hernia . The patient subsequently presented to us and was taken to the operating room after a thorough discussion. A diagnostic laparoscopy confirmed the diagnosis and revealed a large paraduodenal hernia with a majority of her small bowel herniating posterior to the proximal IMV， lateral to the ligament of Treitz，into a hernia sac posterior to the descending colon . Several adhesive bands tethering the bowel to the hernia sac were noted and divided. The hernia was completely reduced following which the leaflets of the hernia sac (posterior aspect of the left colonic mesentery and the retroperitoneal tissues) were approximated with interrupted silk sutures. The mouth of the hernia defect just lateral to the IMV was subsequently closed with interrupted sutures using an Endostitch device. Patient tolerated the procedure without complications and was discharged on postoperative day 3 on a regular diet. The patient continues to do well without any evidence of recurrence at 24 month follow up.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**In this study， we report the diagnosis and successful laparoscopic repair of a left sided paraduodenal hernia with plication of the hernia sac as an added deterrence to future recurrence and seroma formation. A literature review is also done to demonstrate the efficacy of a laparoscopic approach for repair of these hernias.**\n\n【25】**Small bowel internal hernias account for almost 1% of all cases**\n\n【26】**of intestinal obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， of which 50% are either due to left orright sided paraduodenal hernias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. These typically arise in the fetal life due to malrotation of the midgut and left sided are the most common， comprising 75% of all cases， in which the small bowel prolapses through the Landzert’s fossa， a congenital opening present in approximately 2% of people \\[2，6，7\\]. This opening is a peritoneal fold formed by the inferior mesenteric vein and the ascending left colic artery. In contrast， right sided paraduodenal hernias are formed by prolapse of the small bowel through the Waldeyer’s fossa， a small aperture behind the superior mesenteric artery and 3 or 4h portion of the duodenum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This opening is congenitally found in less than 1%of people and compared to left sided hernias， the right sided hernias are often larger and more tethered \\[1，5\\].**\n\n【27】**Paraduodenalhernias do nothave a typical presentation and most ofthe patients present with vague symptoms of intermittent episodic abdominal pain， nausea and vomiting which makes diagnosis difficult as was the case with our patient. A minority present to the emergency room with signs and symptoms of acute small bowel obstruction. Upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through or CT scans may reveal an oval hernia sac or a cluster of small bowel loops posterolateral to the duodenum， as it did with our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However， these imaging modalities are typically non diagnostic either due to being done during a period of non-herniation or due to the presence of very subtle imaging findings which are easily overlooked. This was evident in our case by the numerous non-diagnostic imaging studies and the patient remaining undiagnosed for more than a year. Of note，the patient had a normal CT scan the dayprior to her surgery while intraoperatively， a majority of her small bowel was found to be herniated which further exemplifies the intermittent nature of this disease and underscores the difficulty in radiologic diagnosis. A high index of suspicion and review of the imaging studies with an experienced radiologist is paramount for the diagnosis of this disease.**\n\n【28】**Most patients are diagnosed in the operating room upon surgical exploration and as a result have an open procedure as is the norm for a majority of small bowel obstructions operated on， in an acute setting in USA. We had diagnosed the left sided paraduodenal hernia preoperatively due to a combination of her symptoms， radiologic imaging and a high index of suspicion. We accomplished a successful laparoscopic repair despite the presence of significant adhesions to the hernia sac and having herniated a majority of her small bowel. Due to the lack of national guidelines and best practices for treatment of this disease which is a reflection of the rarity of the disease， in addition to reducing the hernia， we decided to approximate the leaflets of the hernia sac (posterior aspect of the left colonic mesentery and the retroperitoneal tissues) and close the mouth of the hernia defect laparoscopically with interrupted sutures to further decrease the chance of a recurrence and a seroma， which has not been done before. The patient continues to not have a recurrence at 24 months but in the absence oflarger studies with longer follow up， the best approach to these rare hernias will likely continue to remain uncertain.**\n\n【29】**Literature review**\n\n【30】**A thoroughliterature review was done using Pubmed and Medline databases looking for laparoscopic paraduodenal hernia repairs to evaluate its frequency and efficacy and to try to find best practice guidelines for their surgical repair.

Twenty threelaparoscopic cases in18 publications between 1998 and 2014 have been reported， of which fourteen patients (61%) were left sided hernias. The mean age of diagnosis was 44 years and 53% patients were female. The symptoms at diagnosis were reported in all but two publications (89%) and when reported， the symptoms included abdominal pain (81%)， nausea and vomiting (62%)， constipation/obstipation (19%)， bowel obstruction upon presentation (12%) and an asymptomatic incidental mass(6%). The chronicity of the symptoms was not specifically addressed in all publications but 25% of cases were reported to have chronic symptoms (Range： Two months to six years).**\n\n【34】**In allcases (100%) including ours， bowel was reduced laparoscopically with adhesions being taken sharply. The details of operative closure were mentioned in 78% of the publications. Of the ones that reported operative details， most patients (92%) had the mouth of the hernia defect closed with a permanent suture using either an Endostitch device (only one patient) or intracorporeal suturing (most patients) while in two patients (8%) the defect was not closed. Most cases were successfully repaired laparoscopically with no reported cases of conversion to an open procedure in the literature， regardless of the acuity of presentation or the presence of small bowel obstruction which is likely due to the proximal nature of the obstruction with these hernias. Only one case (4%) had to be converted to an open procedure in the current literature via an upper midline laparotomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In most cases， patients were discharged from the hospital between 1-7 days .**\n\n【35】**Long term follow up in not available in the literature with only two reports documenting follow up of 24 months in both cases \\[3，8\\]. Only two complications were reported in the literature with one patient having an intraoperative injury to the inferior mesenteric vein and one patient having a recurrence (4%). Of note， the patient with a recurrence had the mesenteric defect closed at the index operation with a recurrence noted at 18 months postoperatively which was subsequently repaired laparoscopically with a Gore-Tex plug 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【36】**We decided to not only suture the mouth of the hernia defect(Peritoneum overlying the IMV to the retroperitoneum， ligament**\n\n【37】**of Treitz and the 4hpart of duodenum) but also plicated the retrocolic hernia sac to prevent seroma formation and decrease the chances of recurrence. This is the first reported case with this technique modification， however， its efficacy in avoiding future seroma， recurrence and other complications will likely never be able to be objectively assessed due to the rarity of this condition. While a randomized trial would be ideally required to determine the best approach and technique for repair， the rarity of these hernias makes that unlikely.**\n\n【38】**Conclusion**\n\n【39】**Paraduodenal hernias account for 50% of all cases of internal hernias associated with small bowel obstruction. A high index of suspicion is needed for diagnosis due to the intermittent nature of the herniation， vague symptomatology and lack of sensitive diagnostic tests. Laparoscopic repair is associated with good outcomes in the limited numbers of published case reports. Defect closure with Endostitch device versus intra-corporeal suturing does not seem to affect outcome. Additional plication of the retrocolic hernia sac described by us may play a role in further decreasing complications such as seroma and recurrence rates**\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Acknowledgments**</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**We would like to acknowledge Juan Alvarez and Namrah Aijaz for their help with presentation and manuscript preparation.**</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**l.

The ulcer can be difficult to heal and seriously affects the patient's quality of life. A large amount of labor and time is lost each year due to this condition. Treating iliac vein stenosis and occlusion can save the lost social and economic losses， reduce patient suffering， shorten hospitalization time， and reduce medical insurance costs. This article analyzes and summarizes the clinical data of 27 patients with iliac vein compression syndrome who were treated with iliac vein stent implantation in our department in the past two years.**\n\n【19】**Clinical and imaging data were collected from 27 patients who were admitted to the department of vascular surgery of our hospital， and were diagnosed with lower extremity varicose veins or deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities and its sequelae. Among the 27 patients， there were12 males (44.4%) and 15 females (55.6%)， with an age range of 48 to 76 years and a median age of 57 years. All the patients underwent the implantation of the Wallstent woven iliac vein stent(Boston Scientific， USA). Among the 16 patients with combined lower extremity varicose veins，13 underwent secondary surgery for varicose vein stripping. Among the 2 patients with deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities， both underwent primary Angiojet thrombus aspiration.**\n\n【20】**Surgical methods： All patients underwent lower extremity deep vein angiography first， using the Siemens Artis ZEE ceiling flat-panel vascular angiography system from Germany. The patient was placed in a supine position on an examination table， and a puncture needle with a sheath was placed on the dorsum of the foot. A tourniquet was tied around the ankle to block the blood flow of the superficial veins. If the dorsum of the foot was too swollen to place the puncture needle， the shallow vein in the calf was punctured instead， and the blood flow of the superficial vein was blocked above the puncture point. The puncture needle was connected to a high-pressure injector(2 mL/s flow rate， 100 kPa pressure， total volume of 100 mL) to perform deep vein angiography in**\n\n【21】**the direction of the blood flow， and the condition of the iliac vein was observed under fluoroscopy. Non-ionic iodine contrast agents(Omnipaque or Visipaque) were used for angiography. If abnormal conditions were found in the iliac vein during angiography， the femoral vein was punctured to perform iliac vein balloon dilation and stent implantation.**\n\n【22】**For patients with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities，primary Anjiojet thrombus aspiration may be performed， and if compression of the iliac vein is found after aspiration， iliac vein balloon dilation and stent implantation may be performed simultaneously. For patients with lower extremity varicose veins， secondary surgery for high ligation and stripping of the great saphenous vein may be performed.**\n\n【23】**Result**\n\n【24】**Among the patients in this group， 11 cases (40.7%) were found to have iliac vein compression syndrome combined with deep vein thrombosis or its sequelae， and 16 cases (59.3%) had iliac vein compression syndrome combined with great saphenous vein varicose veins. All of them successfully underwent iliac vein stent placement and were treated for any associated complications concurrently or in phased approaches. Three stents were implanted in 2 cases， 2 stents were implanted in 6 cases， and 1 stent was implanted in 19 cases. Except for patients who underwent simultaneous thrombus aspiration surgery， the surgeries for all patients were completed within 2 h， and hospital stays did not exceed 1 week. Swelling in the lower extremities of patients with deep vein thrombosis was significantly reduced 1 to2 days after surgery. Among the patients with great saphenous vein varicose veins， there were 2 cases of CEAP grade 3 (varicose veins)， 7cases of grade 4 (with pigmentation)， 2 cases of grade 5 (with healed ulcers)， and 2 cases of grade 6 (with active ulcers). Postoperative follow-up at the outpatient clinic has shown no recurrence of varicose veins， improved pigmentation， and all ulcers healed. All patients clinical symptoms improved significantly， and treatment costs were low. No serious postoperative complications or deaths occurred in this group of patients .**\n\n【25】**Discussion**\n\n【26】**Iliac vein disease mainly refers to stenosis and occlusive diseases of the iliac vein. It can cause high pressure in the lower extremity veins， which can lead to lower extremity swelling， deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities， secondary varicose veins of the lower extremities， pigmentation and ulceration in the ankle area. Ulcers can be long-standing and difficult to heal， commonly known as \"chronic leg ulcers\"， severely affecting the patient's quality of life and work ability. Kim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> reported on the progress sequence of clinical iliac vein compression： Stage 1： Asymptomatic iliac vein compression； stage 2： Formation of venous stasis； stage 3： Formation of deep venous thrombosis of the left iliac vein.**\n\n【27】**In the past， insufficient understanding of iliac vein disease made it difficult to treat it from the root. Since the clinical application oflower extremity deep venous contrast angiography， it has been found that a considerable number of patients with lower extremity venous system diseases have underlying iliac vein system diseases.**\n\n【28】**We performed lower extremity deep venous angiography on patients with venous system diseases upon admission to further clarify the etiology. We then performed corresponding treatments based on the fundamental cause， including minimally invasive iliac vein stent**\n\n【29】**Figure 1： lliac vein compression syndrome： lliac vein shows compression marks， significant collateral circulation is formed in the pelvic cavity， and blaod flow goes through the collateral circulation to reach the opposite side and flow upwards.**\n\n【30】**Figure 2： After implanting the iliac vein stent， the blaod flow in the iliac vein significantly improves and the collateral circulation in the pelvic cavity disappears.**\n\n【31】**implantation， and achieved satisfactory therapeutic effects. Berger et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> reported the first endovascular placement of an iliac vein stent to treat May-Thurner syndrome in 1995. In our study，no recurrence of venous varices was observed in patients with great saphenous vein varices after two outpatient follow-ups， suggesting that the patients venous hypertension had been relieved， fundamentally solving the cause of lower extremity varicose veins. Ma Jianjun et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> believed that patients with iliac vein compression syndrome had significant improvement in limb swelling， superficial vein varices， and elevated skin temperature of the lower legs compared to the control group after interventional treatment. They also showed significant improvement in pain， mental and physical ability compared to the control group. Lu Yongming et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> reported on 59 cases of non-thrombotic iliac vein compression with venous reflux. Only stent implantation was performed without superficial venous surgery. Although reflux and superficial vein varices still existed， there was a significant improvement in lower extremity swelling and pain symptoms， and all eight ulcers healed in more than two years. All of the above suggest that interventional treatment for iliac vein compression syndrome has positive significance.**\n\n【32】**We found that the proportion of iliac vein compression was also highamongpatients with deep vein thrombosisofthelowerextremities and sequelae after deep vein thrombosis. In our study， after thrombus extraction， we simultaneously performed iliac vein balloon dilation and stent implantation in patients with combined lower extremity deep vein thrombosis to not only relieve the thrombus load but also solve the disease from the etiology， achieving satisfactory therapeutic effects. Most of the lower limb swelling in patients subsided within1 to 2 days， and no recurrence of lower limb thrombosis was observed during outpatient follow-up visits， indicating good results. This approach protected the deep venous valves and prevented the occurrence of sequelae after lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. Lou Wensheng et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> believed that iliac vein compression is a high-risk group for deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities， which can be induced by surgery， pregnancy， or long-term bed rest， and its manifestations during angiography include： 1. Widening of the diameter of the compressed left common iliac vein； 2. Filling defect or septum formation in the compressed segment； 3. Occlusion of the common iliac vein； 4. Formation of collateral circulation； 5. Delayed venous emptying of the affected limb. We found that iliac and external iliac veins had obvious pressure marks during angiography， and even visible pulsation of the veins， which we considered to be a direct sign of iliac vein compression.**\n\n【33】**In our study， iliac vein stent implantation was successfully performed in 27 patients， using the Boston Scientific Wallstent woven stent. Our experience was that there was a significant shortening phenomenon when the stent was released， and the longer the stent length， the more obvious the shortening phenomenon. Thus， during stent release， attention should be paid to this phenomenon，**\n\n【34】**and an early starting point for stent release and pre-determined predetermined distances should be established. If the stent location is unsatisfactory during deployment before it exceeds 80% (i.e.， before the second marker)， the stent can be retracted into the sheath and repositioned**\n\n【35】**The use of Wallstent woven stents for endovascular intervention in the treatment of iliac vein system diseases has the advantages of minimally invasive procedures， rapid postoperative recovery， and early mobilization of the patient. The success rate of endovascular intervention for iliac vein diseases is high， and the effects are significant， making it of great clinical value.**\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

The recommended approach to treatment is therapeutic termination of pregnancy at the time of recognition. Couples occasionally make the choice to continue with expectant management. There are as few as ten documented cases of CSP and were expectantly managed that resulted in the delivery of a viable neonate. In this article， we present a case of CSP managed expectantly ending in emergency cesarean delivery at 27 weeks gestation. Delivery was complicated by severe postpartum hemorrhage with the need for cesarean hysterectomy. This report suggests the ability to expectantly manage appropriate cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies. However， it also raises several ethical questions. Whether or not we should manage these patients expectantly merely because we can.**\n\n【19】**Keywords： Cesarean scar pregnancy； Ectopic pregnancy； Expectant management**\n\n【20】**Introduction**\n\n【21】**Ectopic pregnancy itself complicates approximately 2% of all pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include a history of ectopic pregnancy， tubal surgery， tubal pathology， previous tuballigation，history of sexually transmitted infections and women with intrauterine contraceptive devices in place 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The most common place for an ectopic pregnancy is within the ampulla of the fallopian tube 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However，ectopic pregnancies can occur in several other anatomic locations including the adnexa， cervix， myometrium， cesarean scar and abdomen. In this case report， we will examine a case of cesarean scar pregnancy. Little is currentlyknown about the risk factors for cesarean scar pregnancies. Proposed risk factors include number of previous cesarean deliveries， type of hysterotomy closure and indication for cesarean delivery， among many others. The current standard of care for cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy currently is therapeutic termination. Termination can be performed via several different routes. Each with their own set of potential complications. But，are these risks of termination absolutely necessary? Is there a possibility to expectantly manage these pregnancies? This case report will review a cesarean scar pregnancy managed expectantly.**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**The patient is a 32-year-old Gravida 5 Para 2022 female whopresentedtoherprimary obstetrician due to positive home pregnancy test and vaginal bleeding. Her medical history is complicated by a history of red cell alloimmunization with anti-E antibodies and Factor V Leiden Heterozygote. Neither child has needed a transfusion for anti-E antibodies， nor has she never had a blood clot as a result of Factor V Leiden Deficiency. The patient’s reported last menstrual period was April 64，2018. Ultrasound dating at that visit was consistent with her last menstrual period and placed her at 7 weeks and 4 days gestation. Ultrasound identified fetal cardiac activity at 143 beats per minute， a bleed superior to the gestational sac that measures 23 mm x 12 mm x 23 mm in a diameter and implantation near the lower uterine segment near the cesarean scar.**\n\n【24】**Management and Outcome**\n\n【25】**Referral to Maternal Fetal Medicine for subsequent evaluation two days later was arranged due to suspicion for cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy. At this time， vaginal bleeding had resolved and the patient had begun prophylactic Aspirin for Factor V Leiden deficiency in anticipation of normal intrauterine pregnancy. Ultrasound evaluation of the fetus was again performed with findings in**\n\n【26】**Figure 1： Shows implantation site in the lower uterine segment， consistent with cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy.**\n\n【27】**Figure 1.Imaging was consistent with cesarean scarectopic pregnancy. The patient was extensively counseled about the standard of care for treatment of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy. Evaluation with Magnetic Resonance Imaging or surgical evaluation with laparoscopy was both offered. The patient declined both options. She was also counseled about therapeutic treatment options including surgical wedge resection and systemic vs. local methotrexate administration. The patient was adamant about expectant management. She was counseled that if she continued with expectant management， she ran the risk of developing morbidly adherent placental complications and the potential need for hysterectomy if bleeding became life threatening. Close follow-up with Maternal Fetal Medicine was arranged with serial ultrasonographic examinations.**\n\n【28】**One week later， the patient returned to the Maternal Fetal Medicine specialist for repeat ultrasonographic evaluation. Images from this appointment are shown in Figure 2. It was now apparent that the patient likely had a Grade I cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy based on the myometrial invasion of the gestational sac. Fetal growth remained appropriate for gestational age. The patient was noted to have at minimum placenta accreted and was counseled ad nauseam about the potential for placenta increta/percreta if she elected to continue her pregnancy. She was again warned of the possibility of uterine rupture and the need for a hysterectomy for significant bleeding. The need for peri-viable or preterm delivery was discussed with the patient if severe hemorrhage were to develop. All thromboprophylaxis was discontinued at this visit due to potential risk of life-threatening hemorrhage. Appropriate follow-up was initiated， and all return precautions were discussed in detail.**\n\n【29】**At the next ultrasonic evaluation，the fetus continued to have fetal**\n\n【30】**Figure 4： Large placenta lakes and continued placenta previa.**\n\n【31】**heart tones and appropriate fetal growth. Imaging is shown in Figure3. Corticosteroids were discussed and recommended at the cusp of viability. Continued expectant management was requested. At 12weeks' gestation， the patient had a second opinion consultation visit with another Maternal Fetal Medicine provider who reiterated the standard of care and possible outcomes with expectant management of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy. Images at 13 weeks' gestation are shown in Figure 4. There is concern that the placental tissue has invaded to the level of the uterine serosa without penetration through the serosa and some placental tissue within the cervix. Counseling about the guarded prognosis of this pregnancy was again provided and expectant management was continued.MRI was performed and was consistent with cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy and complete placenta previa. A normal anatomy scan was performed at 16 weeks gestation and is shown in . The patient then transferred care to a provider with access to a 24-h accerta team. Scans were readjusted to four-week intervals with strict precautions to present to the obstetrical triage unit if any bleeding persists. Placenta increta was diagnosed at an ultrasonographic evaluation at 22 weeks' gestation. Steroids were administered at 24 weeks to help accelerate fetal lung maturity. The patient presented to the obstetrical triage unit at 25weeks and 6 days gestation for vaginal bleeding and was admitted for observation. No active bleeding was noted， fetal heart tones were category I and she was discharged after overnight monitoring.**\n\n【32】**She represented to the obstetrical triage unit at 27 weeks and 4days gestation， again for vaginal bleeding. Bleeding was heavier， yet still minimal. However， fetal heart tones were noted to be category II and unresolved with maternal resuscitative measures； therefore， a decision was made to move forward with cesarean hysterectomy. The Maternal Fetal Medicine team performed the cesarean section. Skin incision was vertical and midline. Classical cesarean section was performed with a transverse fundal incision. Neonate was delivered without difficulty with APGARs of 2/6/8 at 1， 5 and 10 min**\n\n【33】**Figure 5： Definite placenta accreta with placenta previa and concern far placenta increta and fetal growth ultrasound within normal limits with a fetus measuring in the thirty-forth percentile for gestational age.**\n\n【34】**respectively. The fetus weight was 780 g at time of delivery. Complete placenta previa with invasion into the lower uterine segment was identified. The placenta was left in situ and the hysterotomy was whip stitched closed. Blood loss at completion of the cesarean section was 4000 ml. After closure of the hysterotomy， the Gynecologic Oncology team began the hysterectomy portion of the procedure. The hysterectomy was performed in the standard fashion. Blood loss during the hysterectomy was noted to be an additional 1500ml for a total blood loss of 5500 ml. The patient received five units of packed red blood cells， five units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit of platelets. The fascia was reapproximated with PDS suture. The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated with 3-0 vicryl suture. The skin was reapproximated with 4-0 monocryl suture. Derma bond was placed over the incision. The patient was unable to be extubated and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring.**\n\n【35】**She was extubated on the day of surgery. On post-operative day number one， she was transferred back to labor and delivery. Hemoglobin was stable at 110.3 and shee was noted to be hemodynamically stable. She was meeting all post-operative goals by post-operative day number four. Pathologic examination of the uterus reveals a relatively normal appearing cervix that is completely covered by the placenta. The myometrium averages 3.0 cm in thickness. The endometrium is approximately 0.2 cm in thickness. The placenta comprises the entire lower uterine segment without serosal penetration. The placenta contains a subamniotic hemorrhage near the umbilical cord insertion site. The fallopian tubes were grossly normal in appearance.**\n\n【36】**Discussion**\n\n【37】**The actual incidence of cesarean scar pregnancies is unknown as there are few documented cases. One study report that cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy complicates 1 in 2226 pregnancies. Several studies have been conducted to potentially identify potential risk factors for cesarean scare pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Studies have shown that the risk for cesarean scar pregnancy does not correlate to the number of previous cesarean deliveries. Some had proposed that the method of closure may impact the likelihood of cesarean scare pregnancy； however， there is no evidence that supports double vs. single layer closure of the uterus helps prevent cesarean scar pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. It does appear that cesarean section performed on an unlabored lower uterine segment may interrupt proper healing， thus， leading to slightly increased risk of cesarean scar pregnancy. With the increasing number of cesarean sections being performed around the world， the incidence is likely to**\n\n【38】**Figure 6： Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy classification system.**\n\n【39】**increase over the next several generations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【40】**Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy is classified into one of three sub-groups based on ultrasongraphic features at the time of diagnosis， each with its own prognosis. The classification system is shown in Figure 6. Classification is based on the location of the gestational sac and the amount of myometrium remaining 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Grade I is defined as the gestational sac penetrating less than half of the myometrium. In grade II cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies， the gestational sac penetrates greater than half the myometrium. In grade III cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies， the gestational sac extends outside the myometrium. Finally， in grade IV cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies， the gestational sac is highly vascular， and the pregnancy is difficult to identify.**\n\n【41】**The standard of care for cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy currently is therapeutic termination. There are several routes of termination that have been discussed； no one method proves to be superior to the others. As with many diagnoses there are medical， surgical and expectant management options. Medical management is performedwith systemic methotrexate， intragestational methotrexate or intragestational potassium chloride. The dosage for both systemic and intragestational methotrexate is 50 mg/m.A study performed by Kim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> showed significantly better results with intragestational methotrexate when compared to systemic methotrexate. Approximately 93% of cesarean scar pregnancies treated with intragestational methotrexate had complete resolution vs. 73% with systemic methotrexate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Medical management alone has been associated with the need for further surgical intervention with b-HCG greater than 6，000 mIU/mL via dilation and curettage or uterine artery embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Several surgical interventions have been reported for the treatment of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Surgical intervention leads to a more rapid decline in b-HCG levels than medical management. Surgical procedures for management of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy include dilation**\n\n【42】**and curettage， hysteroscopic resection， and laparoscopic vs. open wedge resection. Dilation and curettage alone is often complicated by hemorrhage with up to 76% requiring a second intervention and 14%requiring hysterectomy.Hysteroscopic resection is completed with a30 degree hysteroscope using cold resection techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Resection of products of conception is completed intact or piecemeal until the myometrium is able to be visualized. Any residual bleeding is then cauterized with electrocautery or balloon tamponade with a foley catheter ballon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Laparoscopic removal of cesarean scar pregnancy involves identification of the cesarean scar. Once identified the scar is incised with monopolar cautery and the gestational sac is removed through one of the trochar sites. The remaining cesarean scar is then removed with monopolar cautery and the defect is repaired in a two layer closure. Hysteroscopic and laparoscopic resection is not recommended for patients with less than three millimeters of myometrium remaining dueto risk ofbladder injury通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.Laparoscopic and open wedge resection provides the opportunity to repair the lower uterine segment and theoretically reduce the risk for recurrence通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Laparotomy is specifically indicated for patients with suspected uterine rupture and hemodynamic instability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Hysterectomy is often indicated if bleeding is unable to be controlled via laparotomy. Very few women have elected for expectant management. In one study， 10 patients elected for expectant management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Of those， four patients delivered viable neonates (40%) and three of those women required hysterectomy at time of delivery (75%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【43】**Conclusion**\n\n【44】**ais case report summarizes expectant management of a rare， cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy. A pregnancy outcome that complicates roughly 1 in 2226 pregnancies. The patients choose this treatment plan and successfully delivered a viable， although very preterm， infant. She overcame the odds as it is documented that approximately only 40% of expectantly managed cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies will go on to deliver viable neonates. Like many of her cohort， she also underwent cesarean hysterectomy as part of her treatment. It can be concluded， based on the grade of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy， some patients may be a candidate for expectant management with appropriate counseling. Appropriate counseling wouldinclude that of mass hemorrhage， possible invasive placentation， cystectomy，possible need for cystostomy tube placement and need for cesareanhysterectomy. Counseling regarding when to present to the obstetrical triage unit for evaluation is of utmost importance； however， in the end， delivering a viable neonate**\n\n【45】**is a possibility for women with cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy. The real questions comes in the form of medical ethics， specifically， non-maleficence. Just because we have the capability and the means to successful deliver a pregnancy such as the one presented in the case should we“recommend\"it? Should we tell women to carry these pregnancies knowing the potential risks discussed above?**\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

There are very few studies， which state that there is an association between epithelial ovarian and skin malignancy. However， association of three primary malignancies- breast， ovarian and skin in a patient with no family history of malignancies is not reported. We report a case of three primary malignancies in a76-year-old Indian woman.**\n\n【16】**Case History/Examination**\n\n【17】**Mrs.PM，76-year-oldwoman attended OPD on April 16h， 2017 with abdominal distension and loss of appetite for 1 year. She had history of three previous vaginal deliveries. She used Copper T for contraception and attained menopause at the age of 49 years. She was diabetic and her blood sugar levels were controlled with Tab Metformin 500. She had Mastectomy (right) breast for ductal carcinoma in situ eight years back (at the age of 68 years). She was on regular follow up for the same. The patient had no history of malignancy in first or second-degree relatives. On examination， there was a large pelvic mass of 15 cm x 13 cm， irregular， firm in consistency with restricted mobility.On speculum examination-cervix and vagina was healthy. There was an ulcer in right hypochondrium-2 cm ×2 cm. Skin biopsy was done and this showed superficially invasive basal cell carcinoma.**\n\n【18】**Investigation and Treatment**\n\n【19】**Investigation： Ultrasound abdomen & pelvis showed large heterogeneous lesion 15.8 cm×12cm with cystic areas and significant vascularity within. Uterus and ovaries could not be visualized separately. CT abdomen &pelvis showed large solid cystic pelvic mass 16.5 cmx12 cm×12 cm with mild bilateral hydronephrosis. There was no lymphadenopathy or ascites. Tumor markers were as follows-Serum cancer antigen (CA-125) was elevated (191.5U/ml)， Alpha Feto Protein (AFP) was onhigher side of normal (4.46) and Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) was normal (1.98). Complete blood count and other routine investigations were normal. Chest X-ray & KUB was normal. These findings suggested possibility of malignant ovarian neoplasm.**\n\n【20】**Treatment**\n\n【21】**After preoperative anesthesia clearance， laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and comprehensive surgical staging was done. And basal cell carcinoma excision was done under general anesthesia. Uterus was 10 weeks’size with right sided bosselated irregular fleshy vascular mass extending up to lateral pelvic wall . Wide local excision ofulcerated lesion over anterior abdominal wall was done-2.5 cm×2 cm . She received packed cell transfusion-2 units for anemia. Postoperative recovery was good.**\n\n【22】**Grossly， uterus was attached with left tube and ovary and measured 12.5 cm ×7 cmx5 cm. Right ovarian mass was cream and yellow colored and had congested surface with multiple smooth cystic and solid nodular projections. Left ovary measured 4 cmx1 cm x0.5 cm. Cut section showed multiple cysts in endocervix and a myometrial fibroid in the fundus measuring 4.6 cm x3.7 cm**\n\n【23】Figure 2： Ovarian mass shows cellular tumor comprised of pleomorphic epithelial cells arranged in complex glandular & solid sheet pattern (H&E x100).\n\n【24】**Figure 3： Ovarian mass shows irregular glands lined by hyperchromatic， enlarged nuclei， clumped chromatin， prominent nucleoli， scanty cytoplasm(H&Ex400).**\n\n【25】**Figure 4： Skin lesion， shows squamous epithelial lining with sub epithelial nodular proliferation of basaloid cells (H&Ex100).**\n\n【26】**x 5 cm cream colored with whorled appearance. The tumor had multiple cystic areas， few hemorrhagic， few mucinous and solid areas with small necrotic focus. The fibro fatty tissue covered with skin on one surface measured 5 cm x 4.5 cm x 2 cm. Skin showed area of ulceration measuring 2.5 cm ×1.5 cm. Histopathology report showed poorly differentiated Endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the ovary with large areas of solid growth (>50%)， abundant mitotic figures(4-7/HPF) and large areas of ischemic necrosis. Capsule was intact**\n\n【27】**Figure 5： Skin lesion， shows nests of uniform basaloid epithelial cells with focal nuclear avercrowding， mild nuclear atypia & artificial cleft retraction(H&Ex400).**\n\n【28】**. Omental tissue was not involved by the tumor. The right tube showed presence of mild intraepithelial atypia with no tumor involvement. The other ovary and tube showed normal histology. Uterus showed non secretory glands with simple cystic hyperplasia and a benign leiomyoma. The lymph nodes were free of tumor. The skin biopsy report was superficially spreading Invasive basal cell carcinoma. Depth of invasion was 0.3 mm (only superficial dermis). The margins were free and no lymphovascular emboli was found. She received six cycles of Chemotherapy (Carboplatin， Paclitaxel). CT abdomen & pelvis was normal. She was on regular follow up for 2 years but was lost to follow up after that.**\n\n【29】**Discussion**\n\n【30】**The probability of second primary cancer after primary breast cancer diagnosis was studied in Israeli women from 1992 to 2006. Barbara G Silverman concluded that the probability of second malignancy was 3.6% within 5 years， 8.2% within 10 years and 13.9%within 15 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Women younger than 50 years of age at initial diagnosis were at greater risk than those above 50. Significantly increased risks of colorectal， uterine， lung， ovarian， thyroid cancers were noted along with leukemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【31】**In our case， the patient was 68 yrs old during breast cancer diagnosis. Though her probability for second primary cancer was low， she had both ovarian and skin cancers. Ovarian endometrial adenocarcinoma coexists with endometriosis in 15% cases and may have synchronous endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma. In our case there was no endometrial involvement. One-sided ovary was involved and there was no ascites. The cancer was stage 1 A according to FIGO staging classification 2014. After debulking surgery， she received chemotherapy. There was a skin lesion showing superficially spreading basal cell carcinoma. The association between ovarian and skin is not well understood. Catharina C van Niekerk et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> using the Dutch nationwide pathology database concluded that patients with epithelial ovarian malignancies showed an increased risk of skin cancer. There are studies which show that there is a risk of subsequent cancer after diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma. Patients with basal cell carcinoma have an increased risk for non-cutaneous cancer like breast cancer， non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and testicular cancer通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Also increase in cancers of salivary gland， lip， small intestine， nose and pharynx was observed in Finland study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Breast cancer survivors tend to be more intensive users of medical services than other women their age. Specialist and primary care providers must take advantage of this continued contact to educate patients about their risk for second cancers and implement appropriate preventive and screening procedures tailored to their patients'individual risks.

Presented here is a case of a twelve year old girl with idiopathic bilateral CSCR that underwent spontaneous resolution within three months with a return to 6/5 vision. Various treatments have been described for CSCR in adults but due to the rarity of cases in children the management remains largely anecdotal. Simple observation in the first few months appears to be the most appropriate.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Central serous chorioretinopathy； Paediatric； Bilateral**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 12 year old girl presented to the Eye Casualty department after referral from her optician. The girl had been complaining of bilateral visual blurring for a week. The optician noted raised maculae bilaterally. At presentation visual acuity was 6/60 OD and 6/18 OS uncorrected and 6/18bilaterally with pin hole correction. Anterior segment and intraocular pressure examination were normal with quiet anterior chambers. Pupillary reactions were normal. On fundus examination there was a marked elevation of the macula on the right with a less extensive elevation on the left. OCT examination confirmed serous neurosensory retinal detachment bilaterally of approximately two disc diameters in the right eye and 300um in the left eye . Fundus fluoresceinand Indocyanine Green angiography did not show any active leaking in either eye .**\n\n【17】**The patient had no medical history and was systemically well. She was not using any medication and a focussed psychiatric history revealed not mental health issues. Her blood work including full blood count， renal function and electrolytes， CRP， ESRand morning cortisol level were all normal.**\n\n【18】**At her three week review in clinic her vision had already improved to 6/9 OD 6/12 OS with an improvement on OCT in subretinal fluid in the right eye but slight worsening in the left. She**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： Fundus photo (A)， OCT(B) and retinal thickness map (C) of right and left eyes at presentation showing extensive serous retinal detachment in the right eye and a smaller detachment in the left eye.**\n\n【20】**_cited._**\n\n【21】**No significant leak abserved.**\n\n【22】**Figure 3： Left eye angiography showing red free (A)， early (B) and late (C) Fluorescein angiography and early (D) and late (E) Indocyanine Green angiography. No significant leak abserved.**\n\n【23】**was reviewed again at three months and at this point had made a full recovery with vision 6/5 bilaterally corresponding to complete OCT subretinal fluid resolution . No therapy was administered during her follow up period.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is defined by the accumulation of subretinal fluid with detachment ofthe neurosensory retina. Most cases are self limiting but there is a recognised chronic， recurrent form that results in decreased visual acuity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Men are much more likelyto be affected by CSCR than women with the average age of onset of 41 years. The exact aetiology of the disease remains to be elucidated but risk factors other than male sex include Type A personalities， mental stress， the use of corticosteroids， pregnancy， Cushing's disease or steroid producing tumours \\[2，3\\].**\n\n【26】**There have been previous reports of CSCR in children and young adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-7\\]</u>. We present here the first reported case of bilateral idiopathic CSCR in a pre-pubertal girl. The youngest case of CSCR was reported by Fine et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> at 7 years old； however this was in the context of focal choroiditis.**\n\n【27】**The reported cases of CSCR in children appear to resolve spontaneously. Kim et al. described a case of a 12 year old boy with unilateral idiopathic CSCR who initially improved spontaneously at his 2 month review from 0.5 LogMAR to 0.8， but then had a deterioration at which pointhe was treated with a single Bevacizumab injection with visual acuity returning to 1.0 LogMAR at 18 months. The authors however， admit that it would be impossible to tell how much of the improvement could be ascribed to the anti-VEGF therapy.**\n\n【28】**Most cases of CSCR resolve spontaneously within three months通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， as seen in this case. Current treatment approaches include simple observation， focal laser， photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin， intravitreal anti-VEGF and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as Spironolactone or Eplerenone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Chung et al. concluded in a meta-analysis that there was no clear positive effect of intravitrealanti-VEGF dueto thelack oflargerandomisedcontroltrials and significant heterogeneity between studies examining the relative efficacy of intravitreal Bevacizumab with short follow up periods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The efficacy of PDT has been analysed against Ranibizumab in a small randomised trial of 34 eyes in which the investigators found that there**\n\n【29】Figure 4： Fundus photo (A)， OCT (B) and retinal thickness map (C) of right and left eyes at 3 months follow up showing complete resolution.\n\n【30】**were significant short term improvements in the PDT group over the Ranibizumab group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Central retinal thickness was significantly improved in the PDT group up to month 6 at which point they tailed off and were not significantly different to the Ranibizumab group. There were more modest improvements in visual acuity which were not significantly different.**\n\n【31】**It would appear that cases of CSCR in children follow a similar course to that described in adults and the most appropriate initial treatment is watchful waiting. Should the disease take a more chronic or recurrent form after three months the evidence points slightly in the favour of PDT as the next line of management， and most likely better tolerated by children.**\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Histological investigation has revealed that it becomes integrated into the aortic adventitia thus providing additional strength. This procedure has been performed in 325patients worldwide. Our centers established a PEARS program in 2016 and have undertaken 14cases to date. We report an iatrogenic aortic dissection at the right coronary ostium in case 9 in our series in a patient with Elhers Danlos. We herein report this case to assist other centers considering PEARS and to disclose the important learning points encountered through our experience.**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Personalized External Aortic Root Support (PEARS) is a novel technique designed to prevent aneurysmal dilation and subsequent dissection of the root and ascending aorta in patients with connective tissue disorders. A3D printed model ofthe patients aorticroot is created from Computed Tomography (CT)images and an individualized polyethylene terephthalate mesh sleeve constructed to intimately fit the patient’s aortic contours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The size can be individually specified and as a default， 100% and 95% stents are supplied for each patient. Performed via a median sternotomy， the PEARS is placed around the aortic root and ascending aorta after off-pump dissection of the aortic root down to the valve annulus and underneath the coronary arteries with two defects to accommodate the coronary ostia and preserve flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is reconstituted by a combination of continuous and interrupted sutures with typically 4/0 Ethibond (Ethicon). Animal studies suggest the mesh subsequently incorporates into the aortic wall to both thicken it and prevent any further aneurysmal change 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Compared with the traditional treatment； aortic root replacement， proposed benefits of PEARS include avoidance of lifelong anticoagulation in the case of a mechanical aortic valve implantation or fear of failure with valve conserving surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The majority of PEARS to date have been carried out on patients with Marfan syndrome and a paucity of data regarding other connective tissue disorders exists 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【14】**Case Presentation**\n\n【15】**A 34-year-oldfemale with Loeys Dietz Syndrome (LDS) SMAD3 variant was referred for PEARS. She had a family history of sudden death in two young relatives two generations removed. Her daughter was found to carry the same genetic variant. Clinical examination demonstrated tall stature， bifid uvula， arachnodactyly and skin striae. Cardiac gated Computed Tomography(CT) of the aorta demonstrated aortic root dilation， 4.5 cm with normal coronary anatomy and a right dominant circulation . The patient was counseled regarding operative options including valve sparing root replacement， a Bentall and a PEARS and chose to undergo PEARS. The procedure was performed via using the 100% pears graft. Sternal closure resulted in ST changes in the inferior leads and hypotension. The sternum was reopened and a series of radial cuts in the Right Coronary Artery (RCA) orifice made to ensure no compression was occurring. A small bleb-like hematoma was noted to arise from the anterior aspect of the proximal RCA at this time. The patient entered ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest requiring cardioversion three times then stabilized. Closure was achieved and she was transferred to intensive care in a stable condition. CT on day one post-surgery demonstrated a small pseudoaneurysm close to the ostium of the RCA. The patient was recovering well and planned for discharge home when a further CT was**\n\n【16】**Figure 1：CTthoracic aorta pre-operatively demonstrating isolated aortic root dilation measuring 4.8 cm.**\n\n【17】**a right coronary artery pseudoaneurysm. Left main stem is widely patent.**\n\n【18】**Figure 3： Significant pericardial effusion， small pseudaaneurysm at the arigin of the RCA， moderate narrowing of the ostium is shown and represents and increases in size.**\n\n【19】**performed on day six which demonstrated a significant pericardial effusion and pseudoaneurysm of the right coronary measuring 3 cm x3 cm .**\n\n【20】**Urgent reoperation was undertaken. A large amount of blood was drained from the pericardial cavity. Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted and following cross-clamp and arrest a localized dissection identified at the site of concern on the RCA . The RCA was divided from the aorta and a pericardial patch applied with double layer 4-0 and 5-0 proline sutures used to cover the ostial defect. A section of the unused 95% PEARS graft was then taken to patch the defect in the original PEARS graft. Right Internal Mammary Artery**\n\n【21】**Figure 4： Ascending aorta at the time of emergency reoperation， the PEARS graft is shown and the disrupted RCA at the level of the ostium is shown.**\n\n【22】**(RIMA) was harvested and anastomosed to the mid RCA using 7-0proline. The patient weaned from bypass without difficulty and made an uncomplicated recovery. She represented three weeks post-surgery with chest wall pain and was investigated. Cardiac investigations were normal and a further CT confirmed the RIMA-RCA graft was patent. She remains well on most recent follow up at one year.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**PEARS are a novel procedure and experience in patients with connective tissue diseases affecting the aortic root other than Marfan syndrome is limited. One previously documented PEARS case had a ventricular fibrillation arrest in intensive care and the emergency team released the closing sutures thus allowing restoration of output通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Coronary complications are recognized with PEARS but this case is the first reported localized aortic dissection. As a result， there is a number of learning points the authors feel are of value.**\n\n【25】**Firstly， the case confirms existing knowledge regarding tissue integrity in LDS is fragile and represents an aggressive and problematic issue peri-operatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. LDS is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder characterized by aortic aneurysm， arterial tortuosity， hypertelorism and bifid uvula/cleft palate. The TGF-B super family mediates normal cellular growth and development. Derangement in LDS results in elastin disarray， loss of elastic fiber architecture and increased collagen expression in the arterial wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Significant consideration was given at the time of surgery to suture repair of the small hematoma arising from the right coronary artery. On balance it was felt this would likely result in further problems as there was no active bleeding from the site at that time. A case report describing a right coronary artery dehiscence and resultant pseudo-aneurysm arising in a patient with two successive aortic root replacements first for root enlargement and then for left coronary pseudo-aneurysm and dehiscence has been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This confirms the tissue fragility and proclivity for dissection and aneurysmal change in LDS. We made every reasonable effort to avoid applying the aortic cross clamp but ultimately felt this was unavoidable and did so with a larger broader clamp than usual. We elected to carry out a RIMA to RCA graft with closure of the RCA ostium by patching the aorta with autologous pericardium supported by a patch of PEARS as it was not felt possible to preserve the native vessel due to the degree of damage to the coronary arterial wall.**\n\n【26】**Authors suggest that the index of suspicion of coronary issues must be high in patients with connective tissue disorders undergoing PEARS especially in the setting of cardiac arrhythmia post procedure. The decision to undertake the second CT scan was based purely on**\n\n【27】**suspicion as opposed to anyclearclinical indication. These patients are typically young and will have significant capacity for hemodynamic compensation in the context of a significant pericardial effusion. The patient was preparing for discharge and had in no way demonstrated clinical symptoms resultant from her pericardial hematoma and coronary disruption. There are currently no guideline documents pertaining to follow up imaging in the PEARS cohort， which is an issue that should be addressed going forward.**\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

It has a bimodal incidence with the congenital form commonly seen in boys about 2 years old； and the adult form in postmenopausal women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The MCN definition was initially proposed in 1951 and later subdivided into cystic nephroma and partially differentiated cystic nephroma depending on the presence or absence of blastemal element， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【13】**There are at least 20 denominations that include multilocular cystic renal tumor， polycystic nephroblastoma， solitary multilocular cyst， renal cystadenoma and cystic nephroma \\[1，2\\]. Most patients are asymptomatic and the tumor is commonly diagnosed incidentally. For decades the standard treatment has been Radical Nephrectomy (RN). We report a case of MCN treated by laparoscopic Nephron Sparing Surgery (NSS). Clinical， radiographic， pathological and surgical aspects will be discussed.**\n\n【14】**Case Presentation**\n\n【15】**A 61-year-old woman， asymptomatic， performed a routinely ultrasound scan that revealed a complex renal cyst localized in the right kidney. A subsequent CT scan demonstrated a complex cystic tumor in the lower pole of the right kidney， well defined， with smooth walls， with several internal septa， some thick and with a slight contrast enhancement classified as a lesion Bosniak III. No further abdominallesion or lymphadenopathy was identified.**\n\n【16】**Based on these findings， a right laparoscopic heminephrectomy was realized. Surgery was performed with the placement of two 5 mm and one 10 mm trocars， dissection of the renal vascular pedicle with placement of a laparoscopic vascular clamp (bulldog) in the renal segmental artery to permit dissection of the cystic mass safely with a small margin of renal parenchyma . The mass was completely resected using cold scissors，and reconstruction was done closuring with running suture anchored by Hem-o-lock clips. The vascular clamp was removed totalizing a warm ischemia time of 14 minutes. With 24 months of follow-up， the patient is with no signs of recurrence**\n\n【17】Figure 1A： CT scan shows an extensive multicystic mass.\n\n【18】**Figure 1B： CT scan shows an extensive multicystic mass.**\n\n【19】**Figure 2A： Inferior renal pole containing the tumor.**\n\n【20】**and normal renal function.**\n\n【21】**Macroscopically， the cystic nephrons commonly present as expansive masses， well demarcated from the non-neoplastic renal parenchyma， with a thick fibrous pseudo-capsule. The tumor is completely cystic， with no solid component. The cysts contain clear or hemorrhagic fluid， often biochemically similar to the serum. The septa are thin， translucent and uniform . Microscopically， cystic nephroma presents cysts coated by a layer ofhobnail， cuboidal or flat epithelium. Mitotic figures are very rare or absent. The stromal septa consist of fibrous tissue， ranging from collagenous to myxoid， eventually presenting a similar appearance to the ovarian stroma**\n\n【22】**通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**MCN is a rare benign tumor of the kidney， with a bimodal peak of incidence， between 2 and 4 years of age (73% are boys) and between the fourth and sixth decade. Predominating in women in the 1：8 ratio \\[2，4，7\\]. Most cases are asymptomatic and are found incidentally in routine radiological exams by pathology or as palpable abdominal mass in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In 1989 Joshi and Beckwith 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> indicated pathology diagnostic criteria： 1. tumor composed entirely of cysts and septa； 2. mass well delimited； 3. septa are the only solid components without nodular areas； 4. cysts coated by flat or cuboidal epithelium； and 5. septa with fibrous tissue， with well differentiated tubules present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. MCN cells are positive for various markers of distal tubule and collecting duct (CK19， EMA， CK AE1/AE3) and proximal tubule (alpha-1 antitrypsin， lysosin， CD10， CD15). These immunohistochemical findings suggest tubular differentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【25】**The pathogenesis is unknown， but defects in development and even neoplastic origin are suggested \\[2，4\\]. Despite presenting diverse biological behavior， the infant and adult subtypes have similar histomorphology characteristics. As the tumor is similar to ovarian stroma， the presence of mullerian-like stromal cells in the kidney is possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Hormonal theory has been suggested since it is highly prevalent in women and tumor stroma is positive for estrogen and progesterone and some of the male patients with MCN were in therapy for prostate cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【26】**The diagnosis is usually incidental， but there may be non-specific symptoms such as abdominal discomfort， hematuria， or urinary tract infections. Most are found incidentally in Ultrasound exams or CT scans performed by routine or other cause， and the average size at diagnosis is 10 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The differential diagnosis in adults includes polycystic kidney， nephroblastoma，hydronephrotic kidney and cystic renal cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. There is no specific radiological method and it is not possible to exclude malignancy in the preoperative evaluation， surgery is necessary for diagnosis and treatment.**\n\n【27】**The treatment indicated usually is Radical Nephrectomy (NR)， without chemo or radiotherapy \\[1，12，13\\]， however NSS may be an option depending on the size and location of the lesion \\[1，2，4\\].

Patients suffering from weight loss have reduced ability to complete the prescribed treatment， reduced quality of life， and reduced survival. Optimizing nutrition intake during cancer in order to achieve weight maintenance is difficult and requires individual timely nutritional therapy. The aim of this multi method development study was to create a decision support tool which would prevent weight loss in cancer patients by supporting nutrition intake and containing relevant information to support patients as well as professionals on nutritional aspects throughout the course oftreatment including rehabilitation.**\n\n【14】**Methods： An APP for decision support was developed with patient and professional involvement. Descriptive data were collected for the evaluation of efficacy as weight development and semi structured qualitative interviews with patients and professionals individually. Interviews were analyzed by qualitative content analysis.**\n\n【15】**Results： Patients maintained weight. Nutrition intake was supported in 42 patient's home by the tool. When intake was decreasing， a quick and efficient collaboration between patients and professionals made sure the right nutritional therapy decision was made and implemented. Patients and professionals were very satisfied with the system.**\n\n【16】**Conclusion： The decision support tool for nutritional therapy between patients with cancer and professionals was efficient and well liked. Patients were compliant and maintained weight and oral intake to a high extent. When oral nutrition intake decreased， a fast decision was initiated.**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Malnutrition is a common and serious problem in patients with cancer， as between 15% to 80%of all patients experience significant weight loss during disease and treatment. The consequences of weight loss are muscle loss and impaired functioning， impaired immune system inducing infections， as well as psychological consequences， including depression， isolation and reduced quality of life通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Patients suffering from weight loss have reduced ability to complete the prescribed treatment. In radiation therapy and chemotherapy， it has been shown that poor nutrition conditions often lead to postponement or discontinuation of treatment， thus reducing the strategic effect of treatment.**\n\n【19】**Poor nutritional status specifically contributes to poor outcomes. From literature， we know that even a smaller weight loss has significant consequences for the patients treatment efficiency， and the larger weight loss， especially the loss of muscle mass， the higher risk to survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-7\\]</u>. Nutrition intervention and individual follow up has shown to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes in short and long term \\[8，9\\]. However， early intervention， individual patient involvement and thus compliance， treatment of nutrition impact factors and interdisciplinary collaboration， seem to be crucial in order to achieve success \\[1，3，10，11\\]. It is therefore crucial that an individually adapted nutrition course is initiated at a very early stage. Likewise， it is important that attention to the patient's nutritional state and the changing alternate need for nutrition therapy is continued throughout the entire course oftreatment as well as followed up during rehabilitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Equally it is shown that nutrition and exercise are considerably coherent factors， and that patients who often cease to be physically inactive in order to save their strength，have greater muscle loss， and thus also harder to exploit the nutrition consumed efficiently \\[4，5，12\\].**\n\n【20】**By counseling patients to eat the adequate and proper diet and inverting medical nutrition therapy in due time， as well as maintaining strength and activity， one may contribute to reduce**\n\n【21】**the number and severity of complications， as well as shorten the disease and rehabilitation process. However， studies have shown that practices regarding nutritional advice and therapy during the course of cancer are insufficient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【22】**People suffering from cancer and disease-related malnutrition may need to change their perception of food and their food culture in order to be able to eat sufficiently during a disease that affects the desire and ability to eat. For example， patients with cancer and disease-related malnutrition may normally aim to live a healthy life in order to prevent type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular problems， just as other people ought to do when healthy. Patients may therefore have to override the food and health perception and experience of proper healthy eating habits they have acquired， in order to fulfill nutritional requirements， when the ability to eat is lacking.**\n\n【23】**Decision Support Aids (DSA) are tools designed to present treatment choices based on the best evidence for patients， by stating the decision， describing the options， and helping people evaluate options from a personal point of view， thereby increasing the quality of the patients decision without undermining the patient’s preferences. In addition， a DSA can help health professionals in informing， structuring and involving patients in decisions. A decision support tool for cancer patients with weight loss， used by patients themselves and by the patient in collaboration with professionals throughout the course of the cancer may be able to qualify patients and professionals into the best possible dialogue on nutrition and nutrition therapy throughout the cancer course. A decision support tool for nutrition designed for cancer patients with weight loss may help the patient to pay attention to and monitor dietary intake， weight and other symptoms.**\n\n【24】**The aim of this multi method development study was to create a decision support tool which would prevent weight loss in cancer patients by supporting nutrition intake and containing relevant information to support patients as well as professionals on nutritional aspects throughout the course of treatment. Furthermore， to provide informed dialogue between patient and professionals based on patient preferences， observations and monitoring， as well as launching correct efforts and recommendations for nutritional interventions in case of impairment.**\n\n【25】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【26】**The purpose of the Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) study was to develop and implement a tool to help cancer patients with weight loss， making informed decisions about relevant nutrition therapy， in dialogue with health professionals throughout the course of treatment， from first medical visits to completed rehabilitation. Together with nine patients， eight nurses/three physicians a team of IT-technicians and the research team (authors)， we developed anAPP for use by patients as a single system on tablet or smart phone. The APP was developed in an iterative process in three phases， starting with analysis of needs and experience which built the basis for the development， and allowing patients and staff to test and influence the process along the way.**\n\n【27】**The APP included**\n\n【28】**A food and dietary registration module to be used by patients at home and which provides instructions to the patient about the correct individually calculated dietary intake and what the patient can eat to improve dietary intake， as monitoring and guidance to the patient. Requirements were set based on the scale of Harris-Benedict**\n\n【29】**equation. Protein requirements were calculated in the program as 1.3g/kg/day. An arrow shows how close the patient is to the aim of the day. Suggestions are provided for achieving the goal. Far from goal shows a red arrow， which turns yellow and then green when goal is near or achieved，also including a numbered percentage.**\n\n【30】**A weight-registering module， which is also used in the calculation of individual requirements for energy and protein. Red to green relates to goals.**\n\n【31】**A nutrition impact symptom module， where patients score nausea， constipation， mouth sores， early satiety，pain，depression， and fatigue. Red to green 通用删除7(英):<u>(1-10)</u> relates to worst thinkable or no problems.**\n\n【32】**A physical activity module encouraging physical activity and training by the APP， and patients monitor the activity undertaken in four different phases and how much time they spend during the day.**\n\n【33】**On the above， patients send information to professionals they chose to include. Patients are encouraged to do this on the day before hospital visit and/ or twice weekly. The patient connects his or her healthcare professionals (either individual or teams) including nurses， oncologists/physicians， dieticians， with a single click and these can afterwards follow the patient’s entries and thus orientate themselves in the patient's nutritional state， dietary intake， discomfort and activity level continuously and be prepared for the meeting with the patient. For professionals we developed a website to gather patient information as listed below. Professionals should prepare themselves for the meeting with the patient， with the information provided， in order to give individual and informed advice on therapy actions and support interaction on decisions.**\n\n【34】**In the information library module， the patient finds explanations and reliefsuggestions-housing advice，as well as information about the importance of not losing weight during treatment and maintaining physical activity. Similarly， the patient in layman's language finds information about treatment options for weight loss.**\n\n【35】**We called the APP “NutriDia” reflecting nutrition dialogue between patients and professionals.**\n\n【36】**Data were collected for the evaluation of results as weight development and semi structuredqualitative interviews with patients and professionals individually. Interviews were analyzed by qualitative content analysis \\[131.**\n\n【37】**Ethical considerations**\n\n【38】**The patients signed informed consent prior to participation. The Ethical Committee of Region North Jutland， Denmark had no objections to the study.**\n\n【39】**Results and Discussion**\n\n【40】**We aimed toprimarilyinclude patients with head and neckcancer as well as gastro intestinal cancer. This was due to the assumption that these patients would be moreover able to represent all nutritional challenges. Two other cancer patients were included，as theyhad heard ofthe APP from their treatment team， who found they would benefit from inclusion. Overall 101 patients were consecutively screened for， and 51 patients agreed to participation. Of these， nine patients were solely included in the development process， and 42 patients were included in the intervention period. The decision support tool was used by patients and the health professionals throughout the patient’s treatment course，based on Aalborg University Hospital. Departments involved were the Oncology treatment Departments， including**\n\n【41】**radiation therapy， chemotherapy and surgery. Furthermore， patients used the system with other health professionals during their cancer course， including in conjunction with clinicians in the rehabilitation centers， and in general practitioners. One patient used it in another hospital due to transferrable to another Department of Oncology who took good care of patient and equipment， and found it valuable and easy to follow.**\n\n【42】Figure 1 shows the front page of the patient's APP.\n\n【43】Demographic information for patients who used the tool during their therapy after implementation ofthe final tool is shown in Table _1_\n\n【44】**The 50 patients considered potential candidates for NutriDia， but who ended up not participating were overall characterized with lack of profit for additional information， lack of compliance， lack of IT capabilities， and poor general condition. Of these 14 were included but chose and were supported to drop out after a few days.**\n\n【45】**The included patients were to a far extent able to maintain weight， as sixteen patients' maintained weight throughout the five months intervention period and the fourteen who lost weight lost remarkably little. Furthermore twelve patients slightly gained weight during the period. More than this，some patient lost or gained slightly for a couple of days， but managed to restitute within the course of treatment. Weight development is shown in Table 2.**\n\n【46】**Nutrition intake was noted for all patients， and was on average sufficient for the individual for the overall group. Thirteen patients who had an average lower average oral intake of minus 356 kcal/day (40 kcal to 1020 kcal) were supplemented with either enteral or parenteral nutrition. Eighteen patients had an increased intake of 275kcal/day (30 kcal to 557 kcal).**\n\n【47】**Qualitative interview findings**\n\n【48】**NutriDia provides patients and health professionals with a sound basis for common nutrition related decision-making， based on the following features：**\n\n【49】**Table 1： Demographic information for participants using NutriDia during the interyention.**\n\n| **Demography N=42**  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Gender (men)， n(%)**  | **28 (66.0%)**  |\n| **Age， Mean years (SD)**  | **58(11.2)**  |\n| **BMI， Mean (SD)**  | **25.5(2.7)**  |\n| **Disease Location**  |  |\n| **Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer (cardia， pancreas， oesophagus，** **ventriculi)**  | **14**  |\n| **Lower Gastrointestinal Cancer (Colon， Rectum)**  | **10**  |\n| **Head/Neck and Tongue**  | **16**  |\n| **Others**  | **2**  |\n\n【51】**Table 2： Weight development from start to end of the use of NutriDia.**\n\n| **Weight balance N=42**  | **Number of patients**  | **Mean difference Kg (SD)**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Maintain**  | **16**  | **0通用删除7(英):<u>(0)</u>**  |\n| **Weightloss**  | **14**  | **1.08(2.3)**  |\n| **Weight increase**  | **12**  | **0.55(1.14)**  |\n\n【53】**The patients were very eager to monitor ingested meals， weight， symptoms/discomfort and activity level in. In addition， the patients found they enhanced knowledge about nutrition and nutritional therapy options， reasons for discomforts and how to find relief for these.**\n\n【54】**Patients describe the tool as contributing to structure， control and overview， and to improve their ability to optimize daily intake of energy and protein. Patients always followed the scale of the app's cover page， which illustrates how much the individual was missing out of his needs.**\n\n【55】**The decision support tool has helped prevent further weight loss in patients of which a few hadlost weight before the start ofthe cancer treatment course. This may be explained by the motivational factor highlighted by the participating patients， especially regarding the knowledge of and interest in their nutrition and dietary challenges， which they felt helped them to realize questions they had for the professionals and to find good solutions together with the staff.**\n\n【56】**The results show broad satisfaction with the simple and clear design in the decision support tool， highlighting the colors including the traffic light system. The color codes where the patient achieves“yellow\" at acceptable energy intake and \"green days\" at target achievement was described as being crucial to the patient’s focus on eating sufficiently， as well as continued the feeling of profit and want to monitor almost daily. The color codes thus support the motivation to eat， which all patients express. Patients express that NutriDia has led to increased knowledge of the nutritional content of food， especially in terms of protein and calorie content. Particular attention was paid to protein intake-since patients found the APP gave them the opportunity to follow their protein target and teach them which foods contain a lot of protein. Many patients referred to increased knowledge as they thought protein density was only found in meat and dairy products， which didn\\`t necessarily taste well for the time being. In addition， patients point out that NutriDia is a good tool for adjusting the intake of calories and proteins and that the app has helped to give them an overview of their weight. Finally， several patients are satisfied that NutriDia suggests what food the patient could add to the diet， and that this may be motivating for patients to try out food that they have not tried so far. As one patient said：**\n\n【57】**\"I actually had no sense of the whole idea of calories and protein. Have never ever needed it before. I have only eaten when I was hungry. Now I have learned what I need. And it works really well that you can see how much you ve got and how much you need. The nurse praised me this morning， because she could see that I was doing well. And you also like to be praised. I get these ideas (push messages，ed.) to what I can eat in the evening. Ice and so on. Ilike this feature\".**\n\n【58】**Patients expressed the feeling that they were contributing to the treatment and that the professionals were well-prepared for their meetings with regard to the side effects of cancer treatment and nutritional problems. This reinforces one of the goals in NutriDia； to increase patient involvement in the course of treatment. Patients experienced great satisfaction by actively engaging in the otherwise powerless situation that accompanies cancer diagnosis，including loss of power and desire to eat.**\n\n【59】**The patient information library contributed to the informative goal of the tool， where patients became more aware of their own side effects， but also about relief suggestions.**\n\n【60】**Severalpatients emphasize that NutriDia's functioniss are supportive in relation to the dialogue the patient has with the professionals， including doctors， nurses and dieticians. The registered entries in the app acted as a starting point-for the dialogues and consultations the patients had with the professionals. Several patients described feeling confident in knowing that the professionals could follow the entries the patients made at home. In addition， several patients expressed that the professionals made use of the inputs that patients had entered into NutriDia by starting from the specific issues entered， for example regarding fluctuating weight， nausea， side effects of treatment i.e.， One patient refers： \"They encourage me now that it is time for me to do something about these nutritional supplements and such things.“Now you ve lost a bit， so now you have to go ahead and try it.**\n\n【61】**Only one patient found that her entries were not used with the Oncologist， and that the Oncologist showed less than no interest towards nutrition or her losing weight. Se however had help from the nuirses.**\n\n【62】**Main results from interviews with professionals**\n\n【63】**Professionals found that NutriDia motivates more patients to consume the required amount of calories and proteins as well as their weight. In addition， they found that the app gives patients a feeling of self-control， which many patients can enjoy in a situation where may feel out of control.**\n\n【64】**\"I find we catch them earlier because they themselves get into the weight curve. So I think it becomes very visual for them (patients)， how fast it can go and then they do not get the huge weight loss\"(Nurse， Radiation Therapy).**\n\n【65】**\"I also think that once they’ve got the APP， they are much more aware of getting up to the full dose\" (Nurse， Radiation Therapy).**\n\n【66】\"I'veheard patients say they get a pop-up reminder， “you're behind goals\". It is a big help for many of them\" (Dietitian， Oncological Day Care)\n\n【67】**Doctors， Nurses and Dieticians use data from NutriDia as a basis for dialogue with patients. In addition to facilitating dialogue， more professionals use data from NutriDia to qualify focus in each conversation，both before and during the consultation.**\n\n【68】**\"We talked out of NutriDia， where I could see that the patient met her need for protein and energy， and she had actually taken two of the kilos she has lost\"(Dietician).**\n\n【69】**“It’s a good tool before consulting to see what’s really going on and how she is taking the oncology treatment (Doctor).**\n\n【70】NutriDia makes it easy to involve the patient actively when a common goal is to be set.\n\n【71】**\"I like it because we can look at the entries together and agree that this is the time to act on this or that-it is more like we are in it together. For instance the patient I talked too yesterday， who was less reluctant to tube placement， than I would have expected\" (Oncologist).**\n\n【72】**All in formants agree that NutriDia gave them a quick overview of their patients in the morning. The nurses in the radiation therapy used NutriDia to get an overview of the patients who came to treatment that day when they met in the morning：**\n\n【73】**\"I go in and look in the morning and see； How are the different patients I have today， how is their weight coming along?(Nurse， Radiation Therapy)**\n\n【74】**It's quick to get an overview of who's in bad shape-， the weight goes down and nausea rises， so I’m prepared for the patients-while there may be nothing with some of the other patients. So it gives me that fast-paced overview\" (Nurse， Radiation Therapist).**\n\n【75】**Primary sector： NutriDia was well received in the primary sector including rehabilitation， and was predominantly used by dieticians who found it of great relevance. In rehabilitation there is most often more time for the individual patient， and NutriDia rapidly gained a significant role in the contact between the patient and the healthcare professional. In addition， it was described by professionals that NutriDia in a new way allowed for a slightly better hand in hand\"with the patients between appointments. NutriDia in rehabilitation was often used to assist with the withdrawal from enteral nutrition and nutritional supplements， when the patient monitored increasing weight and better intake.**\n\n【76】**Overall， NutriDia was well received and lived up to expectations. The only draw-back was the lack of integration into the electronic patient journals， which was not included in the project due to data safety.**\n\n【77】**In this PPI multi method development study， we included no group for comparison. Following， we are not able to say if the results achieving weight as well as protein/energy intake maintenance may have also been possible with other means and methods. Meanwhile， the development rose out of patient and professional experiences and perspectives， adding to the relevance of the actual intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Furthermore， the tool gave room for an active and very individualized approach to nutritional therapy， which has earlier been shown efficient by other methods \\[5，15\\]. This study supports the finding of the Cochrane review， which found that people exposed to decision aids feel more knowledgeable， better informed， clearer about their values， and with a more active role in decision making 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.**\n\n【78】**Supported by NutriDia， patients were able to maintain weight and thus that were give improved conditions for going through oncology treatment without complications related to nutritional risk\\[4，5，12，15，17\\]. NutriDia well managed to engage patients in their own nutritional route and therapy， and promoting shared decision making between professionals and patients. This and the ability of**\n\n【79】**NutriDia to interact in patients lived daily lives may be an important link to enhancing better compliance to nutritional therapy.**\n\n【80】**Conclusion**\n\n【81】**The NutriDia decision support tool， which was built with patients and health professionals， prevented weight loss in 42 Head and Neck and GI cancer patients. Its features including monitoring of nutrition intake and nutrition impact symptoms， motivation and information facilities， supported nutrition intake and provided a sound basis for patients and their health professionals in the dialogue on nutritional therapy， throughout the course of treatment.**\n\n【82】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【83】**The authors would like to thank patients， professionals and the development team for their valuable contributions throughout the developmentand intervention process.

We present here a case of a young woman with a diagnosis of SLE and chronic pain syndrome that progressed to septic shock within hours of presenting to the Emergency Department. It has been emphasized in that the key to treatment of septic shock is early， almost immediate recognition and the institution of aggressive fluid resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic treatment.

If the joint infection leads to sepsis it can cause substantial mortality， especially in cases involving immune-compromised patients \\[4，5\\]， unusual organisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-10\\]</u>， and delay of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The time frame commonly cited for necessary intervention， however， within the first 48 h， is on a different order than that routinely emphasized for other instances of sepsis. In sepsis the notion of a “golden hour\"has been found such that each single hour of delay worsens mortality from sepsis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The caveat of extreme time urgency most emphasized with other presentations of sepsis is not customarily part of the literature of septic joints.**\n\n【19】**Many times we view， in retrospect， that we have not managed a case as quickly and effectively as we might have liked.Often such reflection falls into the realm of straightforward quality assessment， material considered appropriate for the standard intradepartmental“mortality and morbidity rounds. There are times， however， when a clinician believes both that he and she might have handled a case more expeditiously and also that the case itself was interesting， unusual， confusing or unanticipated enough that it merits review in a broader forum. When the patient has ultimately done well， it is possible to share that learning opportunity more openly.**\n\n【20】We present here a case of a young woman with a diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosis(SLE)， End Stage Renal Disease on hemodialysis (ESRD)， and chronic joint pain that progressed into septic shock within hours of presenting to the Emergency Department. We were able to drawlessons from the rapidity of this patient’s deterioration that we believe can apply to all patients presenting with joint pain. We also draw lessons with regard to the care of patients who have indwelling venous catheterization，commenting both on the evaluation and use of such devices. Finally we make some\n\n【21】**comments regarding the care of patients in whom a suspicion exists of pain medication dependence. Primarily we observe that patients presenting with septic joints merit consideration for being treated in an analogous time frame with other patients who present with sepsis.**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**A 26 year old woman with a history of Systemic Lupus Erythematous (SLE) and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on dialysis， presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a complaint of leftknee pain. She had been in the ED the week before for joint pain at which time a diagnosis had been made of Deep Venous Thrombosis(DVT). A prior diagnosis had been recorded on the chart of“drug seeking behavior\"， and staff， familiar with the patient suspected her of having shown the same. The patient denied fever， chills， nausea， vomiting， chest pain or rash.**\n\n【24】**On examination initial vital signs showed a temperature of 98.9°F， pulse of 98 bpm， blood pressure 93/46 mmHg and respirations 20 per minute.**\n\n【25】**She was a well developed， well nourished， and chronically ill appearing female crying in pain. Examination of the head， ears， eyes， nose and throat， heart， lungs and abdomen and neurologic system were without abnormalities. A dialysis ‘permacath' catheter was in place in the chest， and not initially noted to appear infected， although the presence or absence of erythema， purulent discharge， swelling or tenderness was not specifically commented upon. Positive findings were confined to the musculoskeletal system which showed a swollen， tender left knee， not noted to be erythematous or hot， but which was very painful to any movement. Skin and neurologic examination was normal.**\n\n【26】**The patient was initially scheduled for a Complete Blood Count(CBC) and metabolic panel， X-ray of the knee and repeat venous Doppler of the lower extremities. She immediately asked for the proprietary name for an injection of intravenous hydromorphone. Owing to the prior diagnosis of chronic pain and her relationship with a pain consultant familiar with the patient， she was given an oral dose of hydromorphone while a pain management consultant familiar with the patient evaluated her， and recommended an injection of ketorolac and topical 4% lidocaine. The plan was made to obtain X-rays and then perform an arthrocentesis.**\n\n【27】**Initial blood results returned “Quantity Not Sufficient\"， and the patient refused several times to permit further attempts at intravenous access. As the patient does not urinate，X-raywas delayed by protocol for a serum BHCG， the repeat venous Doppler obtained first， and X-ray of the knee obtained and resulted three hours after presentation.**\n\n【28】**The X-ray showed a joint effusion. At that time the patient was seen by her nephrologist and her rheumatologist who， with ED resident staff， performed an arthrocentesis of the left knee and obtained cloudy opaque yellow fluid to be sent for cell count and culture. An orthopedist was contacted upon visualization of the specimen， who asked to be informed immediately when results of cell count and gram stain were available.**\n\n【29】**The patient was recommended for intravenous antibiotics. She was still “vocally refusingperipheral IV placement. Use of the hemodialysis catheter， not customarily use for non hemodialysis reasons， was not initially considered. The decision was made to attempt to sedate the patient with intramuscular ketamine to attempt**\n\n【30】**a central line. As the discussion was taking place， the patient was noted to appear increasingly ill， her vocal protestations against line placement appeared less focused， and her BP was found to drop to75 systolic. The diagnosis was made of sepsis with impending septic shock. After immediate consultation with the patient’s nephrologist the decision was then made to access the patient's dialysis port， to give fluid bolus and intravenous antibiotics.**\n\n【31】**Results of the body fluid analysis returned. The specimen contained 9700 White Blood Cells (WBC)， with a differential of82% PMNs， and 7000 red blood cells. Gram stain showed 1+ Gram positive cocci in clusters. An orthopedist was called with the results. The initial impression was that 9700 WBC was indeterminate and that contaminant bacteria in the cocci family can be found， but upon hearing that the clinical course of the patient was deteriorating an operating room time was set for one hour and the patient was prepared for immediate surgery.**\n\n【32】**As the clinical condition appeared to worsen， and surgery was imminent， the decision was made to intubate the patient. It was decided to institute vigorous fluid resuscitation and an infusion of norepinephrine was begun. The patient was escorted to the operating room where an incision and drainage of the knee with washout was performed， draining grossly purulent material. Shortly after surgery the laboratory values obtained during access of the central line were available and revealed WBC 0.5， Hgb 5.7， and platelets 28. The patient had been considering renal transplant and family were initially resistant to the idea of transfusion.**\n\n【33】**The patient remained intubated and on vasopressor support for the first day. Cultures were positive for MSSA from both blood and joint cultures. Suspecting the dialysis catheter to be a likely source of contamination the catheter was removed and cultured， and another later reinserted after several days of antibiotics. The family reconsidered their opposition to transfusion and two units of packed red blood cells were given. White blood count began to return to normal. Over the next few days then patient gradually could be weaned off pressure support and extubated.**\n\n【34】**Her clinical condition improved steadily， and she was transferred from the ICU to the floor. She had several dialysis sessions as an inpatient， had extensive evaluations regarding continued pain management， was ultimately discharged to rehabilitation and has subsequently done well.**\n\n【35】**Discussion**\n\n【36】**We believe that this case presents several management issues which merit review. As has been emphasized in a myriad ofliterature， the key to treatment of septic shock is early， almost immediate recognition and the institution of aggressive fluid resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic treatment 11-14.**\n\n【37】**Reviews of the common emergency presentation of a painful joint swelling identify the septic joint as the most threatening possibility among a wide differential diagnosis， and cite delayed identification and treatment as a major cause of morbidity， permanent joint destruction， as well as mortality with a case fatality rate cited as high as 11% to 16%\\[1，2\\]. Although the classic presentation is one of sudden onset of a single，hot， swollen， painful joint， which resists any movement， some patients will present with multiple joints and longer onset21.**\n\n【38】**One systematic review 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> of eighty better quality studies drawn**\n\n【39】**from thirty to fifty years of literature review found that： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the vast majority of cases were gram positive organisms， with greater than90% being staphylococci or streptococci； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> common risk factors include arthritis， either Rheumatoid or osteoarthritis， prosthetic joints， diabetes， cutaneous ulcers， prior joint instrumentation， and low socioeconomic status， alcohol or intravenous drug abuse；通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> more than a fifth of the cases presented as polyarthritis so that multiple joint presentation cannot be relied upon as suggestive of a more benign etiology； 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> a duration of symptoms is usually in the range of less than two weeks but may be longer with organisms of lower virulence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> the absence of fever does not exclude an infected joint \\[1-3，15\\].**\n\n【40】**The importance of prompt and timely diagnosis of the septic joint is wellappreciated \\[3，11-14\\]，but the time course is usually considered to be within the day， and the notion of the “golden hour” for septic shock is not often considered. Most interestingly， in a comprehensive review this year of the most modern approach to septic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， a table showing “potential sources of infection associated with sepsis by organ system\"， admittedly not exhaustive， did not include septic arthritis. The three most commonly associated sources for sepsis are lung， abdomen and urinary tract and potential septic arthritis is not commonly considered as a high likelihood precipitant of septic shock. Of course， the phrase “septic arthritis\"， more properly pyogenic or infectious arthritis does not always induce a state of septic shock，and there are “mimics” of the condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Ours， however， was a case where， we believe， had the onus of time consideration followed septic shock guidelines rather than those usually cited for pyogenic arthritis， the initial course in the department might have been different.**\n\n【41】**Septic arthritis in immune-compromised patient can have fatal consequences. Salar et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> present a case of a 63 year old female with rheumatoid arthritis who， on a second presentation for joint pain was initially treated for RA exacerbation， but was found ultimately to have multiple septic joints. Despite two joint washouts and 14 days of intensive care and antibiotics， she died in septic shock. The rapid progression from pyogenic arthritis into septic shock is not frequently seen in the same time line as we have come to view the usual presentation of sepsis. In that patient， for example， the interval from presentation with joint pain to hemodynamic compromise was several days.**\n\n【42】**One factor in which the primary clinician may have been more focused， which may have been used to better advantage in facilitating the care of this patient would have been to have focused greater attention to the possibility of line sepsis in a patient with ESRD and indwelling venous access. Catheter related blood stream infections are the second most common cause of death in patients on hemodialysis， with a 28 fold increase in infection when compared to matched patients without renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Rates of infection have been shown to range from 0.19 up to 5.1 incidence per 1000 patient days \\[17，18\\]. This is due to several factors， including comorbidities， disruption of the natural skin barrier， as well as immune dysfunction caused by uremia， which would have been doubly relevant in our patient with SLE. In patients requiring intravenous access for hemodialysis， central venous catheters have been associated with a 15 fold increase in bacteremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18-21\\]</u>.**\n\n【43】**While the tunneled central venous catheter for our patient was not initially noted to show clinical signs of infection in our patient， the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) notes that clinical signs of erythema， induration and tenderness are not necessarily**\n\n【44】**reliable when evaluating for bacteremia due to indwelling catheters， so called Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections (CRBSI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Rather the diagnosis of CRBSI relies on catheter removal followed by sending both the severed tip of the catheter and peripheral blood for culture. Extra caution is recommended in such patients \\[16，17\\]， and it is possible that had the risk of bacteremia in presence of an indwelling catheter initially recognized， the association with a painful swollen joint might have immediately led to a greater impetus to initiate vigorous sepsis resuscitation. This consideration mitigates，in some degree， our caution that any septic joint might be a harbinger of septic shock， however does highlight the demand to be particularly vigilant to sources of hematogenous spread to a septic joint， before bacteremia leads to sepsis and shock**\n\n【45】**As our patient refused intravenous catheter attempts， which left the dilemma that removal of the catheter would have left no vascular access. Our general practice is to avoid when possible using hemodialysis catheters other than for hemodialysis， and it has been recommended that health care personnel who do so， usually nursing， have specialized training， competence assessment procedures and protocols 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. As our patient bordered on extremis， it was decided to use the catheter after communication with the nephrologyconsultants. To eliminate potential communication delays， procedural texts in emergency medicine have recommended accessing hemodialysis catheters by emergency providers in emergent scenarios 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.**\n\n【46】**The finding of a relative low joint fluid white blood count in what was found to be a septic joint is particularly worth note. The range of joint fluid WBC commonly cited as suggestive of septic joint needs to be tempered with an awareness of the systemic WBC. A synovial fluid WBC of greater than 50，000 or even more specifically 100，000with differential of 90% PMNs is commonly cited as indicating bacterial arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However patients with peripheral neutropenia can been shown to have decreased joint fluid white blood cell count， and patients with peripheral neutropenia have been reported to have culture proven septic arthritis with very minimal synovial fluid neutrophils \\[3，25\\]. One needs to be vigilant for the possibility of septic arthritis in a neutropenic patient with a low synovial white count. A patient with either overwhelming sepsis or SLE can become neutropenic \\[26，27\\]. According to our orthopedic author， it was the patient's clinical deterioration， and not the initial joint fluid cell count which prompted immediate surgical intervention.**\n\n【47】**One review 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u> found no single marker in joint fluid aspiration to reliably rule out a septic joint. Of further interest is the fact that serum WBC and inflammatory markers such as ESR and C-reactive protein are useful in monitoring response to treatment，however their absence does not exclude the septic joint. Mcgillicudy et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u> report that the previously suggested threshold of 50，000 synovial WBC lacks the sensitivity to be clinically useful in ruling out septic arthritis. Furthermore， one would think that laboratory guideline is even less helpful in a patient with SLE given normal levels are commonly seen approaching 40，000 white blood cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.**\n\n【48】**It has been commonly held that delayed diagnosis can lead to profound， extensive cartilage damage within hours even when sepsis is not present， however not every review has found delay in surgical treatment to have a significant effect on outcome \\[31，32\\]. In assessing the need for immediate surgical debridement， some studies have found no difference on mortality or incidence of ICU admission with early surgical debridement. However， each of their patients had diagnostic arthrocentesis and institution of antibiotics. It**\n\n【49】**may be that in patients who have had early diagnostic arthrocentesis and institution of appropriate antibiotics， the difference cannot be shown between six and twenty four hours until surgical washout. However septic arthritis should always be treated as a potential septic emergency and diagnosis and institution of definitive therapy needs to be started in a time frame corresponding to sepsis， especially in the immunocompromised patient.**\n\n【50】**Finally， one area which on reflection is troubling， or rather， illuminating about the care of our patient is to question what effect a prior suspicion of pain medication seeking behavior may have had on the pace of her evaluation. Especially in an era of changing perceptions regarding opioid use and increased sensitivity to the possibility of pain management seeking， one has to be increasingly careful to avoid bias and minimization of symptoms. Although there were several elements already mentioned which affected the rapidity of diagnosis and treatment， one must consider whether the perception that this patient had a chronic pain condition， and that the patient had been indicated in the chart as possibly presenting with pain seeking behavior， and that the patient had recently presented with the same complaint and was identified by a staff member from recent memory as a potential drug seeker all may have contributed to moderating the pace of what might have otherwise been a higher priority and more immediate diagnostic endeavor.**\n\n【51】**There is extensive literature regarding delays in treatment of pain in patients as a function of age \\[33，34\\]， gender \\[35，36\\] and race 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37-40\\]</u>， however we did not find prior literature reporting the delay of diagnosis of a significant medical condition based on a perception of drug seeking in the patient. Of course， that might be a situation difficult to report and own up to.**\n\n【52】**Conclusion**\n\n【53】**We believe that this presentation of a rapid development of septic shock in a patient presenting with an isolated painful joint serves as a reminder of the importance of rapid identification and institution of treatment of sepsis， in the patient with a septic joint， especially in the immunocompromised state. It is a further reminder of the need for special attention， and sometimes uses of long term indwelling venous access catheters. It also serves to remind us that patients with frequent use and demand for opioid analgesia often， if not always， seek pain relief from frequent and recurrent real pain and that these patients may be doubly at risk for potentially serious and catastrophic consequences when symptoms are viewed through the lens of pain medication seeking.**\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Bony metastasis is a rare yet well-established occurrence in esophageal cancer； this literary search procured nine other published case reports ofisolated ring finger metastases from esophageal cancer. In addition to the patient's hospital course，report will discuss the diagnostic and prognostic implications of his unusual clinical finding， deliberate upon the proposed mechanisms of metastasis in the current medical literature， and via analysis of other published cases， this case report highlight a predilection of esophageal cancer metastasis to the ring finger.**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**The incidence of esophageal cancer in the US remains relatively low， ranking as the 184 most common cancer diagnosis (1%)， however often portending a very poor prognosis when diagnosed， with the overall 5-year survival estimated only at 19.2%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. While many risk factors contribute to developing esophageal cancer， the ingestion of tobacco， especially of nitrosamines， is believed to have the highest correlated risk of esophageal cancer， both in the number and the duration of cigarettes smoked 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【20】**Esophageal cancer metastasis of the bone particularly that of acrometastasis； is presumed to be the rarest of their kind 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. As such， the pathophysiology of esophageal cancer and its presentation in the phalanges is limited in the medical literature， and warrants further explanation. These unexpected metastases to the hand and phalanges are more commonly from lung tumors and less likely to originate from the gastrointestinal system.**\n\n【21】**These lesions can masquerade in a variety of clinical presentations， from fungating masses， cystic lesions， to herpetic whitlow. And their clinical significance can vary anywhere from firm to soft， tender or non-tender， asymptomatic to functionally debilitating. As a result， acrometastases lend themselves to diagnostic puzzles. X-ray findings have shown completely dissolved bone， which may be a hallmark of this type of metastasis. Here we present a case where esophageal metastasis to the right ring finger was found on exam as firm， non-tender and erythematous mass around the proximal interphalangeal joint.**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**A middle-aged man with a past medical history of 10 pack-years of cigarette use was evaluated for dysphagia of two month's duration. CT scan of his chest showed a right subcarinal and paraesophageal mass measuring 6.5 cm x2.9 cm × 5.4 cm which was biopsied via bronchoscopy. His lymph node excisional biopsy showed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and his right endobronchial mucosal biopsy showed rare focal atypical cells.**\n\n【24】**Squamous cell esophageal carcinoma was initially diagnosed as cT4bN2M0， but due to his calf and ring finger erythema and swelling which were later confirmed to be metastases， he was actually cT4bN2M1-stage IV-B at diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Figures 1 and 2 shows the radiographs displaying expansile； destructive mass lesions within the right fibula and right fourth middle phalanx.**\n\n【25】**In addition， he had two bronchoesophageal fistulas which required esophageal stenting via esophagogastroduodenoscopy， which showed two ulcerated mucosal defects noted at 27 cm and33 cm from the incisors， as well as mucous seen oozing from these sites which confirmed the fistula locations. A non-obstructing Schatzki ring was also present during the examination.**\n\n【26】**Figure 1： Right lower extremity radiograph.**\n\n【27】**Figure 2： Right hand radiograph.**\n\n【28】**His case was discussed with our multidisciplinarytumorboard and was recommended for treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. His oncologist planned to start treatment， however the patient soon developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation and was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. Emergent bronchoscopy demonstrated near-complete neoplastic occlusion of the distal right mainstem bronchus which caused a post-obstructive pneumonia. A second tracheobronchoscopy was performed to dilate the right mainstem bronchus as well as debulk some of the invading tumor. Figure 3 depicts a patent right mainstem bronchus status-post airway dilation and tumor debulking.**\n\n【29】**He was extubated， treated for the pneumonia， and discharged home. His family was eager to start chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin， however， due to the rapid progression of his disease and subsequent loss of airway anatomy， hospice was recommended.**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n【31】**Metastases to the hand are uncommon in all cancers. It is estimated that only 0.1% of metastatic disease originating from any type of neoplasm reveals itself in the hand 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. This is likely because the hand bones are distally located， contain little red marrow， have minimal capillary networks， and sluggish blood flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Esophageal carcinoma most commonlymetastasizes toliver，bones，lungs，adrenal glands， and brain. In one review of unexpected esophageal cancer metastases by Shaheen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>，approximately 9% of published cases had metastases to the extremities. The 60% of extremity metastas cases were squamous cell carcinomas， and tended to be later stage cancers with 80% at stage III or IV at time of diagnosis.**\n\n【32】Figure 3： Rigid and flexible tracheabronchoscopy- right mainstem branchus.\n\n【33】**Figure 4： Chart depicting percentage of the relative incidence (x-axis) of esophageal acrometastasis by location (y-axis).**\n\n【34】**The pathophysiology of bone metastasis in esophageal cancer warrants further elucidation. In a 2013 review of 221 reported cases of metastases to the hand by Afshar et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， 72 originated from the lungs and 55 originated from gastrointestinal tumors (esophageal， stomach， or colorectal). In 30% of reported cases， hand metastasis was present at the time of diagnosis. The occurrence of unexpected metastasis to distal anatomy like the fingers is not fully explained by lymphatic or venous routes alone. Although tumors almost always metastasize via veins rather than arteries， the unexpected presentation of these metastases may be explained by an arterial route. The esophagus is supplied by three groups of arteries， the inferior thyroid artery， thoracic aortic branches， and the gastric artery， which offer several metastatic routes. Another proposed mechanism of metastasis to the hand is from pre-existing lung involvement with the primary esophageal tumor. Compared to other organs， the lungs VSt contain the most extensive access to the systemic arterial supply， whereas in non-pulmonary cancers， hepatic and pulmonary capillary beds usually prevent the hematogenous spread of cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Thus， our patient's lung involvement may have been a major contributor to his acrometastasis. Another interesting proposed mechanism of acrometastasis is the predilection of distal anatomic structures to trauma， especially the hand. Trauma releases chemotactic factors and prostaglandins which may make the digits more hospitable to metastasis.**\n\n【35】**Considering these pathways helps one understand the way in which acrometastasis from esophageal cancer can occur in the fingers and hand. After review of established case reports， there appears to be a peculiar， preferential pattern of esophageal metastasis to the ring finger， as shown in Figure 4. This is observed in our patient as well as in nine other case reports 3，6，8.**\n\n【36】**have both diagnostic and prognostic implications. It may serve as a diagnostic sign for esophageal cancer in patients who present with other red flag symptoms， such as unintentional weight loss， symptomaticanemia，hematemesis， dysphagia， orpersistent vomiting. Unfortunately， acrometastasis signifies a more disseminated disease process and is a major cause of treatment failure in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. And because bone metastasis is believed to portend a poor prognosis in comparison to other metastatic sites， the therapeutic goal of palliation is warranted， which may include analgesia， radiation or even amputation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although further validation is needed， the clinical presentation of digital metastasis， particularly to the fourth metacarpal， may be an indicator of esophageal cancer with lung inyolvement.**\n\n【37】**1.Noone AM， HowladerN，Krapcho M， Miller D， Brest A， Yu M， et al.

Here we present a case of severe weight loss related by dapagliflozin， an antihyperglycemic medication through a mechanism of increasing urinary glucose excretion， in a patient with advanced lung cancer. An unusual feature in our case was that the patient continued to experience severe weight loss while the cancer was quite stable. Increased oral intake was unable to compensate the urinary glucose excretion， but the dose reduction worked， suggesting dapagliflozin as the main reason for weight loss. Our case highlights the usefulness of a full assessment of possible contributors to weight loss， even in patients with cachexia. Identification of reversible causes can have a major effect on the severity of weight loss and overall quality of life for cancer patients.**\n\n【20】**Keywords： Cancer cachexia； Dapagliflozin；Non-small cell lung cancer**\n\n【21】**Introduction**\n\n【22】**Patients with cancer cachexia frequently experience decreased quality of life， reduced chemotherapy tolerance， reduced physical functioning， and shortened survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Between 50%and 80% of patients with advanced cancer develop cachexia， with highest incidence reported in patients with lung and gastrointestinal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is commonly found in cancer patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The relationship between DM and cancer appears to be bidirectional： DM has been associated with an increased risk of developing several types of cancer while also cancer treatments， through the induction of metabolic derangements， can facilitate the onset of DM， or worsen glucose control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. DM can negatively affect the clinical outcomes of these subjects， being associated with worse survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However， there is the lack of specific guidelines for DM in cancer patients， a management of DM in cancer patients refer to the general guideline for DM. Dapagliflozin was the first drug in a class of therapies that took a new approach to glycemic control in adults with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). It can also be used for patients with cancer and T2D. Both patients with cancer and those with diabetes might experience weight loss， or cachexia. We present a case of severe weight loss， which was not caused by cancer or T2D， but caused by dapagliflozin， the antihyperglycemic medication.**\n\n【23】**Case Presentation**\n\n【24】**The patient is a 59-year-old male， 170 cm tall and weighing 53 kg with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. He was presented to Hubei Cancer Hospital， China， with an 8-kg， 13% weight loss over the past 6 months in October 2021.**\n\n【25】**He had been diagnosed with advanced adenocarcinoma 41 months before， and received first line chemotherapy of pemetrexed and cisplatin， followed by albumin-bound paclitaxel combined with pembrolizumab as second line therapy. He then continued pembrolizumab as maintenance therapy. Six months before he experienced weight loss and was diagnosed as diabetes with Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) at 22.6 mmol (406 mg/dL). He was diagnosed as T2D for he was negative for**\n\n【26】**FPG： Fasting Plasma Glucose； ONS： Oral Nutrition Supplement**\n\n【27】**glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody， islet cell antibody， and insulin autoantibody. He was first treated by metformin. Due to a severe side effect as diarrhea， he was then prescribed with dapagliflozin， an antihyperglycemic-Sodium Glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors， 10 mg orally. His serum glucose levels became stable at approximately 7.3 mmol/L (130 mg/dl)， but continued to experience severe weight loss.**\n\n【28】**On examination， his cancer was stable with the maintenance of pembrolizumab. His eating and exercise habits did not change throughout the treatment and he was not depressed. After a dietary survey， his daily dietary energy intake was appropriately 1，500 kcal， which was the same as usual. Oral Nutrition Supplement (ONS) with 500 kcal was added to his daily dietary. However， he lost 2 more kilograms within one month with additional ONS .**\n\n【29】**Sinceadditional ONS did noteliminate his weightloss， weassumed that his weight loss was caused by increased glucose excretion caused by dapagliflozin. His urine glucose was positive. Therefore， the dose of dapagliflozin was reduced to 5 mg and his weight stopped losing and became stable around 51 kg without any other contributors.**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n【31】**Weight loss in patients with cancer cachexia is due to a variable combination of decreased food intake and metabolic changes，leading to negative protein and energy balance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Cancer cachexia can be seen in patients with normal food intake. Metabolic changes were the main mechanism in our patient rather than decreased food intake or increased energy expenditure. Weight loss without trying is one of the most common symptoms for T2D 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The diagnosis of diabetes was clear for this case due to hyperglycemia. However， this patient suffered weight loss related to dapagliflozin， rather than his diseases of diabetes or cancer. Special cautions of weight loss should be placed for those patients with cancer and diabetes， especially for those who undergo dapagliflozin.**\n\n【32】**Although the patient had a severe weight loss， he did not have any fatigue， anorexia， or sarcopenia. Taking together that his lab values such as serum C-reactive protein and albumin were at normal range during the treatment， he cannot be diagnosis with cachexia but only weight loss.**\n\n【33】**Dapagliflozin， an SGLT-2 inhibitors， is the latest glucose-lowering agents to become available. These drugs increase urinary**\n\n【34】**glucose excretion by inhibiting SGLT-2 in the renal proximal tubule通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Through a mechanism of glycosuria and urinary calorie loss of up to 320 kcal per day， substantial weight reduction was achieved when dapagliflozin was used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. For this patient， we might assume that his urinary calorie loss is much more than 320 kcal especially when his weight loss continued with addiction of ONS with 500 kcal， but it was impossible to confirm it due to the limitation of our hospital， although his urine glucose was positive. His weight was rather stable when dapagliflozin was reduced to 5 mg without any concurrent medication.**\n\n【35】**Diabetes is one of the endocrine-related adverse events associated with immunotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Due to the potential mechanism that pancreatic beta cells destructed by immunotherapy， immunotherapy related diabetes is similar to classic type 1 diabetes generally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. However， our case is negative for all the antibodies and is independent with insulin，which is more like T2D. Further researches，such as gene sequencing could be done in order to support the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. We focused on the weight loss and will not go further on this area.**\n\n【36】**Weight loss might be necessary for diabetes patients， but is not a good sign for advanced cancer patients. It could be confused with cancer cachexia， which is related to tumor mass and progressive disease. Normally cancer patients gain weight in association with tumor response to the anti-cancer treatment. An unusual feature was that in our case the patient continued to experience severe weight loss while the cancer was quite stable. Increased oral intake was not sufficient enough to compensate the urinary glucose excretion， but the dose reduction likely worked by reducing glucose excretion.**\n\n【37】**Conclusion**\n\n【38】**Our case highlights the usefulness of a full assessment of possible contributors to weight loss， even in patients with cachexia. Special cautions should be paid for such a severe weight loss when advanced cancer patients with diabetes undergo dapagliflozin. A smaller dose， rather than the standard dose of dapagliflozin might be more suitable for them. Identification of reversible causes can have a major effect on the severity of weight loss and overall quality of life for cancer patients.**\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Acknowledgment**</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**The patient involved in this case report gave his informed consent authorizing use and disclosure of his health information.**</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

The management of FM requires a combination of multiple approaches.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Fibromyalgia； Duloxetine； Pregabalin**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common systemic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and a generalized reduction in pain threshold. The introduction of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) FM classification criteria in 1990 has resulted in increasing recognition of the syndrome. The prevalence of FM in the United States is estimated tobe 2-4%， of which approximately80% are women between the ages of 20 and 60 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. FM affects about 3% of women attending outpatient clinics in Japan； however， the recognition of this disease remains low in Japan. FM causes a marked reduction in patients' quality of life. Prompt diagnosis as well as appropriate treatment depending on the condition of the patients is needed.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**Case one**\n\n【18】**The patient was a 50-year-old female who was diagnosed with total body pain and sleeplessness in 2014. She presented to our clinic and was treated with NSAIDs (celecoxib 200 mg/day) and eperisone hydrochloride (150 mg/day)； however， the pain caused difficulty in walking. Her medical history included epilepsy in childhood， hypertension， and sleeplessness. She had a widespread pain index (WPI) of 13 and a symptom severity (SS) scale score of 6 . Laboratory tests did not reveal any evidence of rheumatoid arthritis or collagen disease . She was diagnosed with FM and was started on 150 mg/day of pregabalin. Her pregabalin dose was increased to 450 mg/day， but was later reduced to 250 mg/day because she experienced dizziness and sense of floating. Her symptoms improved when duloxetine was added . Her pregabalin dose was gradually tapered off， and she is now symptom-free.**\n\n【19】**Case two**\n\n【20】**The patient was a 28-year-old female who presented to our clinic with back pain and depression in 2015. She was treated with NSAIDs (celecoxib 200 mg/day) and eperisone hydrochloride (150mg/day)， but the persistent pain limited mobility. She had a medical history of epilepsy from 15 to23 years of age， a WPI of 16， and SS scale score of 22 . Laboratory tests did not reveal any evidence of rheumatoid arthritis or collagen disease . She was diagnosed with FM and was started on 150 mg/day of pregabalin. Her pregabalin dose was increased to 175 mg/day， but because of the resulting dizziness， this was reduced to 150 mg/day. Her symptoms improved when she was started on duloxetine . At the same time， she received psychological counseling at our hospital. Her symptoms improved and the pregabalin dose was gradually tapered off.**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**FM is a chronic musculoskeletal disorder of unknown etiology. It is characterized by chronic wide spread pain and muscle tenderness，as well as the presence oftender points on examination. The diagnosis of FM is made when the patient fulfills the ACR 1990 Criteria. The first criterion includes pain for at least three months involving the upper and lower body， right and left sides， as well as axial**\n\n【23】**Table 1： Laboratory examination of patients.**\n\n| **Case one**  |  | **Case two**  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Peripheral blood**  |  | **Peripheral blood**  |  |\n| **WBC**  | **5100 pL**  | **WBC**  | **7800pL**  |\n| **RBC**  | **433x104pL**  | **RBC**  | **496x104pL**  |\n| **Hb**  | **13 g/dL**  | **Hb**  | **14.8 g/dL**  |\n| **Ht**  | **38.10%**  | **Ht**  | **44.60%**  |\n| **Plt**  | **20.5x103pL**  | **Plt**  | **28.6x10\\*uL**  |\n| **ESR8mm**  |  |  |  |\n| **Urinary**  |  | **Urinary**  |  |\n| **Protein**  |  | **Protein**  |  |\n| **Glucose**  |  | **Glucose**  | **通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>**  |\n| **Keton**  |  | **Keton**  |  |\n| **Urobilinogen(±)**  |  |  |  |\n| **Occult**  |  | **Urobilinogen (±)**  |  |\n| **Chemistory**  |  | **Occult**  |  |\n| **AST**  | **18 U/L**  |  |  |\n| **ALT**  | **17 U/L**  | **Chemistory**  |  |\n| **LDH**  | **137 U/L**  | **AST**  | **21U/L**  |\n| **T-Bil**  | **0.5 mg/dL**  | **ALT**  | **18U/L**  |\n| **ALP**  | **163 U/L**  | **LDH**  | **180U/L**  |\n| **V-GTP**  | **8 U/L**  | **T-Bil**  | **0.6 mg/dL**  |\n| **TP**  | **6.8 g/dL**  | **ALP**  | **149U/L**  |\n| **alh**  | **4.1 g/dL**  | **V-GTP**  | **27U/L**  |\n| **BUN**  | **14 mg/dL**  | **TP**  | **7.5 g/dL**  |\n| **Cr**  | **0.71 mg/dL**  | **alb**  | **4.5 g/dL**  |\n| **eGFRcre**  | **68 ml/min/1.73m2**  | **BUN**  | **8 mg/dL**  |\n| **UA**  | **4.2 mg/dL**  | **Cr**  | **0.47 mg/dL**  |\n| **CRP**  | **0.1 mg/dL**  | **eGFRcre**  | **129 ml/min/1.73m2**  |\n| **RF**  | **22.9IU/ml**  | **UA**  | **4.7 mg/dL**  |\n| **IgG**  | **1302 mg/dL**  | **CRP**  | **0.1 mg/dL**  |\n| **IgA**  | **182 mg/dL**  | **MMP-3**  | **12.4ng/mL**  |\n| **IgM**  | **92 mg/dL**  | **Anti-nuclear antibody**  | **40x**  |\n| **C3**  | **73 mg/dL**  |  |  |\n| **C4**  | **20 mg/dL**  |  |  |\n| **CH**  | **50 41.9 U/dL**  |  |  |\n| **ANA**  | **10.2index**  |  |  |\n| **Anti-CCP-ab**  | **0.6 U/ml**  |  |  |\n\n【25】**skeleton. The second criterion requires the presence of tender points in at least 11 of 18 sites on digital palpation， when about 4 kg per unit area of force is applied. These criteria were later modified into a self-reported questionnaire (Fibromyalgia Survey Questionnaire， FSQ) for assessing patient symptoms. The two cases we described had widespread points of tenderness (fingers and toes) over 18 sites over more than three months， which fitted the FM diagnostic criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【26】**FM is often accompanied by various psychotic symptoms. Patients experience various kinds of central neuropathic conditions such as sleeplessness and depression in addition to chronic pain.

A meta-analysis showed that 150 mg/ day of pregabalin was generally ineffective in treating FM， and that higher doses (300， 450 or 600 mg) were required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However， most patients discontinue pregabalin because they experience side effects such as somnolence and dizziness， which become more common at higher doses. Antidepressant such as serotonin-no repinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are also effective in relieving the symptoms of FM. Duloxetine， an SNRI， has been approved for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain， depression， and generalized anxiety disorder. The recommended daily dose of duloxetine is 60 mg. Combined therapy with pregabalin and duloxetine has been proven to be more effective than either medication used alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The**\n\n【32】**addition of duloxetine relieved the pain experienced by our patients， perhaps because of its antidepressant effects. Empirical evidence also suggests that gabapentin is effective in patients with morning stiffness and pain，and clonazepam is effective in patients with muscle stiffness and pain.**\n\n【33】**Non-pharmacological treatments modalities have been recommended in the treatment of FM. Examples include aerobic exercise， physical therapy， cognitive behavioral therapy， massage， and acupuncture. In the cases we described， our patients practiced stretching therapy while on a tapering dose of pregabalin. Warming， increasing the body temperature is reported to be effective for FM， but this was ineffective in the cases we described. Symptoms of FM reportedly improve within two years in approximately 90% of cases. This was true for our patients.**\n\n【34】**FM is a clinical diagnosis without remarkablelaboratory findings. Effective treatment of this condition requires a combination oflong term pain control and life support such as psychological care.**\n\n【35】**Conclusion**\n\n【36】**We report two cases of FM that were successfully treated by combination therapy with pregabalin and duloxetine. Non-pharmacological therapies were also effective in symptom relief. A multidisciplinary approach is required to treat FM effectively.**\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Many are the causes described for this disorder and in this paper； we present the first case， to our knowledge， of intraperitoneal sepsis as a possible cause of pyometra.**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Pyometra is defined as the accumulation of pus within the uterine cavity related to an occlusion of the cervical canal. There are many causes for pyometra， well described in literature： Malignancies ofthe uterus or the pelvis invading the cervix， benign tumor of the cervix such as polyps or fibromas， past surgery on the cervix and post radiation cervicitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Multiple case reports suggest that rupture of the uterus consequent to pyometra， despite being a rare complication， is associated to peritonitis and abdominal abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-5\\]</u>.Nevertheless， there is no evidence in literature of abdominal abscess as the cause of pyometra. We present the first case， to our knowledge， of pyometra occurring as complication ofabdominal sepsis for gastric perforation.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**An 80-year-old female patient was transferred to our department after one month hospitalization in a smaller hospital for gastric ulcer perforation (Helicobacter pylori positive) treated by surgical debridement and omental patch. The post-operative evolution was complicated by multiple abdominal abscesses. An empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam， both for Helicobacter pylori and abdominal sepsis， was started with percutaneous attempt of drainage. The patient was then transferred to our hospital for family reunification， where a new abdominal CT scans was performed， confirming the persistence of a perisplenic abscess， a pelvic abscess and pyometra .**\n\n【18】**Weperformed a newpercutaneous CT-guided drainage of thepelvic abscess， whiletheperisplenic abscess， smaler and hardly reachable by percutaneous approach， and were treated conservatively. The gynecologists performed a hysteroscopy with emergent dilatation and curettage to manage the pyometra. The procedure was well tolerated and no other possible causes for pyometra were found. We observed a good clinical， biological and radiological evolution. A further CT imaging showed an improvement with reduction of abdominal collections and complete disappearance of the pyometra. The final histology ofthe ulcer biopsies showed a poorly differentiated gastric cancer ulcerated. She was then treated， after a period of rehabilitation， with partial gastrectomy with no further therapies needed .**\n\n【19】**Discussion**\n\n【20】**Pyometra is a collection of purulent material in the uterine cavity due to the impossibility of draining the cervix and this is a potentially lethal disease widely diffused within the veterinary community， especially between dogs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.

A third or more of people with Diabetes (DM) might developed DR. As a result， the purpose of this study was to evaluate adult diabetic patients knowledge about diabetes retinopathy and its complications in Sana'a， Yemen. On this foundation， we also suggest using a public health strategy to combat DR in the researcharea.**\n\n【19】**Methods： At the Al-Kuwait University Hospital and the National Center of Public Health Sana'a(NCPHL)， a cross-sectional study was conducted. After receiving informed consent， responses from 885 people (men and women) with DM were gathered using a validated questionnaire. The goal of the questionnaire was to measure respondents' level of knowledge with DR， its detection， prevention， and treatment. The results of the questionnaire were then used to see whether there was a correlation between the individuals characters and their level of DR awareness**\n\n【20】**Results： About 59% of the respondents have heard about DR. 46% of them correctly defined DR as one of the complications of DM that could cause blindness， whereas 208 (23.5%) knew that DR is related to damage to retinal vessels and 186 (21%) to high blood sugar due to uncontrolled diabetes.285 (32.2%) had a good level of knowledge， while 67.8% showed a poor level of knowledge of DR. There was a better level ofknowledge with male patients (37.3% vs. 27.1% for females)， younger age(18-30 years) (42.2%，OR=1.5，p=0.03)，and college graduate patients (75.7%， OR=11.2，p=0.0001). Older than 50 years old， widowed， divorced， and illiterate and those who attained high school education or less， showed poor levels of knowledge equal to 73%，79.3%，83.3%，93.7%，and 74%， respectively， with significant p=0.05.**\n\n【21】**Conclusion： In this study， most patients indicated insufficient levels of awareness regarding DR. This lack of proper understanding was connected with low levels of education， female sex， and older ages. Additionally， there was a lack of compliance with routine eye inspections. These findings are of major concern； hence， the implementation of efforts to enhance the knowledge of DR and the significance of early retinal screening among affected patients is very vital. Health education campaigns should engage schools， as a portion of the community may not be able to acquire a higher education. Additionally，a comprehensive strategy of mandated referrals to ophthalmologists should be introduced by general practitioners throughout Yemen. Eventually， screening methods for DR ought to be adopted.**\n\n【22】**Keywords： Blindness； Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)；Diabetes Mellitus (DM)； Knowledge**\n\n【23】**Introduction**\n\n【24】**Diabetes， often known as diabetes mellitus， is a set of common endocrine illnesses defined by sustained high blood sugar levels \\[1，2\\]. Diabetes is caused by either the pancreas not making enough insulin or the cells of the body not responding effectively to the insulin produced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Diabetes， if left untreated，leads to several health issues， one of which is Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)， which is a leading cause of blindness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As of 2021， an estimated 537 million individuals worldwide have diabetes， accounting for over 10% of the adult population， and type 2 diabetes accounts for around90% of all diabetes cases \\[5，6\\]. The prevalence of the disease continues to increase， most dramatically in low- and middle-income nations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Yemen is one of the countries with a greater prevalence of diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Yemen s diabetes prevalence was 5.4% in 2021， and there were 2，852.000 documented cases of diabetes in 2021 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Diabetic retinopathy is the primary microvascular consequence of**\n\n【25】**diabetes mellitus； in addition， Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a priority disease in the Vision 2020 effort for the global elimination of avoidable blindness. The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged its member nations to integrate a program strategy for DR within their prevention of blindness programs \\[9，10\\].**\n\n【26】**In Yemen， the prevalence of DR was 55% (95% CI 49.6.60.1)， while the proportions of Background Diabetic Retinopathy (BDR)， Pre-ProliferativeDiabeticRetinopathy(PPDR)，Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR)， and diabetic macular edema were correspondingly 20%， 13%， 17%， and 22%. Blindness was 16%common among DM patients. Glaucoma and cataract incidence rates were respectively 34.3% and 8.6%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In Yemen， diabetic individuals have relatively high rates of obesity， hypertension， and dyslipidemia通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， making them more prone to developing diabetic retinopathy. Therefore， our study seeks to evaluate the knowledge and awareness of the risk of diabetic retinopathy among adult diabetic patients in order to reduce the incidence of diabetic retinopathy and to improve the quality of life of diabetic patients.**\n\n【27】**Subjects and Methods**\n\n【28】**Study area： The proposed study was carried out in Sana'a， Yemen. The number of diabetics in the city of Sana a is estimated at 212，000通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Study conducted in September 2022.**\n\n【29】**Study design： A cross-sectional study was conducted at the National Center for Public Health Laboratories in Sana'a (NCPHL) and Kuwait Hospital in Sana a City targeting adult diabetic patients from Sana a city who were undergoing blood glucose tests at the two centers.**\n\n【30】**Sample size： Sample size was determined using epi info software version 7， according to a population survey. Taking into account later criteria， the population of Sana’a is 4，000，000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. As previously reported in Yemen， the expected frequency of RP among DMs is equivalent to 50%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， and the worst accepted accuracy is equal to2.95% at a 95% confidence level. The sample size required to achieve meaningful results was 885 patients.**\n\n【31】**Data collection： The data was collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire contains 16 questions(8 questions related to demographic and clinical data， and 8 questions assessing the knowledge about diabetic retinopathy). In order to facilitate answering the questionnaire it has been translated to Arabic language.**\n\n【32】**Data analysis： Utilizing Statistical Epi-Info version 7， data were examined. The distribution of the sociodemographic characteristics and the diabetic patient's knowledge of DR were analyzed using descriptive statistics (frequency， percentages， and median). Each accurate response received one points toward the overall knowledge score， while incorrect or unknowing responses received zero. Scores over the median score 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> were thus seen as indicating a good level of knowledge. To further explore the connection between sociodemographic characteristics and the patient's knowledge of diabetic retinopathy， OR， 95% CI， and Chi-squared test were calculated. P values less than 0.05 were regarded as significant.**\n\n【33】**Ethical approval： On May 01， 2022， with the reference number2022-1， the Medical Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of Sanaa University issued its official approval.

A little over 59% of those surveyed have heard of DR. 46% of them correctly identified Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) as one of the DM problems that can result in blindness， while 208(23.5%) and 186 (21%) were aware that DR is linked to retinal vascular damage. Of the study's participants， 435 (49.2%) were unaware that aging raises DR risk， while 40.7% were aware that aging increases susceptibility to DR. When questioned about DR problems，403 (45.5%) of the participants had no idea， compared to smaller percentages who correctly identified blurred vision (31%) and vision loss (18%). Less than half (41%) correctly recognized blin dness as the worst complication of DR. About third (34.9%) correctly reported that DR is a treatable condition， while 55.9% did not know that.**\n\n【44】**The score for all of the knowledge was determined. It had a score range of 0 to 8， with a median of 4 (IQR=2-6). Good levels of knowledge were defined as values above the median. As a result， 285(32.2%) had a good level of understanding， whereas 67.8% displayed a poor level . Table 3 displays the correlation between knowledge level and sociodemographic information， diabetes type， duration， and number of ophthalmologist visits. Male patients had a higher level of knowledge， with a good level of 37.3% vs. 27.1%for female patients， and an odds ratio of 1.6， CI=1.2-2.1， p=0.0009. Additionally， respondents between the ages of 18 and 30 had a higher rate of good levels (42.2%)， OR equal to 1.5， CI=1.03-2.3， and p=0.03. Patients who had graduated from college had higher levels of knowledge； the good level was 75.7%， and the odds ratio for having good knowledge was 11.2， with a confidence interval of 7.6 to 16(p=0.0001). Additionally， postgraduate patients had a higher level of knowledge， with a good level of 90%， and a good level of knowledge was related with an odds ratio of 18.3， CI=2.3-14.5， p=0.0001. Additionally， type I diabetes patients had a higher level of knowledge， with a good level at 41.2%， and a good level was related with an odds ratio of 1.5， CI=1.1-2.1， p=0.01. Additionally， type II DM patients had a higher level of knowledge， with a good level of knowledge at36.4%， and an odds ratio of 1.4， CI=1.1-1.8， p=0.02 was related with a good level of knowledge. Older than 50， widowed， divorced， illiterate， and those who had just completed high school shown poor level of knowledge equal to 73%，79.3%，83.3%，93.7%，and 74% respectively with significant p<0.05. Additionally， individuals who were unsure of their diabetes type demonstrated a higher level of ignorance (86.4%with p<0.0001). Patients who did not see an ophthalmologist also had a lower degree of knowledge， which was 86.9% with a p value of0.0001 .**\n\n【45】**Discussion**\n\n【46】**Being aware of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a critical first step in the early detection， diagnosis， and treatment of this condition. One of the leading causes of blindness and reduced vision bothinternationally and in Yemen is diabetic retinopathy \\[9，10\\]. Therefore， the current study's implications for community health planning are absolutely crucial \\[13，14.**\n\n【47】**This study showed that 32.2% of DM patients had a good level of knowledge， while the majority (67.8%) showed a poor level of knowledge. The level of awareness of DR reported in our study is much lower than the levels reported in Jordan， where approximately80% of diabetic patients were aware of the nature and consequences ofDR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Also， our result (32.2%) was even lower than the reported levels in Al-Ahsa， Saudi Arabia， where 66.6% of diabetic patients knew the nature and outcome of their diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The existence of a well-established national eye health care program and referral standards related Diabetic Mellitus (DM) and DR management for primary care， according to the authors， is what accounts for the high awareness of DR in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Patients are referred for an eye examination once a diagnosis of DM has been made， despite Yemen's lack of a national eye health care program. A similar improvement in DR awareness was noted in Jeddah， Saudi Arabia(82%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， and Malaya， Malaysia (86%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.

Cetin et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> conclusion that Turkey's lack of suitable knowledge and behavior for the management of DR is comparable to these findings. Furthermore， knowledge of ocular complications of uncontrolled DM and how to prevent them was very low among Saudi DM patients in Al-Ahsaa and Hispanic people， where only one-third ofparticipants who had recently been diagnosed and half of those who had had their diabetes diagnosed more than a year prior were aware that uncontrolled diabetes could result in eye disease \\[13，21\\].**\n\n【52】**about DR in the current study was their low levels of education.

Longer periods of diabetes over 5 years were associated with better awareness in Turkey 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. However， the current study did not reveal an association between the duration of diabetes and the level of consciousness . The American Diabetes Association recommends annual eye exams for people with type 2 diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. According to this report， just a small percentage of people actually go to an ophthalmologist for annual eye exams. Only 34.9% of the participants maintained annual attendance. Additionally， there was a strong correlation between the weaker knowledge levels and this poor attendance . One of the predisposing elements that influences behavior， such as participation in screening， is suggested to be an individuals awareness \\[251. Our members' lack of knowledge may be the cause of their irregular eye exams. However， despite having a high level of awareness regarding the value of getting an eye checkup， other research found that patients lacked the drive to do so. Patients with diabetes all around the world appear to exhibit a similar gap between awareness and compliance when it comes to regular eye exams. According to some reports， just half of the patients in Myanmar 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> and two thirds of the Japanese patients showed up for a routine eye checkup 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Additionally， a recent study in Turkey found that 77.3% of diabetes patients had previously undergone an eye exam， despite the fact that only 41.9% of these patients were aware that they should have annual eye exams 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The low level of visits to the ophthalmologist in Yemen may be due to the unavailability of this service and its cost， which can be barriers that must be taken into account in Yemen， especially at this time when the war is still going on， which has caused the cessation of government medical services.**\n\n【57】**This highlights the fact that Yemeni general practitioners are required to follow a broad referral policy to ophthalmologists. In this study， general practitioners and ophthalmologists were the primary sources of DR information， with social media， the internet， educational institutions， community health organizations， radio， television， and family and friends playing a much less role . This is similar to patient reports from Saudi Arabia \\[13，16\\]. In order to convey information and emphasize the importance of routine eye screening， the participation of health professionals at primary care facilities is crucial. This was emphasized in a related Irish study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Additionaly， it is important to leverage and direct media and online resources toward raising public awareness.**\n\n【58】**Conclusion**\n\n【59】**Most patients in this study reported having little knowledge of DR. Poor educational attainment， feminine sex， and advanced ages were linked to this lack of proper understanding. The usual eye examination protocol was also not followed. As a result of these alarming findings， it is imperative that efforts be put in place to raise**\n\n【60】**affected patients' knowledge of DR and the value of early retinal screening. Schools should be the focus of health education initiatives because certain members of the community might not be able to attend college. Additionaly， general practitioners in Yemen ought to implement a broad plan that mandates referrals to ophthalmologists. At some point， Yemen should implement DR screening programs.**\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Acknowledgment**</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**The work was financed by Sana'a University， Sana'a， Yemen， which the authors would like to thank**</u>\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\. \"Diabetes\".World Health Organization.

Heunderwent a Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) to treat CDA II. His clinical，biochemical， molecular， and mRNA transcript levels are studied before and after HSCT to understand the effect of HSCT.**\n\n【21】**Results： The patient had transfusion-dependent severe anemia， pallor， weakness， and icterus. A molecular study identified c.1385 A>G， p.Tyr462Cys homozygous mutation in the SEC23B gene causing CDAII. This is the most common type of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia. mRNA transcript levels of SEC23B gene were significantly decreased in this patient who received Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant from HLA-identical siblings. On follow-up at 18 months after HSCT，he did not require transfusion， other clinical features are normal and mRNA transcript levels are the same as that of healthy controls.**\n\n【22】**Conclusion： This study highlights the outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplant on clinical， biochemical， molecular， and SEC23B gene expression levels in a patient suffering from congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II in India.**\n\n【23】**Keywords： Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia (CDA)； Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant； SEC23B gene expression； Iron overload**\n\n【24】**Introduction**\n\n【25】**Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia (CDA) is a group of rare， hereditary disorders characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis， anemia， and iron overload. CDA patients usually show anemia of variable degrees， icterus， hepatosplenomegaly， and distinctive bone marrow features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. There are three main types of CDA -CDAI， CDA II， and CDA III. Other rare forms of CDA are also known. The most common type among these is CDA type II. Patients suffering from CDAII show anemia， icterus， pallor， and hepatosplenomegaly. The requirement for blood transfusion is variable. Some severe cases require regular blood transfusions while others require infrequent blood transfusions. The inheritance pattern ofCDAII is autosomal recessive and is caused due to mutations in the SEC23B gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It has been reported that mRNA expression levels of SEC23B are reduced in CDAII 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. CDA II is diagnosed mainly based on microscopic observation of bone marrow morphological features， and molecular analysis. According to the literature， the Mean Channel Fluorescence (MCF) in the Eosin-5-Maleimide (EMA) test used for diagnosis of red cell membrane protein defect is also low or in the grey area for CDAII. This is because of the hypoglycosylation of band 3 protein in the red cell membrane of CDAII patients. The differentiation between hereditary spherocytosis and CDAII can thus be made based on the CD44 antibody bin ding test \\[4，5\\].**\n\n【26】**The disease is commonly managed with regular blood transfusion and iron chelation. In some cases，the number oftransfusions has been reduced using splenectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Currently，Hematopoietic**\n\n【27】**Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) is known to be the only curative option for CDA \\[7，8\\]. Some reports suggest the efficacy of HSCT， but the data from the literature is very rare. There are very few reports of CDAII in the Indian population. Here， we report a case of CDAII having severe anemia， requiring regular blood transfusion， diagnosed with bone marrow analysis， biochemical and molecular tests， and managed with a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. On follow-up， we also evaluated the effect of hematopoietic stem cell transplant on mRNAtranscript levels of the SEC23B gene in this patient.**\n\n【28】**Materialand Methods**\n\n【29】**Patient**\n\n【30】**A 5-year-old male child born of consanguineous marriage complaining of weaknessSandlethargy，having transfusion-dependent anemia was referred to ICMR- National Institute of Immunohematology， Mumbai， India for a hemolytic anemia workup. Routine hematological studies were carried out by standard protocols. Complete Blood Count (CBC)， absolute reticulocyte count， and corrected reticulocyte count were taken. Morphological changes in blood cells were observed using light microscopy. Hemoglobinopathies were ruled out using hemoglobin variant analysis.

Activities of 3common red blood cell enzymes - Pyruvate Kinase (PK)， Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD)， and GlucosePhosphate Isomerase (GPI) were normal. Low Mean Channel Fluorescence(MCF) was observed in Eosin-5-Maleimide test. Thus， an anti-CD44 antibody binding test was used to rule out CDAII \\[4，5\\](Table1). The patient showed significantly raised CD44 antibody binding. Bone marrow smear showed marked erythroid hyperplasia and mild dyserythropoiesis.

There was no statistically significant difference in the mRNA transcript level in patients and healthy individuals (p>0.05) .**\n\n【50】**Discussion**\n\n【51】**CDAII is a rare hematological disorder. Due to difficulty in diagnosis， many cases remain undiagnosed despite having severe**\n\n【52】**clinical features. The diagnosis of CDAII needs to be suspected in congenital anemia cases having features of hemolytic anemia and patients showing low mean channel fluorescence values in the EMA test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The molecular analysis using Next Generation Sequencing and/or Sanger sequencing of the SEC23B gene is the confirmatory test for CDAII. The protein band 3 is hypoglycosylated in the red cell membrane of CDAII patients. Thus， the EMA test shows low MCF in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Therefore， differentiation of CDAII and HS is necessary using CD44 antibody binding test \\[4，5\\].**\n\n【53】**Clinical presentation in CDAII patients is variable. Some show severe anemia with splenomegaly， requiring regular blood transfusion and some show mild anemia with notransfusion requirement. Patients showing severe clinical features are managed mainly by supportive care by regular blood transfusions， iron chelation therapy， rarely splenectomy， and allogeneic HSCT. In many patients， throughout life iron accumulates steadily 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Currently， iron overload in these patients is managed by following guidelines used for the treatment of thalassemia major.**\n\n【54】**Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) using a fully matched sibling donor is currently considered to be a curative therapy for CDA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. According to the literature， there are few reports of CDA managed successfully with HSCT， and the outcome was good. There is one report from the Indian population showing the clinical benefits of HSCT in CDAII. The patient reported here required transfusion every month and had continuous weakness and fatigue. Parents were not ready for lifelong transfusions followed by iron chelation therapy. Splenectomy was suggested but they were not ready because of the risk of infection susceptibility. Thus， the only curative option was HSCT. His elder sister has no symptoms of CDAII and was checked with the molecular test ofthe SEC23B gene.**\n\n【55】**For the first time， we have studied the molecular， biochemical， and clinical benefits of HSCT for the management of CDAII with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant may improve the prognosis in patients. The changes in the expression of the SEC23B gene regarding mRNA transcript levels were first time studied before and after an HSCT in a patient suffering from severe CDAII.**\n\n【56】**Conclusion**\n\n【57】**There are no definitive treatment guidelines available for CDA because of its rarity. But， in severe cases where an HLA-matched donor is available， allogeneic HSCT should be considered. In this study， we have reported the outcome of HSCT in a CDAII patient**\n\n【58】**having severe clinical features. This is the first study reporting the mRNA expression level of the SEC23B gene before and after HSCT in the CDAII case in the Indian population. The mRNA expression level was significantly decreased suggesting the clinical severity and it was almost equal to that of healthy individuals after treatment with a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Post HSCT， the patient is now normal， healthy， and completely transfusion independent.**\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Acknowledgment**</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**We would like to thank patients and family members for their cooperation and participation in this study.

The second day after her arrival， she presented abdominal pain， inmmediately after her last dose of terlipressin. A consultation to our department was made. Upon examination， she presented with signs of acute abdomen and tachycardia， abdominal radiography revealed a stack of coin image， CT scan revealed bowel loop dilation ， and her hemoglobine levels went from 9.8 mg/dL to 6.1 mg/dL in less than 24 hours， she also presented hypoalbuminemia (1.7 g/dL) and hyperbilirubinemia (Total，3.74 mg/dL； direct 2.57/dL).**\n\n【28】**Under the suspicion of acute mesenteric ischemia we decided to _P_ perform an exploratorylaparotomy， finding small intestine ischemia， with mesenteric pulse and peristalsis and no signs of intestinal necrosis observed . Because of these findings， we decided to close up the abdomen and perform a second look surgery 48 hours later. In the meantime the terlipressin was suspended and she was treated with IV fluids. During those 48 hours endoscopic banding of varices was performed and treatment with a low molecular weight heparin was initiated. Second look surgery was performed， observing a complete remission of intestinal ischemia， she still presented adecuate mesenteric pulse and peristalsis .

In history， he said growing left neck mass in 5 months. Neck ultrasound (USG)， neck CT and chest CT were done before coming to our clinics. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) results from mass were reported as metastatic adenocarcinoma. Patients PET was performed and hypermetabolic areas were found in the left cervical region and rectum. Two tumor biopsies were taken from rectum at different times for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes and reported as negative， therefore， neck dissection was planned. Round encapsulated mass with 3x2. 7x2. 5 cm was detected in left carotid bifurcation， intraoperatively. The mass was excised by working in subadventisyel. As pathology results， the mass was reported as paraganglioma， on the other hand， the neck dissection material was reported as reactive hyperplasia. Preoperative fine needle aspiration biopsy results can lead to incorrect diagnoses. The carotid body tumors can be misdiagnosed as malignancies in histopathological evaluation. We believe that the preoperative evaluation of the patient by a multidisciplinary team composed of oncologist， otolaryngologist， pathologist and radiologist will reduce this possibility.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Carotid body tumor； Adenocarsinoma； Biopsy**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Neck swelling is quite frequent seen in various medical disciplines such as oncology， pathology， ear-nose-throat， general surgery， internal medicine， pediatrics， thoracic surgery，radiotherapy and creates a common interest. The neck is the busiest parts of the body's lymphatic network and very different and a lot of neoplasm can be seen in the neck. For this reason， the differential diagnosis is important in neck masses. In differential diagnosis； history， ultrasonography (USG)， computed tomography (CT)， magnetic resonance (MR)， fine needle aspiration (FNA) is utilized. FNA has become the standard in the diagnosis and treatment of neck masses. Different opinions regarding the success of FNA in the diagnosis has been reported in the literature \\[1，2\\]. The experience is important for receipt， preparation and evaluation of aspiration. The most important reason for misdiagnosis was shown as aspiration from inappropriate places and improper preparation \\[1，2\\]. FNA is a good method in the diagnosis ofhead and neck malignancies， especially a highly sensitive method for the detection of metastatic carcinoma of the lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The carotid body tumors are rare tumors developing from paraganglionic cells of the carotid body and they are often found in common carotid artery bifurcation. The carotid body tumors are rare， asymptomatic，slow-growing and usually benign tumors. Malignant transformation of tumor is between 3-10 % and metastasis has been published as 2% \\[4，5\\]. Metastatic spread often happens to regional lymph nodes.**\n\n【15】**In this article， we present a patient with carotid body tumor misdiagnosed as adenocarcinoma metastases in the light of the literature.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**Forty-three-year-old female patient with a mass in the neck was forwarded to us by oncologist with the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown. In history， he said growing left neck mass in 5 months. Neck ultrasound (USG)， neck CT and chest CT were done before coming to our clinics. In the neck CT， there was a ovoid， smooth contours of approximately 30x20x45 mm in size and isodense mass pushing the left internal carotid artery (ICA) posteriorly， and locating in the posterior of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle . Fine needle aspiration (FNA) results from mass were reported as metastatic adenocarcinoma. Patients PET was performed and hypermetabolic areas were found in the left cervical region and rectum. Two tumor biopsies were**\n\n【18】Figure 2： Previous image before intra operative dissection.\n\n【19】**taken from rectum at different times for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes and reported as negative， therefore， neck dissection was planned. Round encapsulated mass with 3x2. 7x2. 5 cm was detected in left carotid bifurcation， intraoperatively. The mass was excised by working in subadventisyel . As pathology results， the mass was reported as paraganglioma， on the other hand， the neck dissection material was reported as reactive hyperplasia.**\n\n【20】**Postoperative complications were not observed in the patient. Although flushing episodes were observed in the patient’s in first postoperative days， these complaints were disappeared in follow-up.**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**Neck mass is a common pathological condition involving many medical disciplines. All tumors should be approached with a suspected neck malignancy until proved otherwise， and primary studies should be performed in order to determine the pathology taking into account the possibility of a metastasis.Therefore， detailed ENT examination in the approach of the neck masses is vital especially in metastatic neoplasms. It is not possible to identify the primary focus without a complete ear， nose， and throat examination. Multidisciplinary approach should be followed in the diagnosis of mass such as radiology， pathology， oncology branches. In our case， oncology directed the patient to our clinics in the diagnosis stage； FNA diagnosed incorrectly， preliminary results of PET / CT results have led us to have the wrong directions.**\n\n【23】**The staging of head and neck tumors is an important part of diagnosis and treatment. Especially， in locally advanced head and neck cancer are about 10% in the distant metastatic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.PET/CT provide bothlocal staging and showing distant metastases and it is a good opportunity in this regard affecting the patient management. In a study， especially， high-risk patients were selected and evaluated for synchronous and metachronous metastases of patients as the first staging of head and neck cancer and it was conducted in F-18**\n\n【24】**Figure 3： Image after excision of the mass.**\n\n【25】**FDG PET / CT. The sensitivity and specificity for distant metastasis were 96.8% and 95.4%， respectively， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In our case PET/ CT results， hyper metabolic areas of the rectum were followed and rectal adenocarcinoma is thought to be inducing metastasis in the neck. Tumor biopsies were taken from the rectum twice and have resulted as negatives in both of them. Although PET / CT have high reliability， fallibility should be kept in mind.**\n\n【26】**Head and neck masses develop due to inflammatory， infectious， benign or malignant neoplasms， and cystic lesions. The story of the patient and clinical findings are necessary for diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However， morphological examination is necessary in order to make a definitive diagnosis in most cases. In addition， during preoperative evaluation， accurate diagnosis is of paramount importance in determining the surgical and technical technique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Therefore， importance of FNA in the diagnosis and treatment planning increases. FNA is cheap， reliable and easy diagnostic methods to apply. However， different opinions in the literature regarding the diagnosis success of FNA has been reported \\[1，2\\]. In a study reported by Ozbay et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>regarding to non thyroidal FNA results containing all head and neck masses， they reported 68 patients with 95.1% accuracy， 97.5% sensitivity，92.8% specificity， 1.5% false positive and 2.9% false negative results. In our case， treatment plans has changed completely due to wrong result as adenocarcinoma metastasis.**\n\n【27】**In the histopathological basis of carotid body tumor， the majority of main cells and supporting cells that surround them create \"zellball island\". Main cells contain cell nuclei with fine chromatin network structure and amfofilik or eosinophilic cytoplasm. These cells are sometimes as short cords in carcinoid tumors， sometimes gland-like structures as in adenocarcinoma， and sometimes rosette-like structures as seen in neuroblastic tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Therefore， histological differential diagnosis is required in cytological differential diagnosis of these tumors. Our patient was misdiagnosed as metastasis of adenocarcinoma. This kind of differential diagnosis to avoid misdiagnosis is necessary to rule out the possibilities.**\n\n【28】**The carotid body tumor is caused by chemoreceptor tissue in the carotid bifurcation. It is frequently benign and non functional. Growing mass in theanterior necktriangle should raise this pathology. Due to the slow development， it is often asymptomatic until it reaches a certain size 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. They remain silent until they press cranial nerve or vascular structures. In patients with functional， it can occur with symptoms related tothe release ofcatecholamines. It is more common in women and at high altitudes. They are tend to be seen together with other cervical paraganglioma of carotid body tumors， head and neck and other malignant paraganglioma (lung， larynx， breast carcinoma)**\n\n【29】**and are tend to be bilateral or multiple. Therefore， each patient with unilateral mass should be examined carefully including all neck and thorax \\[13，14\\]. In our case， it wasasymptomatic left neck mass growing in five months， and it has no symptoms， no family history. There was no other focus showed by the body scan.**\n\n【30】**The choice of therapy for carotid body tumor should be planned considering patient’s symptoms， age， tumor size， growth rate and complications of the surgery. Radiotherapy and / or embolization can be selected because it has slow growth pattern， low malignancy and surgical treatment risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In our case， the mass was excised by working in subadventisyel and postoperative complications were not observed in the patient.**\n\n【31】**Conclusion**\n\n【32】**Unknown primary tumors of the neck should be evaluated multidisciplinary. A detailed ENT examination and all attempts must be carried out carefully in order to find primary tumor. FNA is one of the diagnostic phase， therefore it should be done professionally and should be reported by a good cytologist. Otherwise， patients with suspected cancer may be uneasy for months like our patient. The patient waited 3-4 months until reaching surgical pathology report as benign. If the patient was admitted to our clinic directly and FNA results was diagnosed correctly， the patient would not be uneasiness tor 3-4 months.**\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

It is found more often in the non-bulbar area with worse prognosis compared with Caucasians. No consensus is reached regarding the standard surgical treatment of palpebral CM. We presented a 39-year-old Chinese female who developed CM at her right eye， involving superonasalpalpebral conjunctiva，superonasal bulbar conjunctiva and medial caruncle. We excised the lesion including underlying Tenon capsule and the main part of underlying tarsus with a maximum clear margin of 4 mm， while sparing the tarsus of the eyelid margin. We applied a hemi-depth lamellar incision on the eyelid margin tarsus to preserve the contour of eyelid. Double freeze-thaw cryotherapy was applied to the excision margin， and the conjunctival deficit was closed by an amniotic membrane graft. We provided post-operation adjuvant chemotherapy with 0.02% Mitomycin Cthree times daily for a schedule of three weeks on， one week off. Good cosmetic outcome was achieved with no recurrence in the following 35 months. Tarsus is important in lid function and for aesthetic appearance. To achieve wide-enough safety margin and intact eyelid contour， we presented a new simple approach with good cosmetic outcome and desirable disease control in palpebral CM surgery.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Blepharoplasty； Conjunctival neoplasms； Melanoma**\n\n【18】**Key Messages**\n\n【19】**Non-bulbar conjunctival melanoma is associated with poor prognosis especially in the Chinese population. The wide excision with externallamellar lid margin tarsus sparing was a simple approach that yielded good cosmetic outcome and desirable disease control.**\n\n【20】**Introduction**\n\n【21】**Conjunctival Melanoma (CM) is a rare and highly recurrent malignancy that primarily affects old Caucasians in their 60s. CM annual age-adjusted incidence rates (1 million person years) for different races were 0.49 for non-Hispanic Whites， 0.18 for Blacks and 0.15 for Asians 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Bulbar conjunctiva is the most common site ofCM， affecting 60% to 92% of cases， and half ofthem involving the limbus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.CM in Chinese patients， with 70% to 95% of them invading non-bulbar area，leading to a poorer prognosis \\[3，4\\]. Surgical treatment for bulbar melanoma has long been reported， but little has been discussed on the aspect of reconstruction related to palpebral conjunctival melanoma. Cases reported are mainly limited to those undergoing tarsoconjunctival graft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， Hughes tarsoconjunctival flap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and total-tarsus-sparing surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Here， we demonstrated a novel and relatively simple surgical approach for treating palpebral CM. This surgical method achieves wider safety margin without grafting， prevents donor-induced wound on donor site， as well as a good aesthetic appearance.**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**A 39-year-old Chinese female with no systemic disease presented with a pigmented lesion at the superonasal palpebral conjunctival of her right eye . The lesion existed since her age of 32 years， and enlarged progressively over the recent two months. There were no associated**\n\n【24】**Figure 1： Large nodular conjunctival melanoma involving superior palpebral conjunctiva， superior fornix， caruncle and superior bulbar conjunctiva over right eye. The eyelid margins are spared. No feeding vessel is seen.**\n\n【25】**Figure 2： Diagrams to illustrate the surgery design. The melanoma invaded palpebral， forniceal， bulbar and caruncle area (red line). We excised the bulbar conjunctival lesion including the underlying Tenon capsule (green block)， as well as palpebral conjunctival lesion with full thickness of the tarsus underneath melanoma (blue block). The conjunctival lesion within two millimeters superior to lid margin was excised with hemi-depth lamellar tarsectomy (yellow block).**\n\n【26】**complaints related to the central nervous system， chest or abdomen. On examination， an elevated dark-brown lesion measuring 15 mm in size was located at 12 o'clock to 3 o’clock area of right palpebral conjunctiva， invading caruncle， superior fornix and superior bulbar conjunctiva. The lesion was close to but did not invade the eyelid margin. Her visual acuity was 6/6.7OD and 6/5 OS. Other ophthalmic examinations including those of the anterior chamber and B scan were all unremarkable. No palpable lymphadenopathy was detected over the submandibular， cervical， preauricular and parotid areas. The patient's systemic work-up including general physical examination， chest X-ray， abdominal sonography， brain MRI and Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT were also unremarkable.**\n\n【27】**We performed a wide local excision with a planar clear margin**\n\n【28】**Figure 4： Post-operation clinical appearance of the patient's eyes. Note the contour of right upper eyelid is intact with good cosmesis.**\n\n【29】**of 4 mm as much as possible. It started from the superior palpebral conjunctiva to the superior bulbar conjunctiva， including caruncle and superior fornix. We excised deep to the underlying Tenon capsule and tarsus， while sparing the external hemi-depth lamellar tarsus of superior eyelid margin， which was 2 mm superior to eyelid margin， to preserve the function of eyelid with enough safety margin. Double freeze-thaw cryotherapy was applied over the conjunctival excision borders and the base of palpebral conjunctival excision site. The residual conjunctival defect was closed with an amniotic membrane graft， using a second set of instruments to avoid contamination. The symblepharon ring was inserted in place. The final histopathology revealed malignant melanoma arising from Primary Acquired Melanosis (PAM) with moderate atypia， with microinyasion<1mm. The Breslow thickness was less than 1mm. The resection margin was free of tumor but less than 1 mm in distance to the peripheral and deep margin . Lymph-vascular invasion and perineural invasion were not identified. The final clinical staging was cT2cN0M0， according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual (8h edition) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【30】**The patient appeared unable to tolerate the symblepharon ring and symblepharon with shallow upper fornix was observed. We reconstructed， 7 weeks after primary surgery， a superior fornix with a contralateral conjunctival graft. No obvious syndromes of dry eye for diplopia were noted after surgery. Topical adjuvant chemotherapy was applied considering the higher recurrence risk related to pagetoid pattern of pathology. We started the patient on topical chemotherapy**\n\n【31】**one week after the fornix reconstruction， allowing the wound to heal. The three-week course of topical chemotherapy was followed by one-week of rest and repeated for 12 cycles. Follow-ups of 35 months showed no recurrence of melanoma with good cosmetic outcome.**\n\n【32】**Discussion**\n\n【33】**About the surgery for conjunctival melanoma， the \"no touch\"surgical technique was firstly described by Shields et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> and was widely accepted.Wide excision and reconstruction with clean instruments can prevent the tumor from recurrence and metastases related to inadequate surgical treatment or iatrogenic seeding. The excision of underlying Tenon capsule in bulbar CM is widely performed， and lamellar scleral dissection is suggested if the Tenon capsule is involved or scleral adhesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In our case， the underlying Tenon capsule was not involved， so we did not perform lamellar scleral dissection.**\n\n【34】**Different from bulbar conjunctiva， which isloosely attached to the sclera by the Tenon capsule， the palpebral conjunctiva adheres firmly to the tarsus. In palpebral CM， posterior lamellar eyelid resection is often conducted. The defect of tarsus and conjunctiva can be repaired by the Hughes technique or nasal cartilage with mucous membrane通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Some may excise the conjunctival lesion only with tarsus sparing to preserve the eyelid function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. If the lesions extend onto the eyelid margin or skin， a full thickness eyelid resection is required. In our case， the melanoma invaded both bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva with eyelid margin sparing. We excised the posterior lamellar of eyelid， namely the conjunctiva and the full-thickness of tarsus underneath the palpebral CM， and performed the superficial lamellar tarsal excision at the eyelid margin， leaving hemi-depth of residual tarsus to preserve the normal eyelid contour. The surgical technique in this patient created a larger safety margin than total-tarsus-sparing procedure and was much simpler in reconstruction compared with conventional posterior lamellar evelid resection due to no need of grafting. A good functional and aesthetic outcome was achieved with no tumor recurrence in 35-month follow-up.**\n\n【35】**Post-operative adjuvant therapy is also important in treating conjunctival melanoma. Topical chemotherapy such as mitomycin C is widely used. There is no recommended dose and treatment cycle duration， but the convention is 0.04% mitomycin C four times a day for 1 to 3 weeks， followed by 1-week rest or topical steroids通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In addition to mitomycin C， others use interferon alpha-2B as an alternative due to its fewer adverse events. Brachytherapy is another adjuvant treatment and has effects on sclera， deeper than the topical mitomycin C. For extensive tumors， proton radiotherapy is used after excision and conjunctival mapping if patients refuse exenteration. At present， no effective systemic treatment is available for CM. Recent studies reported benefits of immunotherapy of CM using checkpoint inhibitors (like nivolumab or pembrolizumab)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In view ofthe high similaritybetween cutaneous melanoma and conjunctival melanoma， the efficacies of BRAF/MEK inhibitors are also being evaluated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. We prescribed 0.02% mitomycin C three times daily instead of 0.04%regarding that higher dose was related to limbal stem cell failure in some cases. Our patient went through topical chemotherapy well and showed no melanoma recurrence in the following 35 months.**\n\n【36】**For CM， prognostic factors include tumor location， tumor thickness， andits origin and histopathology findings. Bulbar melanoma’s outcome is better than those involving other sites， like limbus， cornea， fornix， palpebral conjunctiva and caruncle. Tumors**\n\n【37】**\\>2 mm thick (as measured from epithelial surface to the substantia propria involved) have higher stagings and poorer prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. De novo melanoma develops metastasis and mortality worse than those arising from nevi or PAM with atypia. Histopathology involving epithelioid cells， pagetoid growth， absence of inflammatory response and lymphatic invasion are associated with a poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In our present case， the tumor was located at palpebral conjunctiva， which is a site with unfavorable outcome. The pathology with pagetoid growth is also associated with poorer prognosis. Apart from the above conditions， our patient's tumor originated from PAM and was <2 mm thick， both of which are associated with a better outcome.**\n\n【38】**Very few case reports and series of CM are available for Chinese and other Asians. Compared to Caucasians， Chinese patients tend to have poorer prognosis with the younger population， with more cases of de novo origin， or located at the non-bulbar area， showing multifocal lesions， more metastases and tumor related deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Another study on Asian Indians showed the same trend of younger patients， more de novo in origin， and metastasis rate higher than Caucasians， but with fewer local recurrences and more incidents of bulbar melanoma \\[151.**\n\n【39】**Conclusion**\n\n【40】**CM in Chinese is found more often in the non-bulbar area with poorer prognosis compared with Caucasians. There are very few studies on the treatment and reconstruction of palpebral CM. We here reported a new and simple surgical technique that achieved good disease control without grafting and donor site wound， as well as desirable cosmetic results. More cases and longer follow-up periods are needed to assess long-term outcomes.**\n\n【41】**Ethical Approval Statement**\n\n【42】**All procedures performed in studies involving human participant were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.

Primary lesions in head and neck region had come up with better prognosis compared to other primary sites hence management of such jawlesions is a challenge particularly in pediatric patients during first decade of life as functional impairment and facial disfigurement may affects the quality of life. Here we are discussing a unique case of primary lesion of horizontal region of mandible with special focus on use of radiation therapy， radiation dose related effects and spontaneous bone regeneration.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Primary Ewing's sarcoma； Radiotherapy； Spontaneous bone regeneration； Secondary sarCOmas**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Ewing's sarcoma of jaws is a rare primary malignancy affecting children and adolescents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， initially described by James Ewing in 1921 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Given the rarity of Ewing-s sarcoma it is usually not included in differential diagnosis of radiolucent lesions affecting horizontal region of mandible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Chemotherapy with local control therapy are the main treatment modalities. Role of radiotherapy is limited in pediatric patients due to its deleterious effects on craniofacial growth and induction of secondary sarcomas. Spontaneous bone healing with large mandibular defects even after giving radiotherapy depicts that bone healing capacity is high in growing patients.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**Aneight-year-old boy reported to the departmentofOral and Maxillofacial surgery GDC Shimla with history of swelling left side of face for 6 months， associated with dull， episodic， non-radiating pain without any discharge and trismus. On intraoral examination a swelling of size approximately3.5 cm x 4.5 cm， extending from lower left deciduous incisor to lower first permanent molar， obliterating the buccal sulcus， with no change in mucosal color was present. On palpation swelling was tender， non-fluctuant， non-compressible， hard， and adhering to underlying bone and no signs of paresthesia were present. History of spontaneous loosening of tooth following swelling and pain was there. On OPG a mixed radiolucent radio opaque lesion with ill-defined borders involving the tooth bud of 34 extending to the inferior border of mandible was present (Figure1). Plain computed tomography scan showed a lytic expansile lesion with speculated periosteal reaction in left mandible associated with cervical lymphadenopathy .**\n\n【20】**Incisional biopsy of suspected lesion was performed and revealed malignant round cell tumor. Further immunohistochemistry of jaw lesion revealed positivity for CD99 and neuron specific enolase giving the probability of diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma.**\n\n【21】**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of mandible revealed heterogeneously enhancing mass in relation to mandible on left side with erosion， destruction & extension into floor of mouth involving muscles and cheek with cervical lymphadenopathy. X-Ray long bones， PA chest and bone marrow biopsy from anterior iliac crest performed to rule out any primary foci oflesion， the negative report ofwhich proved that lesion is primary in mandible.**\n\n【22】**After final diagnosis， patient was referred to regional cancer Centre for chemotherapy； there he received four cycles of chemotherapy including injections Ifosfamide， Etoposide， doxorubicin and vincristine， which yielded good clinical response i.e. noticeable size reduction in primary lesion. Then submandibular incision extending from below the tragus up to midline given after**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： OPG showing a mixed radiolucent radio-opaque lesion with ill defined borders.**\n\n【24】**Figure 5： Segmental Mandibulectomy followed by reconstruction with adaption plate.**\n\n【25】**Figure 2： 3D CT scan showing destruction of mandible.**\n\n【26】**Figure 6： 1F-FDG PET-CT SCAN at one year follow-up.**\n\n【27】**Figure 3： Histopathological slide with small round cells at 40x.**\n\n【28】**Figure 7： Spontaneous regeneration of bone after 2 years follow-up.**\n\n【29】**Figure 4： Surgical exposure of primary lesion.**\n\n【30】**at an interval of 21 days followed by radiotherapy @ 45 Gy in 25#s. At one-year follow-up IF-FDG PET-CT SCAN done， revealed no recurrence and no secondary metastases . During follow-up b/t 3 to 6 months on (OPG) there was evidence of spontaneous bone formation at the resected margins which was clearer on follow up radiographs .

During the procedure as much of periosteum as possible was preserved. Post-surgery patient received4 cycles of chemotherapy including injections Etoposide， Ifosfamide**\n\n【32】**Discussion**\n\n【33】**Although Ewing's sarcoma is most common in long bones and pelvis but cases of primary lesion have been seen in head and neck region， affecting the bones of the skull or face in about 1% to 4% of the cases. Among jaw bones， mandible is more commonly affected than the maxilla， with an incidence from 1% to 10%. Previous case**\n\n【34】**reports of primary lesion of jaws have concluded posterior region of mandible most commonly affected site due to increase in marrow content compared to anterior region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Uniqueness of this case is related to the site of origin oflesion i.e. the body region of mandible.**\n\n【35】**The clinical signs and symptoms include swelling， pain， loose teeth， paresthesia， ulceration， trismus and toothache. It is observed radiographically as an expansile osteolytic lesion with or without cortical erosion and bone expansion that can be related to the differential diagnosis of following oral lesions such as osteomyelitis， eosinophilic granuloma， giant cell tumor， simple bone cyst， aneurysmal bone cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Current case revealed， displacement， root resorption of deciduous teeth and absence of inferior alveolar canal outline.**\n\n【36】**H/P it is poorly differentiated small round cell tumor， involving various diseases as its differential diagnosis i.e. rhabdomyosarcoma， neuroblastoma， lymphoblastic lymphoma and small cell carcinoma通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Therefore， Immunohistochemistry analysis (CD99， FLI1) is necessary for its diagnosis. Based upon degree of differentiation of neuroectodermal cells these tumors may also express Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE)， synaptophysin and S-100 protein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. CD99 can also be positive in rhabdomyosarcoma， neuroblastoma， lymphoblastic lymphoma and small cell carcinoma.FL11 is positive for neuroblastoma， lymphoblastic lymphoma. NSE positivity has been seen in neuroendocrine tumors. Synaptophysin positive in EFT/PNET，therefore， FISH or PCR is crucial for identification of EWSR1translocation t(11；22)(q24；q12) and t(21；22) (q22；q12) but also not specific for ES. Hence combined morphogenic， radiographic and genetic features required for definitive diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【37】**Improved treatment modalities have led to increased survival rate of primary lesions of jaws， therefore its early diagnosis， functional and esthetic rehabilitation of complicated anatomy of face is dare demanding for Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons. Multimodal treatment approach including induction chemotherapy followed by surgical resection and post-operative radiotherapy was planned for this case. As per NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for bone cancers 2018通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， chemotherapy is recommended for all patients regardless of the status of surgical margins and the time for chemotherapy should be between 28 to 49 weeks following wide excision.**\n\n【38】**Chemotherapy with local control therapy should be the mainstay for primary Ewing's sarcoma treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for bone cancers 2018 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， suggests adjuvant**\n\n【39】**radiotherapy for positive Margins. Radiotherapy plays an important role in patients who need functional preservation (Head and neck region) and unresectable tumors (spine， vertebrae， weight bearing bones) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. But according to the author， Chatzistefanou I， et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> radiotherapy generally avoided in pediatric patients because of induction of secondary cancers at radiated site and interference with the facial growth. Kuttesh et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> collected data from 266 survivors of Ewing's sarcoma and concluded that evolution of secondary sarcoma is radiation dose dependent. A radiation dose >60 Gy are associated with higher risk compared to dose <60 Gy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.Our case is a satisfactory example of this statement that secondary sarcomas do not develop if dose is <60 Gy as such complications has not been seen in two year follow up.**\n\n【40】**Contemporary reconstruction of surgical defect subsequent to wide surgical resection is an important consideration. Primary goals of reconstruction in Oral and Maxillofacial region should be restoration of excellent functional and esthetic unit. Reconstruction methods which include autogenous andallogenic materials. Autogenous reconstruction methods i.e. free vascularized grafts have revolutionized the field of reconstructive surgery throughout last decades however their use is limited in pediatric patients due to following side effects like flap harvesting， small dimensions of the vessels， airways issue， anesthesia complexities4 and graft site morbidity.**\n\n【41】**It is not for the first time that spontaneous regeneration of a post resection mandible has reported. Bone regenerating capacity in jaws differs from other tissues which usually heal by scar formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Reconstruction was performed with Titanium adaption plate and spontaneous regeneration was observed which could be related to high cellular activity， abundant mesenchymal cells in young patients differentiating into osteogenic cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This regeneration was positively influenced by the intact periosteum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> as it is a well-known source of osteoprogenitor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. And its preservation is crucial for spontaneous bone healing.**\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Pazopanib， a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor approved for first line treatment in metastatic renal cell cancer and second line therapy for advanced sarcoma， is rarely associated with lung complications. However， interstitial lung damage is the major problem associated with coronavirus pandemic and the cause of severe respiratory syndrome. We describe the development ofpneumonitis in a patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with pazopanib during the peak of coronavirus disease in Italy. This report notifies the possible onset of pazopanib induced pneumonitis and how to diagnose and manage drug induced interstitial lung disease during the pandemic ofcoronavirus.**\n\n【24】**Keywords： Interstitiallung disease； Pneumonitis； Coronavirus； Renal cell carcinoma； Pazopanib**\n\n【25】**Abbreviations**\n\n【26】**COVID-19： Coronavirus Disease 2019； SARS-CoV2： Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2； RT-PCR： Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction； CT： Computed Tomography； ILD： Lung Interstitial Disease； TKI： Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor； VEGF： Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor；RCC： Renal Cell Cancer； EGFR： Epithelial Growth Factor Receptors**\n\n【27】**Introduction**\n\n【28】**Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious respiratory syndrome caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) that was first identified in Wuhan (China) in December 2019. It rapidly spread worldwide causing thousands of deaths and a serious cluster of COVID-19 was reported in Italy， with a total of 9，136confirmed deaths on March 2020通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【29】**Common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever， cough， myalgia or fatigue； about 17% of patients positive for the infection complicated with lung damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for disease diagnosis but also Computed Tomography (CT)， thanks to its high sensitivity， plays a critical role. The major CT pattern of COVID-19 is bilateral ground glass opacities (50.2%)， mixed ground glass opacities plus consolidation (44.4%)， consolidations (24.2%)， and reticular pattern (9.9%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【30】**Nevertheless cough，fever， dyspnea， and hypoxemia are also clinical manifestations of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)， a reported complication of treatment with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI). ILD is usually diagnosed by exclusion of other causes oflung damage and， during TKI treatment，its incidence ranges between 0.35 to 1% with a mortality rate of 20% to 50%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Computed tomography can help oncologists to ILD diagnosis but imaging findings are nonspecific； the major CT patterns of ILD are area with ground-glass attenuation， a multifocal area of airspace consolidations， patchy distribution of ground-glass attenuation accompanied by interlobar septal thickening， and extensive bilateral ground-glass attenuation or airspace consolidations with traction bronchiectasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【31】**Among TKI， pazopanib targets Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor(VEGF)andplatelet-derived growth factor； it has demonstrated efficacy as first line treatment in metastatic clear cell Renal Cell Cancer (RCC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and after failure of standard chemotherapy in metastatic non-adipocytic soft-tissue sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Unlike other TKI， the association of ILD and pazopanib is not well defined and no cases of pazopanib induced ILD are reported in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.**\n\n【32】**Since COVID-19PpneumoniaaanddTKI-induced ILDhave similar clinical course and CT findings， we reported a clinical case of interstitial lung damage in a patient treated with pazopanib for metastatic RCC during the peak of COVID-19 in Italy.**\n\n【33】**Case and Methods**\n\n【34】**A 70-years old man， with a history of clear cell RCC， was transferred to our hospital for fever and dyspnea. He was a curren smoker of 13 pack years， in good clinical conditions with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of0. No significant comorbidities were present except for a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation treated with flecainide. In December 2014，he underwent a left nephrectomy for a clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Fuhrman grade 2) with infiltration of perirenal adipose tissue； the Tumor Node Metastasis stage was pT3N0. During his regular follow-up， in November 2019， an abdomen magnetic resonance revealed six nodular metastases of the right kidney and a chest CT showed a lung nodular metastasis of 12 mm above the left diaphragm. In December2019， he started oral therapy with pazopanib 800 mg daily. In March2020 after 12 weeks oftreatment， a total body CT scan was performed and showed stable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.**\n\n【35】**However， ten days after the CT scan， he complained of dyspnea， cough， and fever. On clinical examination， body temperature was38.4°C， blood pressure 130/65 mmHg， heart rate 77 bpm， and oxygen saturation 95%. Blood and urine cultures were negative for eIl bacterial and fungal infections. A chest radiograph was performed， demonstrating a bilateral lung reticular shadow .**\n\n【36】**Laboratory test on admission showed lactate dehydrogenase 263U/L， procalcitonin 0.09 ng/mL， creatinine 1.03 mg/dL， C-reactive protein 174.7 mg/L， white blood cells 8.03×10/uL，hemoglobin 12.6g/dL， platelets count 261 ×10/puL. An arterial blood gas showed a pH 7.452，pCO2 38.8， pO2 80.7 in VM60% P/F 135. Due to clinical worsening a high-resolution chest CT was performed and it showed bilateral ground-glass opacities with thickening of the interlobular septa consistent with interstitial pneumonia .**\n\n【37】**Figure 1： Chest X-ray at admission： diffuse bilateral areas of ill-defined lung opacities with a small parenchymal consalidation on the right base (red box).**\n\n【38】**Figure 2： Chest CT： bilateral and multifocal interlobular septal thickening(empty arrows in a) together with small ground glass opacities (white arrows in a) and a discrete consalidative apacity (red box in b).

Bronchoalveolar lavage resulted negative for cancer cells as well as for common and opportunistic infections including Mycobacterium and Aspergillus. Moreover， the research of SARS-CoV-2 was performed on the bronchial fluid， resulting negative.**\n\n【43】**Patient started empirical antibiotic treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 h and methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg IV. In the following days there was a gradual improvement of clinical symptoms and hypoxia. He was discharged on day 21 with steroid tapering at home.**\n\n【44】**On day 24 patient re-started treatment with pazopanib but after only 4 days， he was readmitted to hospital for fever and dyspnea. Laboratory test showed C-reactive protein 140.8 mg/L，procalcitonin0.08 ng/mL， white blood cells 6.37 ×10/uL， platelets count 231×10/uL. Symptoms resolved with pazopanib stopping and retreatment with high dose steroid.**\n\n【45】**Immunoglobulin G for COVID-19 were performed on day60， after symptoms resolution， and confirmed negative for the viral infection. The first follow up chest X-ray on day 60 showed a significant reduction of lung abnormalities ， and the last chest CT after five months of pazopanib discontinuation showed the total disappearance of lung infiltrates .**\n\n【46】**Radiological findings， clinical course， and negative tests for common， opportunistic， and SARS-CoV-2 infection， led us to the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease caused by pazopanib treatment.**\n\n【47】**Discussion**\n\n【48】**We report a clinical case of interstitial disease induced by pazopanib at the time of the outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy， so generating diagnostic troubles.**\n\n【49】**Typical outset of drug induced ILD is with fever and respiratory symptoms； CT scan shows nonspecific signs of interstitial pneumonia， but an exclusive diagnostic test is missing， and so diagnosis is usually made by exclusion of other causes of lung damage.**\n\n【50】**Pulmonary events are more frequently reported with Epithelial Growth Factor Receptors (EGFR) inhibitors and ILD incidence in trials with erlotinib， gefitinib or afatinib ranged from 0.5% to 5.3%8.**\n\n【51】**For VEGF TKI used in the treatment of metastatic RCC，lung complications are reported with sunitinib and sorafenib 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In a retrospective series of targeted therapies in metastatic RCC， 65.4%of patients after the resolution of drug-induced ILD switched to subsequent targeted therapies without any ILD-reoccurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Despite its biological mechanism similar to other TKI that caused ILD， it is a rare complication during treatment with pazopanib. A previous case of interstitial pneumonia correlated to pazopanib was reported in a man with leiomyosarcoma suffering from chronic lung disease. He was treated with high-dose methylprednisolone and immunosuppressant tacrolimus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. More recently， another case of organizing pneumonia in a patient treated with pazopanib for a leiomyosarcoma was published. The histological specimen from the bronchoscopy revealed intraluminal fibrosis alveolar spaces and confirmed the diagnosis of pazopanib-related organizing pneumonia. A gradual improvement was obtained after treatment with oral prednisolone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Similarly to our case， time to onset of symptoms in these reports was respectively two and four months after the start of pazopanib treatment. No previous data exist about pulmonary**\n\n【52】**complications induced by pazopanib in patients with renal cell carcinoma.**\n\n【53】**COVID-19 breaks out after an incubation of 2 to 7 days with fever and dry cough.

The pattern of metastases is similar between upper urinary tract and bladder urothelial carcinoma： Lymph nodes，liver，bone and lung. Here we describe a case report where a 43-years-old man affected by urothelial carcinoma of ureter underwent right nephroureterectomy and retroperitoneal lymph nodes dissection and then it was administered adjuvant chemotherapy (4 cycles of cisplatin/gemcitabine). Then， during his clinical and radiological follow-up， some uncommon sites of metastases were found， such as stomach， peritoneum， left axillary， right and left supraclavicular lymph node. At the end of five cycles of first-line chemotherapy， he developed symptoms connected to Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis(LMC)， which is absolutely an atypical site of relapse for this kind oftumor. Patient was treated with intrathecal methotrexate 12 mg once weekly and second-line therapy with Pembrolizumab 200 mg flat dose for four cycles. In literature we have found only other two case reports which describe LMC in urothelial carcinoma of upper urinary tract and no patient affected by this tumor treated with systemic immunotherapy and intrathecal chemotherapy for LMC. Our patient died three months after the LMC diagnosis， supporting the fact that the prognosis for this site of metastasis is poor.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Urothelial carcinoma； Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis； Metastatic**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis (LMC) is a very unusual metastatic localization for urothelial carcinoma of ureter. In this case report we describe a 43-years-old man affected by this kind of tumor with atypical sites of relapse： Stomach， peritoneum， left axillary， right and left supraclavicular lymph node and finally LMC. The treatment for LMC from solid tumors is not established， but Intrathecal Therapy (IT)， radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy according to primary tumor are usually administered \\[1，2\\]. In literature there are not many metastatic presentations like this， as well as few descriptions of treatment based on systemic immunotherapy and IT for LMC.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**In February 2019， a 43-years-old Caucasian man， presented hematuria. He had no concomitant diseases. His familiar history was positive for breast cancer (grandmother and sister). An abdominal ultrasound scan identified right hydronephrosis of grade II-III and pelvic expansion of right ureter. A contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) of chest and abdomen confirmed the presence of right hydronephrosis and a mass of 2 cm ofureter， the bladder had irregular walls，retroperitoneal lymph nodes were enlarged， the major of them of 2 cm × 1.2 cm. A Cystoscopy revealed normal mucous membrane without macroscopic alterations with thickening of the right walls. In March2019， a right nephroureterectomy and retroperitoneal lymph nodes dissection were performed. A macroscopic examination showed 5 cm mass of right ureter. Histological examination found a papillary and not papillary urothelial carcinoma of right ureter， G3， and metastatic involvement of only one of three lymph nodes.

His blood examination was normal， in particular serum creatinine was 1.24 mg/dl with estimation Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) >60 ml/min. He was fit for cisplatin-based chemotherapy； in particular he had no cardiovascular， audiometric and neurological**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： PET-CT showed elevated uptake of stomach (SUVmax 10.9).**\n\n【23】**Figure 2： PET-CT showed elevated uptake of left armpit (SUVmax 6.4).**\n\n【24】**alterations. From April to July 2019， our patients received 4 cycles of first line intravenous chemotherapy with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m’on days 1-8 q21 plus cisplatin 70 mg/m’ on day 1-q21 without significant adverse events， except Grade (G) 1 nausea from day 1 to day 3 of chemotherapy and G1 fatigue according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event version5.0 (CTCAE v5.0). There was no relapse of disease at abdominal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and a chest CT scan performed in August 2019. He underwent observation with blood examination， urinary cytology， abdominal ultrasound/MRI and chest CT scan， all of these were negative.**\n\n【25】**Thirteen months later (September 2020)， patient complained G1left armpit pain， G2 abdominal pain， G2 nausea and G2 vomit.ECOG performance status score was 0. He showed weight loss of 7% in last6 months and reduced oral intake (50%) in past 7 days. An axillary ultrasound showed 5 cm ×1.7 cm ×3 cm mass of left armpit. Urinary cytology was negative for atypical cells. Abdomen ultrasound revealed6 mm mass of posterior portion of bladder. For gastrointestinal symptoms， patient received Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) and underwent Esophageal-Gastro-Duodenoscopy (EGDS) with biopsy that found diffusely edematous， hyperemic and hypertrophic mucosa from fundus to antral region of stomach； duodenal mucosa was edematous andhyperemicwith some superficialerosions. Histological examination revealed neoplastic cells positive for GATA3， CK7，p63at Immunohistochemistry analysis， with a possible urothelial origin. There was no alteration of mismatch repair proteins (MLH1，PMS2，**\n\n【26】**Figure 3： PET-CT showed elevated uptake of right and left superclavear lymph nodes (SUVmax 5.5 and 5.6， respectively).**\n\n【27】**MSH2，MSH6).**\n\n【28】**A (18F) Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in Combination with CT (PET-CT) showed elevated uptake of stomach (SUVmax 10.9) ， left armpit(SUVmax 6.4) ， right and left superclavear lymph nodes(SUVmax 5.5 and 5.6， respectively)  and peritoneum(SUVmax 3.8). Based on the long progression free survival after first line chemotherapy treatment， the good tolerance of first line of chemotherapy， the good clinical condition and young age of patient， between October and December 2020， were administered 4 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m’ on days1-8 q21 plus cisplatin 70 mg/m’ on day 1-q21. Then， FDG-PET-CT revealed a partial metabolic response， in particular， there were no uptake in stomach and peritoneum and there was uptake reduction ofleft armpit (SUVmax 2.5)， right and left superclavear lymph nodes(both with SUVmax 3). A Cystoscopy of control was negative. For the disappearance of abdominal symptoms and the recovery of normal weight (/increase of weight)， TPN was interrupted with a gradually intake of oral food. On January 20h， 2021 was administered， the patient was in good clinical conditions， he accused only G1 nausea and G1 vomiting from day 1 to day 3 of chemotherapy and G1 fatigue.**\n\n【29】**Ten days later after the fifth cycle of chemotherapy， for the onset of frontal headache， diplopia and visual blurring， the patient underwent ophthalmological evaluation showing bilateral hyperemic and edematous papillae with flame hemorrhages and peripapillary exudates. A brain CT scan described intracranial hypertension without brain metastaticlesions. There was mild tortuosity ofthe optic nerves and mild ectasia of perioptic sheaths， and a slight appearance detected of both optic papillae. There were no neurological alterations at clinical examination. So， he was admitted in the Neurology department. Neurological evaluation found diplopia with a deficit of left VI cranial nerve， mild anisocoria major on the left than right. A brain MRI confirmed intracranial hypertension and contrast enhancement involving of leptomeninges. A lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) was colorless， transparent， glucose and protein levels were normal (57 mg/dl and 46 mg/dl， respectively)， chloride was 131 mEq/l； cells count was increased(50 cells/uL) with lymphocytes and atypic cells. Cytological CSF examination revealed atypic cells positive for GATA 3 and negative for p63 and TTF1， with a possible metastatic localization ofurothelial carcinoma. Microbiological examination and CSF antibodies research**\n\n【30】**were negative.**\n\n【31】**Frontal headache was stopped after pharmacological treatment with acetazolamide but there was no benefit in left visual loss and appeared vomiting. The patient was transferred to the Oncology Department， for other evaluation and treatment. He received steroid， anti-emesis and anti-edema therapy. For leptomeningeal carcinomatosis， we decided tOadministeerrIntrathecaal(IT) methotrexate 12 mg weekly and concomitant second line of systemic treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab at flat dose of 200 mg intravenous on day 1 q21n (a total of four cycles were administered). Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) evaluation of DNA and RNA was performed in CSF of the first IT infusion， identifying uncommon alteration of exon 11 of BRAF gene (G466V)(missense) and of exon 3 of AKT1 gene (E17K) (missense)， did not found alteration of BRCA1 gene. NGS examination performed to the _following IT infusion did not identify gene alterations._**\n\n【32】**After 4 doses of IT chemotherapy， CSF was colorless， transparent， glucose level was normal (54 mg/dl)， protein was 68 mg/dl (elevated)， chloride was 123 mEq/l(normal)， cells count was decreased (1 cells/uL) but cytological CSF examination was still positive for atypical cells， so this treatment was interrupted after five IT methotrexate infusions.**\n\n【33】**At the beginning of April， he was admitted in the Oncology department because of sepsis from Pseudomonas aeruginosa； during the hospitalization he underwent a brain RMI which showed stable intracranial hypertension without contrast enhancement in leptomeninges. From the middle of April， his clinical condition became worse and worse because of the onset of epileptic seizures and progressive postural instability. He passed away at the beginning of May， three months after the diagnosis of LMC.**\n\n【34】**Discussion**\n\n【35】**Urothelialcarcinoma ofureterandrenalpelvis is rare，representing respectively 1% and 5% of all urothelial cancers. On the contrary， the most common histology of Bladder Cancer (BC) is urothelial one. More often these tumors metastasize to lymph nodes， liver， bone and lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Our patient showed atypical sites of metastasis， such as stomach， peritoneum， left axillary， right and left supraclavicular lymph nodes. Moreover， he had Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis(LMC)， which is absolutely an atypical site of metastasis of this kind of tumor.**\n\n【36】**Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis (LMC) consists in cancer cell localization in pia mater， arachnoid and in the space between them， called subarachnoid space. It is also called leptomeningeal disease and leptomeningeal metastasis. The percentage of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies that metastasize to leptomeninges is about5% to 8% and 5% to 15%. More often， lung cancer (9% to 25%)， breast cancer (5%to8%)and melanoma (6%to 18%) could show this particular metastatic site， with major incidence in some histological subtypes such as lobular histology and triple-negative molecular subtype for breast cancer and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-mutant disease.**\n\n【37】**In general， the incidence of LMC has increased because of new detection instruments for diagnosis. Most therapeutic arms are developing to control this kind of disease.**\n\n【38】**About 1.2 to 2 years occur from diagnosis of systemic solid cancer to LMC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Specifically， our patient developed LMC after 2**\n\n【39】**years. Onset symptoms were headache and blurred vision. When LMC started， FDG PET/TC showed partial response of the other metastasis sites. To our best knowledge， only two cases of metastatic urothelial cancer of upper urinary tract and LMC were reported in literature. Imamura et al. describe a case report where otologic symptoms (facial nerve paralysis and bilateral hearing loss) were the first clinical presentation of LMC from transitional carcinoma of renal pelvis： these symptoms were connected to the infiltration of malignant cells in temporal bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In Matsushita et al. case report it is described a transitional carcinoma of bladder and ureter， where LMC symptoms developed sixteenth month after radical cystectomy and right nephroureterectomy， and then patient died six days after LMC diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【40】**Actually LMC therapy consists in Intrathecal Therapy (IT)， systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Our patient was treated with five administrations of intrathecal methotrexate 12 mg once weekly. Moreover， in February 2021 he started second-line therapy with Pembrolizumab 200 mg flat dose every three weeks for four cycles.**\n\n【41】**Umezawa et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> collected 33 cases of LMC and metastatic BC； the majority of them were urothelial carcinoma， except for two cases with different histologies (adenocarcinoma and small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma).**\n\n【42】**As in most cases described in this review， our patient has developed LMC during the first-line chemotherapy， after the histological diagnosis of gastric relapse. Umezawa et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> reported that twenty-four patients were treated， while nine patients did not receive any treatment because their clinical conditions quickly became worse. 14 of 24 treated patients (58.3%) received IT chemotherapy (methotrexate alone in 13 pts， unknown in 1 pt). Seven patients (29.2%) underwent a radiotherapy treatment (in 1craniospinal radiotherapy，spinal radiotherapy in 1， and whole-brain radiotherapy in 5). Finally， two patients (8.3%) received systemic medical treatment， based on MVAC or Gemcitabina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【43】**In the present case， it was administered a combined treatment (IT and systemic immune-checkpoint inhibitor). If we analyze the review just mentioned， we can observe that seven patients， who underwent IT， received another therapy： Six patients also radiotherapy and one also systemic chemotherapy.**\n\n【44】**A recent case report describes LMC in a bladder cancer and its treatment： After the clinical and radiological manifestation of LMC， patient received whole-brain radiotherapy (30 Gy) and then immunotherapy， Pembrolizumab 200 mg， but he died of bladder cancer one month after the diagnosis of LMC通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【45】**Therefore in literature there is not a description of a treatment similar to our case： IT with MTX 12 mg weekly and Pembrolizumab200 mgq21.**\n\n【46】**According to the prognosis， our patients passed away 3 months after the diagnosis of LMC.

Its occurrence in solid cancers is exceptional with only 45 cases collected by Baeksgaard and Sorensen JB published between 1977 and 2002 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Thus， prognosis is poorer than with hematological malignancies due to a lack of early recognition and prevention.**\n\n【30】**We collected other cases of TLS in patients treated for metastatic colorectal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-6\\]</u>. Factors implicated to promote cell lysis or inhibit compensatory mechanisms included high tumor volume， metastatic presentation， bulky liver metastasis， high LDH and uric acid levels， and pre-existent renal insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In our case， the TLS occurrence after 2.5 weeks of concomitant chemo radiotherapy and rapid impressive tumor shrinkage was mainly due to DPD deficiency. The tumor volume was moderate and TLS couldn’t be anticipated.**\n\n【31】**Therefore， TLS diagnosis has to be discussed in patients with solid cancers， regardless the treatment regimen， due to its high risk of mortality and the need of immediate management， conversely to hematological tumors where prophylactic measures are anticipated8-14.**\n\n【32】**DPD screening for any patient receiving 5FU iss now a recommendation， it is rare but toxicity can be lethal. In February2018， the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) had advocated the search for a DPD deficiency for any patient concerned bychemotherapyincorporating fluoropyrimidines.

The antigens may be different proteins， carbohydrates， glycoproteins or glycolipids. It depends on the type of blood group. ABO and Rh blood group systems are the two types of blood group system. The ABO blood group system is used to denote the presence of one， both or neither of the A and B antigens on the red blood cells通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【16】**In Rh blood group system blood groups are classified on the basis of the presence or absence of Rh factor on the cell membrane of the red blood cell. The Rh blood group system consists of 49defined blood group antigens among which the five antigens D， C， c， Eand eare the most important\\[21.**\n\n【17】**Getting up early in the morning is very useful for health.

However， the patient's temperature returned to normal after intravenous fluids were discontinued.**\n\n【16】**Conclusion： Our case illustrates an unusual ELP presenting with drug fever that makes differential diagnosis more complicated. Clinicians should be aware of ELP pneumonia， which may manifest as infectious pneumonia.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Lipoid pneumonia； Drug fever； Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**_C_**\n\n【20】**Exogenous Lipoid Pneumonia (ELP) is a rare lung condition because of the inflammatory reaction caused by the presence of foreign fatty substances in the alveoli， its imaging findings are easily misdiagnosed as interstitial pneumonia or lung cancer. Diagnosis confirmation necessitates special staining of the Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) or lung biopsies \\[1，2\\]. Drug fever is particularly problematic whenever it occurs among patients with non-infection， and drug fever can result in overutilization of anti-infectives and other agents trying to treat non-existing infections， possibly resulting in an increase in the risk of complications. By comparison and summary， Baron“et al\". found that all individuals with acute ELP had fever for several days to weeks \"while all the patients with chronic ELP had no fever\". However， this study did not describe in detail the patients fever type and peak body temperature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The clinical manifestations of ELP vary， patients mainly presenting chronic cough， and a small number of patients will have chest pain，hemoptysis， weight loss， intermittent fever and so on 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The diversity observed with cases of drug fever makes it difficult to form general conclusions. No study has shown a pathogenetic correlation between ELP and drug-induced fever， the complicated with drug fever in present case remind us that fever in ELP patients may not be associated with ELP.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 76-year-old never smoking female， was admitted with fever and slight cough for 3 weeks. Fever symptoms occurred on December 06h， 2020 with a thermal peak of 39.5…C. Cough slightly with white foamy phlegm. Chest CT on December 09t， 2020 indicated diffuse inflammation in both lungs. One week after anti-infection treatment with cefoperazone/sulbactam and levofloxacin， reexamination on chest CT showed no improvement in the lung lesions. Then treatment with fluconazole and meropenem for 10 days， the patient's fever did not ease. Her past medical history consisted of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and cerebral infarction for many years. On December 25h， 2020， the subiect was transferred to our hospital for further treatment. Her WBC (White Blood Cell) count was 6.07 ×10° cells/L，N% 84.7%， C-reactive protein was 120mg/L. Procalcitonin was 0.08 ng/ml. Body temperature was 38.2C. To rule out infectious fever，**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Chest computed tomography scan on admission and three weeks after the initiation of corticosteroid treatment， shows improvement of bilateral consolidation in the lower lobes.**\n\n【24】Figure 2： Bronchoscopy showed that the wall of the air tube was mild edematous in the lower lobes (A-D). Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides with both low(x10， E and F) and high power (x40， G and H) microscopic view of alveolar septum and alveolar lumen with lipid-laden macrophages (indicated by elliptical circle).\n\n【25】**on December 28h， 2020， high throughput sequencing of the blood samples was detected， and test results showed that 36 sequences of Epstein-Barr virus and 4 sequences ofcytomegalovirus.On December29h，2020， blood samples were negative for aspergillus antigen test and cryptococcus gel qualitative test. Chest computed tomography scan on December 304， 2020，which shows bilateral consolidation in the lower lobes . Ultrasonic bronchoscope examination was performed on December 304， 2020， reveals that the wall of the air tube was mildly edematous， without of pus or necrosis . Cell classification results of BALF showed that neutrophils were 50%， lymphocytes 20%， histological cells 10%， columnar epithelial cells20%， and tumor cells were not found. Then the patient continued to be treated with antibiotics for an extra week， nevertheless the patient's fever persisted.**\n\n【26】**On January 06\"， 2021， pathological results of dorsal segment of the lower lobes reported that lipid-filled vacuoles associated with lipid-laden macrophages in alveolar septum and alveolar lumen. On further questioning the patient was hospitalized for**\n\n【27】**intestinal obstruction 1 month before admission， she received a total amount of 500 ml paraffin oil， and aspiration occurred for 3 times. Therefore， the diagnosis of ELP was made. Then， from January 06，2021， the patients were given methylprednisolone 60 mg/day for 6days. From January 12h， 2021， prednisone dose was reduced to 40mg/day. The puzzle was that the patient still had fever symptoms after anti-infective and anti-inflammatory treatment After excluding other factors， the possibility of drug fever was considered. Intravenous medication was stopped on January 084， 2021， and oral medication was retained. The patient's body temperature returned to normal on January 104， 2021. On January 15h， 2021， the patient had stable vital signs， without fever symptoms， and was discharged with prednisone 30 mg/day oral administration. The patient feels well and without adverse or unanticipated events during prednisone oral administration. The reexamination of chest CT on January 29h，2021indicated that the lesion in the lung was improved .**\n\n【28】**Discussion**\n\n【29】**ELP is an uncommon type of pneumonitis， resulting from**\n\n【30】**exogenous lipids of mineral， vegetal， or animal origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， which reach the alveoli by inhalation of volatile hydrocarbons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， or by aspiration of oil-based substances. Most ELP cases originate from mineral oil aspiration present in laxatives and oily nose drops 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The typical clinical manifestation of ELP constitutes a chronic cough manifesting with or without dyspnea along with the presence of diffuse interstitials infiltrates on imaging assessment of chest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. While， the patient in this case presented with persistent fever as the main clinical feature.**\n\n【31】**The clinical manifestations of ELP depend on the type， dosage，and frequency of lipids inhaled. Acute heavy inhalation can lead to fever， cough and dyspnea while chronic long-term inhalation may not show symptoms or only mild cough， expectoration， weight loss and other non-specific symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Hemoptysis is uncommon， with only one reported case in English language literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The symptoms of this patient in present report are insidious onset of cough， as well as fever， without dyspnea， similar to infectious pneumonia. We initially considered infectious fever according to the patient's lung lesions， so we gave adequate anti-infective therapy. However， chest CT reexamination 1 week after anti-infective treatment indicated that the patient's pulmonary lesions had not improved and fever was still present. After the patient's lung lesions were pathologically confirmed to be ELP， we adjusted the treatment plan and added methylprednisolone， but the patient's body temperature was still not well controlled. After excluding other factors， we considered that the patient might have a drug-induced fever. Due to the poor physical condition of the patient and the long duration of fever， there was not enough time to stop intravenous drugs successively to observe the changes in the patient's body temperature， so we chose to stop all intravenous drugs of the patient. The patient had no fever after discontinuation of intravenous drugs. Although we do not know exactly what medication caused the patient's fever， the patient's body temperature returned to normal after the intravenous medication was discontinued， so the diagnosis of drug-induced fever in this patient should be confirmed.**\n\n【32】**Physical exam findings of EL Pare those ofinterstitial lung disease. The lungs can be clear or have fine rales. As seen in our patient， we could hear distinct rales in the lower lobes of both lungs， which was consistent with the radiographic findings ofthe patient.**\n\n【33】**Due to its association with aspiration， the CT scan of ELP is usually patchy ground glass with thickening of intralobular septa and consolidation in both lower lungs along the bronchial vascular bundle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In addition， it can also be shown as isolated nodules with lobes and burrs， or mass shadow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， and these lesions may have high uptake during PET-CT and are difficult to distinguish from lung cancer.**\n\n【34】**ELP diagnosis is often a challenge because the symptoms， signs， along with the radiographic results are all a bit nonspecific. Although aspiration is the most common cause of ELP， patients may not be aware of inhaling irritating drugs because repeated small amounts of the fatty substance might not cause a significant cough-stimulating reflex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Notably， not all ELP cases originate from aspiration； some cases result from inhalation and nasal drop. Case reports have demonstrated that ELP can develop among vaper. Chronicinhalation of e-cigarette which contain of vegetable glycerin caused the patient to manifest with insidious onset cough， night sweats， progressive SV dyspnea on exertion along with fever， and was in respiratory failure on admission to hospital 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. While， the clinical use of mineral oils is even more widespread. Thus， the history of exposure to exogenous**\n\n【35】**lipids substances is a remarkable clue to the diagnosis of ELP. Histopathological examination is the gold standard for the diagnosis of ELP. Microscopically， foamy lymphocytes in the alveolar space can be seen. Floating oily foamy substance and fat globules are found in BALF， which are also of high diagnostic value for this disease.**\n\n【36】**It is evident in our case that the patient's diagnosis was delayed for several reasons. First of all， the patient was an elderly woman with fever， so the pulmonary lesions were primitively considered infectious disease.Secondly， there is a lack of detailed inquiry on the specific treatment of intestinal obstruction， causing the omission of a history of chemical irritants inhalation. In addition， the patient had no respiratory symptoms other than a cough， nonspecific clinical features. What's more， this patient had a clear history of cerebral infarction and GERD. A multicenter review revealed an incidence of80% ELP caused by aspiration in patients with intestinal obstruction and chronic constipation accompanied by GERD while using liquid paraffin and Vaseline as a laxative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This reminds us that patients with a history of chemical irritants aspiration， especially those with GERD or cerebral infarction， should be highly suspicious of ELP.**\n\n【37】**To date， ELP standardized treatment regimens have not been established. Recommendations for treating ELP are on the basis of clinical experience and not long-term observational studies. Because ELP is often associated with aspiration， prevention is important. Avoiding ongoing exposure， as well as providing supportive care constitutes the main stay of treatment. Antibiotic therapy alone is usually ineffective. Systemic corticosteroid treatment has been utilized successfully in some cases to dampen inflammatory response\\[12，13\\]. Nonetheless， corticosteroids might not be applied routinely on account of the severe side effects， and could be utilized if the lung injury is severe and ongoing. It has been reported that corticosteroid therapy on kerosene aspiration was ineffective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In this case our patient responded well to corticosteroids and CT assessments were improved after a month of treatment with corticosteroids. Bronchoscopic Alveolar Lavage (BAL) has treatment implications in some cases. Numerous case reports documented the effectiveness of treatment lung lavage for lipoid pneumonia， which washed away lipids directly， as well as improved lung opacities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15-17\\]</u>. However， in patients with respiratory failure or severe complications， BAL cannot be performed. Localized lobectomy may also be considered if medical treatment fails. In present case， two BAL were performed on the patient， but the results were not satisfactory.**\n\n【38】**Conclusion**\n\n【39】**In conclusion， we report an exogenous lipoid pneumonia case associated with liquefied petrolatum that was complicated with drug fever. To the best of our knowledge， it is the first case which report that ELP complicated by drug fever. The clinical manifestations of ELP vary greatly， ranging from asymptomatic to severe life-threatening. As can be seen from this patient， patients with ELP still need to be alert to the possibility of complicated with other diseases when they have fever symptoms.**\n\n【40】**Funding**\n\n【41】**This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 82000039)</u> .**\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Bacillus cereushas found notoriety as a cause of gastroenteritis， but bone infections involving this bacterium are very rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. We report a case of B. cereus osteomyelitis in an otherwise healthy young girl with no identifiable risk factors， the first of its kind in the literature to our knowledge.**\n\n【11】**Case Presentation**\n\n【12】**A healthy， five-year-old Caucasian female with no significant past medical history was seen in the pediatric orthopedic clinic with an 8 week history of left sided gait abnormality. She refused to heel weight-bear and had no clear history oftrauma，insect bites， superficial abrasions or penetrating injuryto her left foot. There was no history of fever or systemic features of infection， and no history of immunodeficiency. She had no urinary， chest， ENT (including dental) or skin evidence of infection. Her hindfoot was swollen， and was tender to palpate over the calcaneus.**\n\n【13】**Several areas of lucency and sclerosis within the calcaneus were seen on radiographs. She was admitted for further investigations. Hematological tests revealed a CRP of <3， ESR 8， and WCC of10.6×10. Blood cultures showed no growth.**\n\n【14】**An MRI was performed the following day which showed increased signal within the calcaneus， talus and cuboid bones， consistent with multifocal osteomyelitis .**\n\n【15】**A calcaneal biopsy under general anesthesia was performed. Alateral approach was undertaken to access the calcaneus. Nofrank pus was seen， but the bone was friable and dark， altered interosseous blood was encountered. Multiple， non-cross-contaminated fresh tissue samples of bone fragments， tissue swabs and blood aspirate were sent to the lab for culture.**\n\n【16】**Microbiological culture revealed growth of Bacillus cereus in 4/4 samples， and StaphylocoCCUS hominus in 2/4 samples. Histology revealed trabecular bone with absent normal marrow， having been replaced by fibrous tissue， foamy histiocytes， and lymphocytes， consistent with chronic osteomyelitis.**\n\n【17】**Following discussion with our infectious disease physicians， intravenous Vancomycin was initiated. Following initial administration in hospital， it was continued in the community for a total of 6 weeks， during which she was kept in a non-weight-bearing below knee cast. Vancomycin was chosen to provide anti-staphylococcal cover in addition to B. cereus， although it was less clear that this was a pathogenic organism in this patient's case. The duration was chosen due to the poor vascular supply to the calcaneus， and the poorer efficacy of vancomycin compared with beta lactam antibiotics.**\n\n【18】**A follow up MRI was obtained to confirm resolution of infection， four weeks after cessation of Vancomycin. This was consistent with resolving osteomyelitis， with reduced signal intensity in the hind foot and mid foot.**\n\n【19】**Weight bearing commenced after 6 weeks in cast. By 3 months she was running and jumping normally， without any symptoms of pain or disability. At 6 months post biopsy she continued to be symptom free with normal radiographs and was discharged from routine clinic follow-up.**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**Bacillus cereus is a Gram-positive aerobic or facultatively anaerobic， spore-forming， motile，rod-shaped bacterium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Its environmental reservoir includes soil， marine and fresh water， and the**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： MRI.**\n\n【23】**intestinal tracts of invertebrates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It is also one of the most common bacteria cultured from the drug associated paraphernalia of heroin addicts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Having a spore form allows B. cereus to survive standard food cooking processes in a dormant state. Once in an active state， it produces a number of tissue destructive exo-enzymes， including an emesis-inducing toxin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. It is the emesis effect of B. cereus which gives it most notoriety， causing fried rice syndrome' following the consumption of cooked rice stored at room temperature after its initial preparation.**\n\n【24】**B. cereus is often regarded as an insignificant contaminant in positive clinical specimens. However， it is recognized to cause a multitude of pathologies， including fulminant sepsis， cutaneous infections，anthrax-like progressive pneumonia， severe eye infections， and meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， as well as osteomyelitis.**\n\n【25】**While uncommon， osteomyelitis due to B. cereus is certainly recognized， though less than 10 cases have been described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. All of these cases were associated with surgical or accidental trauma， IV drug use， pre-existing infection or sickle cell disease. Only two cases have been reported in children - an 11-year-old boy with a depressed skull fracture and B. cereus osteomyelitis of the bone fragment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， and a 13-year-old girl with distal femoral osteomvelitis due to S. aureus and subsequent superimposed infection with B. cereus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. To our knowledge， this case represents the only case of B. cereus osteomyelitis in a child without any identifiable risk factors or history of inoculation injury， with confirmed deep infection. The patient had no other site of infection， and no definite trauma. The difficulties of history taking in a young child were illustrated in this case given the delay from symptom onset to presentation； no history of significant antecedent trauma could be recounted from the child or parents. Of note the patient was a very active child with a new trampoline； minor trauma may have had an association with this case but was below the sensitivity of the history taking to detect.**\n\n【26】**While microbiology contamination with B. cereus is common， we are confident our case represents a true causative effect as it was recovered from all four tissue samples， whereas S. hominis was only seen in two ofthese. Furthermore，there was a clinical and radiological resolution of infection following appropriate antibiotic treatment.**\n\n【27】**Osteomyelitis due to B. cereus has previously been successfully treated with gentamicin， cloxacillin， clindamycin， penicillin and vancomycin； antibiotic optionstypically revolveearoundthe susceptibility profile of the isolated strain and the antibiotic resistance is variable. One study of 54 strains of B. cereus concluded that vancomycin may be the drug of choice for invasive infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【28】**Incconclusion， while an11iincommon cailseofpediatric osteomyelitis， B. cereus should be considered in the differential diagnosis. This is particularly relevant in cases in which no response is demonstrated with traditional empiric antibiotics. Because there are no specific features to the clinical presentation or imaging， this case highlights the importance of adequate microbiological sampling prior to commencement of antibiotics.**\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

They account for less than 1% of primary breast tumors. They typically grow rapidly and clinically appears as breast lump in woman within a median age of 45 years. PTs are characterized by an enhanced intra canicular structure with leaf-like project ions into dilated lumens. In the 70% of cases， these tumors constitute benign unilateral lesions of the female breast. Less common are the malignant phyllodes， characterized by stromal pleomorphism and over growth， frequent mitosis and infiltrative borders. PTs， rarely， occur in pregnancy. Here， we present a case of 37 years old women with a giant malignant PT in her left breast， with a maximum diameter of about 24 cm， the largest reported in literature. It grew over 7months， during pregnancy. The histological examination of the resected tumor specimen， after its wide excision， revealed predominance of stromal hyper cellularity with a few altered epithelial component and a focal area showing a leaf-like pattern， consisting with a large malignant phyllodes tumor.**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Phyllodes tumors (PTs) of the breast are a rare and complex group of biphasic fibro-epithelial neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. They represent less than 1% of primary breast neoplasms. PTs usually present as breast lump and they are diagnosed in all age groups with a median age of presentation of 45years. Rarely are diagnosed during pregnancy \\[2，3\\]. These tumors are often clinically benign and are characterized by a rapid growth， with an increased intra canicular growth pattern with leaf-like projections. Malignant PTs are rare and exhibit an enhanced stromal pleomorphism and over growth， frequent mitosis and in filtrative borders. Currently， biopsy is the too lused for diagnosing phyllodes tumors. The treatment is surgery， by wide local excision with sufficient margin of normal breast tissue or mast ectomy.**\n\n【19】**Here，we presented a case of a 37 years old women with a large breast left mass of about 24 cm diameter. The mass was surgically removed by wide local excision and the histological examination demonstrated the presence of a biphasic fibro epithelial neoplasm. The stromal component exhibited an enhanced intra canalicular pattern and leaf like projections， accompanied by hyper cellularity and moderate nuclear atypia. Stromal over growth was observed. The epithelial component also showed alterations， consisting of marked adenosis are as， accompanied sometimes in lactation like epithelial changes. Furthermore， areas of malignant degeneration were detected. All together these changes were consistent with a giant malignant phyllodes tumor.**\n\n【20】**Case Presentation**\n\n【21】**A 37 years old Italian women presented in our hospital， in the first three month period of pregnancy， with a smalllump on the left breast above the nipple， measuring about 1.2 cm. Her only significant past medical history was adenoids. She referred to have a miscarriage eat 36 years old， and to be under hormonal therapy. She never smoked. She had thrombophilia and she was under anticoagulant medication. Shewas an allergic individual to antibiotics，belonging tothe cephalosporin and penicillin class. Shehad not familyhistory of breast or ovarian cancer. Ultra sound examination demonstrated an odular formation on the left breast contained liquid， consistent with a suspicious BI-RADSU4 tumor， according to the BI-RADS classification \\[4，5\\]. Successive examination，by core-needle biopsy， revealed a biphasic fibro epithelial neoplasm. The epithelial components hawed areas**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： Enlarged patient's left breast.**\n\n【23】Figure 2：(A) Operative findings： wide lacal excisian (B) The excised tumar mass， 24 cm x 16 cm x 4 cm in size.\n\n【24】**of slight iperplasia， while the stromal one presented spindle cells with moderate hyper cellularity， leaf-like projections， without atypia and mitosis， suggesting a doubtful benign phyllodes tumor. After she gave birth， she came back to our hospital. She was breast feeding. At that time， physical examination showed a massively enlarged left breast mass， measuring about 24 cm in maximum diameter . She stated that it was not painful. In particular， mammography revealed that the left mammary gland body was entirely replaced from a poly lobed nodular growth. The patient right breast and the rest of clinical examination were normal. Examination by ultrasound breast with repere revealed a large heterogeneous solid mass with internal vascularity， replacing all normal left breast tissue. No suspicious findings in the left lymph node as well asin the right breast and in the right axilla were detected.**\n\n【25】**Further examination with a chest and abdomen ultra sound was performed， which showed no evidence of metastatic lesion. Thepatient under went to a wide local excision with sufficient surgical margin resection . The resected tumor specimen measured 24x16x4 cm . Histological examination demonstrated a fibro epithelial architecture with an exaggerated intra canalicular patternwithleaf-like fronds (Figure3B)， accompanied by stromal hyper cellularity ， and moderate nuclear atypia (Figure3D). Alterations of the epithelial component were demonstrated， consisting of marked adenosis areas， accompanied sometimes in lactation-like epithelial changes. Stromal overgrowth (defined as the presence of stroma without epithelium in at least one low-power field as observed with a x 4 microscope objective) was observed. Amitotic**\n\n【26】**Figure 3： Histo patholagical findings： histolagical analysis of the surgical specimen demonstrated a diffuse fibra-epithelial lesion showing a few elangated epithelium lined clefts with stromal mounds by low magnification(A) A leaf-like pattern typical of phyllodes tumor was demonstrated at higher magnification (B) Marked stromal hyper cellularity was abserved (C) with maderate nuclear atypia with alteration in nuclear size and irregular nuclear membranes (D) All the tissue sections were stained by hematoxy line osin.100 pm bar was reported.**\n\n【27】**activity of 11/10high-power fields (HPFs) was measured in an area of stromal hyper cellularity. The tumors howed well defined borders. The histological examination was consistent with a giant phyllodes tumor，showing area of malignant degeneration.**\n\n【28】**Discussion**\n\n【29】**PTs of the breast are rare fibro epithelial neoplasms， which can occur in all age groups， but predominantly occur in middle aged women， with the average of 45 year old \\[6，7\\]. On clinically examination， these tumors usually present as painless mass with an average size of 4-5 cm \\[8，9\\]. They are classified into benign， border line and malignant grade categories on the basis of their histological properties， i.e. the degree of stromal cellularity and atypia， stromal overgrowth， mitotic activity and the nature of their tumor borders通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However， it is still difficult， not only， accurate and reproducible grading classification of these tumors but also the discrimination between benign phyllodes tumors and cellular fibro adenoma as well as between the malignant phyllodes tumors and primary breasts arcomaor spindle cell meta plastic carcinoma in all this spectrum of the PTs. This is due to overlapping microscopic features among these tumors. In addition to add more complexity to the PTs diagnosis and categorization is their intra tumoral heterogeneity. It is in fact no tun common that these tumors show benign lesions in some area and characteristics of border line and malignant lesions in other areas通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【30】**In our case， we observed a small lump (1.2 cm) on the left breast consisting of a biphasic fibro epithelial neoplasm， in the first trimester of pregnancy in 37 years Old Italian women. Only two cases are reported in literature of phyllodes tumors diagnosed during the first trimester of pregnancy \\[2，11\\]. Our case was not immediately treated but after the patient gave the birth. She experienced rapid growth during pregnancy，leading the left breast mass to a dimension of about 24 cm， the largest phyllodes tumor reported in literature. Rapid growth is one of the features of PTs and seven cases are reported in literature with this property， suggesting that the growth is more enhanced during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Further， this finding**\n\n【31】**supports the idea that these tumors may be hormonally sensitive， although this concept is highly debated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In this case， our patient referred a miscarriage at 36 years old， and to be under hormonal therapy. Interesting， in 10 reported cases of PTs during pregnancy， six presented a history of a previous breast mass \\[2，3，11，13-15\\].Our patient did not report any previous breast mass. Furthermore， she had no family history of breast and ovarian cancer.**\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\. LakhaniSR， Ellis IO， Schnitt SI， Tan PH， vande Vijver MJ.

It rarely occurs in the nasopharynx， and only six such cases have been reported. Nasopharyngeal PLGA can be treated by wide local excision with no additional treatment. We report a case of PLGA originating in the nasopharynx mucosa. We were able to completely resect1the tumor using simple endoscopic surgery rather than an open approach， such as a transpalatal resection. Our patient had no local recurrence or distant metastasis at 24-months follow-up.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Minor salivary gland； Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma； Otorhinolaryngological surgery**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Polymorphous Low-Grade Adenocarcinoma (PLGA) is a minor salivary gland neoplasm that primarily occurs at intraoral sites. An extra oral location of the tumor is rare， with nasal tumors representing less than 1% of PLGAs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The tumor generally involves the palate， but has been described from the base of the tongue， upper lip， buccal mucosa， tonsils， and retromolar pad 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. PLGA is a rare pathology that often occurs in the fifth and sixth decades of life with a female/male ratio of 2：1 \\[3，4\\].**\n\n【16】To date， six cases of PLGA presenting as a nasopharyngeal mass have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-10\\]</u>. Nasopharyngeal PLGA grows slowly， painlessly， and has only a few symptoms， including unilateral ear fullness and nasal obstruction. Here， we describe a case of nasopharyngeal PLGA including clinical characteristics， pathology， treatment， and prognosis with a review of the literature.\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 51-year-old male patient presented with right-side ear fullness with no nasal symptoms. No neck mass was noted. He did not smoke or drink alcohol and had no past history of acute disease with the exception of cataract surgery. Nasal endoscopy revealed an irregularly shaped mass on the right salpingopalatine fold . Paranasal sinus Computed Tomography (CT) showed a 20 mm x 23 mm x 30 mm polypoid mass in the lateral wall of the right nasopharynx with no surrounding bony destruction or intraorbital or skull base invasion . Right middle ear effusion was seen on otoscopy. Punch biopsy of the nasopharyngeal mass was performed in the outpatient department. Pathological biopsy revealed a benign salivary gland tumor consistent with pleomorphic adenoma .**\n\n【19】**The tumor was resected 2 months later using the endoscopic approach according to the preoperative biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Surgery was performed under general anesthesia with the patient in the supine position. We used the transnasal endoscopic approach with 0°and 30°4 mm nasal en doscopes(Karl-Storz， Tuttlingen， Germany). The posterior portion of the right inferior turbinate was excised to create a working space for the endoscope and to expose the tumor. Then a circular incision of the mucosa was made around the mass using a sickle knife， and further dissection was performed using a freer elevator. The right pterygoid bone was exposed after the tumor was excised with a 2mm resection margin. Frozen biopsy specimens revealed a carcinoma of undetermined type. Frozen sections prepared from the intraoperative margin tissue revealed a negative resection margin. We completely removed the nasopharyngeal tumor according to the preoperative CT scan， although we were unable to use an intraoperative navigator system to guide placement of instruments in the surgical field. The gross surgical specimen showed a pale brown to tan soft tissue mass measuring2.0cm×1.3 cm×1.0 cm. Finally， Tacho Comb was applied to the wound site， followed by Merocel**\n\n【20】**Figure 1：Endoscopic image of a Polymorphous Low-Grade Adenocarcinoma(PLGA) in the right salpingopalatine fold.

A Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-CT scan performed the same day confirmed no remnant nasopharyngeal mass or neck metastasis； however， an exophytic mass seen in the left kidney was resected and diagnosed as clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. Follow-up PET-CT 7 months after nasal endoscopic surgery revealed no definite abnormal lesion suggestive of recurrence.**\n\n【28】**At the 24-month follow-up， the patient received no additional treatment and showed no signs of local recurrence or distant metastasis .**\n\n【29】**Discussion**\n\n【30】**PLGA has a low tendency for aggressive behavior； thus， the recommended treatment is surgical excision， and the results are generally excellent. No cases of lymphatic spread have been described； therefore， neck dissection is not necessary unless there is clinical evidence suggestive oflymph node involvement.

PLGA rarely occurs in the nasopharynx， and there is no definite treatment of choice. En-bloc mass excision using the transpalatal or nasal endoscopic approaches are options； however， the transpalatal approach may cause several complications， including pain， bleeding， and oronasal fistulas. Exclusive endoscopic resection can avoid potential complications and shorten the hospital stay.**\n\n【34】**To date， six cases of nasopharynx PLGAs have been reported. Lengyel et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> reported a case with skull base invasion and intracranial spread confirmed by CT. Radiotherapy was performed. Follow-up CT scans revealed a partial response to radiotherapy， and the patient was still living after 51 months post-radiotherapy. Wenig**\n\n【35】**et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> reported a case of a patient with PLGA who underwent transpalatal tumor resection and recovered uneventfully for 9 months after operation. Furthermore， four previous studies found that patients with PLGA who underwent exclusive transnasal endoscopic tumor resection fully recovered with no additional treatment\\[6，8-101. Our case is the fifth report of a patient with nasopharyngeal PLGA who underwent nasal endoscopic tumor resection with no additional therapy. We found no local recurrence or evidence of metastasis at the 24-month follow-up. Our findings， together with those of previous studies， suggest that the simple endoscopic approach is a feasible treatment for nasopharyngeal PLGA. However， during endoscopic surgery， the surgeon must be able to resect the mass with sufficient margins to ensure they are free of tumor. In cases where the tumor extends beyond the nasopharynx or endoscopic view， we suggest that open surgery such as the transpalatal approach should be used rather than the endosopic approach. In addition， open surgery should also be performed in cases where local recurrence is detected after endoscopic surgery.**\n\n【36】**Conclusion**\n\n【37】**In cases of nasopharyngealPLGA which is limited to nasopharynx mucosa， if surgeon is able to resect it with sufficient margins， the endoscopic approach will be feasible choice. This procedure is curative， cuts down the length of operation， decreases wound-related complications and shortens hospital stay.**\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Acknowledgment**</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**This work was supported by the 2018 Inje University Busan Paik Hospital research grant.**</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Ligament tears due to sports injuries or tissue aging often require surgical intervention， and reconstitution using autologous， allogeneic or artificial ligaments as grafts is currently the gold standard for treating such diseases， but these grafts have many drawbacks. With the development of material science and manufacturing technology， artificial ligament tissue based on biological scaffold is expected to become a new type oftissue donor， by simulating the structure， composition and biomechanical characteristics of natural tissues， the purpose of tissue regeneration can be achieved， in addition to growth factors， mechanical stimulation and other factors also have positive significance for stem cell repair ligament， this paper summarizes the in vitro and animal experimental research of ligament tissue engineering， with biomimicry as the design principle， all aspects of ligament tissue scaffolding are evaluated. In addition， the performance and effect of various factors on stem cells to promote ligament repair and reconstruction are summarized， and the future development direction of bionic scaffolds and mechanical stimulation combined with growth factors on stem cells in ligament tissue engineering research is summarized and prospected， in order to provide new ideas for clinical repair of ligament damage.**\n\n【11】**Keywords： Ligament tissue engineering； Scaffold； Bionic； Biological materials； Biological factors**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Ligaments are dense connective tissue that connects the bone and maintain joint stability during exercise and rest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The mechanical properties of the ligament make it prone to laceration after sports injury or tissue aging. The repaired ligament is mainly disordered fibrous scar tissue， and its biomechanical properties are far inferior to those of normal tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. About 33 million musculoskeletal injuries are reported in the United States each year， with 50% of tendon/ligament injuries， and on average over 300，000 patients undergo surgery to repair a damaged tendon or ligaments annually 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In China， the incidence of rotator cuff injury is 20% at 60 years old and31% at 70 years old， but there is no accurate statistics on the incidence of ligament injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-8\\]</u>. Although transplantation can restore some mechanical function in a short period oftime， the use of autologous， allograft or xenograft brings some problems， such as artificialligament/tendon products represented by Leeds Keio and LARS show good initial mechanical strength and postoperative joint stability in clinical use， lack of viscoelasticity， wear and aging， limited autologous tissue regeneration caused synovitis， medium and long-term injury mechanical strength and even graft failure， making the clinical application of artificial ligament/tendon graft controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The purpose of ligament tissue engineering is to combine the scaffold， cells， growth factors， and mechanical stimuli in viro to reconstruct the structure and function of the injured ligaments. Seed cells， growth factors， and mechanodynamic stimulation can greatly increase the application effect of fiber scaffolds in ligament tissue engineering， and the review of scaffold manufacturing technology is conducive to the development of ligament tissue engineering. As a structural basis， the scaffold provides mechanical support and a cellular microenvironment， it functioning similar to the Extracellular Ligament Matrix (ECM). Composition and mechanical properties mimic natural ligament tissue. Now a days， the most studied ligament tissue engineering projects are fibrous stents and heterogeneous**\n\n**interface stents， which facilitate the reconstruction of the tendon -bone interface and ultimately anchor the regenerated ligament in the bone. In recent years， due to retaining the structure， composition and mechanical properties of the original tissue， scaffolds derived from biological tissue have been studied more and more in ligament or interface tissue engineering， among which book acellular scaffolds are more innovative|10|.**\n\n【15】**Seed Cells**\n\n【16】**Immune rejection and disease transmission. Adult bone marrow is a collection of bone marrow recharge stem cells， and Bone Marrow Recharge Stem Cells (BMSC) can self-renew and have the ability to differentiate into various mesenchymal cells \\[11，12\\]. Several remarkable properties ofBMSCs make them a clear choice for various tissue engineering： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> they can form a single colony of fibroblasts that can be isolated and expanded according to their ability to adhere to a solid surface to contain large numbers of cells； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the massive amplification of BMSCs in vitro has no obvious pathological effect on the eventual formation of ligament tissue in vivo and can differentiate into ligaments and tendons， and it is precisely because of this property that it is a popular seed cell in tissue engineering ligament construction； 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> by setting the same culture conditions can induce the differentiation of BMSCs into different mesenchymal phenotypes， including osteoblasts， chondroblasts， adipoblasts， and tendon/ligament cells； 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the tissue-engineered ligaments formed by BMSCs can be used as a suitable autograft without surgical resection. No risk of an immune response (an allograft may occur) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.**\n\n【17】**Growth Factors**\n\n【18】**Growth factors play an important role in inducing and/or supporting the expression of specific mesenchymal cell lines. Oxygen can influence the rate of extracellular matrix synthesis and the development of tissue-engineered tissues in vitro. Whether oxygen affects stem cell differentiation into ligamentous fibroblasts is unknown. Fermor et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> showed that high oxygen concentration(21%) maximizes the differentiation of ACL fibroblasts， while low oxygen concentration (10%) promotes extracellular collagen synthesis. As a long-acting source of vitamin C， phosphate vitamin C has significantly increased the viability of cultured cells in vitro and increased the expression level of type I collagen by. Epidermal birth Growth Factors such as long factor (EGF)， basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF)， Insulin-like Growth Factor-II (IGF-Il， and Transforming Growth Factor-(TGF-) can enhance cell proliferation. Furthermore， insulin， TGF-，and IGF-can promote connective tissue protein expression and extracellular matrix production. Its effect on the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells is also related to concentration， but the specific dose-effect relationship needs to be further studied. TGF-and EGF as well as TGF- and insulin can synergistically stimulate the proliferation of fibroblasts and stromal cells. BMSCs were cultured in vitro using Advanced DMEM (ADMEM) medium with or without added growth factors by Morrow et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The expression level of collagen type I was all significantly increased in BMSCs when compared with DMEM medium. The combination of EGF and TGFs (in sequence) maximizes cell proliferation and type I collagen expression. The effect of growth factors on BMSCs is dose-dependent.Hankemeier et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> have shown that low-dose bFGF (3 ng/mL) significantly promotes the differentiation of BMSCs into fibroblasts and significantly increases ligament and tendon-specific extracellular matrix expression of cytoskeletal components， but has no effect at high doses of bFGF 通用删除7(英):<u>(30)</u>**\n\n【19】**ng/ml)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16-18\\]</u> .**\n\n【20】**Mechanical Stimulation**\n\n【21】**Mechanical signals that affect ligament growth and development in vivo also play an important role in tissue-engineered ligament cultures in vitro.Theapplication of stress can affect tissue development in at least two ways： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> enhancing the matrix 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> directly stimulating cells. Mechanical stimulation of cultured ligamentous fibroblasts enhanced the expression of type I and type III collagen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， fibronectin， and mucin-C. In the absence of specific growth factors and regulators， human MSCs can differentiate into ligament-like cells by exposing human MSCs to physiological circulatory stress. Stress can alter the autologous and the fineness of the tissue-engineered ligaments. The extracellular environment， which directly affects cell shape and fibrillary clearance， or enhances mass delivery in and out of the cell through fluid flow. Mechanical pressure stress directly acting on the cellular level can stimulate the proliferation and regeneration of BMSCs and promote bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to repair ligament damage.**\n\n【22】**Stent Material**\n\n【23】**The scaffold materials involved in ligament or tendon tissue engineering are generally divided into synthetic polymers， natural polymers， inorganicc osteoconductive materials and biological tissue-derivedmaterials.Synthetic polymersmainly include Polycaprolactone (PCL)， Poly-L-Lactic Acid (PLLA)， Polyglycolic Acid (PGA)， Poly-L-Lactide-Co-Caprolactone (PLCL)， Polylactic Acid-Co-Glycolide (PLGA)， Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET)， etc. Natural macromolecules mainly include Collagen (COL)， Silk Fibroin (SF)， silk， chitosan， Hyaluronic Acid (HA)， Chondroitin Sulfate (CS)， fiber glucosamine， Glycosaminoglycan (GAG)， alginate， Gelatin (GEL)， etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Inorganic osteoinductive materials mainly include Hydroxyapatite (HAp)， phosphoric acid Tricalcium (TCP)， etc. Materials derived from biological tissues include acellular cortical bone， tendon， fibrocartilage， fat or bone-fibrocartilage-tendon composite tissue .**\n\n【24】**Stent Manufacturing Technology**\n\n【25】**Fiber structures are often used in the design of tissue engineering scaffolds for ligaments or tendons. Traditional electrospinning techniques can spray material solutions into filaments by applying an electric field， and the arrangement or diameter of the fibers can be tuned by multiple parameters. Melt electrospinning can generate more precise and repeatable fiber patterns， such as sinusoidal fibers with specific wavelengths and amplitudes， mimicking the coiled structure of collagen fibers， further enhancing the guiding effect of fiber topology on cells.

Management and operative technique are still a matter of debate and the role of the robotic surgical platform in these patients has not been reported on. We present a robot-assisted repair of a rare TAWH through a fracture of the left iliac wing. Our operative technique and review of the literature is described.**\n\n【14】**Case Presentation**\n\n【15】**A 46-year-old male with a history of a high energetic trauma presented at our department with a symptomatic swelling in the left lumbar region. He was involved in a traffic accident four years ago， suffering from multiple organ injuries and a fracture of the left iliac wing that were all treated conservatively. At time of presentation， he had an abdominal wall protrusion in the left lumbar region. He complained of decreased abdominal muscle strength with chronic discomfort during Valsalva maneuvers. A previous CT scan showed an important defect of the abdominal wall caused by a disruption of the iliac and gluteus muscles and non-union of the left iliac wing fracture. This caused a herniation of the descending colon through this bony defect of the left iliac wing (Figure1). There were no signs of strangulation or incarceration. An elective operative management was scheduled.**\n\n【16】**A robot-assisted Transabdominal Preperitoneal hernia repair (TAPP) using the da Vinci Xi(Intuitive Surgical， Sunnyville， CA， USA) robotic system was planned. The patient was positioned in right lateral decubitus. Pneumoperitoneum was established through an open 10 mm trocar introduction in the left paraumbilical position. Two additional 8 mm trocars were placed on the left pararectal side， with all 3 trocars on the same vertical line. Exploration confirmed a herniation of the descending colon through the bony defect (3 cm in transverse length and 5 cm in longitudinal length) of the left iliac wing . The content of the hernia was reduced after mobilization of the sigmoid. Subsequently a vertical incision was made in the peritoneum lateral to the left semilunar line to enter the preperitoneal space. The dissection was extended from preperitoneal to retroperitoneal with the medial edge of the psoas muscle as safety landmark that allowed us to avoid injuries to retroperitoneal structures， such as ureters， blood vessels， and nerves. We carefully preserved the entire hernia sac to ensure adequate tissue coverage of the mesh. Since the hernia was entirely bounded by bony structures， primary fascial hernia defect closure was unattainable. Therefore， we inserted a synthetic (20 by 20 cm) small pore polypropylene mesh (Bard mesh\"， C.R. Bard， Inc.， Covington，GA) in the created pocket. The mesh was positioned as such that the central part of the mesh covered the hernia defect . The mesh was fixed with absorbable Vicryl 2-0(Ethicon， Inc.，Somerville， NJ) sutures and fibrin glue (Tisseel Baxter Corp.，Deerfield， IL) onto the bone and the border of the psoas . We avoided mesh fixation with sutures， tackers or bone anchors in the iliac and psoas region to reduce the risk of chronic postoperative pain. The peritoneal sac was plicated at its base using a running absorbable suture (V-Loc， Covidien， Mansfield，**\n\n【17】**Figure 2： Traumatic hernia. Figure 3： Mesh placement and fixation.**\n\n【18】**MA， USA). The postoperative course was uneventful， and the patient was discharged one day after surgery. At follow-up the patient showed no chronic pain or signs of recurrence. Clinical bulging was minimal. The follow-up period up to now is 6 months.**\n\n【19】infection between early and late hernia repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In the absence of hemodynamic instability or peritonitis， patients may safely be observed and referred for delayed hernia surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**TAWH is a rare and often difficult diagnosis in the trauma setting. Due to its low incidence and high risk for associated injuries there is no consensus on the management. The mechanism of injury following blunt trauma consists of a disruption or weakness of the underlying abdominal wall musculature or fascia with secondary herniation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. TAWH at the level of an associated pelvic fracture has been scarcely described in the literature. We report a case of a delayed presentation of a symptomatic large bowel herniation through a traumatic hernia defect of the left iliac wing， treated by mesh repair with the robotic platform.**\n\n【22】**Various methods for the repair of hernia defects in TAWH have been described. These include primary closure with non-absorbable monofilament sutiires， fasciocutaneous flap reconstruction， bioprosthetic or prosthetic mesh repair \\[1，7\\]. The decision depends on clinical situation at the time of diagnosis， patient comorbidities， size， and location of the hernia defect. Without signs of gross contamination or bowel perforation， hernia repair with synthetic mesh is feasible in the acute setting. In the presence of peritonitis biologic meshes can be used or， alternatively， the patient can be referred for a delayed mesh repair. As we describe in our patient report， we performed a delayed elective mesh repair after a delay in diagnosis. The decision to perform surgery was based on the patients’symptoms of discomfort and the risk for incarceration/strangulation because of the presence of bowel herniation.**\n\n【23】**Traditional management methods of TAWH focus on early exploration and hernia repair due to the high risk for concomitant intra-abdominal injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. With a reported incidence ranging from 18% to 60% of intra-abdominal and bowel injury， patients diagnosed with a TAWH are often referred for early exploration and hernia repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>. Considering the risk for contaminated field in the trauma setting， these patients are more likely to have a primary tissue repair instead of mesh repair. Data available from small case series show higher recurrence rates in TAWH after primary suture compared to a delayed mesh repair， respectively 26% to 50% and 8%\\[1，3-6\\]. Honaker et al. and Netto et al. note a decreased recurrence and complication rate in delayed mesh repairs \\[3，4\\]. However， in a large-scale multicenter retrospective study from Harrell et al. in 2021， there is no significant difference in hernia recurrence or surgical site**\n\n【24】**Location of the hernia defect matters in the decision-making process of the ideal method for repair. The atypical location through a non-union of the left iliac wing made fascial closure of this hernia defect impossible. To provide sufficient strength we used a small pore heavyweight polypropylene mesh (Marlex， C.R. Bard， Inc.， Covington，GA) and provided extensive mesh overlap through a large preperitoneal dissection. In the literature， there is lack of evidence about the best surgical method to close this bony defect. Only two case reports by Delaune et al. and Moon et al. provide their surgical technique for the repair of an interfragmentary hernia through the iliac wing \\[9，10\\]. Moon et al. describes a repair with closure of the bony defect using two fibular strut allografts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Delaune et al. uses a prosthetic monofilament polypropylene mesh， fixed from the iliac**\n\n【25】**crest to the subinguinal hiatus and to the anterior space of the left kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. However， no conclusive information about follow-up and outcomes are available.**\n\n【26】**Considering the surgical approach， there is no formal comparison between open， laparoscopic， and robotic approach in traumatic abdominal wall surgery. The open approach is most frequently used in both early and delayed repairs. Harrell et al. states that more than90% of early repairs are performed open， compared with 68% of late repairs. The minority of reported TAWH are managed laparoscopic or robotic， respectively 7% and 0% for early repairs and 21% and15% of late repairs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In the last ten years， there is a tendency to perform abdominal wall surgery with minimal-invasive techniques to achieve less morbidity. Subsequent， there is also growing interest to manage TAWH in a delayed state with minimal-invasive techniques. Novitsky et al. describes the largest series of 14 patients who underwent laparoscopic mesh repair of traumatic flank hernias in an elective setting. No complications or recurrences occurred after an acceptable mean follow-up period of 35 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The literature concerning robotic repair in traumatic lateral hernia is still scarce. Only 2 retrospective case series report on 4 patients who had a delayed repair of lumbar traumatic hernia \\[7，12\\]. However， in both studies surgical procedural details are limited and no comparison has been made between the outcomes of robotic vs. open or laparoscopic technique. Wijerathne et al. reports a robotic TAPP procedure in a lumbar traumatic hernia. The authors recommend to perform a robotic repair if the hernia defect is larger than 4 to 5 cm to facilitate an extensive dissection and adequate mesh coverage in the lumbar region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， especially when there is lack of adequate tissue to close the fascial defect and in the proximity of important neurovascular structures， as presented in our patient case. We believe that， in an elective setting， the robotic platform facilitates dissection and adequate mesh placement in the lumbar region. Furthermore， compared to the laparoscopic approach， it provides better ergonomics and less technical difficulties， particularly in lateral abdominal wall hernia surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**The available literature has several limitations， most importantly the small population and short-term follow-up duration. There is no conclusive evidence to support one operative method of repair over the other in TAWH surgery. Robotic repair has proven some evidence for feasibility in small case studies and is of growing interest. We found our robot-assisted approach to be safe and feasible for the management of this rare and chalenging TAWH**\n\n【28】**Conclusion**\n\n【29】**TAWH is rare and the management is still a matter of debate. There is a tendency towards mesh repair in a delayed setting with minimal invasive techniques. In difficult to reach areas of the abdomen， a robot-assisted repair of TAWH might be a valid approach. Larger studies are needed to confirm our initial experience in traumatic hernia surgery.**\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**l.

At last follow-up in August 2015， visual acuities were 6/5 in the right eye and 6/9 in the left eye. Unfortunately in spite of the improvement in her ocular condition and some initial improvement in the liver lesions with olaparib， the patient eventually developed more advanced disease in the liver and lymph nodes. She was taken off olaparib and subsequently enrolled onto another clinical study of Liposomal Eribulin (November 2014 to February 2015)， followed by palliative chemotherapy with carboplatin (February 2015to April 2015) and vinorelbine (started in April 2015).

They noted a 12% rate of recurrence of choroidal metastasis following treatment and a 10%rate of active choroidal metastasis in spite of treatment. 53% of the study patients had developed ocular metastases while on systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy， indicating that these might not be sufficient for preventing ocular metastases. Tumour responses to treatment therefore remain variable and new agents are being researched.**\n\n【40】**PARP-inhibitors such as olaparib， which target BRCA-positive tumour cells， are one of the newer agents being investigated as treatment for BRCA-positive ovarian/breast cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-10\\]</u>.

They have shown promising results as anticancer agents， both in monotherapy and as chemo-potentiating agents.**\n\n【41】**PARP-inhibitors work by preventing cancer cells from repairing their DNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. BRCA1 & 2 is tumour suppressor genes that serve an important function in DNA repair. BRCA-positive cancers often show poor response rates with traditional agents， and therefore tailored therapies on basis of biomarker screening are being developed. PARP 1 is an important component of base excision repair involved in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks which would otherwise be converted into DNA double-stranded breaks. Cells with inactive BRCA genes are heavily dependent on PARP 1 for DNA repair. PARP-inhibitors therefore selectively target the BRCA-positive cancer cells while normal cells， in which DNA repair is still carried out by the active BRCA genes， are spared \\[8，9\\].**\n\n【42】**Conclusion**\n\n【43】**In this case olaparib caused regression of ocular metastases in a patient with a BRCA mutation and advanced breast cancer. It supports the case for further research towards offering targeted treatment through gene expression analyses and biomarker functional assays. The hope is that prompt delivery of targeted treatment at the time of diagnosis will help prevent the emergence of drug resistant cancer sub-populations. More research is required to further assess the relative risks and benefits oftreatment with olaparib.**\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\. Cohen VML. Ocular metastases.

These lesions are rarely described in long bones since they generally appear in the tubular bones of the extremities. The etiology is unknown， although it is related in several cases to a traumatic history. It shares imaging and histological similarities with other bone lesions such as Bizarre Parosteal Osteochondromatous Proliferation (BPOP)， subungual exostosis， osteomyelitis， myositis ossificans， and malignant surface tumors of bone and cartilage which include conventional， periosteal and parosteal osteosarcoma. Regarding treatment when presenting early， this process can be treated conservatively with rest and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication. When presenting late， with an aggressive nature and/or with recurrence， wide local resection is considered the treatment of choice. Differential diagnosis is essential to avoid unnecessary aggressive treatments. We present a case of a florid reactive periostitis of a middle third tibia， with progressive growth without previous trauma or infectious process. The diagnosis was not suspected by imaging tests. The histological findings of a parosteal lesion with benign characteristics raise the possibility of florid reactive periostitis， having ruled out chronic osteomyelitis due to the negative microbiological studies. After the intervention， the pain disappeared and one year after the surgery there were no recurrences of the lesion.**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Florid Reactive Periostitis (FRP) is a rare benign periosteal lesion， which mostly involves the tubular bones of the extremities. FRP of the long bone is especially rare. We present a case of a florid reactive periostitis of a middle third tibia.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 36-year-old female patient presented with a swollen and painful lesion in the middle third of the right tibia with progressive growth without previous trauma or infectious process in the tibia. Characteristically predominant nocturnal pain. Conventional radiographs revealed a bone tumor with periosteal reaction with involvement of adjacent soft tissues . Due to the intense pain， the patient went to the emergency room and a deep vein thrombosis was ruled out by Doppler ultrasound showing an area of cortical bone irregularity with periosteal reaction. The MRI showed a lesion in the middle third of the diaphysis of the right tibia with Codmann's triangle and associated medullary edema . The CT scan showed a lesion of aggressive characteristics with periosteal reaction in onion layers and with prominent speculation that affects more than 90%of the transverse section of the tibia and a craniocaudal extension of 6 cm . With these findings， extension study and bone biopsies were carried out by tru-cut for radiodiagnosis. In the histological analysis， only soft tissues with myxoid edematous changes were observed. Given the hardness of the bone lesion， it was not possible to take a sample of it percutaneously. A second incisional biopsy was performed with these results： Very compact cortical and medullary bone with portions of mature lamellar bone with ossification and mineralization. The arrangement of some trabecula was parallel and others more irregularly distributed. It showed a florid crown ofosteoblasts in some areas without atypia with very occasional mitotic figures. Given the radiological data of the lesion on the cortical-dependent surface， FISH of the MDM2 gene was performed， not observing its amplification. The sample sent as periosteum showed chronic inflammatory signs and vascular proliferation. Samples are sent to microbiology， all being negative. The study of the complete piece was recommended， as it may be a florid ossifying reactive periostitis. Surgical intervention was carried out，performing an exten ded resection，leaving the lateral hemicortical bone of the tibia， and a cancellous structural graft was provided and stabilized with a plate . Several samples are sent to pathological anatomy and microbiology . Histological results again showed a proliferative bone lesion with trabecula that are arranged perpendicular to the cortical bone， the**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： Antero-posterior X-ray revealed a bone tumor with periosteal reaction with involvement of adjacent soft tissues.**\n\n【20】**Figure 4： Postoperative X-Ray show the cancellous structural graft at the excision's site of the bone lesion fixed with a plate.**\n\n【21】**Figure 5： Postoperative CT images.**\n\n【22】**Figure 2： MRI shows alesion in the middle third of the diaphysis of the right tibia with Codmann's triangle and associated medullary edema.**\n\n【23】**bone had a mature appearance with more densely sclerosed areas and empty lacunae ofosteocytic necrosis and phenomena of reactive bone formation could be glimpsed. It was a sclerosing lesion. In continuity and towards the surface， periosteal reaction with neoformation and vascular proliferation as well as fibroblasts was observed. As no areas of chondroid differentiation or frank atypia were observed ， the diagnosis of periosteal osteosarcoma was ruled out. A new FISH of the MDM2 gene was performed， not observing amplification， so**\n\n【24】**parosteal osteosarcoma was ruled out. Therefore， the findings of a parosteal lesion with benign characteristics raise the possibility of florid reactive periostitis， having ruled out chronic osteomyelitis due to the negative microbiological studies of both surgeries. After the intervention， the pain disappeared and one year after the surgery there were no recurrences of the lesion.**\n\n【25】**Florid reactive periostitis is a benign bone lesion characterized by**\n\n【26】**transverse section of the tibia and a craniocaudal extension of 6 cm.

At the base of the lesion， there is mature-looking bone with cement lines and areas more densely sclerosed. In continuity and towards the Surface， is observed periosteal reaction with new reactive bone formation， with abundant polygonal osteoblasts and some mitatic figures. Focally there is infiltrate inflammation between the bone components.**\n\n【28】**an aggressive periosteal reaction and soft-tissue inflammation \\[1，2\\]. Usually affects the digits of the hand and less frequently the feet. It is characterized by pain and tight swelling restricting digital motion and is not usually related to previous trauma. The imaging and histologic features， show an overlap with other bone lesions including BPOP， subungual exostosis，osteomyelitis， myositis ossificans， and malignant surface tumors of bone and cartilage which include， conventional， periosteal and parosteal osteosarcoma.

This diagnosis is made radiologically by the presence of an osteolytic center with a ring of sclerosis on conventional imaging通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Additionally， a culture of the biopsy tissue is needed to support the diagnosis and identify the specific pathogen. Histology often only shows sclerotic bone with chronic inflammatory cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Furthermore， subungual exostoses can also mimic florid reactive periostitis. There is a reproducible translocation \\[t(x； 6) (q13； q22)\\] associated with this diagnosis and thus， it may be considered a true neoplasm. Lastly， malignant osteoblastic tumors including parosteal， periosteal， and conventional osteosarcoma are considered in the differential diagnosis. Parosteal osteosarcoma is the most frequently occurring osteosarcoma and thus it is crucial to diagnostically separate this entity from reactive periostitis. Histologically， it exhibits an extensive boney matrix with a hypocellular stroma and mild to minimal fibroblastic cellular atypia. Radiologically， it takes the appearance of a firm， lobulated “cauliflower-like\"， lesion encircling the bone. A thin radiolucent line delineating the tumor from the cortex， known as the “string sign\"， is seen radiologically in 30% of cases conventional osteosarcoma. Histologically， these tumor cells are very pleomorphic with numerous atypical mitoses that are entrapped in the osteoid matrix.

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus with envelope belongs to the genus of B-coronavirus. It is the seventh kind of human coronavirus infections， closely related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)，characterized by lower respiratory infection. In the past 20 years， more than 10，000 cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection have been reported in the world \\[1，2\\]. Compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV，SARS-CoV-2 has stronger infectivity. As of September2021， more than 200 million confirmed cases and more than 4 million deaths have been reported in the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Considering there are many infections of COVID-19 are asymptomatic， the total number of infections may larger 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As we known， pregnant women are a vulnerable population who were more susceptible to viral infections.SARS-CoV orMERS-CoV infection during pregnancy could lead severe complications such as maternal death， stillbirth， spontaneous miscarriage， and so on. It has been reported that the mortality rate of SARS-CoV infection in pregnant women was**\n\n【26】**25% (10% of the general population)， while the mortality rate of pregnant women infected with MERS-CoV was as high as 37%\\[1，2，5-7\\]. Therefore， a SARS-CoV-2 screening method for pregnant women is required， especially to differentiate the asymptomatic from health pregnant women. The main mode of SARS-CoV-2 spread from person-to-person is through respiratory droplets， close contact and high concentration aerosol transmission. Vertical transmission is also reported occasionally. Some studies showed that a low proportion of newborns delivered from pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were infected with SARS-CoV-2， but most of them had no evidence of placental infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. A Sweden team reported a confirmed intrauterine vertical SARS-CoV-2 case with high viral load in placenta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Therefore， the possibility of intrauterine transmission in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ignored. Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) based on cell-free DNA(cfDNA) which is present in maternal plasma has been introduced in routine pregnant examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Pregnant women in Changsha， Hunan could get free NIPT， benefitting from the financial support provided by the government's preferential policies. In this study， we present an approach of noninvasive prenatal testing of SARS-CoV-2(NIPT-SARS-CoV-2) to achieve the screening of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women during routine prenatal examination.**\n\n【27】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【28】**Study design**\n\n【29】**This study was approvedbythe Ethics Committee ofthe Changsha Hospital for Maternal and Child Health Care， Hunan， China. A total of 50 pregnant women were recruited from Changsha Hospital for Maternal and Child Health Care between July and September 2020for this study， in which 40 were NIPT negative and 10 were NIPT positive. The SARS-CoV-2RNA sample used in this study was from COVID-19 patients visited in the First Hospital of Changsha，Hunan， China. Written consent was obtained from all participants. An optimized NIPT was designed to detect fetal aneuploidy and SARS-CoV-2 at the same time.**\n\n【30】**Plasma separating and processing**\n\n【31】**First， peripheral blood of pregnant women was centrifuged at1，600 g for 10 min at 4-C. Second， the supernatant was transferred to 2.0 ml EP tubes， centrifuged again at 16，000 g for 10 min at 4C. Finally， the plasma was transferred to fresh tubes and immediately stored in -80-C， with 0.6 ml each tube. The separated plasma was divided equally into two parts， one was for extracting cfDNA， and the other was for extracting SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The plasma cfDNA was extracted by QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen， Germany). The plasma RNA was extracted by QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen， Germany)， and then was reverse transcripted to cDNA immediately by Fapon RNA-sep cDNA Synthesis Kit (Feipeng， China).**\n\n【32】**Library constructing and sequencing**\n\n【33】**The cfDNA and SARS-CoV-2 cDNA were mixed in equal proportion and were used as the input DNA to make the NIPT library. Three groups of libraries were set up， including negative group， trisomy positive group， and simulated SARS-CoV-2 group. The negative group library was prepared by cfDNA and SARS-CoV-2cDNA from NIPT negative pregnant women. The trisomy positive group library was prepared by cfDNA and SARS-CoV-2cDNA from NIPT positive pregnant women. The simulated SARS-CoV-2 group library was prepared by cfDNA from NIPT negative pregnant women**\n\n【34】**and SARS-CoV-2 cDNA from COVID-19 patients. Three different SARS-CoV-2 concentration gradients were set up in the simulated SARS-CoV-2 group， including 1，400 copies/ml， 14，000 copies/ml， and 140，000 copies/ml. Through end repairing， adding adapter， and PCR amplification to prepare the NIPT library， after quality control， the products were sequenced on the Ion Proton platform (Life Technologies，USA).**\n\n【35】**Data analysis**\n\n【36】**The Quality Control (QC) analysis was used to filtered the low-quality reads from raw sequencing data. The clean data were mapped to human genome 19 (hg19). The BAM files obtained were sorted and the PCR repeat reads were filtered. NIPT analysis software (Darui Biotechnology Co.， Ltd.， Guangzhou， China) was used to preform GC-bias correcting and Z-score calculating to determine the risk of fetal chromosome aneuploidy. When the Z-score >3 or <-3 of any chromosome showed that the fetal with high risk of fetal chromosome aneuploidy. At the same time， the clean data were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC\\_045512.2)， and the low-quality reads (mapped length less than 60) were filtered. Then through calculating the number of mapped SARS-CoV-2 reads to determine whether there was SARS-CoV-2 infection.**\n\n【37】**Statistical analysis**\n\n【38】**Paired t-test was used to compare the amount of data that generated by different methods， and Pearson correlation coefficient was used for data correlation analysis. All statistical analysis were performed using R3.5.1.**\n\n【39】**Result**\n\n【40】**Detection of fetal chromosome aneuploidy**\n\n【41】**NIPT analysis and SARS-CoV-2 analysis were performed for all samples. Negative NIPT result was confirmed in all cases in the negative group and simulated SARS-CoV-2 group， while positive NIPT result was confirmed in all cases in the trisomy positive group， including 4 cases for trisomy 21， 4 cases for trisomy 18， 1 case for trisomy 13， and 1 case for trisomy 21 combined with trisomy 13.20 clinical routine NIPT samples from Changsha Hospital for Maternal and Child Health Care were selected randomly to evaluate the sequencing data of the new technology of NIPT-SARS-CoV-2. The results demonstrated that there was no significant difference of total sequencing data in the two technologies， which indicated the new NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 could accurately analyze fetal chromosome aneuploidy without increasing the sequencing data.**\n\n【42】**Detection of SARS-CoV-2**\n\n【43】**SARS-CoV-2reads were detected in all cases in simulated SARS-CoV-2 group， with average 35 reads in 1400 copies group (range4-64)， average 337 reads in 14，000 copies group (range 252-464)， and average 2，759 reads in 140，000 copies group (range 2392-3220). None SARS-CoV-2 reads were detected in the negative group and trisomy positive group. Combined the NIPT result indicated that the new NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 could detect SARS-CoV-2 in the three concentration gradients without affecting the fetal chromosome aneuploidy analysis. The fewest number of SARS-CoV-2 reads only 4 in 1，400 copies group， suggesting that this method could accurately detect SARS-CoV-2 with a viral load of 1，400 copies/ml. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 reads in 1 million total reads was calculated to analysis the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 reads proportion and detected viral reads. The correlation coefficient**\n\n【44】**between the two up to 0.977， suggesting that the new NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 has potential for quantitative or semi-quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2.**\n\n【45】**Discussion**\n\n【46】**Since the outbreak of COVID-19， asymptomatic infections have beenreported in manystudies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-13\\]</u>.Asymptomatic infections mean who have no clinical symptoms and abnormalities in images but with positive detection of SARS-CoV-2. A study focuses on asymptomatic ratio showed that the incidence of asymptomatic was estimated to be 30.8% among 565 Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Asymptomatic infection is also existed in pregnant women. Another study investigated 675 pregnant women for delivery in three New York City hospitals found that 10.4% were positive for SARS-CoV-2and up to 78.6% of them were asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Some studies indicated that the viral load in asymptomatic infections is similar to COVID-19 patients， and the infectivity between the two has no significant difference， which signified asymptomatic infections may accelerate the spread of COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15-18\\]</u>. But it has great challenge to identify and control asymptomatic infections due to no obvious clinical manifestations with them. Screening high-risk populations is a possible effective measure to find asymptomatic. The new method NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 reported in this study can accurately analyze fetal chromosome aneuploidy and SARS-CoV-2 without increasing the sequencing data， and the virus load could low to 1，400 copies/ml.So that through this method SARS-CoV-2 can be detected for all pregnant women when they carry out the routine prenatal testing. In addition， detecting viral nucleic acid by peripheral blood can avoid the drawbacks of collecting nasopharyngeal swabs collection， such as the discomfort and psychological pressure to pregnant women， the exposure of healthcare staff. In this way， pregnant women with asymptomatic infection can be early recognized and controlled， which will be conducive to get the optimal management and treatment for them. The collection of upper respiratory specimens， especially nasopharyngeal swabs， has been widely used to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19. However， in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs， some researches show that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid can also be detected in other sites including sputum， feces， blood and other types of samples \\[19，20\\]. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid can be detected in the blood of COVID-19 patients 2~3 days after onset， and there is even report shown that the same one COVID-19 patient with positive SARS-CoV-2 detection in blood samples， but no SARS-CoV-2 is detected in throat swabs， which suggesting that it is feasible and necessary to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by blood samples. Once virus infection occurs， although it takes a period of time to form toxemia or show obvious clinical symptoms， the nucleic acid fragments of virus degraded in the process of metabolism will enter the peripheral blood at an early stage. Therefore， the new technology NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 has the advantage of screening pregnant women carrying the virus in the early stage of infection. The diagnosis of COVID-19 mainly depends on clinical manifestations， epidemic history， CT imaging screening and etiology detection， among which etiology detection is the most accurate diagnosis scheme 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Etiology detection includes viral nucleic acid detection， antibody and antigen detection， and the viral gene detection by quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) is a priority test recommended by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. RT-qPCR can detect viral nucleic acids efficiently and rapidly， with high sensitivity and high specificity. But this method only can detect some specific viral gene regions， such**\n\n【47】**as Open reading frame 1 ab (ORFlab)， Nucleocapsid protein (N) and Envelope (E)， which may cause false negative due to the virus variant. Unlike RT-qPCR， the NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 can detect whole genome of the virus with low-depth sequencing， which can identify virus variants and trace the cryptic origins of the virus in theory. A recently study reported an intrauterine infection case of COVID-19， the puerperal and the newborn were infected with the same virus，but a variant of the virus occurred in the newborn a few days later 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The researchers thought it might be caused by the contact with the external environment after birth， and the virus mutated surprisingly fast， which also suggested the importance of virus gene sequencing. In conclusion， the technology of NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 reported in this study can achieve the purpose of NIPT detection and SARS-CoV-2detection for pregnant women in the progress of routine prenatal testing by drawing only one tube of peripheral blood. In this way， SARS-CoV-2 screening can be performed for pregnant women， so that asymptomatic infections can be early recognized and controlled， which ensure the optimal management and treatment for pregnant women and newborns. In addition， it has the potential for monitoring virus variant and tracking virus transmission， which will be helpful for control the spread of this serious epidemic.**\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Acknowledgment**</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**This work is supported by the Innovative Construction Project of Hunan Province， Special Topic on Fighting against Coronavirus Disease 19 \\[Grant Number： 2020SK30441.**</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Catheter related bloodstream infections are the most serious compilations of parenteral nutrition therapy.**\n\n【14】**Contamination of the hub of a central line may cause bacteremia and sepsis. We present the case of Leuconostoc mesenteroides bacteremia in a parenteral-fed patient in the home-care setting. To our knowledge， it is the first described case of central line's salvage from this pathogen in an immunocompromised permanently parenterally fed adult patient.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation： A 29-year-old man with features of malnutrition due to infection of a central line was admitted to the hospital on emergency. The patient reported abdominal pain， fever and symptoms of dysuria for 3 weeks. Standard tests were performed including blood for culture sampled from the central line and the peripheral vein. Blood cultures detected central line.**\n\n【16】**Parenteral nutrition administered viatheperipheral venous route was introduced. Firstly，bacteremia was empirically treated with antibiotics such as vancomycin and imipenem+cilastatine， secondly switched to ampicillin according to the antibiogram and with Clindamycin administered to the central line followed by alcohol lock. Control cultures confirmed successful treatment. Parenteral nutrition was administered to the central line and transfusion went uneventful for two days.**\n\n【17】**Conclusion： Successful treatment of opportunistic CRBSI with catheter salvage can be feasible even in immunocompromised patients. In the central lines treatment it is important to consider risks and benefits resulting from its removal.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Central venous catheter； Leuconostoc； Home parenteral nutrition； Sepsis**\n\n【19】**Introduction**\n\n【20】**Leuconostoc species are Gram-positive， non-motile bacteria placed within the family of Streptococcacae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Species of this kind are hard to identify in clinical studies； by virtue of similar phenotype they are sometimes incorrectly reported as a.o. Streptococcus， LactococcuS Or Enterococcus species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Leuconostoc spp. is widespread in the natural environment. They were also identified in human's gastrointestinal tract， oral mucosa and reproductive organs. Until recently were considered to be non-pathogenic for humans and animals， whereas they are a rare cause of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. Now they have been recognized as a potential pathogen causing infection mainly in immunocompromised patients， patients with central venous catheters or patients undergoing long-term treatment with antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【21】**Infection problem in parenteral nutrition**\n\n【22】**Parenteral nutrition is an invasive form oftreatment which carries a risk of serious complications. These complications when diagnosed too late or misdiagnosed and treated poorly might lead to the death of a patient. It is estimated that complications of central venous catheters might occur in one patient in ten. Often， the number of catheter-related septic complications is expressed as “catheter days”. Acceptable CRBSI (Catheter-related bloodstream infection) rates have been variably reported as 0.35-2.27 episodes/1000 catheter days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>.**\n\n【23】**_cited._**\n\n【24】**When a significant bacterial or fungal growth occurs， microbes disseminate into the blood**\n\n【25】**stream and clinical symptoms manifested by sub febrile states or fever with chills， tachycardia， shortness of breath and overall deterioration of patient's state occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. When disseminated infection is suspected the culture for fungus， aerobic and anaerobic bacteria is performed from the blood collected from the catheter or from the peripheral vein. Culture is also performed for urine， feces and skin around the exit of the catheter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【26】**During the waiting period for blood culture results， empiric antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive (vancomycin) and Gram-negative bacteria (carbapenem) is implemented， which then is modified according to antibiograms. A type of vascular access should also be considered during the course of treatment： in case of non-tunneled catheters the consideration of risks and benefits from catheter removal is advisable. In case of permanent tunneled catheters a local treatment while keeping a catheter is recommended， if the infection is not caused by pathogens from a Staphylococcus _aureus， Pseudomonas aeruginosa， Mycobacterium group. Fungal_ infections， multi-resistant bacteria， opportunistic microorganisms， IS， immunocompromised patients or valved catheters (Groshong) are considered as not suitable for successful salvage. Infection caused by shall also not be treated通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**Case Presentation**\n\n【28】**A 29-year-old male was urgently admitted to the ward because of a 39℃ fever， abdominal pain and symptoms of dysuria persisting for3 weeks. The patient was permanently parenterally-fed via a tunneled catheter in home settings andpresented with features of malnutrition， atrophy of subcutaneous tissue and BMI 16. Before admission to the hospital a primary physician administered Sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim which led to a partial improvement in the following symptoms： abdominal pain and dysuria symptoms stopped， while fever without chills persisted.**\n\n【29】**Medical history was as follows： Crohn’s disease， Perianal fistula with chronic colonization of Klebsiella preumoniae MBL (+)， short bowel syndrome due to multiple extended surgical resections， drug induced liver and bone marrow damage after immunosuppressive treatment， hypertension， and prerenal acute kidney injury. At the admission， 100 mg of azathioprine was administered by oral rout to sustain immunosuppression for several months. On the day of the admission patient's temperature was 37.6°C， blood pressure 103/63mmHg， heart rate of 108 beats per minute with regular heart rate. Patient's general condition was good. Laboratory results： WBC： 9，06K/uL \\[4，0 -10，0\\]； RBC： 2，86 M/uL \\[4，3- 5，9\\]； HGB： 8，7 g/dL \\[13，6-17，2\\]； CRP： 61，42 mg/1\\[0，00-10，00\\].**\n\n【30】**The chest X-rayand abdominal ultrasonography has not revealed any important abnormality. Patient with normal peristalsis and stoma output in the left mid-abdominal region， with two fistulas on the right side and no abdominal signs. A Broviac catheter on the right side of the chest， the area around the exit of the catheter was normal.**\n\n【31】**Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) was administered into the peripheral venous catheter. Nil per os was recommended. Empiric antibiotic therapy was implemented： vancomycin 2 × 1.0 g i.v.， imipenem+cilastatine 3×0.5 g i.v. On the following day， patient's body temperature was normalized and pain regressed. Blood for culture from permanent catheter revealed Leuconostoc mesenteroides.**\n\n【32】**Despite the opportunistic character of infection and poor immunological patient's status， an attempt to heal the central line was**\n\n【33】**taken. By the tenth day of hospitalization ampicillin was administered according to the antibiogram 4×0.5 g i.v. (for 7 days). Catheter lock with 1.5 ml of 90% alcohol (for 4 following days) was applied.**\n\n【34】**On day 13 catheter lock of Clindamycin 150 mg for the following4 days was administered via VCS according to an antibiogram while continuing the previous systemic antibiotic therapy. At the end of the treatment a peripheral blood and central catheter cultures confirmed successful treatment and catheter salvage. A nutrition mixture was administered to the central line wan was uneventful. On the 18h day of hospitalization the patient was discharged. In the control test 8weeks and 3 months later no recurrence of infection was found.**\n\n【35】**Discussion**\n\n【36】**The reported case comes from the largest parenteral home-feeding centre in Poland， the member of a Polish Network of intestinal insufficiency treatment. Annually about 340-356 patient are fed parenterally. A diligent training program on using a central venous catheter for patients and families resulted in the fixed number of incidence of infections at a rate of 0.45 incidents per 1000 catheter days. The authors in Winkler’s work presented prevalence of blood infections linked with the use of a central line in parenterally-fed patients (CRBSI) at the rate of 0.38-4.58 incidence per 1000 catheter days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Other reports oscillate in the rate of 0.34 and 2.68 incidence per 1000 catheter days \\[13，14\\]. Average frequency of CRBSI in Europe is 1.5 to 2 incidents per 1000 catheter days. Longer time of catheterization causes a higher risk of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.**\n\n【37】**Recommended antibiotics used for treatment of the Leuconostoc spp. infections are B-lactams. Penicillin and ampicillin are more active than cephalosporins and are used as first line therapy. Carbapenems(e.g. imipenem) are effective， although there is a documented incident resistance to this group of antibiotics in case of a patient with postoperative meningitis. Leuconostoc spp. bacteria is also susceptible to Clindamycin， Tobramycin， Erythromycin， Minocycline with variable susceptibility for Quinolones， Cephalosporins and Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) \\[2，16\\].**\n\n【38】**These microbes are characterizedbyself-resistance to glycopeptides such as Vancomycin (VCM) because of modified peptidoglycan precursor’s production. Modifiedprecursors are characterized by reduced affinity for vancomycin.**\n\n【39】**In the presented case antibiogram suggested susceptibility of Leuconostoc mesenteroides to 3 antibiotics： Ampicillin， Meropenem and Vancomycin. Ampicillin was introduced； because literature suggests that in-vivo resistance for two other antibiotics may appear. During the targeted therapy， when choosing an antibiotic， the penetration capacity of the infection site， proper dose and the route of administration was considered as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.**\n\n【40】**There are only a few cases of Lecunostoc spp. bacteremia described in literature. Ho et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> describe the case of female patient with squamous cell carcinoma and sepsis was successfully treated with antibiotic therapy and central line was maintained. Due to initial blood cultures revealing Gram-positive cocci empiric antibiotic therapy was administered (vancomycin and piperacillin with tazobactam). According to antibiogram antibiotics were changed to ampicillin 2 g i.v. every 6 h. After 2-week treatment blood culture results came out negative 18.**\n\n【41】**Ishiyama et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> presented a case of a female patient with myeloblastic leukemia who developed moderate fever during**\n\n【42】**chemotherapy. In the blood culture Gram-positive cocci were found and vancomycin was implemented. Having proven that it was Leuconostoc bacteria， VCM was ceased. On the basis of medicine susceptibility imipenem/cilastatin and gentamicin were implemented. When treatment was not successful and fever went up， gentamicin was changed to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The therapy proved to be effective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.**\n\n【43】**In the other case of 26-year-old male patient in who blood culture found Leuconostoc spp. a result of antibiogram test showed susceptibility to clindamycin， ampicillin， gentamicin and penicillin. He was successfully treated with clindamycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.**\n\n【44】**Another publication presents the case of a patient with a 38.8℃fever. Leuconostoc mesentroides bacteria susceptible to penicillin and aminoglycoside were isolated from peripheral blood. For 6 days the treatment included ampicillin (6 g/day i.v.)， then it was switched to amoxicillin (3 g/ per os.). Decrease in fever was reported. Blood control results came out negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.**\n\n【45】**In another publication presented by Huber et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> a male with lung mycobacteriosis， parenterally-fed via central line， was diagnosed with Leuconostoc bacteria susceptible to： Penicillin， Ampicillin， Imipenem， Erythromycin， Clindamycin， and Gentamicin and resistant to Vancomycin found in a blood culture from the tip of a catheter. The catheter was removed which led to the reduction of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.**\n\n【46】**Conclusion**\n\n【47】**Although L. mesenteroides is an opportunistic pathogen， it was successfullytreated with catheter salvage. It is feasible to treat catheters even with pathogens considered to be at high risk of treatment failure. To the attempt for treatment with catheter preservation， good condition and close monitoring of the patient is mandatory.**\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

The angiomyolipoma of the kidney is a benign tumor that often happens along with tuberous sclerosis. Large renal angiomyolipoma's associated with tuberous sclerosis are in danger of fatal hemorrhage. This study reported a case with an unexpected large size of renal angiomyolipoma's associated with tuberous sclerosis.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation： We report a girl aged 5 years and 9 months old with tuberous sclerosis who referred to nephrology clinic due to abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed a large mass in the right flank. Kidney ultrasound reported a large mass with approximate size of 90 mmx 60mm in the right kidney， and abdominal CT scan also showed a non-hemogenic solid mass in the right kidney with size of 91 mm x68 mm×67 mm， was highly suspected for Wilms tumor. Since the large size of lesion and subsequent suspension for malignant tumor， partial nephrectomy was performed and through kidney biopsy an unexpected angiomyolipoma was diagnosed.**\n\n【19】**Conclusion： Considering extended studies in various populations with tuberous sclerosis and renal angiomyolipoma， this case is challenging and intriguing since she was the youngest one among patients with necessity of nephrectomy due to the large size of lesion and radiologic findings suggestive of Wilms'tumor.**\n\n【20】**Keywords： Tuberous sclerosis； Renal angiomyolipoma； Children； Nephrectomy**\n\n【21】**Introduction**\n\n【22】**Tuberous Sclerosis (TS) is an uncommon neurocutaneous and genetic disease， arises from inactivating mutations of either TSC1 (chromosome locus 9q34.3) or TSC2 (16p13.3) genes which encode hamartin and tuberin， respectively.

Complications are usually treated with angiographic embolization or surgical removal such as radical nephrectomy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. This study reported a case with an unexpected large size of renal angiomyolipoma's (90 mm x60 mm) associated with Tuberous sclerosis. It was so interesting that despite large size of tumor， there were no evidences of bleeding， and kidney ultrasound and abdominal CT scan findings were representative of Wilms tumor.**\n\n【24】**Figure 1： Abdominal CT scan with contrast media injection which shows a non-hemogenic solid mass in the right kidney with the size of 91 mm x68 mm x 67 mm， highly suspected to Wilms' tumor. Additionally， various non-hemogenic lesions in middle line， spleen and the left kidney which are undifferentiated from normal parenchyma. No abdominal lymphadenopathy.**\n\n【25】**Case Presentation**\n\n【26】**The patient was an Iranian girl aged 5 years and 9 months old and referred to nephrology clinic due to abdominal pain and a huge right flank mass. At the age of 9 months， following recurrent seizures accompanied by skin lesions the diagnosis of TS was made for this patient. Her weight was 15 kg (Z score： -2) and systolic blood pressure at first visit was 100 mmHg with no detectable diastolic blood pressure. Pulse rates were normal and there were no evidences of internal hemorrhage.**\n\n【27】**Although she was old enough (age >5 years)， she had fecal and urinary incontinence and because of intellectual disability she was unable to speak. Physical examination determined different Cafe au lait macules and angiofibroma's lesions on the face， limbs， trunk and borders of the fingers， and Shagreen patch in the region of lumbar vertebrates. She had a history of repetitive hand surgeries for removal of fingers lesions which restricted her movements. Physical examination of abdomen revealed a huge mobile mass in the right flank without tenderness.**\n\n【28】**Imaging test**\n\n【29】**Kidney ultrasound findings reported a large mass with a size of90 mm x 60 mm in the right kidney， very closely resembled a Wilms tumor. Abdominal CT scan with intravenous contrast injection defined a non-hemogenic solid mass in the right kidney with a size of91 mm x68 mm x67 mm，highly suspected to Wilms tumor (Figure**\n\n【30】**Figures (2A-2C)： Pleomorphic Angiomyolipoma composed of epithelioid cells with acidophilic or clear cytoplasm and some bizarre nuclei intermixed with bload vessels. (H&E staining low and high-power field). The tumor cells showed immunoreactivity for Desmin and HMB-45 that confirmed the diagnosis.**\n\n【31】**1). Thoracic CT scan also performed in multiple sections and their results were unremarkable. Partial nephrectomy was performed and histopathologic examination revealed Pleomorphic Angiomyolipoma as the final diagnosis and there were no histological evidences of Wilms tumor .**\n\n【32】**Discussion**\n\n【33】**Tuberous Sclerosis (TS) is an autosomal dominant disease， most commonly caused by TSC1 or TSC2 genes mutation and identified by benign hamartomas in about 34% to 80% of TS patients with renal angiomyolipoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. It is a rare genetic multisystem disorder， presented by benign tumors which can develop in any organ system. It’s prevalence in live-birth is 1 in 5，800 births and prevalence of 1 in 12，500 had been reported in total population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Renal angiomyolipoma’s are benign vascular， smooth muscle tumors and are typically asymptomatic but may induce flank or abdominal pain， hematuria， abdominal mass or distension， fever， nausea， vomiting， or progressive loss of kidney function. Death due to retroperitoneal hemorrhage (Wunderlich syndrome) have been reported in cases with renal angiomyolipoma's 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【34】**Growth of angiomyolipoma associated with TSC is faster than those associated withsporadic angiomyolipomaa13， Angiomyolipoma’s with a diameter >3.5 cm have the significant risk for severe hemorrhage and selective embolization should be considered as first treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Renal angiomyolipoma lesions are classified as small (<4 cm)， medium (4 cm to 8 cm) or large (>8cm) based on the single largest lesion in each kidney. The severity of complications is mostly related to the sizes oflesions. The mean size of 85 mm (35 mm to 200 mm) and 78 mm (45 mm to 180 mm)renal angiomyolipoma's (sporadic or associated with TSC) referred to selective embolization， have been reported in two studies \\[15，16\\]and the individual risk of bleeding appears moderate， even in TS patients(around 6%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【35】**It has been reported that tumors sized >6 cm are at higher risk of bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， while another study showed that tumors with size of<8cm tend to be asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Similar to our case， a recent study reported asymptomatic giant renal angiomyolipoma's (290 mm×215mmx120 mm) in a patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.**\n\n【36】**In a recently extended study among patients with TS， 1070 of2065 enrolled cases (51.8%) had a history of renal angiomyolipoma. Among patients aged<18 years，34.3% had angiomyolipoma with the**\n\n**size of >3 cm. Totally 498 cases with renal angiomyolipoma (46.5%) needed to treatment， including 11/134 (8.2%) patients who were at age of 5 to 9 years (likely the age range of our case). Nephrectomy was a rare modality used for treatment in cases <18 years (5/498cases； 1%)， while in those aged >18 years， 57/572 patients (9.95%) underwent nephrectomy. The youngest age for nephrectomy was >9years 20|.**\n\n【38】**Conclusion**\n\n【39】**Our case is interesting since presents a girl with TS and large renal angiomyolipoma which mimicking the Wilms’tumor findings in the imaging studies (renal ultrasound and abdominal CT scan). Despite large size of tumor there was no sign of bleeding. Patient underwent nephrectomy because of the large sized lesion and suspicion to malignant tumor. Nephrectomy rarely needed in children with TS who were at age of<18 years (1%). Considering an extended study in a large population with TS and renal angiomyolipoma， our case had been the youngest one with indispensable nephrectomy.**\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Acknowledgment**</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**The authors thank all the staff of Children's Medical Center at Tehran University of Medical Sciences for their kind assistance with this study.**</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Clinical manifestations are immediate but less frequently it could lead to insidious lung damage， as De demonstrated by the presented case. We present a case of unsuspected FB aspiration， mimicking an infection vs. lung tumor. After left lower lobectomy， pathology revealed a foreign body (animal bone) at the open of lingular bronchus.**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Tracheobronchial Foreign Body (FB) aspiration is not uncommon， though the incidence in pediatric age is higher \\[1，2\\]. The clinical manifestations range from acute asphyxiation， when FB obstruct the main airway， whereas in more distal airway obstruction， it is more common signs of a recurrent infection with insidious lung damage. A delayed diagnosis is frequent in cases where FB aspiration is not overt， so it should be considered as one of the causes of persistent post-obstructive pneumonia 3-5.**\n\n【15】**Symptoms are usually nonspecific，so a highlevel ofclinical suspicionis needed， as its presentation mimics other respiratory tract pathologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The predisposing factors in adults are male sex， old age， CNS dysfunction， psychiatric illness， alcohol and/or sedative abuse， trauma intubation， dental procedure and pulmonary disease \\[7，8\\].**\n\n【16】**Because of the anatomical features of the bronchial tree， foreign body is commonly lodged in the right， especially in the right intermediate bronchus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.

A 63 years-old caucasian man， former smoker， with past medical history of COPD， hypertension， dyslipidemia and acute myocardial infarction in 2005， without history of alcohol or sedatives abuse. He presented in the Outpatient Clinic of Pneumology in January 2018 with complaints of weight loss， since 9 months before， and cough-syncope episodes following vigorous bouts of cough since 6 months before， with no fever or chest pain. He also reported hemoptysis since2 months before. He denied history of aspiration. Pulmonary auscultation revealed crackles in the left hemithorax. On investigation， chest- RX showed an opacification of the middle left hemithorax and chest-CT revealed a lingular consolidation with atelectasis . It was performed a bronchoscopy， with evidence of a white and necrotic plaque in the left upper division bronchi with signs of obstruction and bronchiallumen reduction， as also signs of mucosal edema and infiltration. The patient kept the recurrent symptoms initially described along the next 6 months， and there was also a radiological impairment in sequential chest-CT scan， with a higher extension of the lingular consolidation. It was performed a PET scan， with signs of metabolic activity in lingular consolidation (SUV maximum of 8，4). Considering the insidious clinical evolution， the persistence of symptoms and radiological impairment， the suspect was infectious or malignant aetiology. The patient underwent a left upper lobectomy， where it was removed a foreign body-animal bone-located at the open oflingular bronchus . The histological result showed an inflammatory infiltrate surrounding a foreign body (chicken bone).**\n\n【19】**_cited._ This case demonstrates the potential diagnostic challenges of FB aspiration.

Often the fistula is iatrogenic， following esophagoscopy or esophageal irradiation or， less frequently， traumatic due to ingested foreign body， as fish bone or caustics.

The overall mortality rate is very high，reaching 80% in malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 68-year-old woman with 1-year medical history of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with liver metastases (neoplasm staging IVb： T4， N1， M1 as defined by American Cancer Society，2020) was admitted to the emergency room due to hemodynamic instability， orthopnea and chest pain. Nine months before， an implantation of partially covered Self-Expanding Metal Stent (SEMS， Evolution PC Cook Medical Inc， Bloomington， IN) has been performed， as a palliative treatment of a malignant esophageal stricture. At admission， chest X-ray demonstrated a conspicuous hydropneumopericardium ， and the patient was referred to our cardiology department. A physical examination revealed arterial hypotension (88/55 mmHg)， sinus rhythm (96 bpm)， and tachypnea (respiratory frequency 32/m). Blood tests showed leukocytosis (23.150/mm’) with neutrophilia (91%) and elevated C-reactive protein (32.12 mg/dL). No fever was present. Urgent2-D transthoracic echocardiogram showed a very large circumferential hyperechoic pericardial effusion with moderate compression of the right atrium. Pericardial drainage was immediately**\n\n【18】Figure 1： Chest X-ray at admission (anteroposterior and lateral projections).

Gastrografin@ fills the esophageal stent (arrowhead).**\n\n【20】Figure 3： Esophagascopy shows the perforation of the mid-thoracic esophagus (arrow) and the irregularity of the esophageal mucosa. Cardiac pulse was visible through the ulcerated perforation. The arrowhead indicates the partially covered proximal flanges of the previous implanted stent.\n\n【21】**performed by subxiphoid approach under fluoroscopic guidance with a pigtail catheter by means of the Seldinger technique. A volume of approximately 650 ml of cloudy and foul-smelling fluid was drained. The catheter was left in place for 4 days for continuous drainage and repeated flushing with saline. Pericardial fluid analysis was performed and results were suggestive of salivary flora colonization consisting of numerous Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacilli. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started. The clinical suspicion of an underlving esophagopericardial fistula was confirmed by thoracic Computed Tomography (CT) with oral iodinated media contrast (Gastrografin'Bayer). CT scan visualized the fistulous tract and the leakage of contrast from esophagus into the pericardial cavity， excluding other esophageal fistulation . The subsequent flexible fiber-optic esophagoscopy showed， 34 cm distal to incisor teeth's， a crater-like ulceration on the anterior wall of the mid-thoracic esophagus， with a evident perforation penetrating into the pericardial space， confirming the presence of an esophagopericardial fistula . The sharing of the clinical case with the oncologist and the gastroenterologist defined the most appropriate diagnostic path. We scheduled our patient for palliative therapy， due to advanced neoplastic disease and the rapid worsening of clinical condition.

During clinic and endoscopic follow-up no further complications of the esophageal canalization， stent dislocation or embolic and septic events occurred， until she died six month later， due to her neoplastic disease.**\n\n【25】**Discussion**\n\n【26】**The case highlights a critical and complicated context that required a multidisciplinary approach to successfully face and resolve this intricate clinical situation. The multidisciplinary team，including the intensive care cardiologist， the senior digestive endoscopist， the oncologist and the radiologist， discussed the clinical case， considered the patient's choices， and planned a tailored care plan. The first step was the resolution of the severe septic state and the drainage of the pericardial space， cause of the hemodynamic imbalance.

When surgery is not indicated or refused， the palliative treatment by esophageal stent placement provides a valid alternative， ensuring improvement of patient's quality of life as well as fast resumption of oral nutrition， and minimally morbidity \\[10，11\\]. Our concept was to combine a minimally invasive nonsurgical approach by esophageal stent placement with resolution of septic status and pericardial effusion by continuous drainage， repeated flushing with saline and systemic broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. In our patient a partially covered SEMS had previously been implanted for an esophageal neoplastic pathology. The senior endoscopist indicated the palliative implantation of a fully covered SEMS inside the first partially covered SEMS by stent-in-stent technique \\[12，13\\]. This technique is usually performed for the removal of stents embedded in the esophageal wall. Normally， one or both stents were subsequently removed after a few weeks. However， the removal of stents is frequently associated with bleeding or mucosal tears due to removal of the superficial layer of the esophagus or with mechanical complications due to traction of device通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. For these reasons， and for the severe underlying pathology， it was decided not to proceed with removal maneuvers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. This case highlights the importance of the multidisciplinary approach that conveys benefits to both the patients and the health professionals working on the team， improves clinical outcomes and offers enhanced safety for patients， by a decision making from different specialty fields that lead a shared treatment strategy patient-centered.**\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Acknowledgment**</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**We thank dr.

The clinical history， visual field， electroretinogram(ERG)， dark adaptation test， spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)； fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) plus DNA analysis (by Sanger sequencing) were performed.**\n\n【13】**Results： Fundus examination revealed scattered， homogenous， yellow-white dots throughout both fundi. OCT showed extrafoveal numerous well-demarcated homogenous dome-shaped lesions originating in the RPE. FAF showed a lack of autofluorescence (AF). Electroretinogram of the cone and the mixed rod-cone system had a normal morphologybut with a significant decrease in the a and b wave amplitudes and a delayed peak time. The rod-mediated ERG was non-detectable. However， after a prolonged (3-hour) period of dark adaptation， the rod-mediated ERG was detectable and the b-wave reached 48% of normal value. The DNA analysis and sequencing of RDH5 revealed a homozygous c. 524-526delACT mutation， leading to a protein change of p.Tyr175del， which has not been reported before. The cone ERG results， strongly suggest that she is developing a cone dystrophy， despite the fact that she is asymptomatic and still maintains 20/20 vision and normal color discrimination.**\n\n【14】**Conclusion： We identified a new deletion in RDH5 responsible for fundus albipunctatus with a progressive cone dystrophy； c. 524-526delACT in a patient from Burundi.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Fundus albipunctatus； RDH5； Cone dystrophy； 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase； Dark adaptation； Spectral-domainoptical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)； Fundus autofluorescence**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**_Citation：_**\n\n【18】**Fundus albipunctatus (FA) is an autosomal recessive congenital night blinding disorder characterized by the presence of retinal white dots caused by mutations in the RDH5 gene \\[1，2\\]， encoding for the retinol dehydrogenase (RDH).

She was also complaining of nyctalopia which was improving with her age. Her past medical history was insignificant and she was not on any medications. She came from a non-consanguineous family， and had a sister who was living in Burundi with the similar complaint.**\n\n【34】**The patient underwent a complete ocular exam. Her visual acuity was 20/20 in both eves. Her color vision was normal in both eves. There was no afferent pupillary defect. The intraocular pressure and the anterior segments were normal for both eyes.

However， after a 3-hour period of dark adaptation the amplitude of the a- and b-waves increased to reach values that were 85% (a-wave) and 69%(b-wave) of normal values. Peak times remained abnormal even with prolonged dark adaptation .**\n\n【43】**PCR，DNA analysis and sequencing of the RDH5 gene revealed a new deletion mutation in the RDH5，c. 524-526delACT mutation， which has not been previously reported .**\n\n【44】**Discussion**\n\n【45】**The SD-OCT exam in our FA patient showed numerous outer retinal lesions at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium， which extended into the overlying inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction of the photoreceptors as well as the outer nuclear layer.

No recovery after 2 h and only a modest recovery after 17 h has also been recently reported in a RLBP1 -negative RPA patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Our patient had an increase in the amplitude of the rod/cone-mediated ERG by 85% (a-wave) and 69%(b-wave) of normal values after a 3-hour period of dark adaptation. The cone ERG results， strongly suggest that she is developing a cone dystrophy， despite the fact that she is asymptomatic and still maintains 20/20 vision and normal color discrimination.**\n\n【50】**Our molecular genetic analysis demonstrates a new deletion mutation in RDH5， a homozygous 3bp deletion c. 524-526delACT.**\n\n【51】**Some patients with FA and RDH5 mutations are stable， while others develop cone dystrophy.

It has been suggested that focal ischemia， migraine， venous congestion， and epileptic phenomena are involved in the pathogenesis of TGA， and migraine is one of the most compelling relative factors associated with developing TGA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Generally，TGA attacks only once in most cases， but 5.4% to 27.1% of TGA patients will experience recurrence \\[2，3\\]. In recent years， migraine has also been seen as an important influencing factor in TGA recurrence， and there are some cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> suggested that TGA occurs as either \"an aura\"or “a sequel\"to migraine.Hippocampushyperintensity on Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) reflects the diffusion limitation of the structure related to memory which is thought to be associated with the focal transient perturbation of hippocampus circuits. Few reports have addressed the imaging of patients with recurrent TGA complicated with migraine， and we have herein reported a case of recurrent TGA patient with migraine， who showed hippocampus hyperintensity on brain MRI， aiming to try to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of recurrent TGA patients complicated with migraine.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 62-year-old woman with a sudden memory disorder 3 hbefore her emergency visit， presented with repetitive questioning about her immediate circumstances (e.g.，“What am I doing here?；“Has the car stopped?). Symptoms similar to this time have occurred twice at 6 years ago and 1 year ago， and recovered completely the next day after sleep and had no memory of the course during the onset. She only had a medical history of migraine for ten years that manifested fluctuation-like pain in the right posterior occipital and often occurred at cold， cough， fatigue and when summer and autumn alternations. She had no diabetes or hypertension and did not smoke or drink. During the attack， her personality， cognition involving semantic language， visuospatial discrimination， and writing ability were all preserved， and there was no impairment in the state of consciousness， and no obvious seizure activity. Physical examination showed limbs strength， sensation， reflex and coordination were normal. CHA2DS2-VASc scores were three (history of TGA， female). Blood tests revealed no significant abnormality. No significant abnormality was observed in the head Computed Tomography (CT) scan. MRI performed at three days after onset revealed a recent right hippocampus punctate hyperintensity on DWI with corresponding lesion in the T2-weighted MR image ， and MRS sequence showed the decrease of NAA peak in bilateral hippocampus. Fazekas' score was one which represented only minor cerebral microangiopathy in this patient. Because this patient had Valsalva-like activities related migraine， we also done contrast-enhanced Transcranial Doppler (c-TCD) examination which showed no shunt during normal breathing and mild shunt (1 microbubble appeared 11 sec after the starting of injection) during the**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： MRI imaging of patient at three days after onset (A-D).

Aspirin and statins were given for secondary prevention， and the patient had complete symptom resolution the next day after sleep and had no TGA or stroke recurrence during six months follow-up.**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**Although TGA was previously considered as a subtype of TIA because both are characterized by a sudden reversible loss of function， it was recentlybelieved that manyTGA patients did not belong to TIA. The risk factors of TIA are atherosclerotic risk factors， for example， age， hypertension， diabetes mellitus and cerebral microangiopathy. However， it is reported in the literature \\[2，5\\] that age and cerebral microangiopathy are protective factors for TGA recurrence， and TGA patients have a lower prevalence of hypertension， diabetes， and lipid disorders compared with TIA patients. Liampas et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> raises a pathophysiological hypothesis that the interaction between angiotensin II type-1 and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors may be an important reason for traditional risk factors for cerebrovascular diseases have emerged as protective factors for TGA recurrence. This patient was a 62-year-old female patient with no history of smoking， alcohol consumption and hypertension or diabetes mellitus， with a normal head MRA， which was consistent with the reports on the risk and protect factors for TGA recurrence.**\n\n【23】**The most compelling study in TGA risk factors， come from alarge-scale population-based study in 2014 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， who demonstrated people with migraine were more prone to TGA than those without migraine， with the incidence rate ratio of 2.48. No associations were found between migraine subtypes and TGA. Studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1 \\]</u> have shown that the most frequent trigger factors of TGA were emotional stress， physical effort， Valsalva-like activities and water contact or temperature change. In this case， three episodes of TGA attacks were triggered by cough or fatigue， which may be related to the temporary reduction in cerebral blood flow by VM. It is worth noting that Valsalva-like activities are the trigger factors of TGA， migraine is a risk factor of TGA， and migraine may be associated with unclosed foramen ovale， so here is an interesting hypothesis about the pathogenesis of TGA that the unclosed foramen ovale mediates paradoxical embolism under Valsalva-like activities and causes migraine， which also causes local cerebral ischemia and eventually triggers TGA. However， further attempts to verify the causal relationship between patent foramen ovale and TGA have since failed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， and the result of the c-TCD examination in this patient also do not fully support patent foramen ovale. In addition， some scholars 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> believe that TGA may be sequelae in migraine patients due to the activity throughout the cerebral cortex was suppressed in migraine patients， and the depression will extend to the hippocampus， thus leading to transient memory dysfunction. Spiegel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> has also reported that migraine may contribute to the destabilization of the CA1 filed of the hippocampus by releasing massive glutamate. However， the current evidences can only prove an association between migraine and TGA but not causality and further experimental researches are needed to prove the causal relationship between them.**\n\n【24】**A recent systematic review yielded TGA recurrence rate of13.5% by an analysis of nine cohorts consisting of 1，989 patients通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Andreas et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> predicted that patients older than 70 years old and with mild microangiopathy were subjected to about 25% risk of recurrence within the median latency period of four years. Oliveira et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> reported patients with recurrent TGA versus single TGA had more hippocampus hyperintensity on DWI (p=0.001). There are some retrospective studies \\[3，4\\] showing that young， without significant microangiopathy， with migraine and history of depression or dementia have an increased recurrence risk of TGA.**\n\n【25】**TGA is mainly a clinical diagnosis andhippocampus hyperintensity on brain MRI also assist in the diagnosis of TGA**\n\n【26】**Figure 2： MRS sequence showed the decrease of NAA peak in the right hippocampus.**\n\n【27】**Figure 3： MRS sequence showed the decrease of NAA peak in the left hippocampus.**\n\n【28】**Figure 4： The contrast-enhanced Transcranial Doppler (C-TCD) examination show no shunt during normal breathing and mild shunt (1 microbubble appeared 11seconds after the starting of injection) during the Valsalva Maneuver (VM) procedure.**\n\n【29】**from a neuroanatomical perspective. Lesions were considered to be located in CA-1 sector of the hippocampal cornu ammonis when they were detectable in both DWI and T2-weighted images which had been speculated to play a key role in the pathophysiology ofTGA通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. While TGA does typically not show acute changes on brain imaging， DWI or T2-weighted imaging may reveal hippocampal regions from 48 h to 72 h to 7 to 10 days after onset， and studies suggest that delayed neuronal injury of the hippocampus may cause the delayed appearance of the lesions on image findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In this case， the patient completed brain MRI at three days after onset showed a DWI lesion with corresponding lesion in the T2-weighted MR that revealed a recent right-side hippocampal lesion ， a region known to be critically involved in the process of memory consolidation and to be vulnerable to metabolic stress， and MRS sequence of hippocampus completed at eight days after onset showed the decrease of NAA peak in bilateral hippocampi . As we know that MRS provides information of metabolic alterations within brain structure from a clinical perspective， and NAA is one of the highest concentration of molecules in the Central Nervous System (CNS)， which is a marker of neuron integrity and viability通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， however there are no relevant reports of decreased NAA peak on the hippocampal MRS of TGA patients as yet. Bartsch et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> reported hippocampal MRS of diffusion lesions showed a lactate peak which indicated acute metabolic stress of hippocampal CA-1**\n\n【30】**neurons while long-term metabolic sequelae were lacking. There is only one punctate hypersignal in DWI， but both hippocampi have decreased NAA peaks， indicating that the hippocampal dysfunction that triggers TGA is far greater than the range shown by DWI. This phenomenon supports the hypothesis that TGA with migraine is not ofTIA origin. In view of the fact that there are few reports addressing MRS pattern in TGA， it is difficult to verify whether the decrease of NAA peak in bilateral hippocampus is representative and whether the pathophysiologic correlation between these lesions and episode of TGA is established， and more studies should be investigated.**\n\n【31】**The limitation of this case is lacking MRS sequences in the early stage of the onset and the follow-up， therefore we could not identify the alteration of NAA peak in the whole course of TGA.**\n\n【32】**In summary， we have herein presented a case of recurrent TGA complicated with migraine， who had a typical DWI lesion with corresponding lesion in the T2-weighted MR that revealed a recent right-side hippocampus lesion and relatively rare decreased NAA peaks in the bilateral hippocampus on MRS. Although TGA is generally a benign course， patients with recurrence risk factors and abnormal imaging examinations should be noticed by neurologists and scheduled for a long-term follow-up. Therefore， more studies are needed to investigate the relationship between migraine and recurrent TGA and DWI/MRS sequences of TGA patients at each stage of the**\n\n【33】**onset， which may shed light on the pathophysiological bases of TGA.**\n\n【34】**Funding**\n\n【35】This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.81871080).\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Patients present proptosis， edema， orbital and facial pain， and redness. Proptosis usually grows with the degree of inflammation fibrosis， and mass effect. It is possible to find optic neuropathy， alterations in the motility of the eye， ptosis. Patients may also experience headaches， asthenia，and general malaise. The diagnosis is based on anamnesis， clinical characteristics， exclusion of other pathologies. Orbital Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and TC are the most important diagnostic tests. Biopsy is rarely practiced mainly due to the low risk-benefit ratio； the possibility of injury to the orbital and periorbital anatomical structures is high. The main therapy is represented by corticosteroids， administered for a long time until the improvement or remission of symptoms \\[11.**\n\n【13】**The Sphenopalatine ganglion (GSP) is a complex anatomical structure， present bilaterally within the facial massif. Its fibers provide sensitivity to various structures and regulate their secretory and motor activity. We refer to： Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal mucosa， lacrimal glands， oral cavity in its upper region and nasal cavity. The fibers of the sphenopalatine ganglion also innervate the meninges and cerebral vessels.**\n\n【14】Specifically， the sphenopalatine ganglion is located behind the lateral insertion of the middle nasal concha and is covered with a thin layer of mucosa in the pterygopalatine fossa. The latter， together with the GSP， are anteriorly in relationship with the maxillary sinus； posteriorly with the pterygoid process； medially with the palatine bone； laterally with the pterygomaxillar fissure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【15】**Another set of axons that cross the pterygopalatine ganglion is made up of the somatic sensory fibers of the maxillarybranch of the trigeminal. The maxillary nerve emits somatic sensorybranches cross the pterygopalatine ganglion to form the palatine nerves. They conduct the somatic sensations of the gums， hard and soft palate， oral cavity， tonsils and uvula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Due to its sensory afferents， the sphenopalatine ganglion has been the target of treatment for chronic headache and atypical facial pain syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**We report an interesting case of a patients affected by IOIS with a disabling pain syndrome. She reported orbital and temporal pain， continuous， with a VAS steadily more than 7， insomnia and poor quality of life. At the CT scan of the facial massif the patient presented osteodysplastic alterations involving the small sphenoid wing， the frontal scale， part of the ethmoid labyrinth and the left anterior clinoid with fibrous tissue and immature osteoid. There were also alterations of the orbital pyramid. All the lesions were present on the left， where the painful symptoms were manifested.**\n\n【18】**The patient had practiced pharmacological therapy with opioids， antiepileptics drug， NSAIs and corticosteroids with very poor results. Upon obtaining informed consent， we proposed to the patient to undergo a cycle of sphenopalatine ganglion anesthetic blocks. We asked the patient to express the number of daily pain attacks， their intensity and duration. We administered the HIT-61aL questionnaire to the patient to assess the impact of pain on quality of life. The same information was requested at the end of each therapy cycle. The patient received the treatments at the AORN Monaldi pain therapy department in Naples， as an outpatient procedure. In each session the patient was placed in the supine position with the chin raised； 0.3 ml of 0.5%bupivacaine were administered through the left nostril by means of a special device present in the company for over a year and**\n\n【19】**already used for treatment of migraine and trigeminal neuralgia. The procedure was practiced in the same way contralaterally. The patient was observed for 30 min and then sent home with an appointment for the next block.**\n\n【20】**We subjected the patient to sphenopalatine ganglion block once a week for three weeks and repeated the cycle 15 days after the last administration. Fifteen days after the end of treatment， the patient reported a decrease in mean pain (mean VAS 3.6 ± 0.7) and a reduction in the number of daily painful episodes (2±0.5) and in duration (30 ±25 min). The consumption of NSAIDs was reduced and the quality oflife was defined as improving (HIT-6 score from 60before treatment to 50 after).**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**Ocular inflammation syndrome is a benign but disabling disease. The painful symptoms that often accompany this clinical condition are often very intense， continuous and capable of compromising normal daily activities. In the specific case it was a young patient， active at work and in good health conditions for the rest. However， the frequent painful attacks were unresponsive to all available pharmacological treatments and had led the patient to a depressive**\n\n【23】**state. The analysis of the anatomy of the sphenopalatine ganglion and of its sensory afferents allowed us to hypothesize its block in the management of the orbital inflammatory syndrome. The good response to treatment represented an interesting therapeutic option. Such experience obviously requires further investigation and alarge-scale application to validate its effectiveness.**\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**l.

Eligible patients were randomly assigned to the training and validation datasets. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression was used to select the optimal risk factors. A prediction model was established based on the selected characteristics. The performance of the nomogram was assessed by calibration plots and the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC). Furthermore， Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) was used to determine the net benefit rate of the nomogram.**\n\n【19】**Results： Among 368 patients who met the incusion criteria， older age， a history of diabetes and hyperuricemia， longer intravesical Prostatic Protrusion (IPP) and larger Prostatic Urethral Angulation (PUA) were independent risk factors for bladder calculi in patients with BPH. These factors were used to develop a nomogram， which had a good identification ability in predicting the risk of bladder calculi in patients， with AUROCs of 0.911 (95% CI： 0.876-0.945) in the training set and 0.884 (95% CI： 0.820-0.948) in the validation set. The calibration plot showed that the model had good calibration. Moreover，DCA indicated that the model had a good clinical benefit.**\n\n【20】**Conclusion： We developed and internally validated the first nomogram to date to help physicians assess the risk of bladder calculi in patients with BPH， which may help physicians improve individual interventions and make better clinical decisions.**\n\n【21】**Keywords： Bladder calculi； Benign prostatic hyperplasia； Risk factors； Nomogram； Decision curve analysis**\n\n【22】**Introduction**\n\n【23】**Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is the one of common benign diseases in urology， with a prevalence of 50% in men over 60 years of age， a figure that increases to 83% when men reach80 years of age or older 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Bladder calculi is one of the common complications of BPH. Bladder calculi account for 5% of urinary calculi in developed countries， and they are responsible for 8% of urolithiasis-related mortalities in developed nations \\[2，3\\]， with even worse incidence in developing countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. With the increasing average life expectancy of the elderly population， the incidence of BPH due to bladder calculi is expected to increase. According to the European Association of Urology (EAU) recommendations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， in general， the presence of bladder calculi in patients with BPH requires surgical intervention. Bladder calculi in patients with BPH not only increase patients'suffering and medical costs but can also increase perioperative risk due to a prolonged operative time. Although bladder calculi formation is believed to be associated with Bladder Outlet Obstruction (BOO)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u> and urinary stasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， in patients with urinary retention， bladder calculi develop in only 3% to 8% of patients with BOO due to BPH \\[10，11\\]. The role of the prostate in the pathogenesis of bladder stones remains unclear. Therefore， the condition is likely the result of complex interaction of multiple factors. Published studies \\[3，9，12\\] have identified some risk factors for bladder calculi in BPH patients， including older age， longer Intravesical Prostatic Protrusion(IPP)， lower maximum uroflow rate (Qmax)， lower urinary pH and magnesium， higher uric acid**\n\n【24】**super saturation and a history of gout. However， to date， there is no research to develop an ideal model for predicting bladder calculi risk in patients with BPH. Therefore， a quantifying and managing risk factor is extremely important for the prevention of bladder calculi to reduce both the rate of gravel surgery and the economic burden. In this study， we confirmed the independent risk factors that influence bladder calculi formation in patients with BPH. Based on the risk factors， we developed a nomogram for predicting the risk of bladder calculi in patients with BPH， which might help physicians provide further individualized clinical decisions.**\n\n【25】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【26】**Study population**\n\n【27】**In this retrospective observational study， patients aged 50 years or older who had IPSS ≥ 8， underwent TURP and had histologically proven BPH at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University between January 2018 and January 2021 were enrolled. The exclusion criteria included a history ofupper urinary tract calculi， diagnosed with urological tumor， neurogenic bladder， and bladder foreign body， bladder diverticulum， bladder neck contracture， and urethral stricture， history of transurethral resection of the prostate or insufficient clinical data. Of the total patients， 1100 patients were selected， based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria， 368 patients were selected for the final data analysis in our study. The enrolled patients were randomly assigned to a development set (n=260) and a validation set (n=108) at a ratio of 7：3， and the flowchart of the study participants is shown in Figure 1. The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi 'an Jiaotong University， Xi an， China.**\n\n【28】**Data collection**\n\n【29】**We collected patient variables， including age， Body Mass Index(BMI)， BPH duration， Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)， IPSS， previous medical history of hypertension， diabetes， Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) and hyperuricemia/gout (uric acid≥7 mg/dl)， urodynamic examination， and transrectal ultrasonography. A single urologist performed Transrectal Ultrasonography (TRUS) using a single ultrasound machine (ProFocus， BK Medical， Herlev， Denmark) in the condition of proper filling of the bladder (150mL to 200mL) to measure and record the Total Prostate Volume(TPV)， Transitional Zone Volume (TZV)，IPP， PUA. The TPV and TZV were measured using the prostate ellipsoid formula (height ×width xlengthxn/6). IPP was defined by measuring the distance from the bladder circumference at the prostate base to the tip of the protruding prostate gland in the sagittal plane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The PUA was defined as the angle formed by 2 rays of both the proximal and distal prostatic urethra on the mid sagittal plane image 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The peak flow rate and Post Void Residual (PVR) were determined according to International Continence Society Good Urodynamic Practices通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. All the patients underwent TURP with or without endoscopic lithotripsy. Postoperative bladder stone composition data were also collected.**\n\n【30】**Statistical analysis**\n\n【31】**Statistical analyses were performed and graphs were generated using SPSS 22.0 software (IBM Corporation， Chicago， IL， USA)， R version 3. 4.1 software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing， Vienna， Austria)and GraphPad Prism version 8 (GraphPad Software， La Jolla， CA， USA). Categorical variables are presented as frequencies**\n\n【32】**and percentages and were compared using the Pearson chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test， as appropriate. Continuous variables are presented as the means ± standard deviation or as medians and interquartile ranges accordingto their distribution and werecompared using Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test. In the training set， a nomogram for screening and predicting bladder calculi risk in patients with BPH was developed using LASSO regression based on the selected factors. To validate the discriminatory performance of the nomogram， the AUROC of the nomogram was calculated for both the training and validation sets. The calibration of the nomogram was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and calibration plots. Internal validation was performed via a bootstrap method with 1000re-samples. Then， DCA was conducted to evaluate the nomogram's clinical benefit. All P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.**\n\n【33】**Results**\n\n【34】**Baselineecharacteristics between theetrainingand validation sets**\n\n【35】**A total of 368 patients were randomly assigned to the training set (n=260) and the validation set (n=108).

Sixteen risk predictors were reduced to six potential risk factors based on the training set. Subsequently， multivariate analysis of the six potential factors was performed. Five factors were found to be associated with bladder calculi risk in patients with BPH (P<0.05). The five independent risk factors were age， diabetes， hyperuricemia， IPP and PUA， which is summarized in Table 3.**\n\n【51】**Construction and evaluation of the nomogram**\n\n【52】**For convenient clinical use， based on the independent risk factors， we drew a readily visualized nomogram of this predictive model . The nomogram consisted of five variables： Age， diabetes， hyperuricemia， IPP and PUA. The total score value of each individual patient was obtained by adding the corresponding scores of different categories of each independent risk factor， and then the corresponding total points scale represented the probability of bladder calculi of BPH patients. The training and validation sets had AUROCs of 0.911 (95% CI： 0.876-0.945) and 0.884 (95% CI：0.820-0.948)， respectively . In addition， the Hosmer-Lemeshow test AUROCs for the nomogram to predict bladder calculi were 0.564 and 0.544 in the training and validation sets， respectively，**\n\n【53】**which demonstrated reasonable calibration performance， and the favorable calibration curves of our nomogram are shown in Figure3d，3e. Finally， the DCA showed a high net benefit across the entire spectrum of probability thresholds ， indicating that the model could provide additional clinical benefit when predicting the threshold of bladder stone probability in BPH patients from 4% to78%.**\n\n【54】**Discussion**\n\n【55】**Bladder calculi secondary to BPH have the characteristics of high rates of urinary tract infection and surgery； they not only bring great pain to patients but also increase their economic burden. Unfortunately， management of bladder calculi in conjunction with BPH is a laborious， time-consuming and arduous procedure， particularly in patients with comorbidities who might not tolerate lengthy and extended procedures. Moreover， Chu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> found that that people with a previous diagnosis of bladder calculi were more likely to develop bladder cancer. Therefore， we used LASSO regression to identify independent risk factors for cystolithiasis and developed a visual nomogram to predict bladder calculi risk in patients with BPH to reduce the burden on the health of older men and on medical costs. In the present study， we found five independent risk factors associated with bladder calculi in patients with BPH， including age， history of diabetes and hyperuricemia/gout， IPP and PUA. More importantly， we developed and validated a nomogram for predicting bladder calculi in patients with BPH. Our nomogram combines the reported clinical risk factors (i.e.， age， history of gout， and IPP) \\[3，9，12\\] and incorporates several novel risk factors that are relevant in this patient population： PUA and history of diabetes. PUA correlates with BPH clinical progress and poor uroflow rate. PUA is an ultrasound parameter for predicting BOO， which is a bent tube， and the clinical significance of the PUA was recently reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17-20\\]</u>. An increased PUA may be the result of a higher bladder neck in men， which can better reflect the fluid dynamics of the urine passing through the prostatic urethra. Cho et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> suggested that energy loss in the bending tube in the prostatic urethra could occur during micturition， which could reflect the degree of obstruction in the process of urination. Our study found that the urine flow rate is inversely associated with PUA. Excessive PUA affects the smooth discharge of urine and is more likely to lead to the formation of urinary salt deposits in the bladder. Some studies\\[22，23\\] have confirmed that diabetes is significantly associated with an increased risk of upper urinary calculus. Interestingly， in our study， we also found that diabetes was an independent risk factor for the development of bladder stones in patients with BPH， suggesting a role of metabolic abnormalities in the formation of bladder stones. Stone formers with diabetes may have more acidic urine than stone formers without diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>，and alowurinarypH plays a major role in the formation of uric acid stones. In addition， the compensatory hyperinsulinemia of insulin resistance may increase the urinary excretion of calcium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. At the same time， previous studies suggested that IPP could be a predictor for bladder calculi， and in our study， we found that longer IPP was an independent risk factor for bladder calculi. The corrected OR was 1.219， indicating that each1 mm increase in IPP was associated with an 21.9% increased risk of bladder calculi in patients with BPH. Thus， the application of the five risk predictors in our nomogram is well founded. In this study， we considered the variables needed in our nomogram to be prevalent in clinical practice and convenient to acquire. Regarding the prediction of bladder calculi in patients with BPH， the AUROCs， calibration**\n\n【56】**Figure 3： (a) A nomogram based on the selected independent risk factors from the LASSO regression model for predicting bladder calculi in BPH patients. The nomogram consisted of five variables： Age， diabetes， hyperuricemia， IPP and PUA. Based on the sum of carrespanding paints of each variable， total paints could be calculated and therefore evaluated for the risk of bladder calculi. (b) ROC curve of the nomogram. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the nomagram was 0.911 (95% CI： 0.876-0.945). (c) ROC curve of the nomogram.

The X-axis represents the nomogram-predicted probability of bladder calculi， and the Y-axis represents the actual probability of bladder calculi. Plots along the 45-degree line indicate a perfect calibration model in which the predicted probabilities are identical to the actual outcomes. (f). DCA revealed that the nomogram shows a positive net benefit， indicating that it has good clinical utility in predicting the risk of bladder calculi in patients with BPH. The x-axis represents the threshald prabability， and the y-axis measures the net benefit. The threshold probability is where the expected benefit of treatment balances the expected benefit of avoiding treatment.**\n\n【57】**plots and the decision curve showed a good correspondence and a high net benefit. Therefore， this nomogram can serve as an excellent tool for predicting bladder calculi in patients with BPH. To our knowledge， this is the first study to establish a nomogram that can objectively and accurately predict the individualized risk of bladder calculi for patients with BPH. This nomogram will help to screen the risk of bladder calculi in BPH patients and provide individualized interventions， which may effectively reduce the rate of gravel surgery in BPH patients. Although our nomogram demonstrated impressive performance in bladder calculi prediction， there are some limitations associated with our study. First， factors such as pH， magnesium， and uric acid in 24-h urine were not included in this study because the relevant data could not be obtained from our institution. However， we did our best to include systemic metabolic factors. Second， this is a retrospective study with inevitable bias. Third， the validation set was derived from the same institution as the training set. Even with perfect internal validation， the presented nomogram is not yet suitable for general use prior to validation in external cohorts. Thus， external and multicenter prospective clinical trials with large sample sizes are still needed to validate the clinical application of our model.**\n\n【58】**Conclusion**\n\n【59】**In conclusion， the nomogram based on the results of LASSO regression can individually predict the risk of bladder calculi in patients with BPH. Therefore， it may help physicians improve individualinterventions and make better clinical decisions.**\n\n【60】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【61】This work was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation Program of Shaanxi Province (Grant number： 2020JM-370).\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\. **M** idersbacher S.

CD20 is homogeneous or strongly positive， favoring diagnoses of lymphocyte-predominant HL， T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， diffuse large B-cell lymphoma， primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma or grey zone lymphoma. Rituximab， applied as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapeutics， is the first monoclonal antibody licensed for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) immunotherapy. Most of the clinical experience with anti-CD20 antibodies has been with rituximab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The response rate， Progression-Free Survival (PFS)， and Overall Survival (OS) of NHL patients has been improved with incorporation of rituximab. In aggressive lymphoma， patients who do not respond to rituximab-combined chemotherapy in a front-line setting represent individuals with poor clinical outcomes. Infusion-related symptoms(e.g.， urticaria， fever， and chills) have been found in more than half of patients. Although these symptoms are usually modest， more serious reactions can occur， including hypotension， rigors， bronchospasm， and angioedema， in as manyas 10% ofpatients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>.Multiple next-generation anti-CD20 antibodies have been designed to improve the promise of B-cell lymphoma therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>.**\n\n【22】**An emerging alternative approach to immunotherapy is llama-derived VHH recombinant monoclonal antibodies， also known as“nanobodies\". Recently， the serum of came lids was found to contain not only the four conventional chain-Immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules but also Heavy Chain Antibodies (HCAbs)， which lack light chains and the CH1 domain. The VHH domain of approximately 15 kDa， which is much smaller than other recombinant antibody formats (60 kDa)， is the smallest known antigen recognition site found in mammals. VHH has full binding capacity and affinity comparable to conventional antibodies. Monomeric Nbs have dimensions of 4 nm x**\n\n【23】**2.2 nm and offer several advantages over antigen-binding fragments derived from classical antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Due to their small sizes， VHHs act as strong enzyme inhibitors， reaching enzyme pockets that are not accessible to common antibodies. When cloned and purified as Monomeric domains， VHHs demonstrate remarkable stability under a wide range of denaturing， temperature， and pH conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Recombinant VHH antibody fragments are emerging as new versatile reagents for the diagnosis and treatment oftumors.**\n\n【24】**Here， we exploited the properties of VHH to develop a reagent that could be applied for the diagnosis or treatment of B cell lymphoma. We show that VHHs are broadly reactive reagents that can be engineered for use in immunodiagnostic tests for CD20antigen.

This study was approved by the hospital ethics committee \\[通用删除7(英):<u>(2017)</u> scientific research ethics review No. 通用删除7(英):<u>(03)</u>\\]. Incomplete Freund’s adjuvant(Sigma-Aldrich， St. Louis， MO， USA) was used in subsequent immunizations. The antibody responses to CD20 in serum during the time course of immunization were monitored by ELISA. For the ELISAs， 96-well flat bottom Maxisorp ELISA plates (NUNC， Thermo Scientific， Waltham，MA，USA) were coated with 50 ng of CD20 diluted in 50 uL ofPBS，pH 7.4，at 4°C. Then，2% skimmed Milk Powder in Phosphate-Buffered Saline (MPBS) was used to blocked the wells， and the wells were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Sera diluted with 2% MPBS were added at 100 uL per well and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Subsequently， the Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-labelled goat anti-Llama antibodies were added to each well after three washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST，pH 7.4)， and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The ELISA was developed with commercial 3，3，5，5-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma-Aldrich， St. Louis， MO，USA， added at 100 uL/well. The absorbance of each sample was read at 450 nm with an ELISA reader (Multiskan EX， Thermo scientific， Waltham， MA， USA)， and averages of duplicate wells were used in the calculation of the values.**\n\n【28】**Antigen biotinylation**\n\n【29】**The EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidobiotin，Thermo Fischer Scientific， Waltham， MA， USA) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (1.0 g/L)， and 100 mg of CD20 antigen was biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin. The antigen was reacted with a 10：1 molar excess of NHS-LC-Biotin buffer (succinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)-hexanoate， Thermo Fischer Scientific， Waltham， MA， USA).

M-280 streptavidin beads (Invitrogen， Carlsbad， CA， USA，) were incubated with 2% skim milk powder in PBS for 1 h at room temperature to block non-specific binding. The beads were drawn into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with a magnetic tube holder (Dynal Biotech， Oslo， Norway)， and the supernatant was discarded. The magnetic streptavidin beads were mixed with biotinylated CD20 antigen (500 nM) and incubated with end-over-end rotation at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently， the beads were incubated with phage for 2 h at room temperature. The magnetic streptavidin beads were rinsed 5 to 10 times. Bound phage was eluted with 200 uL of freshly diluted Triethylamine (TEA)， and then neutralized with Tris-HCl. The unbound phage was discarded. Phages were purified with PEG (20% PEG6000-2.5 M NaCl). Three rounds of selection were conducted， and phage populations from the second and third rounds were tested for specificity to CD20 by ELISA. Next， 2 to 3 rounds of panning were performed with 100 nM，20 nM，and 4 nM antigen concentration， and more than 100 clones isolated were after a single round. The isolated colonies were obtained from the second and third rounds of the bacteria， which was diluted and plated onto an LB/ampicillin plate. A single colony was selected and cultured in 96-well plates at 37°C for 5 h. Subsequently， M13K07helper phage was added and incubated for 30 min without shaking at37°C.

The antiserum titer on day 90 was determined as 1 × 10 for CD20. The Llama serum was used as a control prior to immunization， and the Llama was immunized four times with CD20 antigen over three months. The antigen amount was approximately 1.5 mg. Prior to each immunization， 1~2 mL of blood was collected from the Llama jugular vein， and the anti-CD20antibody level in the Llama was measured by enzyme immunoassay. Negative and immune sera were diluted 1：100， 1：1000， and 1：10，000. As shown in Figure 1， the level of anti-CD20 antibody in the serum increased with as the immune Llama interval lengthened， and the immune times increased after the fourth immunization. ELISA revealed an A450 value of 2.22 for the antibody in the Llama serum diluted 10，000 times， whereas an A450 value was 0.132 for the blank**\n\n【46】**Table 1： Enrichment of specific phages during subsequent rounds of panning.**\n\n【47】**RoundTitre of input phageTitre of output phageOutput phages/input**\n\n| **1**  | **1.32x1012**  | **1.57x106**  | **1.89x106**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **2**  | **7.51x1011**  | **4.76x10**  | **5.33x105**  |\n| **3**  | **6.22x1011**  | **1.29x107**  | **2.82x105**  |\n\n【49】**Table 2： The relative affinity of selected antagonistic anti-CD20 sdAbs.**\n\n| **SdAbs**  | **KD (M)**  | **kon (1/Ms)**  | **kdis (1/s)**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Anti-CD20e7**  | **3.19x107**  | **2.29x10**  | **7.29x104**  |\n| **Anti-CD20b1**  | **3.18x106**  | **5.71x10°**  | **1.82x102**  |\n| **Anti-CD20f1**  | **8.23x10**  | **2.90x10°**  | **2.39x10**  |\n\n【51】**All constants were calculated from five data sets abtained with different concentrations of VHHs (from 1.25-20 uM) by a global Langmuir 1.1 method.**\n\n【52】**control，P/N>2 (positive results).**\n\n【53】**The immunized llama library construction**\n\n【54】**Total RNA was extracted from 10° lymphocytes， which were collected from EDTA-treated blood， and cDNA was prepared and used as a template to amplify VHH genes.

Different types of nanobodies have been used clinically for disease diagnosis and therapeutic agents.

First， in Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC)， the activation of the complement cascade and cell lysis through the formation of Membrane Attack Complexes (MAC) was caused by the first component of Complement (C1) binding to the Fc portion of the anti-CD20 molecule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Second， in Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC)， anti-CD20 antibodies bind to the CD20 molecule， and natural killer cells or macrophages， which release effector molecules， such as perforin， bind to the Fc portion of the anti-CD20 molecule through Fcy receptors， resulting in cell lysis. Last， in direct cytotoxicity， the anti-CD20 antibody induces the internal signaling of apoptosis or other cell-death pathways within the tumor cells， causing antiproliferative effects or cell death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Anti-CD20antibodies bind to an extracellular portion of the CD20 molecule. Most anti-CD20 antibodies， including rituximab， Tositumomab， and Obinutuzumab， bind to the larger of two extracellular loops within the CD20 molecule， this loop includes the Alanine-N-Proline (ANP) residues at positions 170 to 172.**\n\n【76】**The nanobody has the characteristics of low molecular weight， low immunogenicity， high stability， high solubility， high affinity， high specificity and high permeability for tumor target antigen， and this molecule can identify the unusual and unexposed epitopes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17-21\\]</u>. Therefore， the early diagnosis ofnanobodies is particularly suitable for tumors or the preparation of special biological target tumor antigens to rituximab in drug treatments and is expected to make up for the lack of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma， provide new treatment options for the treatment of B cell lymphoma， and show broad application prospects.**\n\n【77】**In the present study， a novel therapeutic approach based onanti-CD20 VHH antibodies was developed. The purpose was to generate anti-CD20 sdAbs and to determine their biological effects. To our**\n\n【78】**knowledge， the present study is the first report of the effects of anti-CD20 sdAbs on B-cell lymphoma cells. Bacterially expressed recombinant CD20 was successfully produced and conveniently purified. After immunizing llamas with recombinant CD20 and constructing an immune phage library displaying the VHH antibody repertoire， three VHHs that bind to CD20 were identified after multiple rounds ofbiopanning. Anti-CD20e7，anti-CD20b1，and anti-CD20f1 bound to CD20 when expressed and purified from E. coli. The recombinant protein was suitable for use as an antigen in phage bio-panning for selecting phage clones that bind to the protein from the established VH/VHH phage display library \\[22，23\\]. According to the set positive criteria of the assays， 24VHH-phagemid-transformed E. coli clones were selected. DNA sequencing confirmed the high diversity of the obtained clones.**\n\n【79】**The immunized Llama VHH library was constructed. The choice of phage display strategy depends on the required affinity and the target application of the desired antibody 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24-26\\]</u>. The immune antibody library mainly originates from the specific antigens of the individual peripheral blood lymphocytes in the Llama in vivo via antigen stimulation of a highly mutated antibody， which increases the affinity by over ten or even several hundred-fold， so in the antibody library preparation and screening of the high positivity rate， it is easy to obtain better antibody specificity and high affinity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27-30\\]</u>. Studies have attempted screening for anti-CD20-specific nanobodies from natural Llama-type nonimmune antibody libraries， but after four rounds of screening， the positivity rate of phage ELISA is relatively low， and it is difficult to select specific antibodies with high affinity， considering the main affected factors of nonimmune type antibody affinity and low output， despite subsequent affinity maturation. A series of methods are used to improve antibody affinity， but these methods are farless effectivethan the immune antibodylibrary. Halfof the antibodies in llama blood belong to VHH， which have light chains and CH1 regions of the heavy chain antibodies， while llamas aged 8to 12 months are in the strongest stage to resist the original stimuli， through which it is easy to produce antigen-specific antibodies. Due to the specificity of the molecular structure of heavy chain antibody， its apparent molecular weight in reducing SDS-PAGE is only 43 kDa， which is less than that of the ordinary 55-kDa heavy chain antibody. Therefore， Protein G affinity chromatography can be used to observe the production of unique heavy chain antibodies in llamas. To select the best immune antigen dose for subcutaneous injection to induce an immune effect， a moderate amount of the antigen was mixed with Freund's adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity of this molecule. The immune process and timely monitoring of serum antibody titers of Llamas can directly reflect the production of specific antibodies because of the direct impact of the quality of the antibody library. We fully considered the potential problems to focus on immune animals to ensure the quality of the anti-nanoscale antibody library.**\n\n【80】**The design of an appropriate selection strategy is equally important for the construction of immune phage library. Effective panning and gradual decreasing of the concentration of CD20antigen resulted in the isolation of the most specific VHHs during each panning. The diversity of antibodies in the antibody library determines the quality ofthe antibodylibrary. Blymphocytes undergo antigen stimulation， and most of these molecules differentiate into plasma cells that produce a large number of antibody molecules. The gene rearrangement mechanism is the basis of antibody molecular diversity. The random combination of antibody fragments at the DNA level can theoretically produce 108 different types of antibodies.**\n\n【81】**The variable regions of antibodies， particularly the different CDR regions， are the main reasons for the diversity of antibody molecules\\[31，32\\]. In the first round of PCR， we selected 11 different pairs of primers for VHH gene amplification by multiple degenerate primers to amplify Llama heavy chain antibody genes， which help to increase the diversity of the antibody gene. Moreover， the number of cycles in the two rounds of PCR amplification is controlled at 30 or more than35 cycles to avoid repeated amplification of dominant antibodies， generate redundant PCR products， and ensure the diversity of antibody libraries.**\n\n【82】**The three selected sdAbs possess unique characteristics in terms of their different CDR structures. More than 80% of the sequences for the three sdAbs share identity with the human VH domain， the main differences in amino acid sequence between the llama VHH and human VH are located in the CDRregions. The spatial conformation of antibody- and antigen-binding sites is determined by the length and amino acid composition of the complementary region of the antigen (CDR region). CDR3 is the important factor determining the variable sequence of antibodies. The nanoscale antibody has a long CDR3 area， which makes it possible to identify different epitopes and increase the affinity of nanoscale antibodies. Three strains of nano antibody affinity are different， and the main reason lies in that the CDR zone and FR zone configuration is slightly different， with some residues changed， making three monoclonal antibodies anti-CD20antibodies， namely， anti-CD20e7， anti-CD20b1， anti-CD20fl， that may recognize different epitopes， resulting in antibody affinity and biologically different functions.**\n\n【83】**In summary， three VHHs specifically recognize CD20 antigen. These clones could represent a new biotool for investigating the mechanisms of B-cell lymphoma and the development of alternative methods for CD20 diagnosis and may even be used as therapeutic agents to overcome the challenges of the current therapy.**\n\n【84】**Highlights**\n\n【85】**_1\\._ An immune Llama phage display library was constructed with phage display technology.**\n\n【86】**_2\\._ The anti-CD20 single-domain antibodies ((anti-CD20e7， anti-CD20b1 and anti-CD20f1) were selected from immune Llama phage display library.**\n\n【87】**_3\\._ Three anti-CD20 single-domain antibodies were produced at high yield in Escherichia coli and showed high affinity.**\n\n【88】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【89】**The present study was financially supported by grants from the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2014HQ008).

Computed tomography showed a 17-mm nodule in right adrenal gland， whereas hormonal markers were normal levels except plasma norepinephrine and urinary normetanephrine were modestly high (= 2.0-fold the upper limit of normal range). Even though the slight elevation in biochemical markers， 23I metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy confirmed the abnormal uptake in the right adrenal gland， the patient was submitted to laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Surgical pathology was diagnostic of pheochromocytoma. Postoperatively，plasma cathecolamines were all in normal range and paroxysmal hypertension disappeared.**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Pheochromocytomas are rare but clinically important tumors， whose failure to diagnose can result in sudden and lethal complications \\[1，2\\]. Pheochromocytomas are usually suggested by paroxysmal symptoms such as headache， sweating， palpitation and hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Although sporadic pheochromocytomas are most common， there is a growing incidence of genetically driven cases possibly secondary to widespread availability of genetic testing in some parts of the world通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Traditionally， sporadic forms of Pheochromocytomas occur in individuals aged 40-50 years and tumors size are large \\[5，6\\]. Using improved biochemical tests and imaging modalities， they have become to be diagnosed at earlier stage， so that the size of diagnosed tumors is decreasing通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Here we report a case of 17-mm in the largest dimension pheochromocytoma detected byI-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy without significant excessive production of catecholamines. Postoperatively，her blood pressure was well controlled with half the number of antihypertensives and paroxysmal hypertension disappeared.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**A. 77-year-old woman was referred to a local hospital for investigation of sudden and striking blood pressure elevations. She had 17-year history of hypertension well controlled with several antihypertensive agents， but she became to have recent symptom of paroxysmal hypertension. On first visit， a screening abdominal computed tomography (CT) with 1-mm thin slices revealed a 17 x 9 mm sized homogeneous mass with soft tissue density (approximately 30-40 Hounsfield units) in right adrenal gland . Biochemical tests revealed that plasma norepinephrine concentration was slightly elevated (824 pg/ml)， however， the levels were not within the threshold range suggested for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Plasma renin activity， plasma aldosterone concentration and adrenocorticotrophic hormone were all in normal range. Additionally， plasma cortisol was under 1.00 ug/dL after low dose (1 mg) dexamethasone overnight suppression test. Six months later， a follow-up anatomic test coupled with biochemical measurements (plasma catecholamines and urine fractionated metanephrines) were performed. An abdominal CT demonstrated that the tumor size was no change. Biochemical tests showed that plasma norepinephrine concentration (976 pg/ml) and urinary normetanephrine excretion(713 ug/gCre) were modestly high . Although the elevation of biochemical markers for pheochromocytoma was slight， the patient still had the symptom of paroxysmal hypertension， a functional imaging was performed. The 1\"I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (\"I-MIBG) planar image showed abnormal uptake in the right adrenal gland indicating that the tumor was a potential pheocormosytoma. Then， she was admitted to our hospital for further evaluation for possible pheocormosytoma. During testing at hospitalization， she had the paroxysmal hypertension. Plasma catecholamine levels were within normal limits， whereas 24-hour urinary excretion rates**\n\n【20】**of norepinephrine， VMA and normetanephrine were higher than upper limits of normal rang， especially the urinary norepinephrine excretion elevated to more than three times the normal value (Table1). On the basis of the symptom， the positive 123I-MIBG scintigraphy and the significant elevation of biochemical markers， the patient was subjected to laparoscopic right adrenalectomy. Postoperative pathologic findings confirmed pheochromocytoma . Histologically， well demarcated area was detected within the adrenal medulla. The region was composed of adrenal medullar cells with clear/eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in zellballen pattern . Immunohistochemically， the tumor cells stained positive for Chromogranin A . The tumor cells exhibited a low Ki-67 index . Postoperatively， her plasma cathecolamine levels were all in normal range. She remained free from symptom of paroxysmal hypertension even though she still11needed antihypertensive agents to control her hypertension.**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**Pheochromocytomas arecatecholamine-secreting tuimors arising from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. They are rare but clinically important tumors， whose failure to diagnose can result in sudden and lethal complications \\[1，2\\]. Based on autopsy studies，**\n\n【23】**however， many cases are probably missed than are diagnosed. At the Mayo clinic in the 50-year period 通用删除7(英):<u>(1928-1977)</u>， 40，078 autopsies were performed and pheochromocytomas were present in 54 patients. Among these patients， 13 patients were diagnosed during life， and41 patients were unsuspected autopsy findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. On the other hand， even among patients suspected to have a pheochromocytoma， the diagnosis is rarely confirmed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Because pheochromocytomas can have a highly variable presentation and an overlooked clinical entity， the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas is difficult， especially when a tumor size is small. In the present case， there are several practical points related to the diagnosis and management of small pheochromocytomas. First， small pheochromocytomas did not always have excessive catecholamine production. Marlon et al showed a direct correlation between tumor size and hormone level that was independent of the clinical presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Run Yu et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> showed that most of the patient with small pheochromocytomas exhibits modestly elevated or normal biochemical marker levels， resulting in underdiagnosis. Other study showed that small tumors have slower turnover rates and release free catecholamines into the circulation that lead to hyperadrenergic symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In our case， repeated biochemical measurements of plasma catecholamines and urinary catecholamines or fractionated metanephrines yield false-negative results. Plasma norepinephrine level (976 pg/ml) and urinary excretion of fractionated metanephrines (713 ug/gCre) were modestly high (plasma fractionated metanephrines are not available in Japan)，however，the levels were not within the diagnostic threshold for pheochromocytoma. Therefore， referred to the recommended testing algorithms， pheochromocytoma should have been excluded in the present case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Currently， there exist several guidelines based on which biochemical tests should be used to confirm or exclude a suspected pheochromocytoma， but no guideline address the importance of tumor size in the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas\\[11，12\\]. Our case suggests that it is essential to pay sufficient attention to the influence of tumor size on biochemical measurments because small pheochromocytoma often exhibits modestly elevated or normal biochemical marker levels， resulting in underdiagnosis.**\n\n【24】**Secondly， small pheochromocytoma exhibits same suspicious**\n\n【25】**Table 1： Biochemical testing.**\n\n|  | First Testing  | Second Testing  | On Admission  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Blood tests  |  |  |  |\n| Catecholamines (HPLC)  |  |  |  |\n| Epinephrine (LT 100 pg/ml)  | 18 (pg/ml)  | 19 (pg/ml)  | 19(pg/ml)  |\n| Narepinephrine (100-500 pg/ml)  | 824 (pg/ml)  | 976(pg/ml)  | 360 (pg/ml)  |\n| Urine tests  |  |  |  |\n| Catecholamines (HPLC)  |  |  |  |\n| Epinephrine (3.0-41 pg /24h)  | unmeasured  | unmeasurec  | 33.5(pg/24h)  |\n| Norepinephrine (31-160 pg/24h)  | unmeasurec  | unmeasurec  | 576(pg/24h)  |\n| Fractionated metanephrines (HPLC)  |  |  |  |\n| Metanephrine (0.04-0.18mg/24h)  | unmeasured  | 0.13(mg/gCr.)  | 0.09 (mg/24h)  |\n| Narmetanephrine (0.10-0.28mg/24h)  | unmeasurec  | 0.71(mg/gCr.)  | 0.30 (mg/24h)  |\n| VMA(HPLC)  |  |  |  |\n| VMA(1.5-4.9mg/24h)  | unmeasured  | unmeasured  | 7.55 (mg/24h)  |\n\n【27】On the first visit (first testing). plasma norepinephrine concentratian (824 pg/ml) was elevated but did not reach a cutaff of inclusion criteria of pheachromocytoma. Six manths later (secand testing)， plasma norepinephrine concentration (976 pg/ml) and urinary narmetanephrine exretian (713 pg/gCr) were madestly high. On admission， the plasma catecholamine levels were within normal limits. 24-hour urinary excretion rates of narepinephrine (576 pg/24h)， VMA (7.55 pg/24h) and normetanephrine (300 pg/24h) were higher than upper limit of normal range.\n\n【28】**Figure 2： Pathohistalagical findings.**\n\n【29】(A，B) Hematoxylin and Easin staining.

In the present case， abdominal CT identifies 17-mm mass ofwhich appearance ofhomogeneitywith soft-tissue density(approximately 40-50 HU) is suggestive of a pheochromocytoma. Moreover，123I-MIBG scintigraphy clearly showedaafocusSOI radioactivity in the mass. The current 2I-MIBG scintigraphy has a high sensitivity at 83%-100% for a specificity of 95%-100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Owing to high sensitivity and specificity， Ioannis et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， say that the presence of pheochromocytomas should always be ruled out or confirmed with I-MIBG scintigraphy. Run Yu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， also recommends to incorporate imaging characteristics of the tumor into the interpretation of biochemical test results. CT with contrast wash-out studies are alternative imaging modalities which may help characterize suspicious adrenal lesions or pheochromocytomas.**\n\n【36】**Finally， in our patient，smallpheochromocytoma didnotcontribute to hypertension. Her hypertension didn’t extremely improve after the operation. This may be come from her long duration ofhypertension and progression of arteriosclerosis. A prior study demonstrated that only a quarter of the patients with small pheochromocytomas can expect improvement of preoperative hypertension after tumor removal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Regardless of a poor improvement of hypertension， resection of small pheochromocytoma is necessary， because most of tumors， ifuntreated， cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are high15.**\n\n【37】**Conclusions**\n\n【38】**A diagnosis of probable pheochromocytoma should still be pursued in patients with modestly elevated catecholamine profiles， especially if clinical history or imaging findings are suggestive. The presence oftypical adrenergic symptoms， oscillating blood pressures，**\n\n【39】**known genetic predisposition or characteristic radiological findings would increase the pre-test probability of diagnosing a catecholamine producing tumor. Consideration should be given to functional imaging modalities in such cases.**\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

We report a case of isoniazid induced psychosis in a 31 years old patient pulmonary tuberculosis patient.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Tuberculosis； Isoniazid； Psychosis； Substance induced psychosis； Brief psychiatric rating scale**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**ISONIAZID (Isonicotinic Acid Hydrazide)， also called INH is a first-line drug in the treatment oftuberculosis. INH has been in use for the treatment of tuberculosis for many decades. It is one of the first line drugs used in patients of tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【19】**South-East Asian region bears the maximum burden oftuberculosis with more than 44% burden oftuberculosis incidence. India has the maximum prevalence of tuberculosis in the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【20】**Psychosis is a mental disorder which causes people to perceive or interpret things differently from those who are around them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Substance-induced psychosis， also known as drug-induced psychotic disorder， is any psychotic episode that is related to the abuse of an intoxicant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. There remains a paucity of evidence of the cases of isoniazid-related psychiatric illnesses. We report a similar case of suspected isoniazid-induced psychosis.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 31-year-old male educated up to high school， shopkeeper by profession， belonging to middle socio-economic strata in urban area with no prior psychiatric history was brought by his wife to the psychiatry outpatient department with the complains of incoherent speech， garbled sentences， paranoid ideation regarding his family (plotting against him and conspiring to steal his belongings)， auditory hallucinations and shouting at people who were not around since the last 2 days. These symptoms were associated with intermittent insomnia and a desire to stay in isolation and darkness.**\n\n【23】The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is one of the commonly used scales to establish about the possible presence and severity of various psychiatric symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The BPRS (Brief Psychiatric Rating Score) was 47 in this patient as evaluated by the psychiatrist on 5h day.\n\n【24】**The symptoms started about 4 weeks after he was put on isoniazid 300 mg/day， rifampicin 600mg/day， ethambutol 800 mg/day and pyrazinamide 1500 mg/day， for pulmonary tuberculosis and pyridoxine (vitamin B6)20 mg/day for prophylaxis against neuropathy by the prescribing physician. There was no history of recent ingestion of any psychoactive substances. He had a family history of social anxiety disorder and bulimia nervosa.**\n\n【25】**The physical examination was unremarkable and the vital signs were stable and testing including a complete blood count， chest X-rayand urine toxicology screening. A thyroid function test initially showed a marginally low Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) with normal triiodothyronine and thyroxine. A computed tomography scan of the head showed no abnormality. Due to absence of any other imminent cause of this behavior an initial diagnosis of drug induced psychosis due to isoniazid was taken into consideration.**\n\n【26】**Thereafter， all the anti-tubercular therapy was stopped by the prescribing physician. Although， he responded minimally after the isoniazid was stopped， the paranoid ideation persisted. The patient was put on tablet olanzapine 10 mg/day， tablet lorazepam 2 mg/day. Rifampicin， pyrazinamide and ethambutol were subsequently reintroduced， one by one to monitor a possible relapse of**\n\n【27】**symptoms. Isoniazid was not reintroduced as it was the most likely offending drug taken into consideration for the symptoms and was subsequently replaced with levofloxacin 750 mg/day by the treating physician to complete the anti-tubercular treatment regimen as per the guidelines. Subsequently， the patient became asymptomatic after taking olanzapine for a period of 15 days.**\n\n【28】**He stopped taking olanzapine 7 weeks after his visit to the treating physician， but agreed for a follow up in the clinic. He remained asymptomatic in the subsequent follow-up visits to the hospital.**\n\n【29】**The causality assessment of the adverse drug reaction came out to be possible for this case using the Naranjo Causality Assessment Scale通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The case was reported to the ADR monitoring center under the Pharmacovigilance Program of India (PvPI).**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n【31】**Tuberculosis remains a major health problem in India. The incidence and prevalence of the disease has decreased compared to the previous decades， still it accounts for maximum DALYs lost among the various communicable diseases. Some of the factors that maycontributeto an increase in the number of TB cases include HIV infection； social problems such as poverty， homelessness and drug abuse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【32】**In this case the patient was diagnosed as a case of pulmonary tuberculosis and initially treated with a regimen of four first line drugs isoniazid， rifampicin， pyrazinamide and ethambutol. The BPRS is a rating scale which is used by clinicians and researchers to measure psychiatric symptoms such as depression， anxiety， hallucinations and unusual behavior. The scales first published in 1962 is one most widely used scales to measure psychotic symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. An expanded version of the test was created in 1993 by Ventura et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【33】**The presence and severity of various psychiatric symptoms are rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (not present) to 7 (extremely severe). The total possible scores vary from 0 to 126 with higher scores indicating more severe psychopathology通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【34】**The association of administration of anti-tubercular therapy and the onset of psychotic symptoms in the absence of any previous psychiatric history provided a strong support for a diagnosis of drug-induced psychosis. Isoniazid is implicated in many cases of psychosis， hence it was first considered to be responsible for the psychotic episode.**\n\n【35】**Besides psychosis， isoniazid has been implicated in a number of other neuropsychiatric conditions including paranoia， obsessive-compulsive disorder， depression andmania， others including peripheral neuropathy， sleep disturbances， headache and blurring of vision have been seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【36】**In this case the onset of the psychotic symptoms that developed4 weeks after initiation of the anti-tubercular therapy and partial resolution was seen after 7 days of isoniazid discontinuation and completely resolved 15 days after treatment with olanzapine. The symptoms onset and resolution were in contrast to a case of drug induced psychosis with a previously unremarkable personal and familial psychiatric history that presented with psychotic symptoms within 12 days of initiation and resolved completely within 2 days of discontinuation of therapy. The patient remained asymptomatic without medication at a 1-year follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【37】**In another case ofisoniazid-associated psychosis the person had a**\n\n【38】**previously positive psychiatric history. A change in the mental status of this patient was observed within a week of initiation of isoniazid therapy. Psychotic symptoms continued for 5 days after isoniazid was stopped， eventually the patient was completely asymptomatic within a week 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【39】**The drug induced psychotic symptoms usually range from a few days to 2 months after treatment onset with isoniazid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.**\n\n【40】**Although the exact cause remains obscure， there are a few suggested mechanisms for isoniazid-associated psychosis.**\n\n【41】**These mechanisms implicate an over- or underproduction of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin， dopamine and norepinephrine.**\n\n【42】**One of the mechanism involves isoniazid acting as a Monoamine-Oxidase Inhibitor(MAO-I)， thus preventing the degradation of catecholamine's， serotonin and ultimately leading to raised concentration of these neurotransmitters at the synapse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.**\n\n【43】**Another mechanism suggests thatpyridoxine deficiencyultimately leading to a reduction in the concentration of the neurotransmitters. Isoniazid combines with pyridoxal (a form of vitamin B6) to form a complex that inhibits the action of pyridoxal kinase. The action of pyridoxal kinase is to convert pyridoxal to pyridoxal phosphate， which is an important coenzyme in the metabolism of amino acids， including tyrosine and tryptophan (precursors of catecholamines). The result is a decrease in the metabolism of amino acids to dopamine， norepinephrine， and serotonin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.**\n\n【44】**Patients with pyridoxine deficiency excrete a number of metabolites of tryptophan in the urine (e.g.， Xanthurenic acid)， after a loading dose of tryptophan is given. This test could also be used to assess pyridoxine deficiency status in addition to obtaining a blood concentration. However， pyridoxine deficiency is unlikely in our patient， as she was taking a pyridoxine supplement. Although the actual mechanism remains to be elucidated， the clinicians should be wary of the possibility ofisoniazid induced psychosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.**\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

To overcome these bone loss problems various graft materials also have been used in day to day practice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. These materials have their own advantages and disadvantages. The research community keeping these disadvantages in mind always strived to find new and economic alternatives. This paper reviews the existing literature on DDM and delineates the clinical usage， its advantage， disadvantage and clinical implications of same in routine dental practice. This paper will guide the clinician and researchers about DDM usage and its expanding scope in bone regeneration and tissue engineering. The literature search has been carried out using various combinations of words related to graft， DDM， extraction， impaction， implant， and ridge preservation. The articles which met the inclusion criteria of human usage of DDM have been considered for review. The in-vitro and non-human studies not considered for review.**\n\n【18】**Demineralized Dentine Matrix (DDM)**\n\n【19】**DDM consists of type-I collagen (95%) and non-collagenous proteins which includes growth factors. The DDM induced bone formation was reported in 1967 using animal derived DDM通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Tooth consists of inorganic components like hydroxyapatite， Tricalcium Phosphate (TCP)， Octacalcium Phosphate (OCP)， Amorphous Calcium phosphate (ACP) and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate and organic components such as collagen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The chemical composition of dentin is very similar to bone which consists of 65% inorganic， 35% organic substances and water 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【20】**Preparation of DDM and its usage**\n\n【21】**Auto Crush mill is used (Osteo mill， Tokyo) at 12000 rpm for 60 sec with 15 saline ice blocks. The crushed granules will be demineralized in 0.34 N Nitric acid solution for 20 min and extensively washed in distilled water to prepare patients own DDM (Granule size 0.5 mm to 2.0 mm) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Periodonatlly involved teeth without root canal filling， wisdom tooth； tooth extracted due to orthodontic reasons can be used for DDM preparation for immediate grafting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Restoration like crowns and fillings should be removed immediately after tooth extraction. High speed tungsten**\n\n【22】**carbide burs are used to remove carious lesion， discolored dentin and remnants of PDL and calculus \\[4，5\\]. In multi rooted teeth root will be splitted and put into grinder for 3 sec， and then vibrating movement for 20 sec in sterile chamber of“Smart Dentin Grinder”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The particles will be separated， and particulate dentin drawer is immersed in basic alcohol for 10 min in a small sterile glass container remaining waste will be discarded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Basic alcohol cleanser consists of 0.5 mm of NaOH and 3% alcohol for deflating dissolving all organic debris bacteria and toxins later washed 2 times in Phosphate Buffered Saline(PBS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Now dentin will be ready for grafting in extracted socket or alveolar bone defects or in maxillary sinus augmentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The whole process from extraction till placement of graft takes 15 min to 20 min 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Hot plate for 5 min at 140℃ will be used to dry the particulate of autologous dentin which can be used for immediate or future grafting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This can be used as particulate or block graft14，5，7.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**Post extraction dimensional changes of the alveolar ridge is inevitable as post extraction sequelae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is important to maintain alveolar ridge dimensions for replacement of missing tooth through the preservation of hard tissue Horowitz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> stated that alveolar ridge preservation prevents the ridge resorption， in comparison with non-grafted site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Alveolar bone defect grafting is increased recently because of implant supported replacements. The DDM can be used effectively because tooth extraction and socket grafting can be performed on the same day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Various allogeneic and synthetic bone replacement materials are used for grating 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. These materials may have osteoconduction， osteoinduction or osteogenesis properties depending on the various material factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The bone graft material can be classed into auto， allo， xenograft and alloplasts. These materials use depends upon clinical applications， volume deficiency and evidence based studies. Even though autogenous bone grafts considered as gold standard but havelimitations like morbidity， potential resorption and high cost.**\n\n【25】**Gomes et al. conducted a human study in 2006 using autogenous DDM. Twenty-seven lower third molar sockets were selected. The experimental sockets were filled with autogenous DDM and were covered with PTFE membrane. After 90 days， the experimental sockets showed bone formation of the same radiopacity as the surrounding bone. Also， these sockets had shown a faster rate of bone formation as compared to the other groups (control group with no material in the socket and the third group with PTFE in the sockets). It was also proven that the experimental socket had a superior bony architecture. Kim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> used autogenous tooth bone powder and block in a socket immediately after tooth extraction. They reported good healing of the socket after 3 to 3.5 months which was then taken up for implant placement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Until now， few studies have reported the osteoinductive potency of DDM and presence of BMP molecule in DDM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Hoary and Mealey conducted RCT to assess particle size for the use of socket grafting in 20 patients and concluded that the ridge preservation using DDM was effective irrespective of the particle sizes used， but allografts showed no effects.**\n\n【26】**Outcome measures of DDM**\n\n【27】**Kim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> have contributed large number of studies and was successful in finding out that autogenous DDM can be used for alveolar ridge augmentation， tooth socket preservation and sinus lift. Pioneer studies performed by Jeoman and Urist in year as early as**\n\n【28】**1967 proved that autogenous DDM possessed regenerative property. Gomes et al. had pointed out that auto DDM had osteoconductive properties and produce radio-opaque bone. Liang et al. have showed that auto DDM may prosper in near future as apexification material and as a permanent root canal flling material in endodontics. Lec et al. conducted a study to compare the efficiency of auto DDM and other bone graft materials used in sinus bone graft surgeries， after the groups showed favourable bone formation， but auto DDM showed faster rate and superior quality bone formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【29】**The modernization of dental bone grafting was combined with a contemporary preventive approach to bone loss has virtually eliminated the need for such drastic measures. A simplified explanation for the success of this form of grafting is that an autogenous bone graft is placed to act as a “biological placeholder”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Initially， it mechanicallyprevents the collapse of the surrounding tissues， whether that is bone or soft tissue. Then， through a process called “guided tissue regeneration，\" the human body is fooled biochemically to recognize the graft as natural bone and over time resorbs and replaces it with the patient’s own native bone.**\n\n【30】**Limitations of the DDM**\n\n【31】**Presence of decay， infection or discrepancy between the teeth that is being lost or any possibility of a grossly carious tooth in which it is not possible to extract the dentin i.e.， autogenous graft out of the tooth**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**It is essential to perform ridge preservation to prevent atrophy. The ridge or socket grafting will fill the void and allow natural bone to proliferate and fill the space with high quality bone. Depending on the size of the extraction socket the required amount of graft will be necessary so that wound will heal between three to six months completely. It is an economic alternative to other bone grafts.**\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\. Um IW， Kim YK， Mitsugi M.

This is a case report of a 76 year old male patient with shortness of breath， cough and pyrexia of unknown origin for 2 months. In the initial diagnostic workup，echocardiography revealed aortic and mitral regurgitation with no pericardial effusion. With the development of right sided pleural effusion about one month after the initial presentation， ultrasound scan guided pleural fluid aspiration performed. Pleural fluid culture revealed no bacterial growth. Second echocardiography showed no flow in the superior vena cava (SVC) and suspected of a thrombus. Contrast enhanced Computed Tomography scan of the chest demonstrated a mass lesion in the right heart and distal inferior vena cava (IVC). The lesion was compressing the SVC without complete obstruction. The pericardium was intact with no pericardial effusion. No mediastinal lymphadenopathy identified. Initial differential diagnosis was leiomyosarcoma of the distal IVC extending in to the right heart. As there was no pericardial involvement， possibility of lymphoma was made as a remote cause. Subsequently digital subtraction angiography guided biopsy performed from the mass in the distal IVC and right atrium. Diffuse lymphoma was confirmed on histology. As there were no Hodgkin cells in the sample， probable diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was made.

They account for 2% of all primary cardiac tumours and 1% of extranodal lymphomas \\[1，2\\]. They are usually diffuse large cell lymphomas manifest as an ill-defined， infiltrative mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. PCL are more commonly seen in immunocompromised states， either iatrogenic including those associated with solid organ or bone marrow transplantation or HIV related and these are usually associated with EBV infection. Lymphomas in immunocompetent individuals are extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As there are no specific clinical symptoms， the clinical diagnosis of the condition is difficult. Typically when B symptoms develop， (fever， weight loss， fatigue common in lymphoid malignancies)， progressive heart failure will ensue in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However advanced cross sectional imaging modalities allowed early and accurate detection of primary cardiac malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The definitive diagnosis of the condition needs histological evaluation of the tumour. One of the accessible diagnostic methods is transesophageal echocardiography -guided transjugular biopsy， which has a relatively low risk of complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Endomyocardial biopsy via percutaneous cardiac approach is also another approach for histological diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. We present a case of lymphoma arising in the heart with extension in to the superior and inferior vena cava.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 76 year old male was initially investigated for shortness of breath and cough of 2 months duration in a specialized hospital for respiratory disease. On initial presentation the patient was not dyspnoeic but found to have 94% of saturation of oxygen in blood. Bilateral ankle oedema was evident at that time . The blood pressure was normal on admission to the hospital. During hospital stay patient develops mild fever episodes intermittently. Sputum culture and blood culture were negative during the febrile illness. Subsequently patient underwent transoesophageal**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： Chest radiograph in the initial stage of the disease.**\n\n【20】**Figure 2： Longitudinal section through the inferior vena cava on ultrasound scan showing no demonstrable flow within the IVC.**\n\n【21】**Figure 3： Contrast enhanced Computed Tomography images showing irregular filling of the right side heart chambers and distal IC. a) Mass lesian in the right heart chambers. b) Mass lesion appears in the distal IVC.**\n\n【22】**echocardiography suspecting infective endocarditis， and it revealed grade ii aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation . There was no evidence of pericardial effusion or features of congestive cardiac failure.**\n\n【23】**About a month following initial presentation the patient develops right sided pleural effusion and then ultrasound scan guided pleural fluid aspiration was performed . There were 3.8g/dl of protein and 80% of lymphocytes in the pleural fluid. However there was no evidence of bacterial growth or acid fast bacilli in the pleural fluid.**\n\n【24】**Again patient was send for cardiology opinion and underwent 2dimensional Echocardiogram which revealed no flow in the superior vena cava (SVC) with suspicion of a thrombus in the SVC extending in to the right ventricle . Right atrium was dilated at that time. Then the patient was transferred to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) for further evaluation and management.**\n\n【25】**Figure 4： Incomplete filling identified within the distal IVC during digital subtraction inferior venocavography.**\n\n【26】**Figure 5： Haematoxylin and Eosin staining showing sheets of discohesive medium to large lymphoid cells with enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei and narrow rim of cytoplasm.**\n\n【27】**Figure 6： Immunahistochemistry (lHC) with Leukocyte Common Antigen(LCA) revealed strong membranous positivity in all lymphacytes.**\n\n【28】**A contrast enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the chest performed in the NHSL and detected a contrast enhancing mass lesion with few hypodense areas within the lesion involving the distal inferior vena cava (IVC)， right atrium and right ventricle. The lesionn was appearing to compress the distal SVC without complete obstruction of the lumen. Right main pulmonary artery was pushed superiorly by the mass lesion without significant luminal narrowing. The pericardium was not involved by the lesion and there was no pericardial effusion. There was bilateral pleural effusion on CT scan. There was no significant hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. In conclusion differential diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma of the distal IVC extending in to the right atrium and right ventricle was made. As there was no pericardial effusion or pericardial involvement by the mass lesion， the possibility of lymphoma was made as a remote**\n\n【29】**possibility.**\n\n【30】**Subsequently the patient referredtor digitalsubtraction angiography guided biopsy of the mass lesion in the distal IVC and right atrium. With right femoral vein puncture the venous access gained and IVC catheterization was performed. Five biopsy samples were obtained using 10 F guiding catheter and an Alligator forcep.**\n\n【31】**On histological assessment with haematoxylin and eosin staining there were sheets of discohesive medium to large lymphoid cells with enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei and narrow rim of cytoplasm. Mitoses were frequently found. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with Leukocyte Common Antigen (LCA) revealed strong membranous positivity in all lymphocytes . Diffuse lymphoma was confirmed by histology. As there were no Hodgkin cells in the biopsy， probable diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin type lymphoma was made. Subsequently the patient was transferred to The National Cancer Institute， Sri Lanka for further management. However the patient died from cardiac arrest before starting specific therapy.**\n\n【32】**Discussion**\n\n【33】**Primary cardiac lymphoma (PCL) is a very rare condition. On histology they are usually of B-cell non-Hodgkin's type lymphoma. The most frequent location of PCL is the right atrium， followed by the pericardium. Signs and symptoms are non-specific and depend on the location and extent of the tumor； these include right-sided heart failure precordialpain，arrhythmias， conduction disorders and cardiac tamponade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In literature there is a case of atypical presentation of ischemic hepatitis in a young adult with PCL， which highlights the wide variety of clinical manifestations of this rare tumour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In our patient the initial presentation was nonspecific and the disease progressed rapidly. Radiological imaging played major role in the identification and sampling of the tumour. The diagnosis of diffuse lymphoma was confirmed by histology with probable diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.**\n\n【34】**The most effective treatment method for cardiac lymphoma is chemotherapy. Palliative surgery may be necessary to correct haemodynamics when venous blood flow to the lungs is disturbed通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.

Situs inversus totalis known as the displacement of all organs according to the mirror image. Dextrocardia is used to describe the position of the heart which tip is pointing to the right instead of left side of the chest.**\n\n【14】**People having situs inversus totalis and dextrocardia live with normal life expectancy and are mostly asymptomatic. These anomalies may not be recognized for a long lifetime. Other congenital disorders such as heart diseases andlung infections may progress with this condition. Although situs inversus totalis with dextrocardia are rare， the lack of a comprehensive study of this anomaly in the literature indicates that further research is needed. In our report， we describe a case of dextrocardia with situs inversus totalis in a 21-vear-old male.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Situs inversus totalis， Dextrocardia；Rare anomaly**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Situs inversus totalis is a condition where the normal positions ofthe chest and abdominalorgans are arranged in a mirror image. Situs inversus totalis is known to be a rare syndrome inherited by autosomal recessive genes. Situs inversus may be seen with levocardia or dextrocardia. In levocardia， the tip of the heart is pointing to the left and in dextrocardia it turns to the right. Dextrocardia is a developmental anomaly where a bulboventricular cycle is folded to the left of the primitive heart cycle in a reverse placement of normal. The anomaly causes the heart to be positioned on the right side of the chest along with the long right and downward orientation. The distribution of these abnormalities was found to be equal between genders as well as between races 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Situs inversus occurs in 1 in 4000 people in Japan， 1 in 5000 in Israel and 1 in 10，000 to 15，000 in Northern Europe and the United States. Dextrocardia occurs in about 1 in 10，000 people in the general population. The exact cause of this condition， although it is unknown， has been associated with several factors including incomplete penetration， maternal diabetes mellitus， and conjoined twin anomaly， as well as autosomal recessive genes.**\n\n【18】**People with situs inversus do not have a phenotypic difference and may maintain routine healthy life without any complication related to their medical condition. Most people with situs inversus totalis are unconscious until they are treated for a medical condition independent of this anomaly\\[2，3\\].**\n\n【19】**The diagnosis of dextrocardia is made by using a combination of clinical， radiological， electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings. The anomaly is generally diagnosed on a routine prenatal sonogram， but not every radiologist can identify it， especially if there are no cardiac structural abnormalities. Diagnostic methods such as chest radiography and electrocardiogram are sufficient to diagnose dextrocardia， but current methods for instance echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging are used for defin itive diagnosis. Dextrocardia with situs inversus might be diagnosed incidentally during the evaluation of conditions not associated with the anomaly， in a routine medical examination or as indicated in this case report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-7\\]</u>.**\n\n【20】**The purpose ofthis study is to present a case with Dextrocardia and Situs Inversus in our country.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 21-year-old male patient was admitted to the urology outpatient clinic of Erciyes University Hospital for urinary tract infection. His blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg and his pulse rate was60 per min. No cardiovascular problems were observed. The patient stated that he had smoked 1pack of cigarettes a day for 3 years. As a result of the ultrasonography， the organs of the patient**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Posteroanterior (PA) chest X-Ray image of the patient. Position of the heart is changed according to the mirror image.**\n\n【24】**were displaced symmetrically. The diagnosis was as situs inversus totalis， accompanied by dextrocardia by chest X-Ray  and Electrocardiography (ECG) .**\n\n【25】**Discussion**\n\n【26】**Dextrocardia was first seen by Leonardo da Vinci in 1452 and later described by Marco Aurelio Severine in 1643 and more than a hundred years later was explained by Matthew Ballie 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. “Situs\"term is used to define the position of internal organs. \"Solitus\" refers to the normal position and “Inversus\" means the opposite position通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Dextrocardia with situs inversus is a rare condition occurring in the general population is approximately one in every 10，000 people， but it is not yet known incidence in Turkey. There is no race-related difference for situs inversus and the male-female incidence is equal通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Situs inversus may be associated with other congenital problems such as asplenism， multiple spleens， duodenal atresia， horseshoe/ectopic kidney and various pulmonary/vascular abnormalities. Situs Inversus Totalis was also associated with Kartagener's Syndrome， a primary ciliary dyskinesia \\[11，12\\]. In our case， the cause of this anomaly was not found exactly. Follow-up of patients with situs inversus totalis and dextrocardia is only necessary if there are congenital heart defects or other associated syndromic features and this condition is not noticed in patients with a healthy life expectancy\\[13，14\\]. Recognition of situs inversus has a great importance for the prevention of surgical mishaps due to reversed anatomy or atypical history. For example， appendicitis causes left lower quadrant pain in a patient with situs inversus， while cholecystitis typically causes left upper quadrant pain. Cardiac situs is also determined by atrial location. In situs inversus， the morphological right atrium is on the left and the left atrium is on the right. However， the normal pulmonary anatomy is also reversed， so that the left lung contains three lobes and the right lung contains two lobes. In addition， the spleen and stomach are on the right and the liver and gallbladder are on the left. Situs inversus also may complicate organ transplantations because the donor organs are located in the situs solitus， which is the normal position. Therefore， problems arise from the geometric shapes of organs such as the heart and liver that need to be implanted \\[15，16\\]. Since this procedure also applies to the orientation of similar blood vessels， the correct steps need to be taken for the proper attachment of the blood vessels.**\n\n【27】**The diagnosis ofsitus inversus totalis associated with dextrocardia canbe confirmed by electrocardiography， echocardiography， magnetic resonance imaging， abdominal ultrasonography， chest**\n\n【28】**Figure 2： The ECG obtained from the patient revealed qRS positivity， which is the opposite of normal status in unipolar avRleads.**\n\n【29】**radiographyandcomputed tomography scans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.ECG isan essential and interesting tool for diagnosis of dextrocardia. Echocardiography is required for precise analysis of cardiac position as well as for the recognition of associated congenital heart or vascular malformation. Sonographic and computed tomography studies are needed to confirm the positions of abdominal organs anatomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are known to be the best method for demonstrating mirror anatomy of organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.**\n\n【30】**Surgeons and radiologists have to avoid this abnormality before or at the time of surgery， and should undergo a routine medical examination， that may indicate the presence of this condition. The medical examination will assist the patient when affected by clinical conditions such as appendicitis. If the pain is on the left side instead of the right side， it may lead to misdiagnosis and even death due to delay in surgical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.**\n\n【31】**Conclusion**\n\n【32】**Although situs inversus is a rare anomaly， studies dealing with this issue are limited. Increased awareness of this situation；surgeons and radiologists should be more careful to take the anomaly into consideration before and during surgery. It is also known that encouraging patients to undergo a routine medical examination that may indicate the presence of this condition will improve life quality of patients. In addition， sharing the experiences of rare patient type will provide guidance in future surgical procedures.**\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

The definitive diagnosis is made at laparotomy. Perforated small bowel obstruction secondary to heavy Infestation with Ascaris lumbricoides brings a number of intraoperative challenges requiring correct intraoperative surgical management decisions. We present a case of a 17 year-old patient who was admitted with a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction that at laparotomy was found to have perforated gangrenous small bowel volvulus with heavy worm load visible through the bowel wall. Because of fecal peritoneal contamination and hemodynamic instability she underwent a two staged procedure with good outcome.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Ascarias lumbricoides； Ascariasis； Infestation； Volvulus； Obstruction； Gangrenous**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Approximately 1.5 billion or 25% of people around the world are infected with Ascaris lumbricoides mainly in tropical and subtropical regions \\[1，2\\]. Prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides is related to poverty， poor fecal sanitation and poor hygiene. Most individuals infected with Ascaris lumbricoides are asymptomatic and medical treatment is the mainstay of management of infestations. Surgical complications are common in patient with a high worm load and include mechanical small bowel obstruction， gastrointestinal haemorrhage， gastrointestinal perforation， obstructive jaundice， pancreatitis， and appendicitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. Intestinal obstruction is the most common complication and commonlyoccurs near the ileal-caecal valve as result of a bolus ofworm obstructing the bowellumen\\[3，5，6\\].**\n\n【17】**Definitive preoperative diagnosis is easy to make in well-resourced centers through the use of plain x-rays， Sonography and Computed Tomography scans. Plain radiographs of abdomen show radiolucent areas， cigar bundle appearance， \"whirlpool\" sign，pneumoperitoneum in a case of perforation and multiple air fluid levels in case of heavy worm infestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>.Ultrasound findings suggestive of ascariasis include the following：-**\n\n【18】al A thick echogenic strip with a central anechoic tube.\n\n【19】**b) Multiple long， linear， parallel echogenic strips without acoustic shadowing in longitudinal(railway track) and transverse (bull's eye) views 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-11\\]</u>.**\n\n【20】**Challenging operative findings include perforation with fecal contamination， gangrenous bowel and heavy worm infestation. These were the challenges we encountered in a hemodynamically unstable 17 year old female patient we suiccessfully managed.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**We admitted a previously well 17 year female patient referred from a peripheral district hospital with a five day history of colicky abdominal pain， abdominal distention， and absolute constipation and vomiting. She was referred with a diagnosis of intestinal obstruction.**\n\n【23】**The referring doctor from the district hospital had commenced the patient on IV fluids (Ringer's Lactate 1 L 8 hourly)， intravenous antibiotics (Ceftriaxone 1 gm daily and Metronidazole 500 mg，8 hourly)， put the patient on oxygen per face mask， had inserted a transurethral catheter and a nasogastric tube for free drainage. There was approximately 200 ml of feculent material in her nasogastric drainage bag**\n\n【24】**Figure 1： Gangrenous terminal ileum (blue arrows showing worms in the bowel lumen).**\n\n【25】**On examination she was ill looking， in respiratory distress， dehydrated， and lethargic. Her level of conscious was 15/15. She was tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 80% on oxygen per face mask. She had a high pulse rate of 120 beats per minute and was pyrexial with atemperature of 38.1° C. Her blood pressure was 112/70mmHg.**\n\n【26】**Her abdominal examination demonstrated a grossly distended abdomen， splinting the mechanics of respiration. She did not have any surgical scars or hernias. On palpation she had generalized and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were absent on auscultation and her rectum was empty on digital rectal examination. Other systems were normal on examination. A clinical diagnosis of intestinal obstruction with ischemic bowel was made. The X-rays done showed multiple air fluid levels and distended loops of small bowel. No free air was noted on the X-rays. Her Full Blood Count (FBC) showed an elevated white cell count 13.6×10^9 and a low hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dl. Platelet count was normal，294×10^3. Her sodium and Potassium were normal， 134 mmol/l and 4.6 mmol/l respectively. Urea was elevated， 17.0 mmol/l. So was Creatinine， 294 mmol/l. Two units of blood were cross-matched in preparation for a laparotomy.**\n\n【27】**Fluid resuscitation was continued and the anaesthetic team was notified. The patient was taken to theatre for a laparotomy. The abdomen was entered via mid-line longitudinal incision. A terminal ileal gangrenous small bowel volvulus was noted. There was a perforation at the centre of the volvulus with fecal contamination of the peritoneal cavity. Viable worms could be seen through the wall of viable and gangrenous bowel as shown in .**\n\n【28】**Intraoperatively the patient became hemodynamically unstable and required inotropic support. Because of hemodynamic instability and gross peritoneal fecal soiling， resection of 80 cm of gangrenous small bowel was done followed by fashioning of an end ileostomy. Piperazine was instilled via the ileostomy end. Peritoneal lavage was done using 3 liter of warm saline and the abdomen was closed in two layers with 0 PDS continuous suture for the sheath and 2-0nylon interrupted sutures on the skin. Patient was admitted into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for cardiopulmonary support.**\n\n【29】**Patient'Progress**\n\n【30】**The patient continued to improve whilst in ICU and on day three was transferred to High Dependence Unit (HDU). Piperazine was continued via the nasogastric tube and when the stoma began to function lots of dead worms were passed through the stoma. By day 5**\n\n【31】**the patient was feeding. The high ileostomy output brought a number of challenges which included nutrition and fluid and electrolytes challenges.Frequent nutritional assessment and rehabilitation allowed us to overcome this challenge. Superficial surgical site infection set on day 7 and this necessitated removal of skin sutures to allow free drainage. Antibiotics were given based on microbiology， culture and sensitivity. She was discharged home well on day 16 post operation. She had uneventful closure of colostomy at 10 weeks after the initial operation.**\n\n【32】**Discussion**\n\n【33】**Approximately 1.5 billion or 25% of people around the world are infected with Ascaris lumbricoides mainly in tropical and subtropical regions \\[1，2\\]. The highest prevalence of ascaris occurs in tropical countries where warm， wet climates provide environmental conditions that favour year-round transmission of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides is related to poverty， poor faecal sanitation and poor hygiene. Ascariasis is common in young children between the age of 2 and 10 years under 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Our patient came from rural Zimbabwe where there are great challenges with regard to clean water supply and proper sanitation. Our case presented at an older age. It is possible that she may have been infected at a younger age and was asymptomatic most of the time up until this acute surgical presentation**\n\n【34】**ThieeImajorityof _Ascaris_ _lurnbricoidesS_ infestations are asymptomatic. Clinical disease is restricted to patients with high worm load 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Symptoms are related to larval migration stage or to the adult worm intestinal stage. Pathophysiological mechanisms resulting in disease include direct tissue damage， the immunological response of the host to infection with the eggs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， larvae and adult worms， obstruction of an orifice or the lumen of gastrointestinal tract by adult worms and nutritional sequelae of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.**\n\n【35】**Definitiveepreoperative diagnosiissisnot always easy in underprivileged communities with poor heath funding. Laboratory and imaging investigations are very limited or unavailable in these communities. This leaves the attending surgeon to have a high index of suspicion of acute abdomen secondary to ascariasis. This results in delay in diagnosis and increase in morbidity as was the case with our patient. More often surgeons carry out emergency abdominal surgery and only make the definitive diagnosis at laparotomy， as in our case. When available imaging studies can accurately diagnose intestinal ascariasis \\[7，8-11\\]. It is particularly important to identify worms on plain X-rays as this can avoid unnecessary laparotomy for partial obstruction thorough timely administration of medical treatment. The indication for surgery in our patient was justified by the clear signs of peritonitis which was consistent with the gangrenous perforated bowel found at laparotomy.**\n\n【36】**The challenges encountered at operation were finding heavyworm load within the bowel lumen， gangrenous small bowel volvulus with perforation and fecal contamination in a haemodynamically unstable patient. Correct surgical decisions needed to be made， the surgical options available were resection of gangrenous bowel， milking of worms followed by bowel anastomosis or resection of bowel and fashioning an ileostomy and giving the patient anti- helmintics in the postoperative period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Milking of Ascaris lumbricoides from the bowel lumen has the potential advantage of reducing the worm load and thereby reducing the likelihood of anastomotic disruption\\[3，8，10\\]. Milking of worms is a time consuming procedure which**\n\n【37】**may be contraindicated in haemodynamically unstable patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Intraoperatively anthelmintic drugs can be instilled in the bowel lumen， as in our case via resected bowel ends. These drugs include Piperazine citrate，pyrantel pamoate， albendazole， and Mebendazole. This ensures death of worms and no further effect to the anastomosis. Ascaria does not have teeth and stay in the intestinal lumen \\[8，14\\]. It can still penetrate normal or pathologic bowel \\[8，14\\]. In simple perforations worms can still be milked via the perforation followed by instillation of Piperazine or any other antihelminthic drug followed by simple closure of the perforation and continuation of anti-helminthic drugs in the post-operative period. Bowel resection was mandatory in our patient as the loops of small bowel involved in the volvulus were gangrenous. Piperazine was instilled via the resected bowel ends followed by ileostomy fashioning. No milking of worms was done because of hemodynamic instability in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15-23\\]</u>.**\n\n【38】**Post-operative recovery can be stormy in patients with faecal contamination and an ileostomy. Major challenges encountered during management of our patient include nutritional challenges， due to increased ileostomy output， fluid and electrolyte challenges as well as septic complications. Good outcome hinged on frequent nutritional assessment and aggressive nutritional rehabilitation， evaluation and correction of fluid and electrolytes imbalances and treatment of septic complications based on microbiology， culture and sensitivity. The successful outcome in our patient was because we followed these core principles.**\n\n【39】**Conclusion**\n\n【40】**_Ascaris_ _lumbricoides_ infestation has protean clinical manifestations， one of which is acute abdomen. A high index of suspicion is mandatory to clinicians working in developing or underprivileged communities. Where imaging is available the diagnosis can made preoperatively and some patients with partial obstruction can be spared surgery. For sccessful outcome， patients presenting with acute abdomen needs early， correct patient specific surgical procedures， intraoperative and postoperative de-worming and supportive care.**\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

The spleen is a PSMA-expressing organ showing physiologic uptake of the tracer \\[3，4，5\\]. We report a case of post splenecomy abdominal splenosis as a potential cause for pitfall on 6BGa-PSMA PET/CT by abdominal metastatic spread.99mTc-dRBCs SPECT/CT study has been used for re-assuring the diagnosis of splenosis. We also review other unexpected settings of benign PSMA expressing tissue as potential pitfalls on 6Ga-PSMA PET/CT interpretation.**\n\n【14】**Case Presentation**\n\n【15】**A 69-years-old male patient with a newly-diagnosed Gleason 9(5+4) prostate adenocarcinoma， was referred for staging with Ga-PSMA PET/CT. Serum level ofPSA was 1.68 ng/ml. Eight months earlier the patient underwent Transurethral Resection ofthe Prostate (TURP) due to Benign prostatic hyperplasia. PET/CT was acquired following administration of 156 MBq (4.2 mCi) 6Ga-PSMA. In addition to uptake at the primary tumor site at the prostate gland， multiple foci of increased tracer uptake SUV\\_ of 4.15± 1.15 was detected corresponding to multiple soft tissue masses ranging in厂size between 8.0 mm to 40.0 mm at the left abdomen subdiaphragmatically， at the anterior abdomen adjacent to the abdominal wall and on the transverse colon serosa (Figure1).**\n\n【16】**Absence of normal spleen on CT has raised the suspicion of post splenectomy splenosis. Patient's history revision has revealed a post-traumatic splenectomy two decades earlier. A subsequent 99mTc-dRBCs scan， planar and SPECT/CT was performed using a hybrid SPECT/CT camera (Optima 640， GE Healthcare).**\n\n【17】**Figure 1： A whole-body 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT study Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) (A)， coronal CT， PET and fused PET/CT (B， C and D respectively) and axial CT， PET and fused PET/CT (E， F and G respectively)， demonstrated a tracer uptake (SUV ax4.15±1.15) by multiple soft tissue masses in the left abdomen， below the diaphragm， left mesentery and the anterior abdomen at the navel level .**\n\n【18】**Figure 2： A subsequent9mTc-dRBCs SPECT/CT study Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) (A)， coronal CT， SPECT and fused SPECT/CT (B， C and Drespectively) and axial CT， SPECT and fused SPECT/CT (E， F and G respectively)， revealed multiple areas of increased activity， anatomically matching with the suspected masses seen on the 6Ga-PSMA PET/CT study， confirming the diagnasis of splenasis.**\n\n【19】**There was a full matching betweenmTc-dRBCs and Ga-PSMA uptake in the abdominal lesions confirming that the lesions seen on PET/CT represented physiologic uptake in splenosis and not metastatic spread .**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**There is accumulating clinical data showing a high diagnostic accuracy of the novel 6Ga-PSMA PET/CT technique for staging of patients with newly diagnosed intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer. Diagnostic accuracy of the study interpretation is based on familiarity with potential pitfalls caused by unexpected sites of physiologic uptake or uptake with non-tumoral lesions. Several previous publications presented cases of increased 5BGa-PSMA uptake in benign lesions including adrenal adenomas， paravertebral schwannoma， Paget’s bone disease， splenic sarcoidosis， follicular thyroid adenoma， meningioma， serous cystadenoma of the pancreas， Pseudoangiomatous Stromal Hyperplasia (PASH) of the breast， liver hemangioma， subacute stroke and newly formed blood vessels， tuberculosis and Healing nonmalignant fracture \\[2，6-16\\]. Celiac lymph nodes were reported to show physiologic uptake and so were PSMA-expressing organs such as spleen \\[2，3，4\\]. Therefore as shown in the current presented patient， ectopically located splenic tissue may lead a false-positive misinterpretation of PET/CT confusing ectopic sites of normal splenic tissue with physiologic tracer uptake and metastatic spread. Ectopic splenic tissue is manifested in two**\n\n【22】**Figure 3： Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) of 68Ga-PSMA (PET/CT) (A)， and 99mTc-dRBCs (SPECT/CT) (B).

It is a rare congenital anomaly. Sometimes the blood vessels responsible for irrigation of the ectopic kidney cross the midline and may be responsible for stenosis of the ureteropelvic junction of ectopic kidney or the normally placed kidney. Most cases of crossed renal ectopia are asymptomatic and the diagnosis is made when pathology (such as infections， urolithiasis， tumors or other less common) affects the ectopic kidney. Diagnosis can be performed by ultrasound， intravenous urography or anterograde pyelography， isotopic studies， computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.

However， there is still a problem with rotation. A large degree of rotation results in the recurrence of astigmatism and decreased visual acuity. Rotation can be treated with relocation； however，rotation may recur.**\n\n【13】**Case Report： A 26-year-old man presented to our clinic complaining of decreased visual acuity in his left eye. He had undergone TICL implantation in his left eye， and experienced spontaneous TICL rotation five times and underwent relocation five times to correct it at another clinic. The Uncorrected Visual Acuity (UDVA) was 20/100， the manifest refraction (MR) was +2.0D -3.0D x 150°， and the TICL was rotated 52°. In our clinic， he underwent TICL explantation， followed by implantation of a Spherical ICL (SICL) combined with astigmatic keratotomies， requiring 4.1 mm and 2.8 mm incisions. Three months postoperatively， the UDVA was 20/18，and the MR was-0.25D-0.25Dx170°.**\n\n【14】**Conclusion： The combined implantation of an SICL with astigmatic keratotomy after TICL explantation is a safe effective treatment for recurrent astigmatism due to TICL rotation.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： ICL； Toric ICL； Rotation**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**The Visian Toric Implantable Collamer Lens (TICL) (STAAR Surgical， Nidau， Switzerland) is safe， stable， and effective for correcting myopic astigmatism but there is still a potential problem with rotation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. The position of the TICL in the eye is stable with an average rotation angle of3.39±2.36°， but there are reports of decreased vision due to spontaneous rotation of the TICL more than 30° \\[4，5\\]. Repeated rotation after relocation to treat TICL rotation has also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. There is another option for correcting myopic astigmatism： Implantation of a Spherical ICL (SICL) combined with an astigmatic keratotomy. This combined surgery has shown good results in terms of astigmatic correction and improved visual acuity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>.**\n\n【18】**We present a patient who had five episodes of recurrent astigmatism due to TICL rotation despite relocations to correct it. He underwent TICL explantation， followed by implantation of an SICL with simultaneous astigmatic keratotomy.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**A 26-year-old man presented to our clinic because of decreased vision in his left eye due to astigmatism that recurred repeatedly after TICL implantation performed elsewhere. He had undergone SICL implantation in the right eye and TICL implantation in the left eye 5 years previously. In the 5 years after the surgery， he underwent five TICL relocations to correct five recurrences of astigmatism in his left eye. The first TICL rotation occurred about 1 year after the surgery， and the subsequent rotations occurred after 9 months，9 months， 1 week， and 3 months； each relocation was performed at the clinic where the TICL had been implanted. According to the patient's medical records， the Manifest Refraction (MR) of the left eye was -6.0D -2.5D×176°**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： (A) Preoperative anterior segment photo. Four incisions were observed on the peripheral cornea； three small incisions (blue dotted lines) were considered side ports and one large incision (red dotted line) was considered the main incision for TICL implantation. The TICL was rotated52° counterclockwise from the horizontal meridian. (B) Postoperative anterior segment photo. Two additional corneal incisions were observed at 12 o'clock(red dotted line， 4.1 mm long) and 6 o'clock (blue dotted line， 2.8 mm long).**\n\n【22】**Figure 2： (A) A 7.5 mm diameter ring was marked. (B) The main incision was made with a 2.8 mm keratome at 12 o'clock approximately 0.75 mm outside the marked ring. (C) An SICL was inserted and placed between the crystalline lens and iris. (D) An additional incision was made with a 2.8 mm keratome at 6 o'clock approximately 0.75 mm outside the ring. (E) The main incision was widened with a 4.1 mm keratome. (F) Leakage was checked with a Merocel sponge.**\n\n【23】**preoperatively， and -0.25D -0.25×35°1 month postoperatively. The TICL had rotated 49°，56°，53°and 60°counterclockwise and14° clockwise. All relocations were successful， and the postoperative astigmatism was less than -0.75D.**\n\n【24】**In the ocular examination performedin1our clinic， the Uncorrected Distance Visual Acuity (UDVA) was 20/18 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left and his Corrected Distance Visual Acuity(CDVA) was 20/18 in both eyes. The MRs were +0.25D -0.25D×25°and +2.0D-3.0D×150° in the right and the left eyes， respectively. The**\n\n【25】**respective keratometry readings were K1 44.75D ×11°/K2 45.25D x 101° and K1 43.25Dx180°/K2 45.75D ×90°. In the left eye， the Intraocular Pressure (IOP) was 18 mmHg， the vault was 0.63 mm， and the Endothelial Cell Density (ECD) was 2907 cells/mm. Slit-lamp microscopy revealed three small incision scars at 10：30，12：30， and 1 o'clock and onelarge incision scar from 1：30 to 3 o'clock on the peripheral cornea； the TICL was rotated 52°counterclockwise from the horizontal meridian .**\n\n【26】**All surgeries were performed under topical anesthesia by the same surgeon (KBK). Explantation of the TICL was performed first. A peripheral corneal incision was made with a 2.8 mmkeratome at 12o'clock. After the haptics were dislocated with an intraocular spatula， the TICL was extracted through the incision. On ocular examination1 month after explantation， the following were measured： MR-6.0D-2.5D× 180°， keratometry reading K1 43.5Dx2°/K2 45.5D×92°， IOP 15 mmHg， ECD 2924 cells/mm， Anterior Chamber (AC) depth3.62 mm， and horizontal white-to-white diameter 11.3 mm.**\n\n【27】**A combined SICL implantation and astigmatic keratotomy were performed 6 weeks after the TICL explantation. After marking corneal incisions at 12 and 6 o'cock， a 7.5 mm diameter ring was marked . The main incision was made at 12 o'clock with a 2.8 mm keratome approximately 0.75 mm outside the ring (Figure2B). After inserting an Ophthalmic Viscoelastic Device (OVD) into the AC， a model V5 SICL was inserted， and four footplates were placed between the crystalline lens and iris and rotated horizontally. An additional incision was made at 6 o’clock with a 2.8mm keratome approximately 0.75 mm outside the ring . Two incisions were made in a single plane， and the incision tunnel length was about 1.0 mm. After removing the OVD，the main incision was widened with a 4.1 mm keratome . After confirming that the incisions had not leaked with a Merocel sponge ， the operation was completed. The SICL had a diameter of 12.1 mm with a refractive power of -8.0D. The expected spherical equivalent was -0.35 D.**\n\n【28】**On postoperative day 1， the UDVA was 20/20， MR 0-1.0D×80°， keratometry reading K1 43.0D × 70°/K2 44.25D×160°，IOP14 mmHg， vault 0.48 mm， and ECD 2924 cells/mm. Three months postoperatively，the UDVAand CDVA were 20/18， MR-0.25D-0.25D x170°，keratometry reading K1 44.0D×170/K2 44.5Dx80°，IOP14mmHg， vault 0.53 mm， and ECD 2849 cells/mm². Two incision scars were observed at 12 and 6 o'clock with slit-lamp microscopy (Figure1B). The angles to the anterior corneal surface were 35°and 36°， with an 1154 um main incision and 1163 um additional incision. Both these incisions were longer and had lower angles than the previous incision for ICL insertion. Endothelial misalignment was observed in both incisions but was more prevalent in the main incision .**\n\n【29】**Discussion**\n\n【30】**Rotation in the cylinder axis of morethan 30° is enough to decrease the optical effect of a TICL \\[10，11\\]. Postoperative TICL rotation is related to several factors， including intraoperative misalignment during TICL implantation and a low vault caused by an undersized ICL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However， according to the medical records， the astigmatism was nearly zero immediately after the initial surgery， and the vault was 0.63 mm， which was estimated to be sufficient. TICL rotation is also correlated with the diameter and structure of the ciliary sulcus-to-sulcus \\[5，6\\]. If the TICL rotates for this reason， re-rotation occurs in the same direction and degree despite relocation. Zhang et al.**\n\n【31】Figure 3： Anterior segment optical coherence tomography images of the corneal incisions showing the (A) main incision at 12 o'clock， (B) additional incision at6 o'clock， and (C) previous incision at 2 o'clock.\n\n【32】**reported a case of TICL rotation that was treated with relocation and then rotated again in the same direction and degree 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. After TICL removal， a new TICL manufactured by recalculation to match the rotated direction was successfully implanted in that direction. In our case， however， the degree and direction of re-rotation were not constant and were 49°， 56°， 53°and 60°counterclockwise， and 14°clockwise.**\n\n【33】**Therefore， we decided to implant an SICL combined with an astigmatic keratotomy after TICL removal. When the patient presented to our clinic， the TICL was rotated by 52° from the horizontal meridian and the MR was +2.0D -3.0D × 150°. After TICL removal， the MR was -6.75D-2.5D×180°， while it was 0.25D-0.25Dx170°3 months after the combined SICL implantation and astigmatic keratotomy.**\n\n【34】**Astigmatic keratotomy， consisting of corneal relaxing incisions at the steep meridian， is effective for reducing astigmatism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Because a corneal incision is required for ICL implantation， if the position， length， width， number， and so forth of the corneal incision are adjusted in the same way as for an astigmatic keratotomy， good refractive results can be obtained with an SICL. Kamiya et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported that patients with an average with-the-rule astigmatism of0.69 ±0.73D before surgery had an average astigmatism of 0.21 ±0.27D after an SICL was inserted using a 3.0 mm superior corneal incision. Sekundo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> reported that a 6.0 mm main incision and opposite partial thickness limbal relaxing incision during iris-claw intraocular lens implantation resulted in an average decrease in astigmatism of 2.2D. In our case， 2.25D astigmatism was reduced through 4.1 mm and 2.8 mm corneal incisions， and the UDVA was20/18 at 3 months postoperatively.**\n\n【35】**We used a single-plane incision with a relatively long tunnel. Compared to a tri-planar incision， a single-plane incision is more effective at correcting astigmatism because the anterior cornea slides more easily to the posterior cornea in the incisional plane \\[14，15\\]. A long-beveled incision is more prone to corneal sliding than a short perpendicular incision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In our case， the two astigmatic**\n\n【36】**keratotomy incisions had longer tunnels than the existing corneal incisions， and sliding was more prevalent than with the previous main incision .**\n\n【37】**In conclusion， we report a patient who experienced recurrent astigmatism due to TICL rotation despite relocation. This patient was successfully treated with combined SICL implantation and astigmatic keratotomy after TICL explantation. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first report ofthis surgical technique.**\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

The patients were assigned into two groups： 1) control group who received 4-week home-based daily exercise program and 2) intervention group (weighted kyphorthosis) who performed exercises and wore weighted kyphorthosis for one hour twice a day. Patients were assessed using computerized balance tests by Balance Master (NeuroCom) (Limits of Stability， Step Quick Turn， Sit to Stand and Walk across tests) before and 4 weeks after start of treatment.**\n\n【15】**Results： Speed in walk across test was improved significantly in both groups compared to baseline from (77.6±25 cm/s to 91.57±30 cm/s and from 72.60±20cm/s to 88.73±18 cm/s) in intervention and control groups respectively. Improvement in right turn time in step quick turn， end point excursion and mean of excursion parameters of Limits of Stability was more significant in orthosis group in comparison with control group (P<0.05).**\n\n【16】**Conclusion： Applying WKO together with exercise program improved some computerized balance tests in women with osteoporosis.WKO can be suggested as an effective intervention in postmenopausal women in order to reduce the risk of falling.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Osteoporosis； Balance tests； Weighted KyphOrthoris； Posture training support**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**Osteoporosis is a common disorder characterized by reduced bone mass and by deterioration of the micro architecture of the bone tissues， thereby leading to increased bone fragility. It affects around 55% of the population over the age of 50 years in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Among common clinical consequences are back pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， hyperkyphosis， limitations of physical functioning and impaired health-related quality of life in osteoporotic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>. It is characterized by low bone mass and micro-architectural changes of bone tissue， leading to increase in fracture risk \\[1，2，7\\]. Vertebral fractures can occur in spinal osteoporosis and constitute a major public health burden. The incidence of spine fracture can be as high as 20% in postmenopausal women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The weakness of paraspinal extensor muscles in osteoporosis accompanied by repetitive vertebral micro fracture results in hyperkyphosis， in osteoporoticpatients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-10\\]</u>. Changes in spinal alignment would displace the Center Of Pressure (COP) closer to the limit of stability，thereby making it easier to lose balance， with consequent falls in elderly women with osteoporosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This postural changes and vertebral fractures can impose physical stress on vertebral bodies leading to acute and chronic back pain通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Furthermore， osteoporosis is associated with deficits of gait and balance， all together resulting in an increased risk of falls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Falls among the elderly， especially for those with osteoporosis， are associated with high morbidity and mortality and are responsible for hip fracture and are the sixth cause of death among elderly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>**\n\n【20】**There are studies indicating that almost one third of falls followed by detrimental consequences are preventable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Apart from environmental modifications and pharmaceutical and physical rehabilitative measures including muscle reeducation and resistance exercises leading to improvements in static and dynamic posture and balance training are among most precious preventive strategies for reducing the risk of falls and subsequent fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13-15\\]</u>.**\n\n【21】**Assessment of postural control and stability in osteoporotic patients through posturography is a**\n\n【22】**promising and sensitive measurement approach for early detection or pre clinical changes in the postural control system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.**\n\n【23】**Previous studies have shown that wearing a spinal orthosis such as osteomed， spinomed and weighted kyphorthosis result in improvements of posture and back extensor strength. Weighted kyphorthosis \\[WKO\\] is among the most known orthosis in osteoporotic patients. In 2005， Sinaki indicated the positive effects of WKO together with spinal proprioceptive extension exercise on balance， gait， and risk of fall assessed by computerized dynamic posturography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.**\n\n【24】**In our previous work ，wearing WKO accompanied by back extensor strengthening exercises lead to significant improvement in functional balance tests including Functional Reach (FR) and Time up and Go(TUG) tests in WKO group compared to exercise group通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.**\n\n【25】**The purpose of the present study is to assess the effects of wearing WKO together with spinal exercises on balance via performing computerized dynamic balance tests including Sit to Stand， Walk Across and LOS， by Neurocom tests in women with osteoporosis. These tests， performed by Neurocom device， are dynamic and much more functional and similar to daily activities compared to clinical balance tests used in our previous work. Considering these facts， they can better evaluate the risk of falling in the elderly.**\n\n【26】**Case Presentation**\n\n【27】**This study was conducted between during 2013 in Shahid Modarres hospital， Tehran， Iran. The protocol of this clinical trial was approved by Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences， Human Ethics Research Committee. This study was designed as randomized clinical trial.**\n\n【28】**Patients voluntarily referredtoOPphysical medicineand rehabilitation clinic were entered the study. Patients were screened initially by an expert physiatrist to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria.**\n\n【29】**Inclusion criteria were as follows： Women with osteoporosis diagnosed based on low bone mineral densitometry at spine(T-score of <-2.5)， aged between 50-75 years old， thoracic kyphosis angle between 35-55 degree (Cobb's angle of thoracic kyphosis was calculated from lateral radiograph of spine).**\n\n【30】**The patients with the following criteria were excluded from the study：**\n\n【31】**_Thee presence of secondary osteoporosis due to metabolic_ diseases (such thyroid disease， etc) evaluated by clinical laboratory tests， the presence of neuromuscular disorders， vertebral fracture in last 6 months， history of spinal or lower limb surgical interventions including arthroplasty， vertebroplasty or discectomy.**\n\n【32】**Serum level of Ca， P， alkaline phosphatase， 25 HO vitD3， thyroid function tests， Renal function tests， parathyroid hormone were evaluated in osteoporotic patients. The patients with low level of vitamin D and secondary causes of osteoporosis were treated appropriately but excluded from this study.**\n\n【33】**Patients who met the above mentioned criteria were assigned to two groups (orthosis (intervention) and control groups). At the same clinic， like intervention group， matched controls of comparable age and weight and height were enrolled in the study as control group.**\n\n【34】**Randomization and Patients'Enrollment**\n\n【35】**Simple random sampling was used for this study. All patients included in the study received a number then by using random number table they were allocated to two groups (Control and intervention groups).**\n\n【36】**Equal allocation between groups was performed. Hence， the patients were classified randomly in control and intervention groups. Random allocation sequence， who enrolled patients to interventions were performed by one physician.**\n\n【37】**Blinding**\n\n【38】**The assessors supervised and performed NeuroCom balance tests， as well as the statistician were blinded to the group assignment.**\n\n【39】**Patients in both groups received medications including 1000mg calcium carbonate and 400 IU vitamin E daily and sodium alendronate 70 mg weekly.**\n\n【40】**Patients in both groups were also instructed to have 30 minutes of daily walking.**\n\n【41】**All Patients were followed via telephone calls to home to get sure that they were sticking to the exercises correctly as prescribed for them.**\n\n【42】**Control group： No orthosis was prescribed for this group； but patients were taught to perform daily back extensor strengthening exercises at home according to professor Sinaki program in Mayo clinic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> as follows：**\n\n【43】**1\\. In supine position， the patient flexes the knees and then abducts and adducts the shoulders while the elbows are extended and upper limbs are in contact with the floor.**\n\n【44】2\\. In the supine position， the patient flexes the knees and put hands over the head. By contracting abdominal muscles the patient tries to draw the low back to the floor and keep this position for10seconds.\n\n【45】**3\\. In the prone position， the patient puts a pillow under the lower abdomen and gently raises the head and shoulders from the floor as much as possible and keeps this position for 10 seconds.**\n\n【46】**4\\. The patient sits on a chair and puts the hands behind the head. Then he/she moves the elbows behind the head while inhaling. The patient will do the opposite while exhaling.**\n\n【47】**5\\. Sitting on a chair， the patient flexes the elbows while keeping the arms near to the trunk and then moves the arms back to reduce thoracic kyphosis.**\n\n【48】**All of the exercise programs were taught by an experienced physical therapist. Also， an illustrated pamphlet describing each exercise was presented to each participant. A paper with a table was given to each patient and she was asked to specify every day if she would do the exercises and bring it on follow up visits. The patients were called by a physical therapist every week to assess exercise performance and associated problems. After 4 weeks， patients were called to return to hospital for re-evaluations.**\n\n【49】**Intervention group (Orthosis group)**\n\n【50】**Patients in this group were taught to perform the same home exercises as control group.**\n\n【51】Weighted kyphorthosis was also administered for the patients in this group.\n\n【52】**Weighted kyphorthosis (WKO)**\n\n【53】**Weighted kypho-orthosis is an especially designed orthosis (made by Cybernetics Company) with a harness and a 2-pound pouch， which centers its weight on the posterior of the spine at T10 to L4.**\n\n【54】**The patients were guided to place the weighted kyphosis orthosis over the thoracic spine and adjust the straps such that the bottom of the pouch is located at the waistline.**\n\n【55】**Patients were instructed to wear the device when ambulating for one hour a day (30 minutes at the morning and the evening) for 4weeks. During this 4 week， patients were followed by telephone calls to assure that they were using the orthosis correctly.**\n\n【56】An experienced orthotist instructed the patient regarding the proper usage of orthosis.\n\n【57】**Measures**\n\n【58】**Dual X-ray absorptiometery (DXA) was used for measuring bone mineral density of spine or hip. All patients were referred to one imaging center for bone mineral densitometry. Then DXA scan was carried out using the Hologic QDR-4500 machine (Hologic， Waltham， MA) to determine BMD values of the femur and lumbar vertebrae. TheaccuracyofaDXA，a monthlycalibration measurement， according to the manufacturer's instructions， was performed.**\n\n【59】**Precision was defined as the reproducibility and the ability of densitometric systems to detect changes in BMD over time. Precision error of the machine and the technologist kept below 1 % in the center we referred our patients for bone densitometry.**\n\n【60】**The cobb's angle of kyphosis was calculated from perpendicular lines drawn on a standard thoracic spine radiograph (lateral view)：a line extends through the superior endplate of the vertebral body， marking the beginning of the thoracic curve and the inferior endplate of the vertebral body， marking the end of the thoracic curve.**\n\n【61】**An experienced radiologist ruled out osteoporotic fractures via assessing associated X-rays.**\n\n【62】**Dynamic balance tests： The NeuroCom Equitest Long Force Plate(NeuroCom International， Clackamas， Oregon) was used to assess the participants’ performance on functional tasks. The Long Force Plate was used to objectively evaluate balance and postural stability under dynamic tests 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The Sit to Stand， Walk Across， Step/Quick Turn and Limits of stability were selected from the Functional Limitation Assessment Battery due to their ability to target functional characteristics pertaining to lower body strength， flexibility， and balance. These areas of interest were chosen due to their impact on independent Function. All participants performed each task three times and the mean score was used in the analyses.**\n\n【63】**Subjects were allowed one practice trial for familiarization with the procedure ofthe test.**\n\n【64】**Testing Protocols**\n\n【65】Before starting protocol， each participant received a verbal explanation of the protocols.\n\n【66】**Sit to stand test (STS)： During the measurements subjects were positioned on the platform facing the monitor with barefoot. The starting position before each trial was standardized by placing knees at 90 degree flexion by adjusting foot placement.**\n\n【67】**Subjects were instructed to stand up as quickly as possible when**\n\n【68】**start sign appeared on the monitor. They were not allowed to use arms or hands to push off their legs or the seated surface. Subjects were asked to remain stationary until the test was completed (<5 sec after they rose).**\n\n【69】**The parameters ofthis test are as follows：**\n\n【70】**a. Weight transfer (in seconds)： time elapsed until the moment of rising，**\n\n【71】**b. Rising index (percentage of the body weight)： is the percentage of weight bearing (% body weight)， which is the ratio of the amount of weight borne on both legs to the patient’s total body weight during the rising phase.( Amount of force exerted on the platform during the rising phase)，**\n\n【72】**c. Center of gravity (COG) sway velocity (in degrees per second)：postural sway velocity during upright posture，**\n\n【73】**d. Left/right weight symmetry (percentage of body weight)：symmetry of the body weight distribution on the lower extremities during the rising phase.**\n\n【74】**Walk Across (WA)： -Participants were positioned in front of a force plate and were instructed to “Go，\"via an audible prompt. Three gait cycles were completed across the force plate， while outcome measures included Step Width (lateral distance in centimeter)， Step Length (longitudinal distance in centimeters)， and Step Speed(velocity in centimeters/second)**\n\n【75】**Step/quick turn (SQT)： The patient is instructed to take two forward steps on command， and then quickly turn 180° to either the left or right and return to the starting point.**\n\n【76】**Limits of stability (LOS)： The NeuroCom LOS test required participants to transfer their COG， while standing on stable force plates， toward 8 targets in a sequential clockwise direction spaced at45° intervals around the body's COG， as represented on a computer monitor. Before testing， subjects were informed that the on-screen COG cursor (i.e.， visual biofeedback) moved in response to the movements of their body COG.**\n\n【77】**During the test， subjects were required to stand with their arms by their sides and to maintain their feet in the standardized foot position. A reference grid superimposed on the force plate allowed for careful monitoring ofthe feet during the testing procedures. They were instructed to keep their body in a straight line， using their ankle joints at the primary axis of motion and to move toward each target as directly and quickly as possible.**\n\n【78】**Outcomes include： reaction time， sway velocity， directional control， endpoint excursion and maximum excursion. Endpoint excursion and maximum excursion are calculated as percentages of the subject’s theoretical 100% limit of stability that is a function of their height.**\n\n【79】**The test was repeated three times and the average values of the measurements were documented**\n\n【80】**Data analysis： SPSS-18 was used for data analysis. Kolmogorov-smirnov was used for testing normality of variable distribution. Independent T-test and Man whitney tests were conducted to determineifthere was a statistically significant change in demographic characteristics between the two groups and improvement in balance tests after therapy. Wilcoxon-signed rank test was conducted to determine the significant change in balance tests within each group after therapy.**\n\n【81】Table 1： Demographic characteristics including age， height， weight and body mass indices compared between two groups.\n\n| **Demographic** **characteristic**  | **Group**  | **mean±sd**  | **P-value**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Height(m)**  | **Control通用删除7(英):<u>(14)</u>**  | **1.51±4.25**  | **0.64**  |\n| **Height(m)**  | **Intervention通用删除7(英):<u>(9)</u>**  | **1.5±4.62**  | **0.64**  |\n| **Weight(kg)**  | **Control**  | **62±4.62**  | **0.63**  |\n| **Weight(kg)**  | **Intervention**  | **67±5**  | **0.63**  |\n| **Agefyear)**  | **Intervention**  | **62±5**  | **0.36**  |\n| **Agefyear)**  | **Control**  | **66±6**  | **0.36**  |\n| **BMI(Kg/m²)**  | **Intervention**  | **27.1±1.8**  | **0.75**  |\n| **BMI(Kg/m²)**  | **Control**  | **29.6±1.8**  | **0.75**  |\n\n【83】**SD： Standard deviation； Intervention Group； Brace and exercise； Control group； exercise only**\n\n【84】**Ethics： The patients were enrolled after providing informed consent as approved by the institutional review board of Shahid Beheshti Medical University.

One patient in each control and intervention group didn't perform exercises regularly. Their results excluded from final analysis**\n\n【105】**Patient's satisfaction： All patients completed the study were satisfied with the treatment (both orthosis and exercises).**\n\n【106】**Adverse events： No adverse events were noticed during the study. Secondary discussion**\n\n【107】**Based on the results of the present study， improvement in balance was noticed in patients with osteoporosis after wearing weighted kyphorthosis for 4 weeks. According to walk across test， speed improvement was noticed in both groups with no significant between group differences. Right turn time decreased significantly only in WKO group. Two parameters of LOS including the mean of End Point Excursion and Maximal Excursion increased significantly in WKO but not in control group.**\n\n【108】**Improvement in the above mentioned parameters can be translated as better postural stability in intervention group. Postural stability has been defined as the ability to control the body's COG within a given base of support. The understanding of postural stability control (i.e.， balance) is essential for performing activities of daily Living and decrease in fall rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.**\n\n【109】**In practice， the actual LOS of a person may be defined as the distance the patient is willing and able to move without losing balance and taking a step 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. As with the Functional Reach (FR) test， the LOS test has been shown to provide reliable scores that are predictive of fall risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.In our previous work 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> WKOlead to improvement in FR. In essence， LOS should measure similar components of balance as FR. However， Wallmann reports that there is no significant**\n\n【110】**relationship between FR measures and anterior displacement on the LOS test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.**\n\n【111】**Decrements in dynamic postural control have been attributed to both age and pathologic changes in parameters associated with movements of the COG. Compared with healthy older adults， osteoporotic patients exhibit smaller voluntary COG excursions， reach maximal lean more slowly， and exhibit less postural control once they have reached maximum lean 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.**\n\n【112】**The LOS test provides spatial and temporal measures (e.g.， movement velocity， maximum excursion， directional control) of COG movements as a person volitionally leans to various positions in space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. LOS test measures one aspect of balance utilized in daily life， and is a measure of improvement in balance resulting from rehabilitation. Considering the high efficiency of LOS test in early identification of falls in elderly， high reliability of its parameters， high test-retest reliability while measured by NeuroCom and its ease of execution， it is popular and confident in global measures of balance21，24**\n\n【113】**Previous studies suggestedthatposturalcontrol1：among individuals with osteoporosis is different from general elderly population. Individuals with osteoporosis are more likely to present higher sway velocities and greater maximum shift of the COG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.**\n\n【114】**Azadinia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u> evaluated the effects of two spinal orthoses on balance in the elderly with thoracic Kyphosis. Patients were allocated to two groups (Spinomed orthosis and the posture-training support groups). In both groups， significant changes were observed in the studied balance parameters. Authors concluded that both interventions may improve balance in the elderly in a similar manner.**\n\n【115】**The ability to transfer from sit to stand (STS) is another most commonly performed tasks of daily living. Accurate control of COG**\n\n【116】**Figure 1： CONSORT 2010 flow diagram.**\n\n【117】**position is critical in controlling the rise movement， as well as to maintain postural stability. Ideally， COG sway velocity during the rise should be minimal. Increased sway velocity can be caused by weak trunk extension or inability to keep the COG movement to a minimum in the elderly. However in our study， no significant change was noticed in this balance parameter.**\n\n【118】**In normal aging， step length and speed decreased， turn time increased substantially with aging.**\n\n【119】**Slow gait speed is associated with falls in aged people. Therapeutic exercises to improve gait speed and step length in osteoporotic elderly can reduce the risk of fall \\[27，28\\]. In our study， step speed improved in both control and intervention group which can be contributed to extension exercises administered for patients in both groups.**\n\n【120】**In the present study， another balance parameter changed in intervention group was right turn time. The ability to make a rapid turn in walking is very crucial and sensitive to dynamic balance problems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.**\n\n【121】**There are few studies evaluating the beneficial impacts of spinal orthosis on gait balance \\[9，29，32\\].**\n\n【122】**In 2005， Sinaki 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u> conducted a study to determine the outcome of intervention with a spinal weighted kypho-orthosis (WKO) and a spinal proprioceptive extension exercise dynamic (SPEED) program on the risk of fall in osteoporotic patients. After 4 week ofintervention， balance， gait， and risk of falls assessed by computerized dynamic**\n\n【123】**posturography improved significantly with SPEED program.**\n\n【124】**The role ofexercise in the treatment of osteoporosis is to improve axial stability through improvement of muscle strength and axial posture33.**\n\n【125】**In our study， wearing WKO lead to improvement in turn quick test， mean of excursion and end point excursion. WKO promotes improvement in posture and increased back extensor strength by two mechanisms： first， the device produces a posterior force below the inferior angle of scapula and reduces anterior compressive forces exerted on the kyphotic spine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Second， application of the WKO increases a patient's perception of spinal joint position， which plays an important role in static and dynamic posture. It creates a preprioceptive input and enhances the patient's ability to sense the position of the spine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. WKO also promotes muscle re-education and decreases painful contractions of the erector spine muscles in kyphosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>.**\n\n【126】**Besides WKO， there are some studies investigating other types of spinal orthoses in osteoporosis. A trial was conducted in 2012evaluating the influence of ThamertOsteo-med spinal orthosis on gait and physical functioning in osteoporotic women. At a 6-month follow up， the study demonstrated that wearing a spinal orthosis reduced double support time associated with improvement on gait stability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Pfeifer et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u> evaluated the efficacy of two spinal orthoses in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Wearing the orthosis Spinomed in that study was associated with increase in**\n\n【127】**back extensor and abdominal flexor strength， decrease in the angle of kyphosis and body sway， also decrease in average pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>.**\n\n【128】**In all above mentioned studies， spinal orthosis had positive effects on postural balance which is in agreement with the results of our studies indicating improvement in LOS， step quick turn and speed in WKO group.**\n\n【129】**In conclusion， applying WKO together with back extensor strengthening exercises in women with osteoporosis leads to improvement in dymamic balance tests evaluated by NeuroCom which can be translated to decreased risk of fall in real life in this population.**\n\n【130】**The limitations of our study were the relatively small number of cases included and short term follow ups evaluations. Absence of a control group receiving no intervention was another limitation ofthis study； however， due to ethical considerations we had to consider the least routine interventions including exercise and medications for all patients.**\n\n【131】**We encourage more randomized controlled clinical trials with larger sample size evaluating the effect of WKO on risk of fall in long term via applying clinical functional and para clinical tests in the elderly with osteoporosis. Future studies can also consider power calculation to determine adequate sample size that yielded improved power and effect size which was lacking in the present study.**\n\n【132】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【133】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Cases of stroke patients with mild thrombocytopenia who received IVT were occasionally reported， but reports of patients with platelet count below 80，000/uL are scarce.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation： We report an ischemic stroke patient with a platelet count of 56，000/uL who received IVT. The patient did not have any hemorrhagic symptoms before stroke and no symptomatic hemorrhagic complications after IVT. The stroke was caused by internal carotid artery dissection， and stenting of the right internal carotid artery was performed to prevent cerebral infarction recurrence.**\n\n【17】**Conclusion： This case exemplifies the need to reassess the threshold of platelet count for withholding intravenous thrombolysis. We often encounter cases with management uncertainties， having no available high-quality evidence. In these cases， clinical decisions must be made on an individual basis.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Thrombocytopenia； Acute ischemic stroke； Intravenous Thrombolysis； Tissue plasminogen activator**\n\n【19】**Background**\n\n【20】**Intravenous Thrombolysis (IVT) with alteplase is approved for Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) patients. Nevertheless， IVT use is limited not only by its short therapeutic window， but also by the numerous contraindications. Having a platelet count of less than 100，000/uL is considered an absolute contraindication for IVT， according to trial selection criteria and expert opinions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. As unsuspected thrombocytopenia is rare， the 2013 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines recommend clinicians not to wait for the platelet count results before administering intravenous alteplase to AIS patients unless there is a suspected bleeding thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The rate of unsuspected platelet count <100，000/uL of patients at stroke presentation was reported to be 0.3% by prior studies \\[3，4\\]. However， there are two issues. First，the two prior studies were conducted in the U.S population， which may differ in clinical characteristics from populations of other countries. For instance， people residing in Southwestern part of China such as Chengdu， have an average platelet count below 100，000/pL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Second， the two studies both excluded patients with a history of thrombocytopenia. In fact， very few of such patients are reported in the English literature. Whether a platelet count of 100，000/uL is a justified threshold for withholding IVT remains unclear. So， we report the case of an AIS patient with thrombocytopenia who received IVT，hoping to provide some advice for the management of such patients.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 57-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension presented with left-sided weakness and transient loss of vision in the right eye for the past three hours. The patient denied any neck pain or trauma. Vital signs were notable for a blood pressure of 163/88 mmHg and a heart rate of58 bpm. Neurological examination revealed left-sided central facial palsy， left hypoglossal nerve palsy， left limb weakness， and left Babinski sign with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS) score of 4. Head Computed Tomography (CT) showed no evidence of acute stroke. The**\n\n【23】Figure 1： Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain at 24 hr after symptom onset.

After IVT， the symptom of left-side facial palsy and hemiplegia disappeared with an improvement of NIHSS score to 0， but a partial right-side Horner’s syndrome with right mitosis and right ptosis was observed. To clarify the cause and artery stenosis， the patient had brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and cerebral Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) at 24 hr after symptom onset. MRI showed AIS in the head of the right anterior limb of the internal capsule (Figure1). DSA disclosed mild stenosis and dissecting aneurysm in the initial position of the right Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) . The dissecting aneurysm was confirmed by cervical Magnetic Resonance Angiography(MRA) . 24 hr after IVT， anti-platelet therapy was strengthened with 100 mg of aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel per day for 3 months. Subsequently， stenting of the right ICA was performed to avoid recurrence of cerebral infarction. The Horner's**\n\n【28】**syndrome disappeared， and the blood flow of right ICA normalized after the stenting . The patient had later resumed work without neurological deficits after being discharged. Three months later the platelet count had increased to 88，000/uL and anti-platelet therapy was changed to aspirin 100 mg daily for lifelong.**\n\n【29】**Discussion and Conclusion**\n\n【30】**Prior studies reported the rate of having unsuspected platelet count of less than 100，000/uL at stroke presentation to be only 0.3%\\[3，4\\]. However， both of these studies were conducted in the U.S population and excluded known thrombocytopenia patients. Another Chinese study showed that having a platelet count of below 100，000/uL was common in Southwestern part of China， such as Chengdu 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The mechanism leading to normalization of platelet count after stroke in our patient with thrombocytopenia was unclear. It is possible that thrombocytopenia was acutely caused by stroke. More detailed investigation is needed on the incidence of thrombocytopenia in**\n\n【31】**Chinese stroke patients.**\n\n【32】**Platelet count is associated with the risk of bleeding. Generally， those with platelet counts between 30，000 and 50，000/uL may note easy bruising， whereas platelet counts above 50，000/uL are usually discovered incidentally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Considering the risk of bleeding complications， thrombocytopenic patients are usually excluded from IVT and hence there is very limited data regarding the safety of IVT in thrombocytopenic stroke patients. Whether a platelet count of 100，000/uL is a justified threshold for withholding IVT remains unclear. We often encounter cases with uncertainty regarding management， for which high-quality data are not available. For these cases， clinical decisions must be made on an individual basis. Based on the scanty literature available on this subject， we would recommend thrombolytic therapy for an ischemic stroke patient with a platelet count of between 50，000/uL and 100，000/pL，provided there is no evidence of a bleeding diathesis.**\n\n【33】**Grants Details**\n\n【34】**i) Clinical Vascular Grant In Chinese Physician 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2017-CCA-VG-029)</u>； ii) Independent Fundation of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu Medical College 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. CYFY2017DL06)</u>； iii) National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81870940)</u>； iv) Sichuan Science and Technology Program (No.2018JY0026)**\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

The aim of this article is to show the alternative and benefits of orthopedic treatment ofterrible triad elbow injuries in Children.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Children； Elbow； Terrible triad**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**The elbow injury represents a common reason for consultation with the child. The most common mechanism is a fall in hyperextension of the upper limb 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Dislocation of elbow is less common， but when it is associated with a fracture of the radial head and the coronoid apophysis， it then joins an entity that is seen in adults called terrible triad of the elbow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. When the terrible triad is diagnosed in children，treatments are they always the same as in adults?**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 13 year-old boy presented to our emergency room with a bilateral elbow trauma after a fall from height of 3 meters. X-rays of face and profile of 2 elbows revealed a dislocation of the elbows with additional fractures of the radial head， and coronoid process . No vascular and nerve complications were noted. Other complementary examinations have not revealed additional trauma. We executed a closed manipulation of the elbow under sedation in the operation room； a steady reduction in the elbow could be obtained. We applied a long arm cast and post manipulation neurovascular examination was normal. A CT Scan of 2 elbows was realized. The CT-Scan showed a reduction of two elbows joints， as well as the comminuted fractures of the 2 radial heads with intra-articular fragments and multifragment fractures of the coronoid process in both elbows .**\n\n【17】**Discussion**\n\n【18】**The terrible triad of the elbow is a severe injury that is difficult to treat and has a poor prognosis in the medium to long term. This lesion recently described by Hotchkiss and al，3 lesions： Elbow dislocation with radial head and coronoid process fracture， these injuries are not frequent even in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In child this lesion presents some particularities related with the properties of the bone of the child： soft and cartilaginous 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This lesion requires in most cases a surgical treatment to reestablish elbow stability； the treatment protocol includes initial gentle closed reduction， followed by fixation of all fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The repair of lateral and medial collateral ligaments is not always necessary， because the child rarely presents ligament rupture but often cartilaginous cutaways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The purpose of the ligament reconstruction in the adult is to ensure the stability of the elbow， as in the terrible triad there is often a failure of one of 2 collateral complexes， or both 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In our case the elbow is stable with a complete mobility after the reduction under general anesthesia. Previous reports have demonstrated that the coronoid process is an important element for elbow stability and fixation of this fracture is often accomplished 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In type I (Regan and Morrey)， fracture of the intra-articular tip of the coronoid， surgical fixing is not necessary because the elbow stability is not compromised. While type III (Regan and Morrey)， fracture involving more than 50% of the coronoid process， often associated with posterior elbow instability， still need surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The other element of the stability of the elbow is the radial head， tensioning the outer compartment thus providing a centering and congruence of the elbow. Type I and II of the Mason classification in the fracture of the radial head allows the orthopedic treatment in the terrible triad of the elbow， provided that the damage to the other elbow stability elements is minimal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. For children that present a terrible triad elbow with stable joint after reduction under anesthesia and can be at least30° of extension with a good joint congruence with a fracture of the coronoid apophysis type I(Regan and Morrey)， a fracture of the radial head type I or II (Mason classification ) and after a CT**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： Lateral radiography of both elbows， who showed terrible tirade of right and left elbows (a-right elbow， b-left elbow).**\n\n【20】**Figure 2： The CT-Scan of comminuted fractures of the 2 radial heads with intra-articular fragments (a- right elbow， b- Left elbow).**\n\n【21】**scan of the elbow， which allows better study of fractures， orthopedic treatment can be accomplished 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The immobilization of the elbow is provided by a plaster taking the elbow at 90° of flexion for 45 days with a radiological control of front and profile during the first three weeks. Our case presented bilateral terrible triad of almost identical appearance to the two elbows. Exploration by CT scan had concluded at Posterior dislocation， with fracture type III (Regan and Morrey) of the coronoid process and fractures type III (Mason classification) of the radial head. Both elbows were stable after reduction and we opted for orthopedic treatment， with plaster for 45 days and radiological monitoring during the first three weeks. This choice was justified by the particularity of the terrible triad at the child， which is rarely associated with breaking of collateral ligaments， major means of elbow stability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The radial head is stabilized by the periosteum. Unlike adults pediatric patients can tolerate immobilization for longer periods， and bone healing is faster in children than adults. Adults require rigid fixation to with stand early active mobilisation. After removal of the plaster our patient had a decrease in joint mobility at the two elbows  but they were stable. Also the X-ray control showed a fracture healing and a good remodeling of the radial heads of two elbows . A re-education was prescribed for 3 months， with activo-passive mobilization of 2elbows. This therapy has improved mobility sectors 6 months post initial trauma. These clinical and radiological results confirm the histological features of terrible triads in children； the periosteum allowed proper healing of radial head 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Orthopedic treatment of the terrible triad is well codified. If not improving mobility areas by the protocol of reeducation extraction of intra-articular arthroscopic bone fragments can be attempted The stability of the elbow at an**\n\n【22】**Figure 3： Front and lateral radiography of right elbow 6 month after trauma who showed fracture healing and a good remodeling of the radial head.**\n\n【23】**Figure 4： Front and lateral radiography of the left elbow 6 month after trauma， good remodeling of the radial head fracture and coronoid process fracture.**\n\n【24】**Table 1： Right and left elbows mobility sectors.**\n\n|  | **Right elbow**  |  | **Left elbow**  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **E/F**  | **P/S**  | **E/F**  | **P/S**  |\n| **3 months after** **Trauma**  | **30/100**  | **307150**  | **30790**  | **30/1300**  |\n| **6 months after**  | **107120**  | **107160**  | **20/100°**  | **20/1300°**  |\n| **Trauma**  | **107120**  | **107160**  | **20/100°**  | **20/1300°**  |\n\n【26】**Evolution of elbows mobility sectors under reeducation.**\n\n【27】**_·.r_**\n\n【28】**E / F： Extension /Flexion， P/S： pronation/supination**\n\n【29】**extension at least 30°is an essential condition，the radial head fracture should be staged I or II according to Mason classification and the coronoid apophysis fracture staged I or II according to Regan and Morrey 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Complications are frequently encountered after surgical treatmentofterrible triad injuries and it is related to the severity of the injury. Common complications are infection， instability， malunion， nonunion， heteropic ossification， stiffness， avascular necrosis of the radial head and ulnar neuropathy.

He had undergone vitrectomy twice because of retinal redetachment after the first vitrectomy. At the last vitrectomy， encircling (silicone strip #220) was performed. Immediately after the vitrectomy， the Intraocular Pressure (IOP) increased up to 30 mmHg to 50 mmHg for about 2 weeks； nevertheless， administration of hypotensive drugs and laser iridectomy. We inserted a BGI via the pars plana with silicone strip resection. The IOP reduced below 20 mmHg for 14 months after the implant surgery with the administration ofhypotensive drops.**\n\n【23】**Conclusion： Insertion of a BGI via the pars plana with silicone band resection may be useful for refractory glaucoma after vitrectomy with a preexisting silicone strip.**\n\n【24】**Keywords： Retinal detachment； Encircling； Baerveldt drainage implant**\n\n【25】**Introduction**\n\n【26】**Postoperative glaucoma has been reported in 2% to 48% of patients after vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment (RD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-5\\]</u>. The cause is considered to be pupillary block angle closure， inflammation， or a preexisting angle abnormality. Owing to conjunctival scarring and recession caused by a previous vitrectomy with an encircling band， filtration surgery is difficult to perform for maintaining a low Intraocular Pressure (IOP) to prevent postoperative glaucoma after surgery for RD.**\n\n【27】**A Glaucoma Drainage Device (GDD) is a valuable tool for the management of patients in whom filtering surgery has failed or as the first surgical option in patients at high risk of failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【28】**However， it is difficult to secure the space for insertion of the plate of the device because in some cases after vitrectomy for RD， a preexisting scleral band may be present. To the best of our knowledge， there is no report on the resection ofa silicone strip for the insertion of a BGI. Herein we report a case of refractory glaucoma with a preexisting silicone strip in which a Baerveldt Drainage Implant (BGI) was inserted.**\n\n【29】**Case Presentation**\n\n【30】**A 43-year-old man developed rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Range of RD was total off. Vitrectomy combined with pars plana lensectomy using gas tamponade with silicone band(#240) was performed. However， 7 days after the first vitrectomy， retinal redetachment from the nasal inferior section was recognized. The second vitrectomy was performed with the change of silicone band (#240) to a silicone strip (#220). Immediately after the second vitrectomy， the IOP increased up to 30 mmHg to 50 mmHg for about 3 weeks because peripheral anterior synechia was observed in almost every part of the angle； nevertheless， administration of hypotensive drugs and laser iridectomy. We performed BGI via the pars plana with silicone strip resection.**\n\n【31】**Results**\n\n【32】The IOP reduced below 20 mmHg for 14 months immediately after the implant surgery with\n\n【33】Figure 1： Surgical procedure.\n\n【34】**hypotensive drops； the retina has remained attached during the follow-up period.**\n\n【35】**was removed， and the conjunctival incision was closed using an 8-0polyglactin continuous suture.**\n\n【36】Surgical Procedure Discussion\n\n【37】**The conjunctiva showed scarring before the operation (Figure1.1). Sub-Tenon’s anesthesia (2% lidocaine) was administered， and a conjunctival incision was made along the corneal limbus to expose the superior and lateral rectus muscles. The silicone strip was resected at the superior nasal quadrant and the inferior temporal quadrant； the resected silicone band was removed from the superior temporal quadrant . Then， the edge of the silicone band was attached to the sclera with 5-0 polyester suture because the effect of retinal indentation to the portion of redetachment of the retina was needed to be rest . A 6 mmx6 mm fornix-based lamellar scleral flap was created， and a 25-gauge infusion line was placed in the inferotemporal quadrant.**\n\n【38】**GDDs inserted via the pars plana route are used to control IOP in eyes with refractory glaucoma， particularly when conjunctival scarring owing to prior intraocular surgery is present.**\n\n【39】**The tube of a GDD is usually inserted into the Anterior Chamber(AC)， but complications， including a shallow anterior chamber and corneal endothelial decompensation， have been reported following insertion of a GDD tube into the anterior chamber 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-10\\]</u>. The pars plana GDD is designed to avoid these complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>， but requires thorough resection of the vitreous by vitrectomy to avoid occlusion of the tube by the vitreous. Therefore， if the patient has already undergone a vitrectomy for RD，pars plana GDD is considered a good device for refractory glaucoma after vitrectomy.**\n\n【40】**The Baerveldt implant tube was knotted using an 8-0 polyglactin suture thread because aqueous flow through the device must be restricted until plate encapsulation and insertion beneath the lateral and superior rectus muscles in the superotemporal quadrant is completed . The plate was then anchored to the sclera using a 5-0 polyester suture through each of the two fixation holes on the anterior flange of the plate. Next， a sclerotomy was made 3.5mm to the limbus under the scleral flap using a 20-gauge V-lance. The tube was inserted through the sclerotomy and the Hoffmann elbow was fixed in place with an 8-0 nylon thread. The Hoffmann elbow was then covered by the scleral flap， which was closed using a 10-0nylon thread. A Sherwood slit was made using a microblade to avoid early postoperative elevation of IOP. Finally， the infusion cannula**\n\n【41】**Smith et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> reported the use of a long-valved (plateless) Krupin-Denver tube inserted into the encapsulated band in cases with a preexisting silicone band. However， distal tube occlusion was recognized in 30% of these cases. Sidoti et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> reported that the success rate of BGI is 85% in eyes with a preexisting scleral band without resection of the silicone band. This study reported that obstruction ofthe distal tube opening by episcleral fibrous tissue was a frequent complication.**\n\n【42】**Sufficient posterior dissection between the sclera and tenon capsule in the quadrant of implantation is necessary to allow adequate seating of the implant and resection of the silicone band is required to secure a space for insertion of the plate. The GGD used**\n\n【43】**in this case was a pars plana BGI that has a plate measuring 350 mm通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In this case， a silicone strip #220 (width 6 mm) was previously used， because of which it was difficult to secure a space for insertion of the plate of the BGI. Further，the BGI was inserted with resection of the preexisting silicone band， rather than removing the entire band， because soon after the vitrectomy， the effect of indentation of scleral band to the retinal detachment position wanted to be rest. The rest of silicone strip was sutured to the eye ball at the edge of the silicone band.**\n\n【44】**Therefore， we inserted the BGI on the opposite side where the retina showed reattachment.**\n\n【45】**If the silicone band is wide and is not resected， the silicone tube from the plate may be occluded by the compression of silicone band. However， the silicone tube was not placed under the band owing to the possibility that the band-scleral compression would perforate the sclera at the tube site. Sidioti et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> reported a case of Baerveldt implantation complicated by scleral perforation at the site of severe ectasia underlying a previously placed scleral buckle.**\n\n【46】**Regarding the space for insertion of the plate， the superonasal quadrant should be avoided for larger GDDs because the implant or an overlying bleb may interfere with the function of the superior oblique muscle， resulting in acquired Brown’s syndrome \\[15，16\\].**\n\n【47】**Our findings in the current case suggest that insertion of a BGI via the pars plana with resection of the silicone band may be useful for refractory glaucoma in eyes after vitrectomy with a preexisting silicone strip.**\n\n【48】**Statements**\n\n【49】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【50】We would like to thank Editage Author Services for manuscript editing\n\n【51】**Statement of ethics**\n\n【52】**The report was approved by the ethics committee at Toho University Sakura Medical Center (approval number S16047).

The objective of this work was to report the exceptional case of a colonic foreign body revealed by sub-occlusive syndromes. This is a 65-year-old patient with no significant pathological history， who presented with Koenigs syndrome progressing against a background of deterioration of the general state with a periumbilical impasto on examination. The abdominal CT objectified a thickening of the transverse colon with foreign body at the level of the peritoneal fat making suspect a colonic perforation by clogged foreign body. Colonoscopy showed an impassable stenosis of the transverse colon， the anatomopathological study of colonic biopsies was in favor of granulomatous colitis， the patient therefore underwent colonic resection with end-to-end anastomosis with good postoperative progress.**\n\n【15】**An anatomopathological study of the operative resection part showed that it was a granulomatous colitis with a foreign body. In the absence of anamnestic orientation， the colonic localization of a foreign body poses a real problem of differential diagnosis with tumor， infectious and inflammatory pathologies. It can be revealed by complications such as occlusion or perforation where imaging plays a key role. Endoscopy always plays an essential diagnostic and therapeutic role in the care of ingested foreign bodies， thus limiting surgical morbidity， although this remains sometimes unavoidable， and the anatomopathological study highlights a granuloma with a constituted foreign body. Granulomatous colitis with a foreign body with clogged colonic perforation is a rarely reported situation and must henceforth be considered before any colonic symptomatology even in the absence of the anamnestic elements in favor such as our case in order to avoid the patient from the side effects and complications of heavy treatments.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Granulomatous colitis； Foreign body； Tumor process； Endoscopy； Surgery**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Ingestion of the foreign body is a situation that gastroenterologists are regularly confronted with the symptomatic range is wide.

We report a case of an elderly subject with repetitive subocclusive syndrome with a periumbilical impasto evolving in a context of deterioration of the general state for 3 months， the obsession was the neoplastic pathology， but the explorations have shown that \"It was a granulomatous colitis with a foreign body with colonic perforation blocked.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**AM aged 65， is admitted to the gastroenterology department of the Mohammed VI University Hospital Center in Marrakechforkoenig syndromeevolving for 3 months in a contextofdeterioration in general condition with weight loss estimated at 8 kg/3 months aggravated by the appearance of subocclusive syndromes.No notion of chronic diarrhea，or of recent tuberculosis contagion neither in the entourage， nor of neoplasia or chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestine (IBD) in the family. The clinical examination found an apyretic patient， stable on the hemodynamic and respiratory plan， having a BMI (Body Mass Index) at 19 kg/m， with a flexible abdomen，with umbilical impasto， without detectable peritoneal effusion.

The patient was put on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy and then he underwent colonic resection with an end-to-end colonic anastomosis with drainage of the collections.

The anatomopathological studyofthe operating room was in favor of granulomatous transmural colitis with foreign body with non-necrotizing epithelio-giganto-cellular follicles without sign of malignancy. The post-operative suites were simple. The patient is asymptomatic， has gained weight and has a negative inflammatory balance， with a 2-year follow-up.**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n【31】**The Foreign Bodies (FB) ingested are numerous but poorlylisted. Children， prisoners， psychotic or mentally retarded patients and elderly and edentulous patients constitute the populations at risk通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Passage through the digestive tract is more frequent \\[2，3\\]. 80%to 90% of foreign bodies ingested pass spontaneously. 10% to 20%require non-surgical extraction maneuvers when they are accessible**\n\n【32】**endoscopically and less than 1% require surgery， particularly following complications (hemorrhage， occlusion and perforation)\\[1，4\\]. Our patient is an elderly subject with no notable pathological history or particular field without the notion of ingestion of a foreign body， presenting a koenig syndrome evolving in a context of deterioration of the general state. The diagnosis is usually easy and is based on the interrogation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， although not contributory in the case of our patient making the observation exceptional. Retro-sternal pain， odynophagia， dysphagia， hyper-sialorrhea and vomiting may occur at the time of the incident which could also be complicated by bleeding， perforation with infectious consequences (mediastinitis， cellulitis and para-esophageal abscess) and fistulas of the digestive tract \\[1，6\\]. Our patient developed a sub-occlusive syndrome on an inflammatory process formed around the foreign body at the level of the median part of the transverse colon.**\n\n【33】**No radiological assessment is necessary for non-bone food impactions without complications. The ESGE (European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy) recommends a simple X-ray to locate the FB， determine its size， appearance and number if the object is suspected to be radiopaque or whose nature is unknown. Computed tomography is indicated in case of suspected complications that may require surgical treatment \\[7，8\\]. In the illustrated case， the radiography of the abdomen without preparation was normal and the abdominal computed tomography showed a thickening of the transverse colon with foreign body at the level of the peritoneal fat making suspect a colonic perforation by clogged foreign body. The exact nature of the foreign body remains unidentified； the anamnestic data were not contributory. The search for an underlying disease during a feeding impaction incident is essential and includes a biopsy of the blocking seat 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The operative part of the colon resection that our patient underwent， was in favor of granulomatous transmural colitis with foreign body while eliminating tuberculosis， Crohn’s disease and neoplasia. Foreign body granuloma is a chronic lesion predominantly made up of cells of the monocyte and macrophage lineage. The phagocytosis function is usually well developed there. It is associated in variable numbers with other inflammatory cells including lymphocytes， plasma cells， antigen presenting cells as well as neutrophils and eosinophils 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In our case， the inflammatory**\n\n【34】**infiltrate consisted mainly of lymphocytes， plasma cells， histiocytes and some polymorphonuclear cells. The cellular profile of this inflammatory lesion has most likely been altered by chronic course.**\n\n【35】**Conclusion**\n\n【36】**The ingestion of foreign bodies is a situation frequently encountered inngastroenterology. Colonic localization is rarely reported. However， such a diagnosis must henceforth be considered after having ruled out infectious， inflammatory and tumor etiologies， even in the absence of an evocative context， sparing the patient from multiple iatrogenic damages.**\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Hepatic Portal Venous Gas (HPVG) is even rarer and has been historically associated with dismal outcome. In this brief report， we evoke this entity emphasizing its etiology， the role of Computerized Tomography (CT) in establishing the diagnosis， and treatment orientations.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Portal； Gas； Sepsis； Surgery**\n\n【19】**Case Summary**\n\n【20】**A 66-year-old woman with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis， presented with a 2-hour history of severe abdominal pain. Upon initial physical examination， the patient was conscious， oriented， with diffuse abdominal guarding. She had tachycardia (120 beats/min) and preserved blood pressure(110/80 mmHg). Blood tests revealed a White Blood Count (WBC) of 20，700/mm’， a C Reactive Protein (CRP) of 137 mg/dl， a serum Lipase of 91 UI/ml， and normal liver function tests. The IV-enhanced abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed diffuse Hepatic Portal Venous Gas(HPVG) . Additionally， gas was detected in both femoral veins . The patient was taken rapidly to the operating room. Laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis of extensive intestinal necrosis from the duodenum to the transverse colon， rendering any surgical resection useless. Supportive care measures were implemented. The patient died four hours later.**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**HPVG is a rare condition secondary to numerous causes， including mainly mesenteric ischemic disease， colonic diverticulitis， inflammatory bowel disease， trauma， or iatrogenic (i.e.，post endoscopic procedures) \\[1，2\\]. Historically， HPVG was first observed in neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most common cause of HPVG in adults is Acute Mesenteric Ischemia (AMI) which represents upto 70% of cases in the literature with a morality rate of up to 80% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Table 1summarizes the most commonly reported etiologies of HPVG.**\n\n【23】**The intraportal gas is usually produced by microorganisms in the intestinal lumen itself or in an cllr underlying abscess. Continuous advances in the accuracy of current imaging techniques have led to less rare diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. CT scan is the mainstay of the diagnostic approach to HVPG. Pre contrast phase may be sufficient to reach diagnosis. The use of lung window is recommended for its high sensitivity in detecting small amounts of gas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>. Usually located in the central part of the liver， pneumobilia is the main differential diagnosis of HVPG which can reach the periphery \\[8，9\\].**\n\n【24】**Figure 1： A 66-years old female patient with previous history of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis： lV-enhanced， abdominal CT scan showed pancreatic pseudo cyst (arrow) and diffuse portal pneumatosis (arrow heads).**\n\n【25】**Table 1： Summary of the reported underlying causes of Hepatic Portal Vein Gas _(HPVG)._**\n\n| **Etiologies of Hepatic Portal Vein Gas (HPVG)**  |\n| --- |\n| **Infectious**  |\n| **Acute cholecystitis**  |\n| **Acute appendicitis**  |\n| **Rotavirus**  |\n| **latrogenic**  |\n| **Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography**  |\n| **Intra gastric balloon**  |\n| **Colonoscopy**  |\n| **Pyloric balloon dilation**  |\n| **Hemodialysis**  |\n| **MiscellaneoUS**  |\n| **Colon cancer**  |\n| **Crohn disease**  |\n| **Acute pancreatitis**  |\n| **Abdominal blunt trauma**  |\n\n【27】**Figure 2： A 66-years old female patient with previous history of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis： lV-enhanced， abdominal CT scan showed gas in both femoral veins .**\n\n【28】**Direct signs of AMI on CT scan include abrupt termination of the mesenteric vessels or even the presence of filling defects in the vessel lumen itself. They are visualized with multi-detector angiography CT scan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In case ofabsence ofIV contrast， one should look for indirect signs including bowel dilation， wall thickening or attenuation， fat standing and ascites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【29】**The second most commonly reported etiology of HPVG is sigmoid diverticulitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Colonic diverticulosis， fat standing or abscess adherent to the colonic wall are commonly disclosed.**\n\n【30】**The prognosis of HPVG is related to the underlying etiology通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In opposition to early studies where mortality rate was nearly75% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， latest reports have showed an overall mortality less than40%\\[7，11\\]. The obvious decrease in mortality is mainly due to the increased usage and sensitivity of CT scan， which facilitated earlier detection and treatment of HPVG通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【31】**Many authors have reported that the volume of HPVG is prognostic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. However， the presence of gas 3 or more hepatic segments has the poorest prognosis. Urgent surgery may be avoided when 2 or less hepatic segments are concerned. In our case， HPVG was very extensive， spreading in the entire liver. Moreover， gas reached the caval system and flooded back to both femoral veins.**\n\n【32】**To conclude， CT scan has profoundly transformed the outcome of patients with HPVG. However， it remains a serious radiologic finding that needs to be closely evaluated. In case of unclear etiology， surgical exploration may be recommended in order to rule out underlying intestinal necrosis**\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

We found an increase in the values of p50 and p50 by14% and 6.4%， respectively (p<0.05)，and the corresponding shift in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve rightwards， which was apparently a response for tissue hypoxia developed due to pulmonary circulation insufficiency.

Although approaches to management of COVID-19 change with accumulation of new information， there is yet no clear understanding of the essence of this disease通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is characterized by a significant impairment in oxygen supply to the body. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include pronounced signs of hypoxic respiratory failure： Patients experience a reduction ofarterial blood saturation (less than 93%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Disturbances in blood oxygen transport， observed in the course of the disease， can also be important. Changed Hemoglobin Oxygen Affinity (HOA)， which is a pivotal factor in compensation for hypoxic respiratory failure under various pathologic states， underlies the processes of adaptation to hypoxia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However， at present， there is no clear insight into the state of blood oxygen transport， particularly in relation to severity of COVID-19，and the few available works dealing with the problem are contradictory \\[4，5\\]. In this connection， this study was aimed to investigate HOA and the gaseous transmitters Nitric Oxide (NO) and Hydrogen Sulfide (H，S) in patients with COVID-19.**\n\n【25】**Material and Methods**\n\n【26】**Subjects**\n\n【27】**The object of research was patients with COVID-19. The group included 15 subjects who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by verification of the virus using qualitative determination of RNA SARS-CoV-2 in scrapings of pharyngo-oral cells by means of the polymerase chain reaction as well as on the basis of the typical clinical status and the changes in the lungs detected by X-ray**\n\n【28】**Computed Tomography (CT) ofthoracic organs. The severity of viral pneumonia was determined according to the regional classification of COVID-19 diagnostics and treatment where the absence of signs of viral pneumonia was designated as CT-0， whereas mild pneumonia with areas of ground-glass opacity and lung injury of less than 25%was designated as CT-1， moderate pneumonia with lung injury of 25%to 50% was designated as CT-2， mild to severe pneumonia with lung injury of 50% to 75% was designated as CT-3 and severe pneumonia with more that 75% lung injury was designated as CT-4. These changes corresponded to the classification of the Dutch Association for Radiology， CO-RADS 4-5. The group of patients included 6 men and 9 women of the mean age of 58.0 years. The group of healthy individuals comprised 15 apparently healthy subjects aged 54 years.**\n\n【29】**Blood oxygen transport (hemoglobin-oxygen affinity)**\n\n【30】**Blood was drawn from the cubital vein after blood flow recovery on admission of patients to hospital. The blood was assayed for partial Oxygen Pressure (pO，) and Carbon Dioxide (pCO，)， pH and blood Oxygen Saturation (SO，) with a Star Profile pHOx plus L gas analyzer (Nova Biomedical， USA). The Siggaard-Andersen nomograms were used to calculate the acid-base parameters： Standard Bicarbonate (SBC)， AAccttuuaall Base Excess/StandardBase Excess(ABE/SBE)， Hydrocarbonate (HCO，-) and the total blood plasma Carbonic Acid (TCO，). HOA was calculated by p50 (the blood PO， corresponding to its 50% oxygen saturation) which was determined spectrophotometrically (the p50). The Severinghaus formulas通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> were applied to calculate p50 at standard values of pH， pCO， and temperature 通用删除11(英):<u>(p50)</u> as well as position of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curye.**\n\n【31】**Gaseous transmitters**\n\n【32】**Production of Nitric Oxide (NO) was measured by the content of blood plasma Nitrates/Nitrites (NO，-/NO，-) using the Griess reagent and a Solar PV1251C spectrophotometer at a wavelength of540 nm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The content of Hydrogen Sulfide (H，S) was measuredbya spectrophotometric method based on the reaction between the sulfide anion and an acidic solution of N，N-Dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in the presence of ferric chloride at a wavelength of670 nm通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【33】**Statistical analysis**\n\n【34】**Distribution of the body of data obtained was evaluated in compliance with the law of normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test.

The results were presented as a Median (Me) \\[25hpercentile； 75tpercentile\\]. The p value of <0.05 was considered significant.**\n\n【35】**The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients from the group examined summarizes in Table 1. The patients of this group had histories of Stage 2 arterial hypertension and coronary heart disease (40% of the cases)， as well as Functional Class II stable angina pectoris (46. 67%). Some of the examined patients (13.3%) had histories of cancer. The analysis of the laboratory parameters (Table2) revealed elevated activities of lactate dehydrogenase， aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase and well as an increased content of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) which reflected an acute inflammatory process.

An elevation of p50 by 14% (p<0.05) was found， which was evidently a typical response to tissue hypoxia that developed due to insufficiency of pulmonary circulation. The values for other parameters did not differ from those in healthy individuals. The p50was elevated by 6.4%(p<0.05) in comparison with the control group. Attention should be given to the rightward shift in the oxyhemoglobin**\n\n【44】**Table 4： Changes in parameters of blood oxygen transport in patients with COVID-19.**\n\n| **Parameter**  | **Healthy individuals**  | **PatientswithCOVID-19**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **n**  | **15**  | **15**  |\n| **p50ac mmHg**  | **28.2(27.9；29.1)**  | **30.0(29.1；31.45)\\***  |\n| **p50，mmHg**  | **27.9(27.5；28.9)**  | **31.8(29.5；34.3)\\***  |\n| **pH， units en.**  | **7.367 (7.352；7.407)**  | **7.456(7.421；7.497)\\***  |\n| **pCo。mmHg**  | **48.5(46.7；49.8)**  | **44.2(41.5；47.7)\\***  |\n| **pO，mmHg**  | **40.0(38.0；47.0)**  | **33.5(25.2；45.7)**  |\n| **HCO.-， mmol/**  | **29.4(27.3；31.0)**  | **30.8(27.5；33.3)**  |\n| **TCO。mmol/**  | **31.0(28.8；32.5)**  | **32.4(29.5；34.8)**  |\n| **ABE， mmolAl**  | **3.5(2.5；5.6)**  | **7.5(2.5；9.2)\\***  |\n| **SBE， mmolA**  | **3.6(2.1；6.0)**  | **7.3(3.0；8.8)\\***  |\n| **SBC， mmol/**  | **26.6(25.3；28.3)**  | **30.1(26.6；31.9)\\***  |\n| **Hemoglobin， g/l**  | **141(117；144)**  | **121 (92；130)\\***  |\n| **SO%**  | **65.4(60.6；67.8)**  | **59.9(44.7；72.8)**  |\n\n【46】**Figure 1： Oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve venous blood in healthy individuals (u) and patients with COVID-19(+).**\n\n【47】**dissociation curve . This can probably be associated with a certain exhaustion of the compensatory response of the body to hypoxia， as evidenced by the decreased pO， and SO， contents. The elevated p50 contributes to enhancement of the oxygen flow to tissues under normoxia or mild hypoxia， whereas in impaired tissue oxygen utilization， its reduction can cause an adverse， pro-oxidant，effect \\[91.**\n\n【48】**Discussion**\n\n【49】**Some papers describing the pattern of changes in hemoglobin-oxygen affinity in patients with COVID-19 are available， but they are rather contradictory. According to Daniel et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， the HOA tended to decrease in patients with this pathology. On the contrary， other authors such as Vogel et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> noticed elevated HOA in patients with the above disease. Under hypoxia， the body supplies O， to the tissues by changing the mechanisms of HOA regulation， and even insignificant changes in HOA can maximize the arteriovenous oxygen difference and optimize O，transport to the tissues， maintaining a relatively low pressure on the hemodynamics通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The shift in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve rightwards in the examined patients with COVID-19 and the decreased blood**\n\n【50】**pO， may be considered as an attempt of the body to compensate for hypoxia. However， under conditions of oxidative stress， when the tissue oxygen utilization is disturbed and a considerable amount of it is spent in oxygenase reactions to produce reactive oxygen species， this can activate free radical oxidation processes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Nearly all patients with COVID-19 experience systemic cardiovascular system injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> which is accompanied by a pronounced damage of the endothelium. Sometimes this pathology is defined as endotheliitis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The endothelial dysfunction developing in COVID-19 is a pathologic state under which the endothelium loses its ability to maintain the normal vascular tone. This brings about changes in production of different hemoglobin derivatives with released gaseous transmitters (NO，H，S)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.**\n\n【51】**We can suggest that the system ofgaseous transmitters， predominantly that of nitric oxide and1上hydrogen sulfide， is responsible for the changes in blood oxygen-binding properties. As is known， the above gaseous transmitters contribute to modification of HOA. This is attained via various mechanisms such as production of sulfhemoglobin and modulation of the intraerythrocyte and L-arginine-NO pathway， as well as is mediated through systemic mechanisms of formation of hemoglobin functional properties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In this connection， of interest is the work of Mortaz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> that shows an increased content of intraerythrocyte NO in patients with COVID-19. In this study， we found an 83.03% increase in the ratio of blood plasma NO-/NO，-(p<0.05) and a 79.9% decrease of H2S(p<0.05) in the above category of patients . It is known that the gaseous transmitters (NO and H S) play a role of allosteric effectors of hemoglobin functional properties， changing hemoglobin-oxygen affinity and thus affecting O， transport 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The changed content of the gaseous transmitters (NO，H S) observed in our study contributes to alterations in blood oxygen transport realized through participation of the gaseous transmitters NO and H，S (elevated concentrations of nitrates/nitrites and decreased hydrogen sulfide). The effects of both NO and the other gaseous transmitter， H\\_S， on the formation of blood oxygen-binding properties can be significant for the processes of gaseous exchange and other physiological functions.**\n\n【52】**Many physiological effects of H，S are due to its interaction with other gaseous intermediates (NO and CO) occurring both at the level of regulation of biosynthetic enzymes and targets for their effects. On this basis， we suggest to consider the gaseous mediators as a union of molecules regulating cell processes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Hydrogen sulfide occupies a special position in regulation of physiologicalprocesses，particularlyin regulation of contractile reactions of vascular smooth muscles， and its vasorelaxing effect is stipulated by not only dysfunction of endothelial smooth muscle interactions but also by a close interaction with NO-dependent mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. This is applicable to H，S effects on red blood cells. It was shown that the hydrogen sulfide donor NaHS at a physiological concentration (6×10\" mol) improved erythrocyte deformability， exerting a unidirectional effect that was similar in value to that of the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside. However， at a higher concentration (10’ mol) NaHS reduced erythrocyte deformability due to the increased limit of membrane fluidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Our study demonstrated an increase in nitric oxide and a decrease in hydrogen sulfide， indicating that the activities of the mechanisms of generation of these gaseous transmitters were not unidirectional. The mechanisms of blood oxygen transport are a prime target forNO and H\\_S effects. Disturbances in the function of gaseous transmitter formation cause impairments in blood oxygen-binding properties and， consequently， provoke a reduction of adequate oxygen delivery**\n\n【53】**\"significant differences fram the group of healthy individuals**\n\n【54】**by a blood flow to meet tissue requirements， thus promoting the development of hypoxia.**\n\n【55】**Conclusion**\n\n【56】**In conclusion， this study found that patients with COVID-19demonstrated impairments in major parameters of blood oxygenation(pO。SO)andan increase in HOA. The changes found in hemoglobin oxygen-binding properties are related to the alterations in the state of the system of gaseoustransmitters (nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide)， which is significant in the pathogenesis of hypoxia developing in this pathology.**\n\n【57】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【58】We are grateful to the staff of the Department of Pulmonology of the Grodno University Clinic for their help in this study.\n\n【59】**Statement ofEthics**\n\n【60】**The Ethics Committee of Grodno Medical University approved the study protocol， and all participants provided written informed consent before initiation of study measurements (Protocol No 1 of26.01.2021).

Paucicellularity and minimal vascularity are most commonly encountered in accordance to its nature as a benign tumor. In some cases，hypercellularity and a higher rate of vascularization have been found， becoming necessary to rule out sarcoma lineage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The main differences in its behavior are that the latter have a rapid growth tendency， ill-defined limits， capacity of infiltration to surrounding tissues， rich blood supply and heterogeneous components within the tumor. The variety of areas within the tumor account for specific tissues，suchas fattytissue，chondroid matrixand focalareas of necrosis**\n\n【54】**通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. An important difference to account for is myxoid degeneration changes within some other types of tumors such as liposarcoma， rhabdomyosarcoma orchondrosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Histopathological analysis (FNAA and biopsy) showed myxoid content， low cellularity， a focal cyst and capsule continuity without signs of infiltration to the surrounding tissues which adheres to its described general behavior. The findings and clinical follow-up point to the fact that surgery was curative. This case describes an archetypical appearance and treatment of this pathology but it is wise to consider other syndromes in particular scenarios.**\n\n【55】**If multiple IM were to be found， discarding systemic syndromes is advised.

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and imaging data of 3 pathologically confirmed gossypiboma patients at varied time after cesarean resection. At four months after cesarean resection， gossypiboma near the small intestine caused fistula and intestinal obstruction. Soft tissue density alongthe intestinal canal， made the “segmentalhoneycombsign\"and\"truncation\"， with metal markings on the edge on CT. Long T1 and short T2 signals and DWI metal artifacts were revealed on MRI. Eighteen months after cesarean resection， gossypiboma located in the peritoneal and intestinal space. MRI demonstrates cystic and solid features， with \"vortex like sign\"and obvious ring enhancement on contrast-enhanced scan. Five years after cesarean resection， gossypiboma was palpated in the right middle and lower abdomen. MRI revealed a round mass oflong T1 signal with mixed T2 signal， as well as swirling lower signal in T2WI，T2WI-FS and DWI were observed. In CT and MRI examinations for suspected gossypiboma after cesarean resection， honeycomb sign\"and\"vortex like sign\" are the characteristic appearances； gauze transplanted into the intestine may show“truncation sign\". DWI metal artifacts and surgical history can aid the diagnosis.**\n\n【23】**Keywords： Gossypiboma； Abdominal； Computed tomography； Magnetic resonance imaging； Diagnosis**\n\n【24】**Introduction**\n\n【25】**A gossypiboma or textiloma is an infrequent complication of any surgical procedure associated with potentially dangerous health problems for the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u> and legal implications for the surgeon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The medico legal implications and widespread negative press coverage explain why manycases are not reported， with theliterature consisting only of case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>. The incidence of gossypiboma is generally low， but is considerably higher in surgeries performed with open cavities， among which cesarean section ranks number one 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Early and accurate diagnosis of gossypiboma plays very important role for delivering proper treatment. However， the diagnosis of gossypibomas is challenging as the symptoms are usually nonspecific， may appear years after surgery， and may be misdiagnosed as a tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> or abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> in the abdomen and pelvis.**\n\n【26】**Depending on the retained time of foreign bodies or sponge， exudative and aseptic fibrous alterations may occur，leading to early abscess or late fistulas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> as well as clinically silent for many years \\[12，13\\]. Thus， medical imaging is important in giving accurate diagnosis. Ultrasonography is a cheap and easy imaging modality for gossypiboma diagnosis； however， it may not be sufficient to evaluate the abdominal or pelvic organs in the cases of suspected gossypibomas in women after cesarean resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Thus recognizing computed tomography and MR features of gossypibomas after varied foreign body retain time in this population is very important.**\n\n【27】**In this study， we retrospectively enrolled 3 women who developed gossypibomas at varied time after cesarean resection and correlated their imaging features with the pathological findings.**\n\n【28】**Case 1. Gossypiboma in a woman at 4 months after cesarean resection**\n\n【29】**A 29-year oldfemale was admitted to the hospital due to intermittent abdominalpain， abdominal**\n\n【30】**Figure 1： A 29-year-old woman who presented with intestinal obstruction 4 months after caesarean section.

More than 1 month before admission， intermittent abdominal pain occurred without obvious reason， mainly in the upper abdomen. The pain became worse after eating， with occasional nausea and vomiting. Recently， she has lost about 15 Kg of body weight. She underwent a cesarean section 4months ago. A 10-cm transverse surgical scar was observedat the lower abdomen， together with the whole abdomen tenderness， especially the middle and lower abdomen. Abdomen plain radiograph revealed high density fold line of the lower abdomen . Plain CT scan revealed tortuous and coiled soft tissue density shadows in the right middle and lower abdominal small intestine， and circular high-density shadows at the edge. Multiple gas shadows were observed with \"segmental honeycomb\" changes. Edema and thickening of the intestinal wall and mesentery， dilation， fluid accumulation and gas accumulation in the upper intestinal layer were also observed. MRI showed that the right middle and lower abdominal small intestine was dilated， with short T2 signal shadows along the intestinal canal lumen， and low DWI signal of metal artifacts on the edge， corresponding to the thickened intestinal wall. Besides， high T2WI-FS and DWI signal， and multiple enlarged lymph nodes were observed around the intestine and at the mesenteric roots . During the laparotomy operation， the small intestine was found to have clumps ofadhesives at 150 cm from the ileocecal part， and the adhesive bowel was about 40 cm long. An enveloped internal fistula was formed locally. Pathological examination revealed intestinal wall tissue， mucosal tissue degeneration and necrosis， submucosal vascular dilation， congestion， inflammatory cell infiltration (Figure1G). Based on the patient history and examinations， the diagnosis of intestinal ulcer and perforation with foreign body (gauze) was made.**\n\n【32】**Figure 2： A 38-year-old woman with a mass in her left middle and lower abdomen18 months after caesarean section.

Gossypiboma in a woman at 18 months after cesarean resection**\n\n【34】**A 38 years old female was admitted in our hospital due to the intermittent abdominal pain and discomfort for 6 months.

She had a caesarean section18 months ago and had a history of massive bleeding and blood transfusion. MRI examination showed a round long T1 mass with mixed T2 signal (\"swirl-like\" sign) about 5.5 cm x 4.4 cm on the left middle-lower abdomen， uneven high signal on DWI， complete capsule at the edge of the mass. Furthermore， obvious ring enhancement in the capsule and no enhancement in the center were observed on enhanced MR scan . Laparotomy revealed that the mass in the left middle-lower abdomen was closely**\n\n【36】**Figure 3： A 30-year-old woman with a mass in her abdomen 5 years after caesarean section.

Gossypiboma in awoman at 5 years after cesarean resection**\n\n【39】**A 30-year old female with intermittent abdominal pain for2 months and abdominal mass for 1 week was admitted. She underwent cesarean section 5 years ago， tubal ligation 4 years ago and myomectomy 1 year ago. MRI examination showed a round long T1 mass (about 13.1 cm ×9.7 cm) with mixed T2 signal  in the right middle and lower abdominal cavity. Slightly lower“swirling”sign was observed in T2WI and T2WI-FS images， and isoT1-short T2 signal envelope at the edge of the mass . Slightlylower vortex signal shadow andlower strip band signal can be seen within high signal background . On the other layer of DWI， magnetic sensitivity artifacts can be seen around the low-signal shadow . Laparotomy revealed a cystic mass at 50 cm away from the ileocecal part， which encapsulated the ileum and adhered to the adjacent small intestine. The section was cystic， containing yellow fluid and gauze mass， and granulation tissue formation was observed V on the cyst wall. Pathological examination confirmed the gauze retention and fibrous tissue wrap， with foreign body granuloma**\n\n【40】**Discussion**\n\n【41】**Gossypiboma developed after cesarean section is the most common one among all gossypibomas \\[1，2\\]， however， its diagnosis remains challenging and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a mass or neoplasm， abscess， lymphocele， or nonspecific**\n\n【42】**imaging findings in a postoperative patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-6\\]</u>.**\n\n【43】**lmagingis the mostefficientdiagnosticapproachfor gossypiboma after cesarean section.

Besides， based on the temporal development and location of gossypiboma， varied imaging features such as cyst， solid soft tissue， or well circumscribed capsulated mass， can be observed. However， these features were not closely related with the disease duration， making the diagnosis of gossypiboma after cesarean section still a clinical challenge.

It has important clinical significance. There are many causes of thrombocytopenia. Abnormal distribution of platelets in spleen and decreased production of thrombopoietin are the main mechanisms. Splenectomy is an effective treatment for these patients. However，recurrent thrombocytopenia after splenectomy is very rare.**\n\n【12】**Case Summary： We report a case of a 59-year-old female patient. The patient had a history of autoimmune cirrhosis for more than 10 years. Splenectomy was performed for thrombocytopenia. But thrombocytopenia recurred about two weeks after splenectomy. After we ruled out the accessory spleen as a possible cause，the platelet count of the patient returned to normal after treatment with anti-infection，hormone， thrombopoietin and platelet transfusion.**\n\n【13】**Conclusion：Forpatientsaftersplenectomy，we shouldbevigilantagainstrecurrentthrombocytopenia caused by infection， accessory spleen， immunity，drugs and other related reasons.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Splenectomy； Thrombocytopenia； Accessory spleen； Immune； Infection； Drugs**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**As blood cellsdirectly involved in clot formationand inflammatory regulation，thrombocytopenia is very common in clinical practice， especially in severe patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Subsequently， the patient developed systemic petechia and nosebleed.**\n\n【22】**History of past illness**\n\n【23】**The patient had a history of decompensated autoimmune cirrhosis and had been treated in our hospital for a long time.**\n\n【24】**Due to hypersplenism and thrombocytopenia， splenectomy was performed under general anesthesia 17 days ago. Heparin was used for 3 days after the operation， and the patient was discharged 2 weeks later. The platelet count at discharge was within the normal range (293×10/L).**\n\n【25】**Personal and family history**\n\n【26】**The patient's family had no previous noteworthy medical history.**\n\n【27】**Physical examination**\n\n【28】**Acute face，listless spirit， petechia scattered all over the body， gingival and nasal bleeding**\n\n【29】**Laboratory examination**\n\n【30】**PLT： 1× 10/L； Biochemical and hematologic test results such as tumor markers， electrolyte levels and liver function revealed no abnormalities.**\n\n【31】**Imaging examination**\n\n【32】**CT of head and chest showed no abnormality.

Finally， methylprednisolone was maintained at 4 mg q.o.d for along time.**\n\n【37】**Outcome and follow-up**\n\n【38】**After 3 days of treatment， the patient's platelet began to increase， and the whole body petechia， epistaxis and gingival bleeding disappeared 9 days later. After 13 days， the platelet count was in the normal range. Thereafter， platelet count fluctuated slightly and remained at (200~350)×10/L during 6 months of follow-up (Figure1**\n\n【39】**Discussion**\n\n【40】**Spleen plays an important role in thrombocytopenia as the site of platelet destruction and autoantibody produc Ption. Splenectomy has been effective in the treatment of thrombocytopenia for a long time通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Thrombocytopenia is a common complication after splenectomy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， and postoperative recurrent thrombocytopenia is rarely reported. There are three main causes of thrombocytopenia： Insufficient platelet formation， excessive platelet destruction and abnormal platelet distribution.**\n\n【41】**AlShammari et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported that accessory spleen may be the cause of recurrent thrombocytopenia after splenectomy. For the generation of accessory spleen， it is generally recommended that**\n\n【42】**surgical resection of accessory spleen after imaging diagnosis is the ideal treatment \\[9，10\\]. In view of this possibility， we improved the abdominal CT after admission to exclude the possibility of accessory spleen. Drugs， etc.， reduce platelet production or destroy too much through immune mechanisms or toxic effects are also a possible reason. As a commonly used drug for preventing thrombosis after splenectomy， heparin is often required to be vigilant about causing thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Currently， antibiotic drugs reported to cause thrombocytopenia include vancomycin， rifampicin linezolid， etc. \\[12，13\\]， but no cephalosporin drugs have been reported to cause thrombocytopenia. For drug-induced thrombocytopenia， it is difficult to complete or diagnose clinically due to the lack of detection reagents and the long detection time. The effective treatment for thrombocytopenia caused by suspected drugs is to stop the suspected drugs， after which the platelet count can begin to recover \\[12，14\\]. Platelets can be transfused in the case of severe bleeding， and others such as hormones， immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis can also be used when necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In this case， the patient had been treated with heparin for 3 days after surgery and was discharged two week after surgery with a platelet count of 293 ×10/L. Fever occurred on the 3rd day after discharge， that is， the 17h day after surgery. After taking cephalosporin orally for once， fever was reduced， followed by petechia ecchymosis of the whole body (the 204 day after surgery). Platelet count decreased to 1×10/L on admission， and no change occurred in platelet count monitoring for 2 consecutive days. Fever may be a clinical manifestation of thrombocytopenia， and the patient developed fever on day 17 after discontinuing heparin， beyond the time window (5 to 14 days) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>， for thrombocytopenia due to heparin exposure. The patient developed systemic petechia ecchymosis on the 4h day after using cephalosporins， which cannot be ruled out as drug-induced thrombocytopenia. However， the patient did not have platelet recovery after discontinuing the suspected drugs， which is not consistent with the situation of drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In addition， since the patient had autoimmune cirrhosis， we cannot rule out thrombocytopenia due to immune factors. At present， there is no clear \"gold standard\" for the diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia， which is mostly based on clinical diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Bone marrow evaluation is not indicated unless patients have additional unexplained cytopenia， a significant family history of thrombocytopenia or myeloid malignancies， or poor response to typical initial treatment options (corticosteroids，IVIG， anti-D immune globulin) \\[17，18\\]. In this case， the platelet count was elevated after a combination of hormones， immunoglobulin， and thrombopoietin. Finally， by adjusting the dose of hormone， platelet can be maintained in the normal range for a long time. Therefore， immunity may be responsible for recurrent thrombocytopenia in this patient.**\n\n【43】**Conclusion**\n\n【44】**Recurrent thrombocytopenia after splenectomyi： 2 rare condition in clinic， but we should still be vigilantagainst postoperative thrombocytopenia caused by infection， accessory spleen， immunity， drugs and other related reasons.

It can be associated with nasal obstruction and regional lymph node involvement. Histologic presentation may mimic classic Hodgkin lymphoma when large， atypical cells with irregular nuclear contours， prominent nucleoli， and bi-/multi-nucleation resembling Reed-Sternberg cells are present in conjunction with positive CD30 immunohistochemical stain. Although reduced expression of B cell markers such as PAX5 is typical in classic Hodgkin lymphoma， a completely negative stain， as in our patient， is rare. This discrepancy along with the clinical presentation of predominant lymph node enlargement significantly contributed to the initial erroneous diagnosis of classic Hodgkin lymphoma.**\n\n【14】**Case Report： Herein we describe a case of a 33-year-old Hispanic male with newly diagnosed Extranodal Natural Killer-/T-Cell Lymphoma (ENTKL)， nasal type. His initial diagnosis of classic Hodgkin lymphoma rendered on a cervical lymph node biopsy was amended upon subsequent discovery of classic diagnostic findings ofENTKL on microscopic evaluation of specimens excised to treat nasal obstruction interfering with chemotherapy.**\n\n【15】**Conclusion： This case emphasizes the need to further investigate medical history and evaluate symptoms on a multi systemic level when eliciting differential diagnoses in suspected lymphoma patients. A more comprehensive approach can increase diagnostic accuracy when deceiving histologic findings are present. Diagnostic accuracy is essential for treatment effectiveness and for its potential to improve disease progression and patient outcomes.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Extranodal natural killer-/t-cell lymphoma； Nasal type； Classic Hodgkin lymphoma； PAX5**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Extranodal Natural Killer/T-Cell Lymphoma (ENTKL) can present in the upper aerodigestive tract with patients suffering from obstruction， epistaxis， and midline destructive lesions. Although regional lymph node involvement is not uncommon， primary involvement oflymph nodes is rare and usuallylacks angiodestruction and necrosis. The absence of these classically diagnostic findings can present a challenge when neoplastic lymphocytes with deceiving morphology are present. Herein we describe a case of a 33-year-old Hispanic male who presented with a neck mass. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma was initially rendered on a cervical lymph node biopsy， and the patient was treated with systemic chemotherapy. Two months later， the patient underwent septoplasty with turbinate reduction for nasal obstruction and inflammation， which interfered with corona virus testing necessary for hospital admission prior to cancer treatment. Subsequent evaluation of resected surgical specimens revealed a diagnosis of extranodal natural killer/T-celllymphoma， nasal type**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**_cited._**\n\n【21】**The patient is a 33-year-old Hispanic male who presented to otolaryngology with a large， progressively enlarging left neck mass underneath the sternocleidomastoid. The patient first noticed the mass one year prior. Review of systems was positive for epistaxis and nasal congestion but negative for fever， chills， sweats， or weight loss. Pertinent physical exam findings included a large conglomeration of the left supraclavicular and parotid lymph nodes， in addition to shotty right cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. There was no inguinal adenopathy. The patient reported a**\n\n【22】Figure 1： Hematoxylin and eosin stain， 40x.

Computed tomography of the neck was significant for extensive left cervical lymphadenopathy.**\n\n【25】**The patient subsequently underwent incisional cervical lymph node biopsy， but the extensive mass was not completely excised due to significant potential for neurovascular complication. Lymphoma workup， including flow cytometry， was initiated. Tissue sections showed a lymph node effaced by a diffuse proliferation of many histiocytes and small lymphocytes with intermixed plasma cells and rare granulocytic cells. Scattered large， atypical lymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours， prominent eosinophilic nucleoli， andoccasional bi-/multi-nucleation resembling Reed-Sternberg cells were present . No nodules or bands of collagen fibrosis were seen but mummified cells and a pseudo granulomatous appearance were noted. Giemsa and acid fast bacilli special stains were negative for fungal or mycobacterial organisms， respectively. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for CD30  and MUM-1 but negative stains for PAX5 ， CD20， CD79a and CD15. In situ hybridization results were positive for Epstein-Barr virus. Flow cytometric analysis showed no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or phenotypically abnormal T-cell population. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma， mixed cellularity type was diagnosed and treatment with AAVD (brentuximab vedotin，doxorubicin， vinblastine，dacarbazine) was initiated.

Resected specimens oftheleft nasal septum，inferiorturbinateandethmoid sinus were negative for acid fast bacilli and fungal organisms. Examination ofhematoxylin and eosin stain morphology demonstrated respiratory epithelium with extensive necrosis and ulceration accompanied by a diffuse， vaguely nodular and angiocentric atypicallymphoid infiltrate with evidence of angioinvasion and angiodestruction . The mucosal glands appeared to have evidence of clear-cell change. The atypical infiltrate was composed of a mixture of predominantly small and medium-sized atypical lymphocytes and a few intermixed larger cells. No Reed-Sternberg or Hodgkin-like cells were identified， and there was no significant increase in eosinophils. The atypical cells had irregular nuclear contours， dispersed to vesicular chromatin， predominantly inconspicuous but variably prominent nucleoli and a moderate amount of clear cytoplasm. A few scattered mitotic figures were seen. Interestingly， no large CD30+ Reed-Sternberg-like cells were present.**\n\n【31】**Following microscopicexamination， immunohistochemical stains were performed to evaluate the lymphoid infiltrate more accurately. Large， atypical lymphocytes were positive for CD2 (Figure**\n\n【32】**Figure 5： CD2 lmmunohistochemical stain， 20x.

Possible staining for CD3 and CD5 was present but difficult to differentiate from background normal T cells. Epstein Barr virus chromogenic in situ hybridization was notably positive. Although the presence of possible CD3 and CD5 expression raised the possibility of a cytotoxic T-cell lineage， a natural killer cell lineage was favored due to negative T-cell clonality testing.**\n\n【35】**The initial lymph node specimen was subsequently re-evaluated with a panel of natural killer and T-cell Immunohistochemistry markers， including CD2  and results showed a similar phenotype to the paranasal specimens. The morphologic and immunophenotypic findings supported the diagnosis of extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma， nasal type. Therefore， the patient’s diagnosis was subsequently amended to extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma and treatment with P-GELOX (pegaspargase， gemcitabine and oxaliplatin) was initiated.**\n\n【36】**Six months later， follow-up PET scan status-post treatment showed recurrent left cervical lymphadenopathy， enlargement of the porta hepatis lymph nodes， and positivity in the right proximal femur. The patient was not a candidate for transplant and palliative radiation therapy to the right femur was recommended to minimize fracture risk while systemic therapy options were determined.**\n\n【37】**Discussion**\n\n【38】**The misleading finding， which prompted the initial diagnosis of classic Hodgkin lymphoma in the initial cervical lymph node biopsy，**\n\n【39】**was the presence of scattered large， CD30-positive， Reed-Sternberg like atypicallymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours， prominent eosinophilic nucleoli， and occasional bi-/multi-nucleation. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma is a monoclonal B cell lymphoid neoplasm composed of Hodgkin large cells with single nuclei and prominent nucleoli) and Reed-Sternberg (large cells with binucleated and very prominent nucleoli) lymphocytes in a variable inflammatory background.**\n\n【40】**The majority of classic Hodgkin lymphoma cases show positivity for CD30 and reduced expression of most B-cell antigens such as CD20， CD79a and PAX5 in atypical lymphocytes. In contrast， immunohistochemical evaluation of this patient’s cervical lymph node was positive for CD30 but completely negative for CD20，CD79a， and PAX5 in atypical lymphocytes. Complete absence of PAX5 in Hodgkin cells is rare； however， cases have been documented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This fact， combined with the misleading Hodgkin-like morphology of neoplastic cells， were the key components that supported the erroneous initial diagnosis of classic Hodgkin lymphoma. Although Epstein-Barr virus infection is present in up to 40% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， it is of minimal diagnostic value due to presence in multiple different etiologies. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma typicaly presents in the cervical or mediastinal lymph nodes and has a favorable prognosis in early-stage disease.**\n\n【41】**Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma is a predominantly extranodal lymphoma of either natural killer or T-cell lineage. Its common location in the paranasal sinuses prompted further workup as a potential diagnosis in this case. Additional immunohistochemical stains of both the original lymph node and paranasal sections supported the amended diagnosis by demonstrating positivity for CD2 and CD56 in large， atypical cells. Although CD30 is positive in50% to 70% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， the patient's paranasal resection specimens lacked the large CD30+ Hodgkin-like cells. This interesting finding was possibly attributed to recentlyadministered brentuximab vedotin therapy for the initial diagnosis of classic Hodgkin lymphoma. Classic features of extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma include Epstein-Barr virus infection， necrosis， cytotoxic immunophenotype and angioinvasion. Its cytological presentation is very broad with cells often having irregularly folded nuclei that may be elongated. Chromatin is granular and large cells may have vesicular nuclei. There is moderate pale to clear cytoplasm and mitotic figures are easily found. A heavy admixture of small lymphocytes，plasma cells， histiocytes and eosinophils can mimic an inflammatory process. Extensive pseudoepitheliomatoushyperplasia offtthe overlying epithelium can result in mass formation， as evidenced in this patient’s nasal obstruction. Prognosis is historically poor； although， outcomes have improved with intense chemotherapy and radiotherapy.**\n\n【42】**The Prognostic Index of Natural Killer Lymphoma may be useful to predict survival in patients treated with non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy. It was developed via a retrospective analysis of 527patients and identified adverse prognostic factors including age >60years， stage III or IV disease， distant lymph node involvement，non-nasal type disease， and detection of Epstein Barr virus via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. It has been argued that using the Ann Arbor lymphoma staging system is in effective for this diagnosis due to consistently poor survival in patients classified as early stage and studies demonstrating worse outcomes for extranasal tumors \\[5，6\\]. As a response， a proposal for a new staging system that classifies tumors via their proximity to the nasal cavity and nasopharynx was created by the Chinese Southwest Oncology Group**\n\n【43】**and Asia Lymphoma Study Group (CA system) and published in20207.**\n\n【44】**The atypical presentation of this case emphasizes the need to further investigate medical history and symptoms on a multisystemic level when eliciting differential diagnoses in suspected lymphoma patients. It demonstrates the responsibility for pathologists to conduct additional comprehensive workup of seemingly unrelated anatomic sites when deceiving histologic findings are present and ancillary studies are inconclusive. The importance for oncologists and surgeons to continuously monitor for treatment effectiveness and residual disease is also represented. These tasks are essentialto increase the diagnostic accuracy necessary for optimal patient outcomes， particularly when multiple etiologies are within consideration.**\n\n【45】**1\\.

It has now spread all over the world and causes presentations of life-threatening diseases. The widespread use of steroids and antibiotics， especially in those with immunocompromised and diabetic states， has led to an increase in new or existing fungal diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Rhino-Orbital-Cerebral Mucormycosis(ROCM) caused by angio-invasive saprophytic organisms， a class of phycomycetes， is additional threat as opportunistic fungi and the COVID-19 disease spectrum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Early detection and intervention are necessary to prevent disease transmission and death. There are several reports on the role of magnetic resonance imaging in Coronavirus-2019 Associated Rhino-Orbital-Cerebral Mucormycosis (CA-ROCM) with different clinical backgrounds \\[4，5\\]. For successful treatment， early diagnosis and elucidation of key structures should be diligently investigated by combined Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) gadolinium contrast， which plays an important role in detecting nasal， orbital， and intracranial extension. In this study， we report the imaging findings of 17 patients with post-COVID-19 condition， who were treated with steroids， Remdesivir or oxygen， have been confirmed as ROCM with KOH mount or other histopathological investigations. Final observations are based on the total amount recovered after amphotericin B administration followed by FESS.**\n\n【19】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【20】**Patient population**\n\n【21】**In a prospective case study， a series of 17 patients with past history of COVID-19 and suspected to have ROCM underwent combined CT and contrast enhanced MRI and confirmed with KOH mount or histopathological investigations during March-May 2021. Patients with reduced Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)， raised creatinine values (more than 2 mg/dL) and raised BUN (Blood urea nitrogen) levels (more than 30 mg/dL)and MRI incompatible metallic implants were not included in this study.**\n\n【22】**Data acquisition**\n\n【23】**All patients underwent CT imaging using a Siemens Emoticon 16slice multi-detector scanner with image reconstruction in soft-tissue and bone windows. All patients underwent gadolinium contrast enhanced MR imaging using a Philips 1.5 T machine. Unenhanced axial and coronal T1， T2， Short Tau Inversion Recovery (STIR) as well as sagittal T2 images and Diffusion-Weighted Images (DWI) were obtained. Contrast enhanced sequences such as T1 multiplanar DIXON was obtained. Ethical and informed consents were not required as the images were anonymous.**\n\n【24】**Results**\n\n【25】**In this retrospective survey of 17 patients aged 35 to 65 years，76.47% with men (n=13) were more affected than women (n=4) with 23.529%. Patients with diabetes (n=14) were 82.23% and those without diabetes (n=1) were 5.88%. Symptoms of ROCM after COVID19 illness ranged from 1 to 3 months. Steroids were given in76.47%(n=13) of cases， and (n=4) 23.529% were given Remdesivir.64.705% of patients (n=11) required oxygen for their COVID-19disease. CT and MRI of 17 patients observed bilateral paranasal sinus involvement (100%). The predominant involvement of the ethmoid sinuses was in 76.47% (n=13) and the maxillary sinuses 94.11%(n=16). CT Plain study shows hypodense diffuse mucosal thickening involving the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavities along the turbinates with combined bony erosions involving the medial wall of the orbit， the ethmoid trabeculae and the bony nasal septum .**\n\n【26】**Disease extension into orbit was observed (n=10) with 58.82% of the right side (n=1) 5.88% and the left side (n=9) 52.94%.

Meningeal enhancement in the basi-frontal and frontotemporal regions is an indicator of the parenchymal expansion of the brain as illustrated in Figure 6. The asymmetric bulge may extend to the cavernous sinus， as shown in Figure 7. Extension to the pterygopalatine or sphenopalatine fossa occurs from the nasal cavity or orbits， as seen in Figure 8 as variable enhancing signals. As the disease progresses intracranially， it can lead to cerebritis and cerebral abscess formation，which appears as a ring enhancing lesion as shown in Figure 9.**\n\n【42】**Discussion**\n\n【43】**FungibelongtomycologysubgroupCof microbiology. Morphologically fungi canbe yeasts， moulds and dimorphic fungithat exist in both mould and yeast form. Candida and Aspergillus species are most commonly encountered fungal species in medical practice通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Fungi， which were rarely encountered with invasive potential， belong to Zygomycota order (Mucor， Rhizopus， Apophysomyces， Rhizomucor species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Immunocompromised individuals are the most susceptible group for these fungi， for example Mucormycosis which belong to the group of moulds called Mucormycetes affecting mostly the sinuses or thelungs after inhaling fungal spores in air. Types include Rhinocerebral (sinus and brain) mucormycosis， Pulmonary(lung) mucormycosis， gastrointestinal mucormycosis， Cutaneous(skin) mucormycosis， and disseminated mucormycosis. There is a wide variety of spectrum of fungal Paranasal sinuses infections. Hora et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> described two broad categories. These were invasive or non-invasive， based on potential of fungal hypha to invade the tissues through the epithelium (invasive) in comparison to the infection being limited to the superficial epithelium (non-invasive) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-9\\]</u>. Invasive fungal sinusitis is further divided into acute and chronic invasive Fungal Rhinosinusitis (FRS) and chronic granulomatous invasive fungal rhinosinusitis. Non-invasive fungal sinusitis was further divided into saprophytic fungal infestation， fungal ball and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. Acute Invasive Fungal Rhinosinusitis(AIFR) is important as it shows aggressive course with high mortality rates (around 50% but can be as much as 80%)\\[10，11\\].AIFRprimarily invades neural and vascular structures (rather than mere mucosal colonization) in comparison to other non-invasive forms. Fungal spores after inhalation (due to poor immunological response) grows on the mucosal lining and invades adjacent neurovascular structures\\[12，13\\]. Further， it causes thrombosis with local or distant ischemia and necrosis. Commonly， it spreads outside the infected sinus cavity into surrounding tissues and bone. Causative organisms of AIFR include： Aspergillus species and Zygomycetes order. AIFR was most**\n\n【44】**commonly observed in immunocompromised patients， patients with hematological malignancies， those who have undergone bone marrow or solid organ transplantation，people with Diabetes Mellitus(DM) and in chemotherapy induced neutropenia \\[14，15\\].**\n\n【45】**India has highest prevalence rates of type 2 DM (8.9% of adults). Poorly controlled diabetic patients were frequently associated with diabetic ketoacidosis. Zygomyecetes order was isolated in this subgroup of patients due to their affinity for acidotic environments with high glucose concentrations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Although neutropenia， hematological malignancies， HIV/AIDS show strong association with AIFR，and most ofthem are associated with hematological malignancy\\[16，17\\]. Aspergillus species has been isolated in this subgroup and also having high iron levels， after receiving deferoxamine for iron chelation or in renal failure. The mechanism behind this was that some fungi (Rhizopus) can utilize deferoxamine for their growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. AIFR in post COVID-19 patients appear to be multifactorial which includes uncontrolled DM (especially with diabetic ketoacidosis)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>， immunosuppressive therapy and immune alterations by COVID-19infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Patients with COVID-19 infection have increased production of cytokines and cell mediated immunity with reduced cluster of differentiation (CD4+T) and CD8+ T cell counts resulting in increased susceptibility to fungal infections \\[20，21\\]. Opportunistic fungal infections also occur with steroid overuse in treatment of COVID-19 which lowers overall immunity and increases blood sugar levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Patients with AIFR can present with paranasal sinusitis， facial edema and erythema， proptosis， headaches， double/loss of vision and other neurological deficit (brain parenchymal or meningeal involvement). Nerve deficits (CN III， IV and VI) can indicate the involvement of cavernous sinus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Mehta and Pande et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u> reported a case study of a patient with COVID-19 infection， during the course of the treatment， developed rhino-orbital mucormycosis. Further， these authors 23 confirmed soft tissue swelling in the right preseptal， malar， and premaxillary and retrobulbar regions with paranasal sinusitis by MRI of brain， orbits and paranasal sinusitis. They confirmed mucormycosis by the presence of fungal hypha which lines with the present study. Blood stream Candida infections were reported amongst the COVID-19 patients in New Delhi， India通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. White et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> have reported invasive fungal infection that had the highest mortality rate amongst COVID-19 patients. Steroid therapy and chronic respiratory infections could be the reasons found for high risk of invasive fungal diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Similar reports were also observed in Pakistan and Italy \\[26，27\\]. It was reported that an MRI of the brain was shown to contain multiple areas of infarction and ischemia in a case of invasive fungal disease in a female having diabetic ketosis with COVID-19 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Mucor was identified from nasal biopsy. Early identification of fungal infections may reduce severity of the disease. Confirmative diagnosis carried by histopathological evidence of fungal elements. KOH of the soft tissue also aids in diagnosis.**\n\n【46】**Conclusion**\n\n【47】**The combined use of CT and MRI imaging illustrates unique findings， with bone erosions and mucosal thickening of the paranasal sinuses with invasion into the orbits， cavernous sinus and meningeal structures. Early diagnosis and identification of the disease can help in early interventions and a good prognosis plays an important role in the outcome.**\n\n【48】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【49】**The authors acknowledge S.

With the progression of pregnancy， the embryo grows deeper and wider around the scar which can cause placenta implantation and even uterine rupture. In early pregnancy， CSP often shows no symptoms or only little vaginal bleeding， and some patients may ignore it. Routine ultrasound examination is most commonly performed for diagnosis of CSP， but when the pregnant tissues with blood clots locate in the whole uterine cavity it is less accurate. Especially in the second trimester， with the growing of pregnant tissue and blood clot occupying nearly the whole uterine cavity inclusive of the lower segment of the uterus， it is difficult for ultrasound or even MRI examination to distinguish it.**\n\n【14】**Case Report： We report a case of a second trimester II type CSP， where the patient， G4P2，had two previous cesareans and two artificial aspiration abortions. The patient presented to our hospital when she was 12+1/7 weeks pregnant with slight vaginal bleeding and occasional mild abdominal pain. Missed abortion was diagnosed because ultrasound examination shows the pregnant sac in the uterine cavity without embryo. Medical abortion was performed. After 3 days， curettage under ultrasound monitoring was performed for incomplete abortion with pregnant tissue residue. During the operation， the ultrasound monitoring revealed CSP with placenta implantation and massive vaginal bleeding occurred. When the uterine contraction drugs failed to stop the bleeding， the laparotomy was performed.**\n\n【15】**Conclusion： CSP is dangerous for patients and difficult to treat especially when the clinician cannot find it in time. Sometime the symptom is not very severe just with little vaginal bleeding and occasional mild abdominal pain. But with the progression of pregnancy especially in II CSP， it will rupture or implant deeply in the uterine muscle even to bladder. So， with many cesareans and curettages， patients must be informed of the danger of pregnancy and receive medical examination and treatment in time. For clinicians we must be vigilant of the CSP for every patient with history of cesarean， we can choice MRI examination when necessary.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Cesarean scar pregnancy； Second trimester； Placenta implantation； Hysterectomy； Massive bleeding**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**With the increased incidence of cesarean deliveries， the incidence of Cesarean Scar Pregnancy(CSP) also increased and gradually attracted clinical attentions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However， the diagnosis and treatment guidelines in the first， second，and thirdtrimesters of CSP still need a worldwide consensus. At present， most studies are about first trimester CSP. CSP can be classified to type I and II 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Type I is characterized by trophoblast implantation that is shallow in the cesarean scar but grows toward the uterine cavity. Type II is characterized by deep infiltration of pregnant tissue in the scar growing toward the uterine muscle， serosal surface， and even penetrating the bladder. A previous study of326 patients with type I CSP showed that the cure rate of type I CSP can reach 98.8% with Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE) combined with suction and 100% with local lauromacrogol injection with suction aspiration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However， uterine rupture has also been reported， and hysterectomy is performed occasionally in type I CSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Compared with the first trimester type I CSP， the second trimester type II CSP is less studied. The longer the pregnancy in CSP， the higher the risk in both CSP types. A uterine rupture occurred in 2.5% of patients in CSP of ≤ 9 weeks and in**\n\n【19】**7.5% of patients in CSP of >9 weeks. Emergency hysterectomy was performed in 3.7% of patients in CSP of s 9 weeks and in 16.3% of patients in CSP of >9 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The treatment of second trimester CSP is a challenge for clinicians because it can progress to massive bleeding， which requires hysterectomy. We report a case of a patient with second trimester type II CSP who underwent a transabdominal hysterectomy. Histopathological examination showedpregnant tissue infiltrating the cesarean scar and nearly penetrating the whole wall of the lower segment of the uterus.**\n\n【20】**Case Presentation**\n\n【21】**We report the case of a 37-year-old woman， G4P2， with two previous cesarean sections each 13 and 11 years ago， two artificial suction abortions each in 12 and 5 years ago. The menstrual cycle of the patient was 25 to 27 days，and the menstrual period was 4 to 5 days without dysmenorrhea or vaginal spotting. The patient presented to our hospital for amenorrhea of 12+1 weeks with the confirmation of pregnancy by positive urine pregnancy test and ultrasonic examination 1 day ago in another hospital. During the amenorrhea two intermittent little vaginal bleeding events occurred， which the patient considered as abnormal menstruation； therefore， she did not go to the hospital. However， she had transient abdominal pain 2 days before going to hospital， and the pain subsided spontaneously. After hospitalization， an ultrasound examination revealed a gestational sac mass of 83 mm x59 mmx53 mm in the uterine cavity and a blended echo block of 49 mm x45 mmx49 mm located in the sac mass. The patient was diagnosed with missed abortion， and medical abortion was performed with mifepristone and misoprostol. An antibiotic drug was used for infection because of the high leukocyte count(14.96×10) and CRP levels (38.26 mg/L)， with a low fever of 37.3℃2 days before undergoing an abortion.**\n\n【22】**During the administration of mifepristone and misoprostol， the patient had no abdominal pain and only experienced slight vaginal bleeding. Three days after the medical abortion， an ultrasound revealed a lot of residual pregnant tissues in the uterine cavity， and curettage monitored by ultrasound was performed after obtaining the consent of the patient. During curettage， the bleeding was massive and some pregnant tissue residue could not be scraped out， ultrasound examination showed some pregnant residue implanting in the scar of the cesarean which means the CSP. Oxytocin was iniected in the cervix combined with an intravenous iniection. After the cervical injection ofergonovine， the bleeding gradually decreased.**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Rupture of the right wall in the lower segment of the uterus during the operation.**\n\n【24】**Figure 2： The whole uterus with cesarean scar pregnancy in the anterior wall and the ruptured right wall in the lower segment of the uterus.**\n\n【25】**Figure 3： Normal cervix with a length of 2.5 cm.**\n\n【26】**Figure 4： The resection of the uterus with pregnant tissue implanted in the whole layer of the lower uterine wall， blood clots in the lower segment cavity， normal uterine body， and empty uterine cavity.**\n\n【27】**The patient was in the operation observation room， and the bleeding was evaluated by weighing. After 1 h and 30 min， the total blood volume reached approximately 1，500 mL，and the bleeding continued profusely and could not be stopped by uterine contraction drugs. The patient and her husband were informed of the risk of CSP， the need for signed consent for exploratory laparotomy and a high possibility of hysterectomy. The operation was performed immediately when blood loss reached approximately 2，000 mL. During the operation， we found the enlargement of the lower segment of the uterus， which was even bigger than the uterine body， the serosal surface of the anterior wall was swollen and purple-blue， and the right wall of the**\n\n【28】**lower segment ruptured with implantation by the pregnant tissue. The situation immediately was informed to the husband and the husband chose hysterectomy and provided signed consent for the operation. Hysterectomy was performed，and the whole uterus was resected . When resecting the uterine specimen， we found that the anterior lower segment was infiltrated by pregnant tissue with a thin serosal layer， and the whole right wall of the lower segment was penetrated by pregnant tissue while the uterine cavity was normal . One day after the surgery， a blood routine examination showed that the patient's hemoglobin levels were only43 g/L； therefore， the patient was transfused with four units of red blood cell suspension. Hemoglobin levels elevated to 71 g/L 2 days after the surgery. Histological examination showed that the decidual tissue and villi were located in the anterior lower segment of the uterus and infiltrated the whole layer of the right wall. The patient recovered and was discharged 4 days after the surgery.**\n\n【29】**Discussion**\n\n【30】**In our case， the villus and decidua infiltrated the whole layer and penetrated the right wall of the lower segment due to the rupture of the uterus， while the serosal layer of the anterior cesarean scar was intact. The rupture site was not in the cesarean scar but in the lateral lower segment， the reason may be that the niche of the cesarean scar extended to the right wall of the lower segment， the residual muscular layer in this position is the thinnest and is more likely to be implanted and penetrated. Another reason is that there may be another severe scar defect located in the right wall， with a bigger range and more complicated morphology than the anterior one. The defect of the endometrium-myometrial interface led to failed normal decidualization and enabled deep trophoblast infiltration. The depth of the penetration correlated with the extent of the damage. The more cesareans and gynecological surgeries a patient undergo， the more complicated of the scar defect in morphology and the higher the risk for placenta increta. According to one study composed of 380，775deliveries， the relative risk for abnormal placental implantation was1.5， 2.7， and 5.1 in one gynecological procedure， two procedures， and three or more procedures， respectively \\[6，7\\]. Because this patient had two cesareans and two dilations and curettages， which can cause two cesarean scars， the relative risk for placenta increta was high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. One study found that cesarean can also contribute to the posterior placenta increta even without scar defect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Therefore， lateral placental implantation may also be possible even without obvious scar defect because some microstructure damages， such as fibrinoid depositions， come from multiple intrauterine operations between the utero-placentalinterface， which also can cause placenta implantation10\\]. One study showed that women who underwent cesarean delivery had a higher ratio of bacterial colonies (89.6%) in the cervical canal compared with those who did not undergo cesarean delivery(49.7%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Therefore， the patient may have had infection in the lower segment， which caused a low-degree fever and elevated serum infection markers. Whether this type of infection is associated with placenta accrete remains tobe studied. On the first visittothehospital， the patient had been pregnant for 12+1 weeks. When CSP progresses to a higher gestational age， the risk of placenta implantation， life-threatening bleeding， uterine rupture， andhysterectomy also increases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. CSP evolves to placenta implantation when it cannot be treated during the first trimester 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The treatment for CSP includes systemic or local injection of Methotrexate (MTX)， dilation and curettage， and Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE) alone or combined. One meta-analysis found that when management for CSP**\n\n【31】**was performed， 63% of patients required hysterectomy because of placental implantation or second trimester uterine rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The patient had almost rupture of the right wall in the lower segment of the uterus， which was dangerous. At present， successful treatments for second trimester type II CSP have not reached a worldwide consensus， and relative studies also are limited. To preserve fertility， the treatments are more complicated，and the help of an experienced Multiple Disciplinary Team (MDT) and combined methods are necessary \\[15，16\\]. The early management of CSP is important to avoid further hysterectomy due to life-threatening bleeding during the second trimester \\[17，18\\]. The patient visited the hospital too late and missed the optimal opportunity for diagnosis and treatment. The patient was not diagnosed with CSP and placenta accreta in the first ultrasound examination. Because the negative image results may be a likelihood of approximately 20% for placenta implantation both in the ultrasound and MRI examinations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>； therefore， we should be alert about the high risks of CSP with placenta implantation in cases of multiple cesarean deliveries， dilation and curettages， and vaginal bleeding with amenorrhea. MRI examination is preferred for patients who are at a high risk because MRI has a higher diagnosis value in sensitivity， specificity， and Area Under Curve (AUC) than an ultrasound examination according to one study of 948 patients with CSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. However， MRI is expensive and the examination results cannot be obtained simultaneously； meanwhile， transvaginal three-dimensional ultrasound combined with color Doppler also has more accurate diagnostic performance than only three-dimensional ultrasound in patients with CSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. These combinations of ultrasound examinations are another viable option.**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**Early diagnosis with more accurate inspections and early treatment are equally important in preserving fertility and avoiding life-threatening bleeding in CSP. Women with high risks for CSP， such as those who have undergone multiple prior cesarean sections and gynecological procedures， must be vigilant of amenorrhea and abnormal vaginal bleeding.**\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Genetic aberrations of the tumor suppressor gene VHL cause it. Based on the reports in VHL， the most common initial presentation tumors are hemangioblastoma in the CNS and retina. In addition， patients can be present with signs and symptoms of other visceral organ involvement， such as the CNS，adrenal gland， the kidney， pancreas tumor and others.**\n\n【12】**Here we report a 34 years old woman presented with signs and symptoms of ICSOL secon dary to hemangioblastoma， confirmed after the patient’s surgery. After years of the smooth postoperative period， she developed a carcinoid tumor at the head of the pancreas and left supra renal mass， for which she was operated and improved. Subsequent follow up detected recurrence and proper Whipple surgery was done and confirmed the diagnosis of VHL.**\n\n【13】**From this case report easily can observe， regular and proper follow up lead early recognition and on-time appropriate treatment remain the mainstay of management in this group of patients.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease； Hemangioblastoma； Multiorgan involvement**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Von Hippel-Lindau(VHL)syndrome is an autosomal dominant，multi-organ， familial neoplastic syndrome caused by genetic aberrations of the tumor suppressor gene VHL located on chromosome通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. The prevalence of VHL is estimated to be between 1： 35，000 to 1： 40，000. The mutation of the VHL gene leads to develop benign and malignant tumors of several visceral organs like the central nervous system， kidneys， pancreas， adrenal， and reproductive organs. The most common VHL associated tumors are hemangioblastomas involving the brain， spinal cord， and retina； clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)； pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas of the adrenal gland and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. The current case report is a young woman with VHL disease involving hemangioblastoma of the posterior fossa followed by visceral multi-organ involvement.**\n\n【17】**Here I am presenting a 34-year-old woman， a mother of two presented with a history of progressive global headache followed by nausea and vomiting of months duration. The intensity of the headache has increased， and it started to have an imbalance， followed by blurring of vision on and off， vertigo and ataxia of one week duration. She gave a history of long-standing dyspepsia and abdominal discomfort. After having an MRI of the brain， hemangioblastoma in the posterior fossa of the brain was diagnosed， and surgery was performed  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【18】**After eleven months of a smooth postoperative period， she started to experience dyspepsia， abdominal discomfort on the right side， anorexia， and weight loss.

She has been referred abroad (India)， where the Whipple procedure was done. Histopathology confirmed pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm PT2N1； all margins are negative one out of 12LN+ve. She had regular follow-ups for almost two years， her blood pressure was well controlled， and after a while， she started to have anorexia， abdominal discomfort， itching sensation all over the body，and right-side abdominal swelling. On physical examination，poorly controlled hypertension(160/112mmHg) and right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness were observed.

These are benign tumors. Some hemangioblastomas remain unchanged in size over several years，and if they do not cause symptoms， their surgical removal may not be necessary. The symptoms of hemangioblastoma are usually caused**\n\n【26】**by the expansion of tumors in the intracranial space and spinal cord. Asymptomatic small tumors are carefully watched until the onset of symptoms. Surgical resection is the best treatment modality for this tumor； in cases of enormous tumor burden where surgical resection is not possible， gamma knife surgery can substitute the treatment modality. The most common sites for hemangioblastoma development are the cerebellum and spinal cord， as evident in our patient. Our patient presented with signs and symptoms of Cerebellar Hemangioblastoma (CHb) and was operated on time. Pathological confirmation was done， and routine investigationslike organ function tests， abdomen ultrasound， and chest X-ray showed no abnormality. Unusual sites of hemangioblastomas in VHL include the anterior lobe of the pituitary， pituitary stalk， hypothalamus， optic nerve， corpus callosum， wall of the third ventricle， the temporal horn of the lateral ventricles， frontal and temporal lobe， meninges 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**In VHL， Renal cysts are much more common than Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)， with an incidence of 60% and 24% to 45%subsequently.Renalinvolvement in VHL is multi-centric and bilateral in at least 75% of patient's microscopic solid tumors identified within the renal parenchyma of patients with VHL， which progress into giant macroscopic tumors. The renal tumor observed， on average， grow at the rate of 1.6 cm/year， which is somewhat faster than those in sporadic renal cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【28】**In the VHL pancreas， different types of lesions like cysts， serious micro-cystic adenomas， and even malignant pancreatic lesions(adenocarcinoma) can be involved. The pancreatic cyst is the most common among the above lesions. Adrenal gland involvement in VHL having pheochromocytomas occurs only 7% to 18%. There are multiple case reports and involvement of different organs with VHL lesions like malignant lesions on the thyroid (Medullary and papillary type)， liver and pulmonary hemangioblastoma， ovarian and omental cysts， hemangioma of skin， and skeletal muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.**\n\n【29】**Patients can have variable presentations depending on the primary site； the diagnosis is often confirmed by positive family history and the presence of one VHL-associated tumor. In cases with no known history of VHL， multiple tumors are needed for diagnosis since approximately 20% of cases result from de novo mutations. Specific genotype-phenotype correlations in affected families led to the classification of VHL subtypes into types 1 and 2 ， primarily based on the presence of a pheochromocytoma. Type 1disease has a shallow risk of pheochromocytomas. Type 2 VHL is further categorized into type 2a (low risk of RCC)， type 2b (high risk ofRCC)， and type 2c， which only presents with pheochromocytomas\\[8，9\\].**\n\n【30】**Based on the above classification， our patient belongs to type 1because she had CNS HB，pancreatic cystic mass， and neuroendocrine tumor. The sex and genotype of the patient influence survival. Female patients have a significantly higher risk of VHL-related death than**\n\n【31】**male patients (HR=2.25，95% CI 1.20 to 4.20，p=0.011).Overall，79%(53 of 67) of deaths were VHL-related， but the risk of VHL-related death has decreased over time， as has the frequency of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) -related death. Surveillance is especially beneficial for truncating mutation carriers with the greatest RCC and Central Nervous System (CNS) hemangioblastoma risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**The current study reinforces the importance of regular follow-ups with proper evaluation by appropriate diagnostic modalities. As we observed from our patient， these tumors often have multiple periods of tumors growth separated by periods of arrested growth， and different kinds of literature informed us the possibility of many untreated tumors might remain static for several years， yet follow-up of VHL patients must not be discontinued after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Advisable to make maximum effort to analyze the chromosomal mutation of the patient， which will help and lead us to offer the option ofpre-symptomatic gene testing and early treatment.

Thus， we examined the efficiency and results from the helpful deeds in different curing programs， especially in recurrent cases， being already primary treated .**\n\n【35】**The mean time for declaring a recurrence from the beginning of the treatment is 10.3 months. The total capacity of the recurrent-helpful deeds is 45%-local-85%，local-regional-100%，regional-23%， distant-19%.**\n\n【36】**We established reasonable cumulative survival with non - activity tumors in patients with performed before surgical and chemo-radio-therapy， as well as a lack of 3 years survival in patients with chemoradiotherapy， only .**\n\n【37】**The 1-year survival for people， operated and then- chemo-radio-therapy is 86%， while for the same， but 3 years survival is69%. We did not fell upon a person with 3 years survival， only on a chemoradiotherapy. So， there are restricted possibilities for treatment after certain helpful surgical performances in recurrent cases. The surgical deeds， themselves， are possible only at the very beginning of the recurrences. That is why the objective follow-up of such people is very important， to detect such recurrences.**\n\n【38】**What about the type of the neck dissection - a large， or selective oner**\n\n【39】**We analyzed retrospectively _T_ 51 patients with advanced**\n\n【40】**hypopharyngeal carcinoma in Complex Oncological Centre-Plovdiv， during the period 2010-2020. There has been a histological verification for everyone. The metastases have been localized on levels II， III， IV， V. During the next follow-up， with performed large or selective neck dissection， we checked recurrences in 4 men (7.8%). So， the neck dissection comes to be an effective way of therapy for meta-recurrent tumors， even in cases with performed before chemo-radio-therapy.**\n\n【41】**We analyzed in a program and retrospective way 53 patients in a stage of advanced hypopharyngeal carcinoma， suitable for a total laryngectomy， treated before that by Doxetacel， Cisplatina and5-Fluorouracil， in order to save the larynx. Among them 42 were men， 11- women， all at mean age of 58.6 ±8.2 years， in advanced clinical stages -IIIand IVh.**\n\n【42】**58% of the patients had 2 years survival， free of recurrences and larynx-saved.In conclusion - the clinical practice shows， that using the induced chemo-therapy on a base of larynx-saving method， could be used successfully in patients with advanced hypopharyngeal carcinoma， and thus - to gain good results in many ways.**\n\n【43】**We checked 100 patients with advanced hypopharyngeal carcinoma - at the ENT-Clinic -UMBAL “St. George\"- Plovdiv， in order to analyze the therapy - effect over them. The induced chemotherapy， followed by radiotherapy， do form the therapeutical effect in such patients.**\n\n【44】**In conclusion - a greater part of the patients with advanced carcinomas could not be able to be treated successfully by larynx-saving methods. Clinical stage IV has a bad prognosis in accordance results. If we insist on a larynx-saving procedure， then the radio-therapy with constantly enlarging doses plays an important role.**\n\n【45】**In our study we checked 55 patients withadvancedhypopharyngeal carcinoma. First， they were treated by 40 Gy radiotherapy， some of them then 30 more -so， it comes totally 70 Gy per person，regarding them as radiosensitive. The rest 28 people were declared as radio-non sensitive. We found out 3 years survival in 77% from the first group.**\n\n【46】**In conclusion- we may declare， that this is a new model for treatingadvanced1上hypopharyngeal carcinoma， i.e.，using the advantages of the concomitant chemoradiotherapy instead of surgical methods. We examined retrospectively 58 patients， being operated at ENT-Clinic-UMBAL “St. George\"-Plovdiv， during the period 2010-2020. All of them were treated by selective bilateral neck dissection. Also， they were followed-up， as time goes by， for any micrometastases and isolated tumor cells，as well. So，according to the immunohistochemical results and analyses， the people were grouped precisely and coordinating.**\n\n【47】**It is obvious， that people with lymph nodular micrometastases and isolated tumor cells， do have a worse prognosis and less survival rate， so the next coming surgical treatment may gain a certain success.

FunctionalpNETs are known to secrete insulin， gastrin， glucagon， vasoactive intestinal peptide or somatostatin. A small number of case reports have also identified pNETs secreting ACTH in patients who presented with clinical features of Cushing’s syndrome. We report the case of a patient treated for a known pNET believed to be non-functioning， who went on to develop features ofectopic ACTH syndrome(EAS).**\n\n【20】**Case Presentation**\n\n【21】**A 59-year-old man with type 2 diabetes was diagnosed with a pNET following investigation for unintentional weight loss. The patient was then admitted to hospital for a subtotal pancreatectomy and splenectomy in addition to medical treatment with the Somatostatin analogue“Lanreotide\".He had a complicated post-operative course and remained in hospital for an extended period due to recurrent infections， reduced mobility， confusion and hallucinations of unknown cause. During this time his blood pressure and blood glucose were persistently difficult to control.**\n\n【22】**Six months after surgery the patient was referred to hospital due to a routine blood test which had found neutrophilia with a White Cell Count (WBCs) of over 46.0 ×10/L. He complained of persistent fatigue and reduced mobility but had no other symptoms. A bone marrow biopsy indicated reactive changes but showed no evidence of a primary hematological diagnosis. He was also found to be hyperglycemic， hypokalemic with a plasma potassium of 3.1 mmol/L and his liver function was deranged with ALP 153 IU/L and ALT 233 IU/L. A recurrence of the pNET with evidence of lymphatic spread was found on CT.**\n\n【23】**Two months later the patient was readmitted with shortness of breath， cough and leg weakness. His mobility had significantly deteriorated， and he now required a wheel chair to mobilize.

The patient had persistent hypokalemia. His blood glucose， WBCs and LFTs also remained elevated . A whole spine MRI ruled out cord compression but showed degenerative changes and multiple fractures of the vertebrae. A chest CT revealed consolidation and a new sternal fracture.**\n\n【28】**Despite improvement of the chest infection after treatment， the patient continued to suffer with confusion， fatigue， poor mobility as well as intractable hypertension， hyperglycaemia and hypokalemia. Tests were， therefore， carried out to screen for Cushing's syndrome. These results are indicative of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome.**\n\n【29】**A pituitary MRI was carried out， which did not find evidence of a pituitarylesion. Inferior petrosal sampling would normally be carried out to definitely exclude a pituitary source of ACTH； however the patient was not eligible for this invasive procedure due to his poor functional status. As a result of the known neuroendocrine tumour， the very high ACTHleveland the persistent hypokalemia， a diagnosis of ectopic ACTH Cushing's syndrome secondary to metastatic pNET was made. The patient was started on Metyrapone， a reversible inhibitor of 11β-hydroxylase which blocks cortisol biosynthesis， with dexamethasone on a block and replace regimen. He also received a prophylactic treatment for Pneumocystis jiroveci in addition to prophylactic anti-coagulation.**\n\n【30】**Since initiation of treatment， the patient’s quality of life has greatly improved. He has had a significant reduction in the frequency of infections， his blood sugars have improved， his blood pressure is now well controlled on Spironolactone and he has regained some mobility. However， a recent CT has found marked enlargement of the pNET recurrence and he is now being considered for peptide receptor radionucleotide therapy.**\n\n【31】**Discussion**\n\n【32】**We report a rare case of EAS in a patient with a complicated post operative course after the resection ofa pNET.**\n\n【33】**Most of the cases reported to date of this condition were for patients presenting with Cushing syndrome， where the tumour was discovered during investigations for the source ofthe ACTH.**\n\n【34】**Table 2： Screening for Cushing's syndrome.**\n\n| **Laboratory**  | **Results**  | **Reference range**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Mid night Cortisol**  | **1583 nmol/L**  | **fnormal <50 nmol/L)**  |\n| **ACTH**  | **534 pg/mL**  | **normal range 10-60 pg/mL**  |\n| **Overnight dexamethasone** **suppression test： Cortisol level**  | **1314 nmol/L**  | **normal <50 nmol/L**  |\n\n【36】**We therefore wish to highlight the importance of including cortisol and ACTH levels in screening for neuroendocrine activity in pancreatic tumors.

Birds are the primary reservoir， but transmission from other animals has also been reported. Virtually all pet birds can carry C. psittaci， but psittacine birds are the most likely to be infected. There are 10 known genotypes based on sequencing of the major outer protein gene and each genotype has host preferences and virulence characteristics. Psittacosis which was estimated to cause approximately 1 percent of cases of community-acquired pneumonia has been recognized throughout the world. The precise incidence and prevalence of psittacosis is difficult to establish， likely due to lack of reachable sensitive and specific diagnostic tests. Psittacosis has been described in all age groups but most commonly seen in young and middle-aged adults. A marked predilection for males is noted，presumably related to increased potential for exposure. Local outbreaks which related to pet shops， aviaries and veterinary facilities have been described. Patients usually present with respiratory symptoms likely dry cough due to pulmonary infection with varying severity. The most frequently reported clinical symptoms are high fever， chills， malaise， headache， myalgia， non-productive cough and respiratory distress. Infection can also be asymptomatic and other less common but important symptoms include pharyngitis， diarrhea， and altered mental status can be seen. Patients usually have a history of bird exposure. The incubation period is usually between 5 and 14 days but can be as long as 39days. Unusual presentations which complicate making the precise diagnosis may rarely be seen. Variable clinical symptoms may arise with involvement in a number of different organs. Cold agglutinins， hemolytic anemia， acute thrombocytopenic purpura， severe pancytopenia secondary to hemophagocytic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura have been described as hematologic complications. But these are uncommon manifestations.**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Laboratory studies may revealleukocytosis with toxic granulation or a left shift. The Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) are very often elevated. The liver enzymes are abnormal in approximately half of hospitalized patients. Mild elevation of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen and hyponatremia is quite common. The chest radiograph is usually abnormal most often with lobar changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-11\\]</u>. Pleural effusions are rare but can occur. On high-resolution computed tomography， the pulmonary infiltrates may be nodular surrounded by ground-glass opacities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Serology is the principal method of confirming the diagnosis Microimmunofluorescence antibody test (MIF) is the most sensitive and specific serologic test for C. psittaci but is only available in specialty laboratories 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. A fourfold rise in antibodies or an Immunoglobulin (Ig)M antibody titer ≥ 16 is interpreted as diagnostic， but antibody titer of ≥ 32 is preferable for a sufficient diagnosis. However， negative serology in hospitalized psittacosis patients is not uncommon. The current serological tests are less sensitive than Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR). PCR methods give a rapid and specific diagnosis. It is not only more sensitive than culture and serology， it also allows genotyping. Unfortunately PCR is not available in many health care institutions in Turkey.**\n\n【14】**_cited._**\n\n【15】**The tetracycline's including doxycycline or tetracycline hydrochlorides are preferred for the treatment of psittacosis. This treatment must be continued during a period of at least 10 to 14 days in order to be effective and to prevent relapse. Other agents like macrolides and quinolones may also have been proposed as alternatives but they are less active against C. psittaci than tetracyclines and macrolides 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14-16\\]</u>.**\n\n【16】Figure 1： Four of all separated figures of peripheral blaad smear shows numerous promonocytes and monocytes that have folded and convoluted nuclei and a finely granulated cytoplasm withaut remarkable vacuales. A and B： Thick area of blaad smear， C and D： Optimal/Medial area of blaad smear.\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 70-year old male was admitted to thehospital with the symptoms of fatigue， myalgia， fever up to 39℃ and non-productive cough since more than ten days. He had been treated with oral amoxicillin/clavulanate of 1000 mg BID for seven days. But the patient stated that symptoms were worsened under the treatment. His medical history included Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with 40year of heavy smoking which was reduced for the last few years. There were no known allergic diseases. At the time of admission his vital signs of blood pressure， respiration and heart rates were stable hence he was hospitalized at the internal medicine ward. Axillartemperature was 38.6°℃ and blood oxygen level was 86% on pulse oximetry. Physical examination revealed petechias on bilateral forelegs. Auscultation of the lungs showed bilateral coarse rales/crackles. On some areas of lungs bronchial breath sounds were also audible. Rest ofsystemic clinical examination showed no abnormalities. Blood analysis showed leukocytosis (12400/uL) with relative monocytosis(2330/uL)， mild anemia (9.5 gr/dL) and severe thrombocytopenia(13000/uL). Peripheral blood smear showed numerous promonocytes and monocytes that have folded and convoluted nuclei and a finely granulated cytoplasm without vacuoles . Coagulation tests**\n\n【19】**were in normal range. There was an elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP)(126 mg/L) and a sedimentation rate of 84 mm/h. Liver enzymes were slightly elevated， with an SGOT of 57 U/L， an SGPT of 66 U/L， a GGT of 104 U/L and alkaline phosphatase of 365 U/L. Bilirubin levels were normal. Auto-immune serology including rheumatoid factor， anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide antibodies and Anti-Nuclear Antibodies were all negative. Viral and bacterial serologies were negative. A chest radiograph revealed extensive pleuropneumonia in bilateral lungs and chest CT showed multiple peripheral ground glass opacities with consolidation in both lungs . Bone marrow biopsy was performed given acute monocytic leukemia was the potential initial diagnosis. Normocellular bone marrow with relative monocytosis， increasedhistiocytes with hemophagocytosis was revealed. Immunohistochemical staining showed normal promonocytes and monocytes without monoblasts . Acute leukemia which was considered as an initial diagnosis was excluded. Pulmonary function tests showed moderate COPD with FEV1/FVC (Tiffeneau Index) of60 and a reduced Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). Transthoracic cardiac echography revealed no abnormalities. Urine culture， sputum culture and repeated blood cultures revealed no specific pathogen. The patient had been keeping approximately a hundred pigeons as a pet for about five years. In the past birds had some illnesses which were treated by the veterinary physician. But there was no demonstrated document about diagnoses and treatments. With the given clinical evidences psittacosis was considered. An antibody detection of C. psittaci assay was performed at the private laboratory without under social reimbursement. Psittacosis was subsequently confirmed by specific IgG immunofluorescence testing. The serum had an IgM titer of 1：16， and elevated titers of IgG (1：512) to C. psittaci， indicating an acute infection. Genotype-specific real-time PCR could not be performed due to unavailability. After one-week course of levofloxacin， as clinical improvement was lacking doxycycline at a dose of 100 mg BID was initiated. Cytopenias due to hemophagocytos is was gradually resolved.Doxycycline was continued for three-week course in order to prevent relapse. Clinical and laboratory response was achieved. Blood values were all became normal ranges with being resolved of monocytosis. The patient fully recovered and discharged.**\n\n【20】**Conclusion**\n\n【21】**Here we present a case of human psittacosis mimicking acute monocytic leukemia which demonstrates an extraordinary clinical presentation of psittacosis. Some hematologic complications of disease have been described： Cold agglutinins， hemolytic anemia， acute thrombocytopenic purpura， severe pancytopenia secondary to hemophagocytic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic**\n\n【22】**Figure 2： A) Bilateral emphysema， bronchial dilatation， and chronic fibratic changes are present in bath lungs.

Hematologic complications usually occur in patients with fulminant disease. Disseminated intravascular coagulation has been described by two different authors as one of the lethal hematologic complication. According to published paper the case was died due to massive thrombosis and respiratory failure and psittacosis was subsequently confirmed by complement fixation tests. Other case with disseminated intravascular coagulation was fully recovered after initiation of heparin and doxycycline. Severe pancytopenia secondary to hemophagocytic syndrome similarly to our case has also been described. Cold agglutinins are sometimes noted in psittacosis， but hemolytic anemia with jaundice is rare. A case presenting with jaundice and the clinical symptoms of an atypical pneumonia which was attributed to Chlamydia psittaci with serologic results has described.Under theliterature reviewonpsittacosis andhematological complications， authors concluded that cold agglutinins may be found in association with psittacosis， but a concomitant hemolytic anemia is very rare. Hematologic complications of psittacosis occur quite rare and are defined based on case reports. According to our review of literature monocytosis demonstrating like acute monocytic leukemia has not been described. The patient was fully recovered after three-week course of doxycycline. Human psittacosis should be consider in cases who show typical and atypical respiratory signs. In recent year's pigeon keeping or pigeon fancying as a hobby is common in Turkey. Therefore detailed medical history including occupational exposure to psittacine birds should be taken in all cases even with unusual clinical presentation. Systematic review of clinical and laboratory signs are fundamental to reach the precise diagnosis. Antibody detection assays are the only diagnostic tools in many institutions to define psittacosis in humans. But in Turkey antibody detection assays are unavailable in most of the public hospitals. PCR-based testing which is highly sensitive and specific is very expensive and very hard-to-reach. In our case antibody detection assay could not beperformed in our institution. The blood samples were sent to private laboratory which does not have an agreement with social reimbursement. Unfortunately these difficulties during diagnostic process make the psittacosis infection being reported vastly underestimated. The real burden of this disease remains undetected.**\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\. Wolff BJ.

There are many complications in tooth extraction especially Inferior Alveolar Nerve (IAN) injury and Iatrogenic Fracture of Mandible (IFM). This case report describes third molar close to the IAN and the crown under first molar. So it is important to protect the INA and molar.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation： A 22-year-old man was referred to the Department of Implantology， Stomatology Center， and Central South University Xiangya School of Medicine Affiliated Haikou Hospital with a chief complaint of the molar miss in the right side. He had no significant past medical history. A dental check revealed absence of right mandibular third molar， mesial impaction of right mandibular second molar with mesial II° caries.

To extract deeply impacted wisdom tooth is one of the highest risks and it is easy to cause postoperative complications. It is highly demand for dentist to prevent these risks.**\n\n【25】**Case Presentation**\n\n【26】**A 22-year-old man was referred to the Department of Implantology， Stomatology Center， and Central South University Xiangya School of Medicine Affiliated Haikou Hospital with a chief complaint of the molar miss in the right side. Intraoral examination revealed absence of right mandibular third molar， mesial impaction of right mandibular second molar with mesial II° caries. CBCT revealed that the tooth was found in the apex of first molar and near inferior alveolar nerve canal . The patient was admitted for surgery under Local Anesthesia (LA) after thorough physical examination and routine blood investigations. Prior to the surgery a duly signed written informed consent was obtained from the patient. A full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was reflected. The posterior part of the buccal wall of the #47 tooth was breached by rosette round bur over teeth #47 and #48， the lateral wall was also resected till the posterolateral wall was approached， guttering of the bone was done around the tooth， distal retractor was used and the #47 tooth was retrieved along with the help of a curette. The #48 tooth was found in the apex of first molar and near Inferior alveolar nerve canal， the vertical and buccal bone of the #48 tooth was to be removed with piezosurgery carefully， the #48 tooth was discovered， then it was split in the neck， but cementum of the #48 tooth close to the IAN was retained， remove the root of it， crown was divided into two pieces then extracted from beneath the #46 tooth， the socket was filled with Bio-OSS and PRF， the wound was sutured . Post-operative recovery was uneventful； the patient was prescribed analgesics and antibiotics. He was followed up for three months and found to have no complaint.**\n\n【27】**Discussion**\n\n【28】**Tooth extraction is a very common procedure in oral surgery通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The complications include Inferior Alveolar Nerve (IAN) injury， hemorrhage， surgical site infection \\[2，3\\] pain， dental fracture， the displacement of teeth or fragments， iatrogenic damage or luxation of the second molar 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， soft tissue damage， subcutaneous emphysema， trismus， swelling， and iatrogenic mandibular fracture. How to prevent these problems above all?**\n\n【29】**The incidence ofIAN injury reported in the literature ranges from1.3% to 5.3% which depend mainly on the position of the impacted tooth in relation to the inferior alveolar canal before surgery. If there is close proximity between the IAN and the roots， the incidence may be as high as 19%\\[5，6\\] and may be temporary or permanent injury通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， therefore proper presurgical planning is required to reduce the risk of injury to the IAN \\[8，9\\]. The minimally invasive extraction operation， originally described in the late 1900s， is an approach to the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus by making a full thickness flap， but in the present case we had to modify this approach as the tooth was located posteriorly in inferior alveolar nerve canal， Minimally invasive extraction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> of mandibular impacted wisdom tooth is better than traditional method. So a vestibular incision was given starting from tooth #46 till distally to tooth #48. The use of a surgical navigation system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> together with an interocclusal splint enabled the retrieval of a close proximity to the mandibular canal impacted wisdom tooth in a safe and minimally invasive manner without damaging the surrounding vital structures. Removal of deeply impacted tooth using the described techniques is safe with regard to mandibular nerve injury and neurologic damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【30】**Iatrogenic Fracture of Mandible (IFM) related to the removal of teeth is a rare complication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Subcutaneous emphysema is not very common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The use of piezosurgery can accurately remove the bone wall； effectively preserve the thickness of the mandible， thereby reducing iatrogenic fractures. And because the piezosurgery does not require high pressure gas as a driving force， it can also prevent the occurrence of emphysema. The antibiotic administration showed a decrease in pain suffered by patients but a higher incidence of gastro-**\n\n【31】**intestinal side effects. Chlorhexidine gel (CHX) is superior to a placebo in reducing the incidence ofalveolar osteitis after mandibular third molar extraction. There were no significant differences in soft tissue closure at any time point and provide any additional benefit to enhance the soft tissue closure of extraction sockets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.**\n\n【32】**In this case， the position of the Mandibular Canal (MC) in CBCT is close to the #48 tooth and absence of cortical bone between the root of the #48 tooth and MC； and the minimum distance between the MC and the third molar is 0 mm， the actual distance was <0.5 mm. The crown ofthe #48 tooth is proximity connects to the distal apex of first molar， the #47 tooth is upon it and there are caries in the mesio-crown. Under the guidance of CBCT， the resistance of bone tissue and adjacent tooth was removed with piezosurgery carefully， #47 and#48 were removed by precise surgical procedure. It is safe to extract teeth without any complications.**\n\n【33】**Conclusion**\n\n【34】**With the development of high resolution imaging technology， we can clearly understand relationship between the impacted tooth and the surrounding tissue， the blindness of extraction can be reduced because of CBCT accurate guidance. The impacted wisdom teeth were removed safely by precise surgical procedure.**\n\n【35】**Consent**\n\n【36】**Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

PIRADS has been added to understand the myriad of prostate pathologies allowing conservative management in selected cases.**\n\n【12】**Case Report： A 71-year-old man who presented elevated PSA from 1.5 ng/ml to 13 ng/ml was investigated after mpMRI showed PIRADS-5 areas. Admittedly， rising PSA was due to urethral catheterization for BCG bladder instillation 3 weeks before. Persistent PSA elevation justified invasive investigation. Histology results of extended prostatic core-biopsies revealed diffuse granulomatous findings with no neoplastic lesions. Investigative tuberculosis exams were negative and PSA follow-up normalized to previous levels.**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Elevated PSA is a concern for any medical situation and clinical investigation is mandatory. Up to recent times PSA elevation was investigated with invasive biopsy. MRI and refinements through PIRADS system allowed better understanding of the progression of the disease and render conservative management as an alternative for some prostate cancers. However， minutia of particular prostatic diseases does not have treatments and workups well established and these cases merit report to add better understanding of them. Patterns and behavior of PSA elevation after BCG bladder instillation demands medical attention as concomitant diseases is possible.**\n\n【15】**Since the introduction of fined MRI protocols we were able to identify cases where more conservative investigation might be used as in cases where granulomatous prostatitis mimic cancer and is highly suspected.**\n\n【16】**Although histology is required to rule out prostate cancer it is becoming clear that some cases where BCG-therapy was past used might be offered close follow up management if mpMRI indicates suspicious findings.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**_Citation：_**\n\n【19】**A 71 years-old patient was diagnosed with Transitional Cell Cancer (TCC) on US exam after1-day self-limited macroscopic hematuria. Pathological exam revealed an isolated high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer-pT1c. Six-cycles of weekly induction intravesical BCG instillation were done. Upon mild urinary discomfort at 14 weeks after instillation， urinary sediment， culture and PSA were requested revealing a jump ofPSA from 1.5 ng/ml to 8.9 ng/ml. No fever， hematuria or systemic manifestation was observed.PSA repetition after additional 3 weeks and 20 weeks after the last urethral catheterization showed PSA stable at 13 ng/ml.**\n\n【20】**DRE was unremarkable with soft gland. Further mpMRI showed 42 cm， 3 gland and bilateral axial T2-weighted different lesions extending from both apices to middle zone in the left lobe and up to the base on the right lobe characterized as PIRADS 5 for both lesions.**\n\n【21】**Twenty core samples of MRI/US fusion targeted biopsy revealed granulomatous aggregates with infiltrating lymphocytes containing epitheloid histiocytes with no classification necrosis compatible with granulomatous prostatitis in all samples. Tb-PCR analyses and PPD test were negative for mycobacteria.PSA progressively returned and stabilized at 4.5 ng/ml at 38 and 42 and weeks.**\n\n【22】**Discussion**\n\n【23】**_cited._**\n\n【24】Granulomatous prostatitis is an elusive and seemingly frequent complication in patients who underwent intravesical BCG immunotherapy but as diagnosis can only be confirmed by histology\n\n【25】**Figure 1： MpMRI T2 axial images showing low intensity signal bilaterally.**\n\n【26】**Figure 2： Diffusian Weighted Image (DW) showing significant impairment of contrast diffusion in both lobes more importantly on the left.**\n\n【27】**it is grossly underestimated by the series of symptomatic cases \\[1，2\\]. Granulomatous prostatitis may be due to infectious or inflammatory causes. It is an infrequent urological diagnosis due to unspecific symptoms and seldom invasive histological confirmation. Periodic Acid Schiff， Gomori and Ziehl Neelsen’s stain are the leading stains to diagnose the etiology. Histopathological exam shows aggregate of histiocytes， epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells nodes which are the types of cells mobilized in type IV (T-cell mediated reaction).**\n\n【28】**Histological granulomatous findings are observed in 1.4% of all prostatic resection specimens in different series resulting from large series of LUTS/TURP treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Histological confirmation of granulomatous prostatitis comes from treatment for sheer LUTS treatment (58%) or LUTS/fever/hematuria (42%)) investigation with 40% been associated with clinically incidental CaP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. DRE elevated PSA e MRIp findings mimicking CaP are all found on granulomatous prostatitis. Although， clinical suspicion for CaP is high association with it on histological examination is weak. The majority of granulomatous prostatitis cases started due investigation because of suspicious DRE or incidental PSA elevation that mimicked carcinoma in different aspects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【29】**Knowledge from small series and illustrative case reports as ours made it reasonable to measure PSA before BCG therapy as it might be useful to compare had any gland alteration being observed. It seems that histological granulomatous prostatitis occurs frequently after BCG instillations as demonstrated on 75% of 119 cases who showed asymptomatic histological confirmation on later cystoprostatectomy**\n\n【30】**Figure 3： Diffusion Weighted Image (DWI) with a high-b value and focally hyperintense lesion on Apparent Diffusion Concentration (ADC) consistent with PIRADS 5.**\n\n【31】**\\[2，6\\]. Another rare study in this matter with patients submitted to TURP after BCG therapy found an astounding incidence of 69%of chronic prostatitis 30% of whom were granulomatous in nature compared to none in 459 regular TURP cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.**\n\n【32】**PSA elevation in patients with intravesical BCG seems to be self-limited， and it typically returns to basal levels within 3 months in the absence of maintenance therapy. Beltrami et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> showed that 42%of patients on intravesical therapy showed PSA elevation with return to previous levels after 12 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【33】**In recent times mpMRI  become an important tool to determine the need for prostate biopsy in cases of biochemical or clinical suspicion for CaP. mpMRI alterations in granulomatous prostatitis are yet poorly determined in the literature. Recognizing that mpMRI may have false-positive findings for CaP as for the cases of bacterial or granulomatous prostatitis acknowledgment of frequent MRI alteration on subjects submitted to BCG might allow conservative management in this clinical setting without invasive investigation. Scarcity of truly documented cases of granulomatous prostatitis limits diagnostic findings on mpMRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【34】**Cheng described a limited series of 6 cases of MRI findings in primary prostatic tuberculosis observing that nodular lesions showed very low intensity on T2-Weighted Imaging (T2WI) as well as in DWI and ADC map while diffuse granulomatous lesions were also low on T2WI but higher than in the muscle with high intensity on DWI and low signal on ADC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【35】**Similarly， Lee et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> identified 16 out of819 cases with biopsied-proven granulomatous prostatitis studied with mpMRI reporting low signal on T2WI with high DWI . Surprisingly， as in our case， all of them were previously rendered PIRADS 5.**\n\n【36】**Although it is difficult to distinguish neoplastic from benign granulomatous lesion ring signal in DCE， firstly described by Kawada et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> might suggest granulomatous origin of the lesion averting invasive measures. Although Leibovici et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> showed an average rise of 6.9 ng/ml during BCG instillation with PSA normalization afterwards the exact MRI findings that characterize granulomatous prostatitis is largely dependent on the amount of water content and inflammatoryprocess.ADC values<1000 with decreased or isointense signal on high-b-value (b>1200) suggest inflammatory component in contrast to CaP pattern which presents lower b-value and faster clearance in Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DCE) \\[12，13\\].**\n\n【37】**While MRI helps justify prostate biopsy rare case reports of suspicious laboratory or clinical findings describing mpMRI alterations after BCG instillations might legitimate conservative management 13，14.**\n\n【38】**PIRADS-5 is a strong finding to justify prostatic biopsy but the assistant doctor may vet the whole picture and admit that even for PIRADS-5 unexpected granulomatous findings might be observed in 38% of the 15.5% with non-cancer histological diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However， if no exam comparisons are possible elevated PSA and suspicious PIRADS lesion will demand prostatic biopsy at the physician's discretion.**\n\n【39】**The reverse of this radiological conundrum is the more frequent usage of 18-Fluoro-2-Deoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (F-18 FDG PET/CT) with consequent prostate incidental lesions. It is acknowledged that 1.5% of the all F-18 FDG presents incidental prostate uptakes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Although it can represent prostate malignancies many of them are related to inflammatory or benign lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Albeit， not being specific to neoplastic lesion avid-lesions showed a high rate of clinically significant prostate cancer - 91%， when biopsies were done 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Surprisingly， 59% of F-18 FDG PET/CT was still positive in the prostate up to 1 year after BCG therapy revealing the lasting pattern of the granulomatous lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.**\n\n【40】**In continuity to prostatic alterations observed in follow up images exams after BCG-therapy CT is no different. Prostate alterations are observed in 38% of asymptomatic cases with low attenuation areas or contrast enhancement in 21% of cases， the majority of them reversed along extended follow up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Our case adds to the scarce information on PSA behavior and histological alterations observed after BCG-instillation.**\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

His liver transplant occurred in May2003； he had been registered on the waiting list for sixteen months. At that time， in Brazil， patients were submitted to transplantation surgery according to their waiting time on the transplant list； the MELD system was introduced in 2006. By histopathological examination of the explanted liver， we found that he was beyond the Milan criteria， showing multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma spread over all liver segments (I to VIII)， with tumor diameters of 1.6 to 1.7cm，trabecular and pseudo-glandular occurrences，Edmonson-Steiner grade III， and also foci of micro-and macro-vascular invasion (Figure1A and B). The TNM classification was T4N0Mx， as the two lymph nodes removed from the peripancreatic and portal region were free of malignancy. After liver transplantation， the alpha-fetoprotein serum level fell from 350 ng/ml to 4.4 ng/ml.**\n\n【31】**On the day after liver transplantation， immunosuppression**\n\n【32】**was started with prednisone 20 mg per day， tacrolimus 2 mg every12h and mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg daily. After 21 days of immunosuppression， prednisone was decreased by 5 mg every three weeks， until it was stopped at the end of the third month， as required by our pre-stated protocol. The serum level of tacrolimus ranged from 2 to 13 ng/mL (mean of 8.37 ng/ml).**\n\n【33】**In 2006 April， three years after the liver transplantation， due to severe diabetes complications， tacrolimus had been replaced by sirolimus， with an initial dose of 2 mg per day， adjusted to 1 mg on alternate days. The serum sirolimus level ranged from 2.5 to 6.2 ng/mL (mean of 3.88 ng/mL) throughout the three subsequent years. Mycophenolate mofetil was maintained throughout the period with adjusted doses， according to clinical and laboratorial evaluations.**\n\n【34】**Six years after the liver transplantation (December 2009)， the patient underwent a heterologous kidney transplantation from a cadaveric donor due to chronic kidney failure， as a consequence of diabetic nephropathy. The preoperative evaluation， including bone scintigraphy， thorax and abdominal tomographic scans and serum alpha-fetoprotein， showed no evidence of recurrence of the HCC. After the kidney transplant， the immunosuppressive regimen was**\n\n【35】**Figure 3： Computer tomography of the chest showing pulmonary nodules with soft tissue density measuring right up to 2.5 cm in diameter.**\n\n【36】**Figure 4： A Late pulmonary recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (A)， and solid and trabecular recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (B).

Sirolimus was maintained on 1 mg every day. On the eleventh day after the kidney transplant had occurred， acute rejection of the new organ was treated with a methylprednisolone pulse， 1 g for three days. Then immunosuppression was maintained with prednisone 45 mg/day， sodium mycophenolate 720 mg every 12h and sirolimus 2 mg/day.**\n\n【38】**Eighteen months after the renal transplant (June 2011)， routine exams showed an increasing alpha-fetoprotein level from 6.7 ng/mL to 232.6 ng/ml. Bone scintigraphy showed no evidence of metastasis. However， a computed tomography chest scan identified nodules with a diameter of 2.5 cm in the right lung . The patient was referred for pulmonary lobectomy， which was not performed due to disseminated tumors on the lungs and pleura. Upon histopathological examination， metastatic HCC in the lungs was diagnosed， 8.5 years after liver transplantation， as demonstrated in Figures 4A and 4B. Thereafter， the patient was treated with sorafenib400 mg twice daily for 80 days， when the treatment was discontinued due to the progression of the metastatic liver tumor. Second-line systemic therapy with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin started， but it was suspended after the second cycle due to myelotoxicity. The patient underwent supportive therapy until progression to death， eleven months after the HCC recurrence.**\n\n【39】**Discussion**\n\n【40】**Tumor recurrence after liver transplantation is “early\"when it occurs within 2 years， “late”when it occurs between 2 and 5 years and**\n\n【41】**those that occur after 5 years of the cancer recovery are considered“very late\"tumor recurrences \\[1，5-71.Most recurrences usually occur within the first two vears after treatment. The literature does not contain many cases of very late recurrences.**\n\n【42】**Our patient received a liver transplant due to alcoholic cirrhosis and HCC， which was followed by kidney transplantation six years later. He had an HCC recurrence 8.5 years (101 months) after liver transplantation.**\n\n【43】**During liver transplantation， factors associated with poor survival were discovered： a multifocal tumor，poor differentiation and vascular invasion， known as a predictive factor for tumor reappearance. Although we cannot prove it， we can consider that the balance of these immunosuppressive drugs may have played a role in the long-term survival of HCC in our patient after his liver transplant. On the other hand， we can also postulate that the over-immunosuppression after his kidney transplant， with a triple regimen with ATG，mycophenolic acid and a corticosteroid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， may have been an important influence on HCC recurrence at a very late time point.**\n\n【44】**The concept of immunosuppression as an important factor for tumor growth was postulated by Yokoyama 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， who demonstrated that the time for doubling the diameter of a recurrent tumor in a transplanted liver under immunosuppression was only 37 days， whereas the doubling of the tumor recurrence in un transplanted cirrhotic patients without therapeutic immunosuppression occurred in 273 days. Experimental studies also demonstrated that cyclosporine A (CsA) increases the growth and invasiveness of tumor cells by inhibiting DNA repair functions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【45】**Clinical Studies from the Bologna Group have shown that the cumulative dose of CSA in the first year after transplantation is an important factor in tumor recurrence. They also analyzed two patient groups transplanted because of HCC， one treated with cyclosporine and the other with tacrolimus. As a high relapse rate was noted in both groups， they recommend that calcineurin inhibitors should be used with caution in patients transplanted for HCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.**\n\n【46】**ecent studies have demonstrated that elevated levels calcineurin inhibitors within the first month after transplantation，i.e. tacrolimus> 10 ng/ml or cyclosporine>300 ng/mlare associated with increased relapse of HCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Another study with approximately36，000 kidney transplant patients demonstrated a higher incidence of cancer in this group of patients than in the general population and， once more， immunosuppression was associated with a carcinogenic effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.**\n\n【47】**S-adenosyl-L-methionine studies have suggested that sirolimus and everolimus，both inhibitors ofthe mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR)， are new immunosuppressant drugs with an antitumor effect due to their ability to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells. It has also been demonstrated that sirolimus and everolimus are safe and increase survival in liver transplant patients with HCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.**\n\n【48】**Geisseler et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> showed that sirolimus in liver transplant recipients with HCC do not improve long-term recurrence-free survival beyond 5 years. However， a recurrence-free survival and overall survival benefit was evident in the first 3 to 5 years， especially in low-risk patients. This trial provided the first high-level evidence for selecting an immunosuppression regime in liver transplant recipients with HCC.**\n\n【49】**Both our patient and Schreibman’s patient had similar high risk**\n\n【50】**factors for HCC recurrence， such as over-immunosuppression and the timing of disseminated HCC recurrence after sequential liver-kidney transplantation， and both patients had a very low chance of effective treatment. Also， the coincident time of HCC recurrence of these two patients after sequential transplantation may focus attention on using a less powerful immunosuppressive regimen after kidney transplantation. The literature associates longer disease-free survival with a milder immunosuppressive regimen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Additionally， we can also postulate about the benefit of screening the patient more often for HCC recurrence after kidney transplantation， in anticipation to the risk of severe disseminated disease on long-term follow-up.**\n\n【51】**In conclusion， we present the second case of HCC recurrence after sequential liver and kidney transplantation with a combination of risk factors such as tumor size， vascular invasion， over-immunosuppression and double transplantation. Therefore， we can suggest that patients with HCC who undergo to double sequential transplant， during long-term follow-up， should receive the mildest immunosuppressive regimen possible and more frequent screening for HCC recurrence， i.e. at least every 6 months. We highlight the need for further randomized studies to identify the best protocol for immunosuppression in liver transplant patients with hepatocellular carcinoma to prevent the recurrence of the tumor.**\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**l.

Women have more time between onset of symptoms and presentation and are less likely to undergo diagnostic tests such as EKGand troponins， especially younger women. The presentation can be similar between men and women； over 80% of both report chest pain when presenting with acute coronary syndrome.**\n\n【13】**Obiective of the Study： The aim of our work is to assess the differences between the two sexes； the cardiovascular risk profile， management of acute care and secondary prevention as well as in-hospital and 1-year mortality.**\n\n【14】**Methods： We recruited 346 patients， the mean age 63.4±12.7 years are admitted for ACS (179(51.7%) STEMI， 120 (34.7%)NSTEM and 47 (13.6%) unstable angina)， we evaluated the clinical characteristics，electrical， biological，therapeutic as well as the risk scores and the intra-hospital and1-year mortality according to the sex of all the patients hospitalized for an ACS.**\n\n【15】**Results： We have 100 (28.9%) women and 246 (71.1%) men， a ratio of 2.46， men with ACS are older than women (66.34±12.3 vs. 62.13±12.7；p<0.01)， 17% women and 23.6% men are under55 years old， there are more hypertensive women (80% vs. 39.2%，p<0.01)， with a ratio of 1.6， there are more women with diabetes (65% vs. 47.9%， p<0.01) with a ratio of 1.4， There is no significant difference between the two sexes in terms of frequency of dyslipidemia (p=0.06)， 85% of women are menopausal， at the ECG the involvement in women is more extensive (number of leads affected>6 in 76% vs. 64.2%， p=0.04)， Renal involvement is more significant in women (p=0.02)， there is a Statistically significant difference in mortality at 1 year between women and men (17% vs. 7.3%； p=0.01).**\n\n【16】**Conclusion： Women hospitalized for ACS have more cardiovascular risk factors than men and cardiovascular mortality at 1 year remains higher in women， this observed difference is mainly linked to the disparity in the quality of care and the results in patients with ACS.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Female； Clinical profile； Acute coronary syndrome； Long-term mortality**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**Traditionally， cardiovascular diseases (coronary artery disease， arterial disease， and stroke) and more particularly coronary disease are considered to be diseases mainly affecting men， women being considered \"protected\". However， statistics from the World Health Organization show that cardiovascular mortality is higher in women than in men. Cardiovascular disease is even the leading cause of death in women， ahead of the more frequently cited breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. But if we look at the incidence of cardiovascular disease in large epidemiological studies such as Framingham for example， for all age groups (between 45 and 95 years)， the incidence is higher in men than in women\\[2，3\\]. This brings us to the first paradox.

However， the selection of appropriate tissue for repairing massive irreparable rotator cuff remains one of the greatest challenges in the field of repair surgery. In this Paper， we herein present 2 patients who received arthroscopic repair of massive irreparable rotator cuff tear with fascia lata patches in March and May 2017 and they were followed up for 50and 48 months respectively. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were performed before and after the surgery and yearly thereafter. The first patient’s American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score increased from 43.0 to 93.0 points and Visual Analog Score (VAS) for pain decreased from 9preoperatively to 0 postoperatively and the constant-Murley score increased from 14 to 91 points. Regarding the second patient， ASES score increased from 52.7 to 94.8 points and VAS for pain decreased from 9 preoperatively to 0 postoperatively and the constant-Murley score increased from24 to 93 points. Therefore， arthroscopic repair with fascia lata patches could effectively improve shoulder function and relieve pain in patients with massive irreparable rotator cuff tears and is thus worthy of clinical application.**\n\n【20】**Keywords： Rotator cuff tear；Arthroscopic； Fascia lata**\n\n【21】**Introduction**\n\n【22】**Rotator cuff tear， which usually leads to shoulder dysfunction and pain， has become one of the diseases that cause shoulder joint dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Among various types of rotator cuff injuries， massive irreparable rotator cuff tear is causative of the most serious clinical symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Despite the growing number of surgical treatment options， massive irreparable rotator cuff tears still represent a challenge for orthopedic surgeons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. What are worse， conservative strategies such as physiotherapy and drug therapy can merely show limited curative effect. Hence， surgical repair remains a viable option for patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears who suffer from weakness in shoulder with or without severe pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Those who endure massive irreparable rotator cuff tears always have a long onset time and concomitant with severe tendon cuff contractions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. During the repair of rotator cuff injury， the tension from tendon retraction makes this tendon residual difficult to pull back to cover the bony footprint， which constitutes an obstacle to placing a single-row or double-row suture in conventional arthroscopic surgery. In addition， retraction of tendon， scarring， and difficult visualization are technical barriers that must be dealt with in repair. The approach adopted extensively including avulsed latissimus dorsi tendon transfer， superior capsular reconstruction of the shoulder or reverse shoulder replacement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. Not only has curative effect been partially achieved， but these surgical means have given rise to a variety of complications encompassing restriction， subluxation and instability of shoulder joint as well as nerve injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Evidently， it is in urgent need to find a novel operative method. In fact， several researchers have already theoretically investigated the possibility of arthroscopically repairing massive irreparable rotator cuff tear with a fascia lata patch 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The current case study focuses on the clinical use of a fascia lata patch in repair surgery instead. The repair with fascia lata patch proved to be feasible in a rabbit model for rotator cuff tear established by Varvitsiotis D. He has reported on fascia lata allograft bridging in vitro 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In this report， we introduce two cases of massive irreparable rotator cuff tear precipitated by chronic degeneration and treated with arthroscopic patching with fascia lata， which was completed in 2017. The two patients exhibited improved clinical signs after the operation as shoulder function of the injured extremity greatly recovered and the pain was almost gone.**\n\n【23】**Case Presentation**\n\n【24】**Patient one**\n\n【25】**A 62-year-old female who retired as a yoga enthusiast，presented with a 2-years history of right shoulder pain without obvious predisposing causes. At first， the pain was more severe during physical activity and could relieve at rest. Then， the symptom gradually aggravated and was accompanied by nocturnal pain. The movement of her right shoulder was remarkably restricted although she did not complain about neck pain and finger numbness. The symptoms could not be significantly alleviated after physical therapy， NSAIDs， local blockade and other symptomatic treatments.X-ray examination showed a type 3 acromion and MRI identified a tear of the right supraspinatus muscle . Specialized examination indicated a restricted right shoulder abduction， active activity： 30°passive activity： 180°，internal rotation： Active L1/passive L5， external rotation： Active： 10/passive 30°， Neer’s sign：(+)， Hawkins sign：(+)， abduction resistance(+)， internal rotation resistance通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>， external rotation resistance(+)， Jobe’s test：(+)， Drop Arm test：(+)， Lift-off test：(+)， Bell-press test：(+)， Sulcus test：通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> . American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， Visual Analog Score(VAS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> for pain and the Constant-Murley score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> were 43， 9and 14 points respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. According to imaging findings and clinical signs， the patient was diagnosed with a massive irreparable rotator cuff tear. Subsequently， the surgery of fascia lata patch transplantation was performed for the patient. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia in the lateral decubitus position with the arm in balanced skeletal suspension. During repair， the arm was placed in 45 degrees of abduction and neutral rotation. Firstly， subacromial decompression was performed. Then， the rotator cuff tendon was debrided to a stable edge， and anatomic footprint soft tissues were debrided to bare bone. The upper and lower surface of the free edge of the supraspinatus tendon were released and pulled back to the bony footprint， but it exposed the defect of 4 cm ×2.5 cm. Hence 4 sutures were reserved to the free edge of the supraspinatus muscle with a sutures hook (ARTHREX Medizinische Instrument GmbH， Germany))uunder arthroscopy. Skeletal suspension was loosened afterward. The fascia lata graft (size， 8 cm x 5 cm) is harvested from the lateral aspect of the homolateral thigh distal to the greater trochanter. The fascia lata is folded in half (size， 4 cm ×5 cm). Directly under the incision， tendon-tendon suture was built between the fascia lata patch and the free edge of the supraspinatus. At last， Titanium suture anchor (Smith & Nephew Medical Limited， USA) was placed in a single row of suture with the folded fascia lata patch . Postoperatively， the patient was transferred to the rehabilitation department for rehabilitative training with the guidance of physical therapist. Two weeks after stitches were taken**\n\n【26】**Figure 1： Patient one： Arthroscopic images of right shoulder from the posterior portal in patient. a) Rotator cuff tear. b) Small incision assisted graft transplantation (H， humeral head； GT， greater tuberosity；SSP， supraspinatus tendon； SG， scapula glenoid).**\n\n【27】**Graft**\n\n【28】**Figure 2： Patient one： MRI a) preoperative oblique coronary position； b) postoperative oblique coronary position； c) preoperative oblique sagittal position； d) oblique sagittal position.**\n\n【29】**out. At the third week， fully passive shoulder activity was initiated and during 3 to 6 weeks， passive and active activities were both initiated. After 6 weeks， strengthening was initiated； the patient began to exercise fully autonomously. She was permitted unrestricted activities at6 months postoperatively， although violent confrontational movement is still not allowed \\[16，17\\]. Six months after the operation， the patient was reexamined in orthopedic outpatient and found that her shoulder function and feeling significantly improved compared with those before operation . ASES score， VAS for pain and the Constant-Murley score were 85.8， 3 and 84 points respectively. A C117repeated MRI indicated a successful fascia lata patch-there was no interruption of ligament signal and no sign of loose suture anchor in the footprint. One year after the operation， shoulder pain no longer existed. Moreover， the ranges of abduction and abductor strength were almost the same as those of the healthy side. ASES score， VAS for pain and the Constant-Murley score were 93， 0， 91 points respectively. A repeated MRI revealed a continuous supraspinatus tendon . The patient was satisfied with the outcome of the treatment. Telephone return visit once a year， the patient did not complain of special discomfort.**\n\n【30】**Patient two**\n\n【31】**A 62-year-old elderly woman， who was self-employed and engaged in light physical activity for a long time， complained of pain in the right shoulder joint a year ago. As the pain was mild at first， she did not pay due attention. Then the pain gradually worsened and was accompanied by nocturnal pain and limited movement without any neck pain or finger numbness. Therefore， she went to the local hospital and was diagnosed with periarthritis of the shoulder. Though she was treated with the remedy of periarthritis， her symptoms could not be alleviated. Five days ago， her symptoms worsened again. She visited the outpatient department of sports medicine in Changsha Center Hospital. X-ray examination revealed a degenerative right shoulder joint and a type 2 acromion. MRI showed a tear of the right supraspinatus tendon. Specialized examination indicated a restricted**\n\n【32】**Figure 3： Patient one： physical check of preoperative and postoperative. a) the range of outreach of preoperative； b) the range of outreach of postoperative； c) the range of internal rotation activities of preoperative； d) the range of internal rotation activities of postoperative.**\n\n【33】**right shoulder abduction， active activity： 30°， passive activity： 180°， internal rotation： Active L1/passive L5， external rotation： Active：10°/passive 30°， Neer’s sign：(+)， Hawkins sign：(+)， abduction resistance(+)， internal rotation resistance通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>， external rotation resistance(+)，Jobe's test：(+)， Drop Arm test：(+)， Lift-off test：(+)，Bell-press test：(+)， Sulcus test：通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>. ASES score， visual analog score for pain and the constant-Murley score were 52.7，9 and 24 respectively. This patient was diagnosed with a massive irreparable rotator cuff tear on the basis of the imaging and body tests. The operation was the same as that of the first patient. (5 cm x5 cm crescent defect was discovered while exploring the supraspinatus muscles， the 6 cm x 4 cm fascia lata was taken from the ipsilateral lateral thigh). The postoperative rehabilitation plan was the same as the first patient. Six months after operation， the patient was reexamined in orthopedic outpatient department and we found that her shoulder function and feeling significantly improved compared with those before the operation. ASES score， VAS for pain and the Constant-Murley score were 71.4，3， 69 points respectively. A repeated X-ray examination indicated a degenerative right shoulder joint and a type 1 acromion. One year after the operation， the pain in the shoulder significantly alleviated than that before operation. The ranges of abduction and abductor strength were still slightly worse than the healthy side. ASES score， VAS for pain and the Constant-Murley score were 89.8， 1，87 points respectively. A repeated MRI examination indicated a continuous supraspinatus tendon. The patient is currently enjoying normal life and is engaged in moderate physical activity. The outcome of the operation is satisfactory. No discomfort with annual telephone return visit.**\n\n【34】**Discussion**\n\n【35】**It is demanding to completely repair massive irreparable rotator cuff tears taking into account the development of tendon retraction with inelasticity， muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Given the growing sophistication of technology of rotator cuff tear， it is noteworthy that arthroscopic single-row or double-row suture for directly repairing massive irreparable rotator cuff tears may induce forceful tension of repaired rotator cuff tissue and no relief or even exacerbation of postoperative pain \\[19，20\\]. Furthermore， direct suture repair cannot fully cover the head of the humerus， which increases the risk for both upward movement of humeral head and postoperative tear \\[21，22\\]. Extensive research effort has been devoted to the restoration of massive irreparable rotator cuff tear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23-25\\]</u>， whereas few studies can provide data on patching repair followed by postoperative rehabilitation exercise that yields satisfying curative effect. Takeshi Kokubu pioneered the treatment of rotator cuff tear with fascia lata patch and applied this procedure to the treatment of a candidate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. After the operation， the pain apparently eased and the function of the injured extremity was ameliorated considerably compared with those before the surgery. Thus， the operation he developed attained a desirable clinical outcome and effectively prevented postoperative complications such as shoulder osteoarthritis. However， post-operative follow-up or rehabilitation training were not mentioned in his report. A.P. Rosales-Varoa investigated 10 patients with a complete symptomatic rotator cufftear and used a suture augmented with their own fascia lata 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. It has been proved that this surgical method can improve functional results and reduce the retear rate. Therefore， fascia lata patch have exhibited great potential to be applied in repairing massive irreparable rotator cuff tears \\[28，291. The simple procedure does not require any special instrument and might also open up a new avenue for reducing the forceful rotator cuff tension generated by direct suture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Another intriguing finding is that such a procedure could reduce shoulder pain， improve shoulder function and lower the incidence of rotator cuff retear \\[7，11，31\\]. Particularly， as far as histology is concerned，the patch was taken from the patient herself and consequently did not elicit an adverse immunogenic response beyond that noted in relation to suture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. In this paper， we described 2 patients with confirmed irreparable， massive tear of rotator cuff who underwent successful arthroscopic reconstruction using fascia lata patch. Though the same procedure was employed， clinical effect somewhat differed between these two patients early. A systematic rehabilitation exercise was developed for the patients after surgery. However， the second patient did not fully follow the doctor's guidance in the early postoperative period， and the recovery was worse than the first patient at 6 months after surgery. Indicating that the postoperative functional recovery and pain relief were positively correlated with postoperative rehabilitation. Rehabilitation exercise is of great importance for postoperative recovery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Contrary to other operational manners including avulsed latissimus dorsi tendon or biceps tendon transfer， artificial patch， reverse total shoulder replacement， the technique of patching the fascia lata could relieve the local trauma of shoulder joint， alleviate the edema of shoulder and is less time-consuming\\[7，32\\]. Hence， this method plays a positive role in the rehabilitation of the shoulder joint by alleviating postoperative shoulder pain and it is advisable to perform early rehabilitative exercise of the shoulder.**\n\n【36】**Conclusion**\n\n【37】**In line with reports from currentliterature and the clinicalpractice**\n\n【38】**of our hospital， it is found that the application of fascia lata patch in the treatment of massive， irreparable rotator cuff tear can obviously alleviate the pain and improve the function of the shoulder. However， few experimental studies have been conducted in this research field and little systematic review concerning fascia lata patch for massive， irreparable rotator cuff tear has been published yet. Meanwhile， it is DOS essential to extend the follow-up time to postoperative patients and randomized controlled study for the sake of evaluates the effectiveness comprehensively.**\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Over time， we learn about new possible complications. This case report highlights the possibility of serious complications after mild course COVID-19 infection in young， previously healthy individual.**\n\n【14】**Case Presentation**\n\n【15】**A. 27-vear-old man with no comorbidities was admitted to the clinic due to infection ofunknown origin. In the fifth week after the onset ofCOVID-19(mild course)， the patient reported fever， vomiting， paranasal sinus pain， epigastric pain； for these he was treated with cefuroxime， later changed to ciprofloxacin， with no improvement. The patient subsequently reported visual phenomena which he described as “visions”involving himself (both with his eyes open and closed) accompanied by severe anxiety. The patient was not previously treated psychiatrically. The patient maintained full verbal contact and logical faculties after admission. Upon physical examination，the following were noted： Bilateral tonsillar enlargement， enlargement and tenderness of right cervical lymph nodes， hepatomegaly， and abdominal tenderness.**\n\n【16】**Laboratory results revealed elevated inflammatory markers (CRP212.29 mg/l， PCT 3.37 ng/L， WBC 9.30 G/L， neut. 8.24 G/L，lymph.0.51 G/L) and liver enzymes (ALT82 U/L，GGT 225 U/L， BIL33.52 umol/L)，an increase in hsTnI0.0506->0.0648ng/ml，BNP61pg/ml. In ECG sinus tachycardia was observed. Moreover， the patient was tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection -PCR antigen test negative， positive IgG antibodies and negative IgM antibodies. A thoracic and abdominal CT revealed hepatosplenomegaly， and hepatic hilar lymphadenopathy. A hepatotropic viral infection was excluded. No abnormalities in the lungs were detected (CORADS1).**\n\n【17】**During hospitalization， empiric antibiotic therapy was continued (ceftriaxone， clarithromycin).**\n\n【18】**Figure 1： 3D transthoracic echocardiogram of left ventricular apical sludge.**\n\n【19】**Figure 2： T1 map with calor overlay mid short-axis showing significantly raised native T1 (elevated T1， 1112 milliseconds) indicated by white arrowheads.**\n\n【20】**Figure 3： T2 map with color overlay mid short-axis showing myocardial edema (elevated T2， 54 milliseconds) indicated by white arrowheads.**\n\n【21】**The patient suffered several bouts of fever. Blood cultures， throat swab， respiratory PCR panel， and serodiagnostic tests for infectious causes were all negative.**\n\n【22】**A panoramic radiograph was performed； tooth number 18 was extracted. A paranasal sinus X-ray and otolaryngological examination did not reveal abnormalities that could correspond with the increased inflammatory markers.**\n\n【23】**Transthoracic Echocardiographic examination (TTE) revealed mildly reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) and unusual LV apical sludge as a result of hypercoagulable state (Figure1). Anticoagulants were prescribed. Cardiac MRI confirmed a localized active inflammatory process . It was decided that the patient would continue treatment with anticoagulant， ACE-I， B-blocker and ivabradine.**\n\n【24】**The consulting psychiatrist put forward a diagnosis of post-COVID neurasthenia and prescribed pernazinum and diazepam.

Infection， stone disease， primary bowel mass， and recurrent urothelial cell cancer are among the causes to consider. Here， we report a case of a 61 year old male who developed hematuria secondary to neobladder varices which was managed with TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt) and variceal embolization.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Neobladder； Hematuria； TIPS； Cirrhosis； Bladder cancer； Varices**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**The standard of care for muscle invasive bladder cancer is a radical cystectomy. While different urinary diversion techniques are utilized， an orthotopicneobladder allows the patient to utilize the natural orifice for urine drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. By utilizing bowel， neobladders are uniquely susceptible to pathologies associated with the gastrointestinal system as well as the genitourinary system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This creates a diagnostic problem in these patients when presenting with hematuria. This is a case report of a male with hepatic cirrhosis who developed hematuria from neobladder varices that was managed by TIPS and variceal embolization. To our knowledge， this is the first case of TIPS and variceal embolization being utilized to successfully stop hematuria in this setting.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 61 year old male with idiopathic hepatic cirrhosis who had undergone cystoprostatectomy for muscle invasive bladder cancer with ileal neobladder ten years prior presented with a one month history of hematuria. He maintained follow up after his original surgery as it was complicated by wound dehissence resulting in neobladder cutaneous fistula. It was eventually closed andhe was lost to follow up about 7 years ago. He reports that he was doing well in the interim until he developed hematuria but did not seek treatment until he developed clot retention and went to an outside hospital. There， he had cystoscopy which revealed diffuse mucosal hemorrhage. He continued to have hematuria requiring continuous bladder irrigation and blood transfusion so he was transferred to our academic institution. On presentation， he was actively hemorrhaging from his neobladder so he was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU). His liver function was compromised as he had Child Pugh class B cirrhosis with total bilirubin of1.5mg/dL， albumin at 2.4g/dL， prothrombin time of 16.7s， moderate ascites on CT scan， and no evidence of encephalopathy. After the patient received resuscitation， cystoscopy was performed to evacuate clots revealing hemorrhage emanating from multiple sites but no mucosal abnormalities indicative of neoplasm. CT angiogram did not show active extravasation but did show prominent varices surrounding the neobladder . During the diagnostic workup， he remained in the ICU as his hematuria persisted such that he received a total of 20 units of packed red blood cells， 6 units of platelets， and 8 units of fresh frozen plasma to maintain hemodynamic stability. The medical team's recommendation was to obtain hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement to assess the varices as a cause of the bleeding. His pressure gradient was found to be elevated at 19 mmHg (normal <5mmHg) so 10 mm TIPS endoprosthesis consisting of a nitinol stent with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft was placed lowering the gradient to 6 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> . Unfortunately， variceal flow remained retrograde and his bleeding continued 2 days later so embolization of the neobladder varices was performed with vascular coils and Amplatzer plugs . Subsequently， his**\n\n【17】**Figure 1： (A) Axial and (B) coronal abdomen CT images showing prominent varicose veins around the neobladder.**\n\n【18】**Figure 2： Menseteric venogram during TIPS procedure showing varicose veins and systemic shunt to the iliac veins.**\n\n【19】**hematuria resolved. He remained free of signs ofTIPS complications without development of encephalopathy， fever， or worsening ascites. He was able to void spontaneously by Crede，external compression of the bladder， after foley catheter removal and had low urine residual before discharge.**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**Hematuria as a result of neobladder varices is a rare entity. Review of the literature only revealed one other case. That patient was unsuccessfully treated with diathermy of the mucosa at the sites of hemorrhage resulting in his death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Additionally， there is a handful**\n\n【22】Figure 3： TIPS shunt between right hepatic vein and right portal vein.\n\n【23】Figure 4： Post varicose veins embolization with amplatzer vascular plug and multiple nitinol coils.\n\n【24】**of case reports of patients who developed hematuria from varices associated with an ileal conduit. Two of these were successfully treated by a TIPS procedure while another was managed by revision ofthe conduit and ligation of the varix 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>.**\n\n【25】**Although very few cases have been reported， the etiology of the bleeding suggests this pathology carries a high risk of death. In the current case， the patient was improved a combination of TIPS and variceal embolization. Additionally， he benefitted from having relatively preserved liver function in the face of cirrhosis severe enough to induce varices and ascites.**\n\n【26】**Conclusion**\n\n【27】**varices. The difficulty associated with managing patients who develop hematuria from varices mandates that liver function and cirrhotic state are factored in when considering type of urinary diversion. Based off the limited number of case reports available， ileal conduit may be a safer option in these patients as management of hematuria from the varices appears to be more successful. Although many factors influence the overall survival of a patient with muscle invasive bladder cancer considering radical cystectomy， underlying hepatic disease must be included. We present a treatment option for patients who develop hematuria as a result of portal hypertension induced neobladder varices.**\n\n【28】**1\\.

In such cases， however， they have typically been associated with a biopsy， or following surgery or trauma. This paper describes a patient with an apparent sural nerve entrapment related to running in the absence of the above-described situations. This case also describes the use of arch taping to aid diagnosis and guide subsequent treatment using foot orthoses.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Nerve entrapment； Foot orthotics**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Entrapment neuropathies involving the foot are relatively rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， but can involve one of five different nerves； Tibial， Deep Peroneal (Fibular)， Superficial Peroneal (Fibular)， Sural， and Saphenous. Depending on the location and severity of the entrapment， these conditions may be managed with non-surgical interventions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Those involving the tibial nerve in the tarsaltunnel are the most common and have sometimes been referred to as “Joggers Foot\"because of the repetitive compressive force exerted on the flexor retinaculum during running \\[1，3-5\\]. Muchless common are entrapment neuropathies involving the lateral aspect of the leg and foot， which may be caused by either the Peroneal (Fibular)or Sural nerves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【17】**The current case report describes a 24 year-old runner with recurring lateral foot numbness and paresthesia and the successful non-surgical management of the condition with foot orthoses. The case report further describes the use of adhesive strapping of the foot to aid in diagnosis and guide foot orthotic fabrication.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**Relevant history**\n\n【20】**The patient described in this case report was a 24 year-old female recreational runner (~20miles/ week) with the chief complaint of bilateral paresthesia over the lateral forefoot (Right茅Left) after running distances greater than three miles. The patient reported that she initially noticed the onset of numbness while she was running on the high school cross-country team as a sophomore. She reported that the numbness was initially restricted to the dorsal-lateral foot， but increased with further running to include the mid-lateral calf and leg. The patient indicated that her symptoms were restricted to sensory loss only and denied any motor involvement. The patient reported that these symptoms would typically subside within 10 minutes after she stopped running， regardless of the distance that she ran.**\n\n【21】**Other than three lateral ankle sprains to her right ankle， which were all managed conservatively， the patient had no history of trauma to her feet. She reported that while in high school， her arches had been taped by the local athletic trainer using the “cross-x\"technique， similar to that described by McPoil and McGarvey通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Unfortunately， this taping did not alter her symptoms. The patient did utilize foot orthotics she had purchased at a local retail store， which helped， but did not alleviate her symptoms enough to allow her to run long distances without the numbness returning.**\n\n【22】**Physical examination**\n\n【23】**Examination by the physical therapist consisted of first， screening the patient's lumbar spine as a possible source of her symptoms. The patient's lower extremity joints had normal range of motion bilaterally and her muscles all tested strong and painless. With the exception of her feet exhibiting a pronated foot posture in standing (FPI： L=+6； R=+7)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> ， there were no other lower extremity mal-alignments noted， including genu varum， genu valgum， excessive femoral**\n\n【24】**Figure 2： The dorsal arch height change measured following the application of the tape.**\n\n【25】**anteversion， or increased tibial torsion during standing and walking. The shoes that the patients used for running were new， showed no signs of excessive wear， had adequate cushioning， fit well and did not restrict her forefoot width. Because the patient's complaint of paresthesia was transient in nature and resolved fairly quickly after her cessation of running， it was felt that electrodiagnostic testing would not be of significant value in making a definitive diagnosis.**\n\n【26】**Because the patient indicated that the “over-the-counter” foot orthoses， which she was currently using， had provided some relief， the effect of her foot posture during running as a source of her symptoms was investigated further. To do this， the patient’s arches were first taped using the “low-Dye\"technique previously described in the literature using two-inch cloth athletic tape applied directly to the skin \\[8，9\\]. The modified reverse-six taping technique was then applied to further alter the posture of the foot by raising the medial longitudinal arch and therefore control the amount of foot pronation during running 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The effect of applying each of these two taping techniques resulted in raising the patient’s dorsal arch height by3.9mm measured using procedures described by McPoil et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The patient was then asked to run at least three miles to determine if the altered foot posture resulting from the application of the tape altered her symptoms. The patient returned the next day and indicated that while the tape was applied she had been able to run without numbness or paresthesia. The above procedure was then repeated in order to insure that altering her foot posture with tapehad altered her symptoms.Because the patient's symptoms resolved when her medial longitudinal arch was raised and overall foot pronation was limited by the application of the tape， it was deduced that the cause of her symptoms were related to her foot posture and excess pronation. It was further deduced that if foot orthoses could provide**\n\n【27】**Figure 3： The patient standing on the foot orthoses fabricated to replicate the dorsal arch change produced by the tape. note the additional material in the medial longitudinal arch region.**\n\n【28】**a similar change in foot posture and motion control， they would be a more permanent solution to her problem.**\n\n【29】**Intervention**\n\n【30】**Due to the immediate resolution of the patient's symptoms by taping her arches， foot orthoses were fabricated to duplicate the tape's effect of raising the patient's medial longitudinal arch. The foot orthoses utilized to accomplish this consisted of a polyurethane base shell with a foam top cover. Material (Plastazote I) was added to the medial longitudinal arch in order replicate the 3.9 mm change in the height of the dorsal arch that was produced by the tape. See Figure 3. No “break-in”period was used once they were deemed comfortable during the initial fitting. Since being fitted with the above constructed foot orthoses， the patient has reported that she no longer has had any episodes of paresthesia or numbness in her feet during running while using the foot orthoses.**\n\n【31】**Discussion**\n\n【32】**Because no electrodiagnostic testing was performed on the patient， the actual nerve involved cannot be determined with complete certainty and is therefore a limitation to the current case. Because the patient's symptoms resolved relatively quickly after running， it was felt that such testing was not warranted. However， based on the reported distribution of the patient's symptoms， the dorsal lateral branch of the sural nerve is a logical conclusion as the nerve most likely affected by her running. Although sural nerve compression has been reported in the literature， its cause is generally that of a mass lesion， scar tissue， ganglia or trauma and not from exercise alone \\[1，3，12\\]. In such situations， however， the pain and paresthesia are generally much more proximal than that seen in the current patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Because of the nerve’s distribution， however， it could result in paresthesia or numbness over the lateral ankle and foot \\[3，4\\]. Sural nerve impingement has also been attributed to ill-fitting footwear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The current patient case is somewhat unusual since the distribution of symptoms was primarily along the lateral foot， her footwear was not restrictive and there was no history of trauma or surgery. Certainly， if clinicians are presented with a similar case， electrodignositc testing should be considered to aide in their diagnosis of the problem.**\n\n【33】**Tapping the foot in order to raise the medial longitudinal arch and limit calcaneal eversion served to help determine if excess pronation of the foot during running was the cause of the patient’s symptoms. Because altering the patient’s foot posture and motion**\n\n【34】**during running through the use of tape alleviated her symptoms， it is reasonable to assume that excessive foot pronation resulted in the impingement of the dorsal sural nerve as it courses behind the lateral malleolus and along the lateral aspect of the foot.**\n\n【35】**The use of foot and arch taping has been advocated and described in the literature as an effective method of determining whether foot posture or foot motion play a role in various lower extremity injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15-18\\]</u>. Further， Meier and colleagues effectively used the same taping procedures described in this case study to fabricate foot orthoses in order to manage a variety oflower extremity injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Although the tapping procedures used in this case eliminated the patient's symptoms， it was not considered a practical solution since she would have to be tapped each time that she wished to run. As such， a more permanent solution was sought to accomplish the same thing that the tape did， namely raise the medial longitudinal arch and limit excess calcaneal eversion during running. As such， foot orthoses were constructed in order to accomplish the same thing that the tape did， which was raise the medial longitudinal arch and limit excess calcaneal eversion. To accomplish this， the amount that the medial longitudinal arch was raised with the application of the tape was used to ensure that the foot orthoses that was fabricated accomplished the same thing. It reasonable to assume that other types of foot orthoses could have a similar effect providing that resulted in the same change that was seen with the application of the tape.**\n\n【36】**As illustrated in this case study， determining if a person’s foot posture or movement is related to their chief complaint can be challenging. In such situations， foot taping can be utilized successfully as a cost effective method to determine if foot motion control is warranted. If so， a method of controlling such motion without the use of tape can be considered. In the present case， this was accomplished with the use of foot orthoses that altered the patient's foot posture the same amount that taping did， thus alleviating of their symptoms.**\n\n【37】**Conclusion**\n\n【38】**This case study describes the management of a patient with lateral foot numbness during running using taping as a way to confirm that altering foot posture and motion was the cause of her symptoms. Further， it illustrates how the change in foot posture from taping can be used in guiding the fabrication a foot orthosis.**\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

In this case report， we evaluated preoperative and intraoperative vagus nerve with ultrasound for VNS implantation regarding a second surgery.**\n\n【17】**Two patients with post left cervical surgery underwent VNS. One case was after cervical lymph node dissection due to metastasis of thyroid cancer. In the second case， the patient developed infection of VNS system， so it was removed， and a new VNS was implanted.

It is a biological medicine used for the treatment of Crohn's disease， Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)， psoriatic arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). Although certolizumab has many reported side effects， neurological side effects are rare. Suicide attempt， mental disorder， delirium，hearing-vision and facial nerve inflammation， epileptic seizure， coordination and/or balance disorder， paralysis， acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy， Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)， peripheral neuropathy and Optic Neuritis (ON) are possible visible effects. Peripheral neuropathy is the most common； Central Nervous System (CNS) and/or medulla spinalis demyelination follows this. While other TNF-ainhibitors(Adalimumab，Infliximab， Etanercept，Golimumab) are used in the treatment of RA， they have been reported to cause demyelinating disease or Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). With certolizumab treatment， the risk of CNS and/or medulla spinalis demyelination or peripheral neuropathy is known and very rare. We aimed to present a case of demyelinating disease secondary to the rare use of certolizumab.**\n\n【14】**Case Presentation**\n\n【15】**Analgesics are administered to 33 years old right-handed female patient who visits emergency with complaints of tingling in the right half of her face and pain in her right eye. She is advised to go to the Neurology department the next day if her complaints continue. The patient applied to our clinic. According to the neurological examination performed， hypoesthesia-hypoalgesia hypothermosis due to touch-pain-heat sensations in the right half of her face and vitality in deep tendon reflexes were detected. As it is mentioned in her resume， she had been using Familial Mediterranean Fever colchicum-dispert for 17 years and certolizumab (subcutaneos once every2 weeks since 2 years) in the treatment of AS for 5 years. Before the patient visited our clinic， a contrast-enhancing hyperintense lesion was detected in the right pons lateral side of the contrast-enhanced cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) taken at another clinic. Therefore， the necessary triggers were requested considering that the patient might have demyelinating disease and/or vasculitis as a pre-diagnosis. Lumbar puncture was performed before medical treatment. In the cerebrospinal fluid examination； NMO IgG negative， oligoclonal band type 2 and IgG index were found as 0.63. Vasculitis， hematological and infection markers were normal. Evoked potentials and cervical MRI， MRangiographywere normal. Certolizumab treatment was immediately stopped. The patient was given 1 gr/day intravenous methyl prednisolone treatment for 7 days. Almost complete improvement was detected in the patient's complaints. It was observed that the lesion completely disappeared in the cranial MRI taken as a control during the follow-up after 9 months.**\n\n【16】**Discussion**\n\n【17】**Certolizumab is TNF-a inhibitor. Other TNF-a inhibitors are used in the treatment of Crohn's disease， RA， psoriatic arthritis and AS. Although certolizumab has many reported side effects， neurological side effects are rare. Demyelinating disease and/or GBS has been reported to develop due to TNF-a inhibitors used in the treatment of RA. Certolizumab was given to two patients with Crohn's disease； peripheral neuropathy was detected in one of them； CNS demyelinating disease was reported in the other patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-5\\]</u>. In an article published as a review， it was not precisely explained how TNF-a inhibitors cause demyelination. Six theories were proposed in the study. These were；**\n\n【18】**TNF-a inhibitors cannot cross the blood-brain barrier， they cause demyelination by activating the increase of peripheral T cells，**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： FLAIR-contrast-enhancedcranialMRIsequences dated27/11/2019.**\n\n【20】**_24/08/2020._**\n\n【21】**TNF-a inhibitors impair myelin repair by decreasing R2receptors，**\n\n【22】**By reducing interleukin 10 and increasing IL-12 and interferon-gamma， it can reveal demyelinating disease findings in patients，**\n\n【23】**Since TNF-a inhibitors cannot pass to the CNS， they cause a high concentration of TNF-a in the CNS，**\n\n【24】**Dysregulation of TNF-a in the serum causes neutralization of TNF-a in relapsing-remitting MS patients，**\n\n【25】**Ithasbeen reported that these medicines cause autoimmune demyelination by reactivating the underlying masked infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【26】**The use of certolizumab was not encountered for the patients in this study. Exactly 26 of 122 patients were treated with the thought that MS might be present， only 7 of these patients were started to be followed up with the diagnosis of MS after the treatment was discontinued 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In another study conducted in Denmark 6 cases were reported. In these cases they used TNF-a inhibitors other than certolizumab， 4 of them were followed up considering that they may have demyelinating diseases. The first patient was diagnosed**\n\n【27】**with MS； interferon therapy was initiated. The second patient was recommended to apply to the MS clinic. With the initiation of rituximab the complaints of the third patient decreased and also remission was observed. The fourth patient was followed up with a diagnosis of demyelinating disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In another study conducted in France between 2005-2008 patients who used 38 TNF-a inhibitors and developed demyelinating disease afterwards were evaluated. These patients used agents other than certolizumab. Demyelinating disease was reported for 33 patients at a mean of 10.2 months. Demyelinating disease was observed in 22 patients due to the CNS and 11 patients due to the PNS. 22 patients； in 16 of them brain involvement (5 patients MS， 5 patients with ON) were observed. In 8of them findings of medulla spinalis involvement were found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In a study conducted in Spain， neurological side effects were reviewed in patients who received 175 TNF-a inhibitors until July 2009. MS and MS-like disease were seen in 43 patients， optic neuritis in 115patients. Eight patients had both MS and ON and five patients had other demyelinating lesions. In addition， 20 of peripheral neuropathy patients were reported as GBS， 11 as multifocal neuropathy， 6 as CIDP， 5 as axonal polyneuropathy and 2 were reported as Lewis-Summer Syndrome. In our case， demyelinating disease findings were revealed after the use of certolizumab with the diagnosis of AS. After the medicine was discontinued， demyelinating disease treatment was given and followed. Although TNF-a inhibitors are used in some diseases， they rarely have neurological side effects. We found it valuable to present a patient who developed CNS demyelinating disease due to the use of certolizumab and completely recovered after the medicine was discontinued.**\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>l.

Early studies were uncontrolled and more recent authors have used unstandardized research instruments or inadequate epidemiological methods. In 1991， Winsa et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> has reported a strict controlled study. Compared with 372 selected matched controls， 208 newly diagnosed GD patients claimed to have had more negative life events in the 12 months preceding the diagnosis， and negative life-event scores were also significantly higher. After this report， many control studies were reported. However， the role of stress on the onset of GD is still controversial as there are some contradictory reports.**\n\n【16】**On the other hand，there are case reports in which emotional stress induced an exacerbation and relapse of hyperthyroidism. But， few systematic studies have been undertaken regarding the effect of stress on the prognosis of the disease. So we investigated the role of psychosocial factors including personality traits as well as stresses on the clinical course of GD by questionnaires 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Firstly， we found that in antithyroid drug (ATD) treated GD patients， depressive personality during treatment when patients were euthyroid reflects the effect of emotional stresses rather than thyrotoxicosis and that it related with aggravation of hyperthyroidism \\[4，5\\]. Secondly， we also found that ability of rational consideration and expressing feeling of ATD treated GD patients related with remission通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. These findings suggest that pychosomatic therapeutic an approach including antipsychiatric drugs and/or psychotherapy appears to be useful for improving the prognosis of hyperthyroidism.**\n\n【17】**There are very few reports on the relationship between stress and other thyroid diseases including Hashimoto's thyroiditis，Plummer' disease and benign thyroid nodule. Stress may influence immune system both directly and indirectly through the activation of the neural and endocrine systems.

We present the case of a patient with somatic dMMR (loss of MLH1 and PMS2)， MSI-H and BRAF V-600E mutated metastatic right-sided colon cancer treated with an Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI)， who had radiological signs of Hyperprogressive Disease (HPD) with also an increase in tumour marker levels， followed by a Complete Remission (CR).**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Colorectal cancer； Hyperprogression； Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy； Microsatellite instability； Pseudoprogression**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**In patients with MSI-H CRC， Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) therapy can be an effective treatment option \\[1，2\\]. New patterns of tumour response have been seen on ICI treatment. The concept of HPD is based on a faster than expected tumour growth on ICI compared to the rate of progression on standard chemotherapy. HPD was reported in 4% to 29% of patients treated with immunotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It can be hard to distinguish HPD from pseudoprogression， which is a rare condition also occurring in patients treated with ICI. After an initial radiologic evaluable progressive disease， a late tumour response occurs \\[3，4\\]. The rate of pseudoprogression is ≤ 10% of patients， independent of tumour type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**The patient was initially diagnosed with stage IIIC (pT3， pN2b (8/22)， cM0) disease， treated with a right hemicolectomy and received adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin(XELOX).Due to sensory neuropathy， oxaliplatin was stopped after 4 cycles. Adjuvanttreatment was completed for total duration of 6 months with capecitabine monotherapy until September 2018. At the end ofadjuvant chemotherapy， a PET-CT showed new development ofperitoneal carcinomatosis and hepatic metastases . A first line PD-1-inhibitor therapy with pembrolizumab was initiated in the light of MSI-H metastatic CRC. After three doses of pembrolizumab， an early PET-CT scan was initiated due to clinical signs of disease progression with beginning bowel obstruction. At this time the tumour marker Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) had increased from 8.42 ug/l (at start of pembrolizumab) to 52.9 ug/l. The PET-CT showed metabolic and morphologic progression of peritoneal carcinomatosis， in contrast to metabolic regression but morphologic progression of hepatic metastases. At the time， we interpreted the combination of clinical findings， imaging and increasing tumour marker levels， as signs of rapid tumour progression and started a second line palliative therapy with 5-Fluoruracil， Leucovorin and Irinotecan (FOLFIRI). Treatment was stopped after two courses due to patient wish. The PET-CT after treatment stop showed minor metabolic and morphologic residuals ofthe peritoneal carcinomatosis and no evidence ofhepatic metastases， corresponding to a near Complete Remission (nCR). Tumour marker CEA had decreased to 3.25ug/l and subsequently normalized. The latest PET-CT in April 2021 showed continued CR (Figure1).**\n\n【18】**Discussion**\n\n【19】**A possible explanation for the rapid disease progression on the first restaging PET-CT after3 pembrolizumab doses is HPD on ICI therapy. It has been shown that patients with HPD had a lower frequency of new lesions compared to patients with disease progression without HPD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【20】**Figure 1： PET-CT demonstrating hyper- or pseudoprogression. The PET-CT at the end of adjuvant chemotherapy (Panel A) demonstrated hypermetabolic hepatic metastases (orange arrow on maximum intensity projection -top image) and one of several hypermetabolic peritoneal masses measuring 1.9 cm， SUVmax 7.1(white arrow on PET-CT fusion- middle image and CT at same level - bottom image). After three doses of pembrolizumab and clinical signs of progression the PET-CT (Panel B) revealed metabolic and morphologic progression of peritoneal carcinomatosis with the reference mass measuring 3.9 cm， SUVmax 11.3 (white arrow on middle and bottom image) in contrast to metabolic regression of hepatic metastases (orange arrow on maximum intensity projection -top image). After two courses of a second line palliative therapy with FOLFIRI there was near complete remission with minor morphologic residuals in February 2019. The patient remained without hypermetabolic activity as demonstrated on the PET-CT in April 2021 (Panel C).**\n\n【21】**In our case， the patient had progression of peritoneal carcinomatosis on PET-CT. However， there was no clear evidence of new lesions. Another explanation for the rapid disease progression is an initial response to pembrolizumab in terms of pseudoprogression. The hypothesis is that pseudoprogression is associated with immune cells infiltrating in tumour tissue \\[3，4\\]. It remains unclear whether pseudoprogression is a result of natural tumour growth before response to ICI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. As our patient continues to be in CR， it seems plausible that pseudoprogression led to a durable response， which resolved in CR. The role of FOLFIRI remains unclear： Whether the chemotherapy induced a tumour response by itself or in combination with the previous immunotherapy. First line chemotherapy with FOLFIRI has a CR rate of about 5%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Recently， the second interim analysis of the KEYNOTE-177 study was published. The open-label phase III trial enrolled 307 previously untreated patients with MSI-H/dMMR metastatic CRC. The patients were randomized 1：1 to first-line pembrolizumab for up to 2 years or investigator’s choice of FOLFIRI or modified FOLFOX6 (5-Fluorouracil， Leucovorin and Oxaliplatin) with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab. The median PFS was 16.5 months for the pembrolizumab group vs. 8.2months for the chemotherapy group (Hazard Ratio \\[HR\\]， 0.60； 95%**\n\n【22】**CI， 0.45 to 0.80； P=0.0002)， OS data are not available yet. Overall response rate was 43.8% for the pembrolizumab group vs. 33.1% in the chemotherapy group， with CR as best response in 11.1% vs. 3.9%of patients， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In an update of the CheckMate 142 trial， comparing the combination of nivolumab and low-dose ipilimumab with nivolumab monotherapy as first line treatment in patients with MSI-H/dMMR metastatic CRC， the combination treatment achieved an objective response rate of 64% by investigator assessment and a disease control rate of 84%. OS and PFS is not reached yet \\[8，9\\]. Final results from CheckMate 142 and KEYNOTE-177 are still pending， suggesting possibly durable responses in a subgroup of patients\\[7，8，10\\]. In our case， CEA levels increased during treatment with pembrolizumab， CEA levels dropped from 52.9 ug/l to 23.2 ug/l two weeks after starting FOLFIRI， and continued to decrease until normalization in March 2019 and continue to be in the normal range as of April 2021. The rising tumour marker CEA remains unclear. It has been demonstrated in a small group of patients with dMMR/MSI-H CRC that the degree of CEA decline after one dose of pembrolizumab was predictive of PFS and OS， the CEA response occurred prior to radiographic confirmation of disease control(range， 10 to 35 weeks)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【23】**Conclusion**\n\n【24】**We think that the clinical course and ongoing response in our patient is more likely the result of PD1-inhibitor therapy with pembrolizumab and not of chemotherapy with FOLFIRI. This hypothesis is supported byhigher CR rates in patients with metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC treated with PD1-inhibitor therapy and the unique patterns of response resulting from immunotherapy. We believe that the scenario described in our case is relevant and that physicians should be aware of the possibility of misleading early signs for disease progression. Importantly， ICI treatment should only be continued in case the patient is clinically well， because pseudoprogression generally is not very common. Distinction between pseudoprogression and HPD remains a challenge and we envision that data from large trials will help to further characterize these events.**\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

In this report， we describe the case of a 4-year-old girl presenting with anasarca found to have hypoalbuminemia， severe malnutrition and Protein-Losing Enteropathy (PLE). Further questioning revealed a history of trichotillomania and trichophagia. An upper GI series demonstrated findings of a trichobezoar extending into the proximal duodenum，consistent with Rapunzel Syndrome. An exploratorylaparotomy with anterior gastrotomy removed an extensive trichobezoar. The patient subsequently tolerated advancement of diet with improvement in total serum protein levels.

Initial laboratory workup revealed hypoalbuminemia of 1.0 gm/dL (3.6 to 5.2)，hypoproteinemia of 3.3 gm/dL (6.0to7.8)， and a normal urinalysis. Infectious gastroenteritis workup was negative. Abdominal ultrasound showed dilated fluid filled loops of bowel with associated colonic wall thickening.**\n\n【26】**Dietary history revealed a poor and restrictive diet over the preceding 2 years typically consisting of bread， tea， and 2 cups of 2% milk per day. Further work-up demonstrated iron deficiency anemia(hemoglobin 9.8 gm/dL，10.2 to 12.7) with a serum iron of 14 mcg/dL，low pre-albumin (5.7 mg/dL，16.4 to 32.0)， vitamin D deficiency (25-Hydroxy Vitamin D<4 ng/mL， 30 to 100)， zinc deficiency (44mcg/dL， 48 to 119)， and a normal folate level.**\n\n【27】**Patient was admitted directly from clinic to the general pediatric service for treatment of presumptive acute gastroenteritis in the setting of poor chronic protein dietary intake. Due to the presence of edema in association with hypoalbuminemia， a 25% albumin infusion of 0.5 g/kg with furosemide was given with subsequent improvement in edema， though albumin levels only transiently improved. Emesis and diarrhea resolved within 5 days of admission without**\n\n【28】**Figure 1： A portable 1 view abdominal radiograph obtained secondary to difficulty with NG tube placement revealed enteric tube terminating early in the region of the gastro-esophageal junction. Haziness over the gastric cavity was ater noted.**\n\n【29】**Figure 2： An upper Gl fluorascopy with serial images was completed demonstrating alarge amount of intraluminal material occupying the stomach(A) with apparent extension into the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum(B) compatible with a bezoar.**\n\n【30】**intervention. However， patient continued to have abdominal distention with limited oral intake. Persistent feeding refusal despite resolution of gastroenteritis symptoms， in addition to a concern for chronic malnutrition， led to subsequent placement of a Nasogastric(NG) tube and initiation of supplemental feeds. Further investigation into the patient’s dietary history demonstrated a likely adequate protein intake (given milk consumption) of approximately 1.14g/kg. Thus， poor protein intake was unlikely the sole etiology of hypoalbuminemia and hypoproteinemia. Supplementary workup resulted with elevated stool alpha-1 antitrypsin (>1.13 mg/gm， 0 to0.50) confirming suspicion of Protein-Losing Enteropathy (PLE) though the underlying etiology remained unclear. Fecal calprotectin was also elevated at 376.2 mcg/g (normal range： <162.9) suggesting an inflammatory process， presumably related to an acute infectious etiology. Differential diagnosis for PLE at that time included enteric infections， hypertrophic gastritis (Ménetrier disease)， inflammatory bowel disease， Celiac disease， and：intestinal lymphangiectasis. An abdominal radiograph revealed a coiled NG tube at the gastroesophageal junction with a hazy opacification corresponding to the gastric cavity . Coinciding abdominal exam was concerning for increasing abdominal distension and a palpable epigastric mass.**\n\n【31】**At this juncture， additional questioning elicited a history of trichotillomania and trichophagia， leading to concern for a trichobezoar. An upper GI series demonstrated large amounts of**\n\n【32】**Figure 3： Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a large trichobezoar occupying the entire stomach (A，B) and extending through the pylorus into the duodenum (C).**\n\n【33】**Figure 4： A trichobezoar measuring 14.7 cm x12.1 cmx5.1 cm was removed via exploratary laparotomy. It was composed of dark brown hair and colored fabric-like sutures.**\n\n【34】**intraluminal material consistent with a bezoar . Findings were confirmed with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealing a large trichobezoar occupying the stomach and extending through the pylorus into the proximal duodenum， consistent with Rapunzel Syndrome . Duodenal biopsies demonstrated distortion of the glandular architecture， villous blunting， decreased number of goblet cells and no Paneth cells. Gastric mucosa biopsies showed chronic， focally active gastritis and immunostaining detected rare Helicobacter pylori organisms. An interdisciplinary General Surgery， Gastroenterology， and Hospitalist team elected to provide Total Parental Nutrition (TPN) for 2 weeks prior to surgical intervention to optimize patient's nutritional status and subsequent post-surgical outcomes.**\n\n【35】**An exploratory laparotomy with anterior gastrotomy removed an extensive trichobezoar measuring 14.7 cm×12.1 cm x 5.1 cm and composed of severely matted， dark brown， morcellated hair with multiple colored， fabric-like sutures .**\n\n【36】**Post-operatively，thepatient was able to tolerate slow advancement of enteral nutrition that allowed TPN to be weaned and corresponded to improved total protein (5.8 gm/dL) and albumin (2.1 gm/dL) levels. She was discharged home on post op day #12 with oral vitamin D， ferrous sulfate and zinc supplements with plans for follow-up for feeding therapy evaluation and ongoing psychiatric therapy given her severe trichophagia.**\n\n【37】**Discussion**\n\n【38】**We describe an unusual case of a 4 year old female presenting with PLE secondary to an extensive gastroduodenal trichobezoar， characteristic of Rapunzel Syndrome. The youngest previous case of Rapunzel Syndrome in the United States occurred in a 5-vear-old girl with developmental delay presenting with abdominal pain and emesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The complexity and atypicality of our case is several fold. Our patient’s initial presentation of vomiting and diarrhea， likely an acute gastroenteritis， was inconsistent with the degree of hypoalbuminemia and anasarca present whichled to further work-up and eventual diagnosis of PLE. PLE is rarely the presenting symptom of a trichobezoar， as oppose to abdominal pain， obstruction， peritonitis， or acute weight loss. Additionally， her extremely young age， neurotypical development， and lack of prior psychiatric diagnoses differs from other cases of Rapunzel Syndrome described in the literature.**\n\n【39】**PLE is a collection of diseases characterized by excessive loss of protein into the gut with subsequent development of hypoproteinemia. Typical presentation is edema with complications including as cites and pleural/pericardial effusions. Diagnosis of PLE is through identification of increased fecal concentrations of alpha-1-antitrypsin， a reliable endogenous marker of enteric protein loss given its stability in the gastrointestinal tract and similar size to albumin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In our patient， the early finding of elevated stool alpha-1-antitrypsin lead to the diagnosis of PLE though the underlying cause of PLE initially remained elusive.**\n\n【40】**Causes of PLE are varied but can be divided into 3 categories：Increased interstitial pressure， erosive gastrointestinal disease and non-erosive gastrointestinal disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.Increased interstitialpressure can be seen in cardiac conditions for example post-fontan procedure or in relation to lymphatics such as in intestinal lymphangiectasia. Erosive GI diseases include inflammatory bowel diseases with protein loss resulting in PLE secondary to leakage of proteins through the eroded epithelium. Non-erosive GI diseases include both infectious gastroenteritis and Menetrier's disease， which lead to PLE through excessive protein loss due to malabsorption or surface epithelial cell loss. Menetrier’s disease is a protein-losing hypertrophic gastropathy characterized by gyriform enlargement of gastric mucosal folds which leads to hypoproteinemia through excess protein-rich mucous secretion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【41】**Menetrier's disease with a coinciding trichobezoar has been previously reported in 4 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-11\\]</u>. In each of these cases， the finding of a trichobezoar was associated with hypertrophic gastropathy and PLE. However， our patient lacked the typical endoscopic findings of Menetrier’s disease. This suggests an alternative relation between trichobezoars andPLE independent of hypertrophic gastroenteropathy.**\n\n【42】**The etiology of our patient’s PLE was likely multifactorial. First， a presumed infectious gastroenteritis was supported by the acuity of diarrhea， emesis， and an elevated stool calprotectin. Another**\n\n【43】**infectious etiology pertinent to our case is H pylori gastritis though noted to be an inconspicuous pathologic feature. A more plausible explanation is that the large trichobezoar itself contributed to the PLE primarily by direct mucosal trauma and irritation. The trichobezoar can also cause a component of gastrointestinal lymphatic obstruction similarly seen in congenital lymphangiectasia， which then leads to increased protein leakage. Previously， Hossenbocus et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> hypothesized that the presence of a gastric trichobezoar induced gastric polyp formation with subsequent irritation and PLE. Our patient's duodenal pathology was especially remarkable for villous blunting， raising an interesting differential diagnosis to include acute and chronic enteropathies. We believe these findings represent acute(infection) on chronic effects of an obstructing mass， malabsorption and malnutrition. The diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy was suggested by our pathologist due to loss of Paneth cells， and decreased goblet cells， but overall lacked typical clinical features of intractable diarrhea with TPN dependence.**\n\n【44】**Conclusion**\n\n【45】**Rapunzel syndrome is an uncommon diagnosis with fewer than 40reported pediatric cases worldwide. We discuss a novelpresentation of Rapunzel syndrome in an atypically young child with protein-losing enteropathy， which led to an instructive and thought provocative process of evaluation and multidisciplinary management. PLE has previouslybeen described in association with trichobezoars；however， this was always in the setting of hypertrophic gastroenteropathy or polyposis. In this case， we hypothesize alternative etiologies of PLE including foreign body induced lymphatic obstruction and local mucosal irritation.**\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

The case patient was diagnosed with SRS， showing Potter sequence as a kidney anomaly at birth， growth retardation， and body asymmetry during growth. Kidney anomaly is not included in the diagnostic criteria for SRS. Since imprinting disorder can have multi loci mutation， genetic testing is required even if the NH-CSS score is low.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Kidney； Phenotype； Silver-Russell syndrome**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**A fetus may develop when there is very little amniotic fluid in the uterus (in utero)， leading to pregnancy and a rare condition named Potter syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The amniotic fluid supports， cushions， and protects a developing fetus. When there is very little amniotic fluid， normal pressure exerted on the fetus during pregnancy can cause adverse physical features， such as abnormal facial features or skeletal abnormalities. When oligo-anhydramnios develops in the early stages of pregnancy， the lungs become underdeveloped (pulmonary hypoplasia) and lead to severe breathing difficulties. Oligohydramnios is the cause of Potter syndrome， but many factors can cause oligohydramnios. It can occur due to following renal diseases： Bilateral Renal Agenesis (BRA)， atresia of the ureter or urethra that causes an obstruction of the urinary tract， polycystic or multicystic kidney diseases， renal hypoplasia \\[2，3\\].**\n\n【17】**Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS，OMIM#180860， also known as Russell-Silver Syndrome，RSS) is a rare condition， which causes prenatal and postnatal growth retardation \\[4，5\\]. Currently， the clinical diagnosis of SRS is based on a combination of characteristic features. Molecular testing can confirm the diagnosis of SRS in around 60% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The clinical diagnosis of SRS is confirmed when a patient scores at least four out of six in the Netchine-Harbison Clinical Scoring System (NH-CSS). The physical characteristics of SRS are as follows：(i) Prenatal growth retardation，(ii) postnatal growth retardation， (iii) relative macrocephaly at birth， (iv) a protruding forehead，(v) body asymmetry， (vi) feeding difficulties， and/or a (vii) a low body mass index (BMI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The most common underlying molecular mechanisms of SRS are the loss of methylation on chromosome11p15 (11p15 LOM； it occurs in 30% to 60% of patients) and maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome7 (upd通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>mat； it occurs in ~5% to 10% ofpatients) \\[8，9\\]. And SRS is imprintingdisorder. Imprinting disorders (IDs) are a group of congenital diseases characterized by overlapping clinical features affecting growth， development and metabolism， and common molecular disturbances， affecting genomically imprinted chromosomal regions and genes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Imprinting disorders： a group of congenital disorders with overlapping patterns of molecular changes affecting imprinted loci.**\n\n【18】**Here， we report a case of SRS； this patient was born with the phenotype of Potter sequence and renal malformations. The study was approved by the Jeju National University Hospital， and written informed consent was obtained from the patient's parents.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**A 34-year-old woman， gravid 2， para 2， was transferred to our hospital at 25 6/7 weeks of pregnancy because she was diagnosed with oligohydramnios， and her fetus had severely restricted growth with no visible kidney in right renal fossa. We antenatally diagnosed the fetus with Potter syndrome. She had no family history， past medical history， or medication history.**\n\n【21】**At 35 4/5 weeks of pregnancy， a cesarean section was performed on the woman as she presented**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： Kidney sonography at birth. (Right kidney is not visible.Hypoplastic left kidney whose size is 2.09 cm and a rotational variation in the left renal fossa with poor corticomedull ary differentiation).**\n\n【23】**a fetal breech. A female newborn was delivered； the infant had a cleft palate， and her left lower leg was shorter than the right lower leg. She showed pronounced underweight and short stature (weight 1340 g，-3.06 SD； length 34 cm，- 4.62 SD) and relative macrocephaly (head circumference，31.5 cm， -0.29 SD).**\n\n【24】**Her Apgar scores were 5 at 1 min and 8 at 5 min after birth. Soon after her birth， it was found that the baby had tachypnea， with SpO. values of 50%. Therefore， a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) was applied to her nose in the neonatal intensive care unit. She was intubated endotracheally， and she received an artificial pulmonary surfactant. Moreover， a High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilator (HFOV) was connected to her because her gradually increased oxygen demand could be suspicious of pulmonary hypoplasia associated with oligohydramnios. In fact， the chest X-ray showed an increased haziness in both the lungs and pneumomediastinum. The findings of laboratory reports， which were obtained on day 3 of hospital stay， were as follows： White Blood Cells(WBC)， 15，800/uL (segmental neutrophil 46%， lymphocyte 36.3%)； hemoglobin， 15.4 g/dL； hematocrit， 42%， Platelets (PLT) 308，000/uL； albumin， 3.2 g/dL； total protein， 5.3 g/dL； total bilirubin， 5.9 mg/dL； aspartate aminotransferase， 38 IU/L， alanine aminotransferase，8 IU/L； blood urea nitrogen， 32.3 mg/dL； Creatinine (Cr)， 1.9 mg/dL； sodium， 136 mmol/L； potassium， 5.8 mmol/L； calcium， 9.0 mg/dL； phosphorus， 8.6 mg/dL； uric acid， 5.0 mg/dL； and Parathyroid Hormone(PTH)， 289.6 pg/ml. By performing ultrasonography of the kidney， we found that the right kidney was not visible， and the left kidney was hypoplastic with a size of 2.09 cm . Moreover， a rotational variation was observed in the left renal fossa. Byperforming X-ray of hips， we found that the ossific nucleus of the femur’s head was not visible and the left femur was relatively shorter in length. By performing an ultrasonography of hips， we detected the deficient bony acetabulum had an alpha angle of 46°when subjected to stress in the left hip joint. This indicates the occurrence of Developmental Dyplasia of the Hip (DDH) in the newborn.**\n\n【25】**It was confirmed that the newborn had Potter sequence， chronic kidney disease， and DDH； however， her urination was normal and pneumomediastinum gradually improved with medical intervention. On day 6 of hospital stay， she received synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation from HFOV. On day 7 of hospital stay， the ventilator was weaned off from the newborn. Renal replacement therapy was not provided despite azotemia. Nevertheless， the oral intake of the newborn had increased. Finally， the patient was**\n\n【26】**Figure 2： A) At 24 months， limb asymmetry. B) At 24 months， the presence of a cleft palate.**\n\n【27】**discharged at 3 months of age. (Weight 2720 g， -5.97 SD； height 46.5cm，-6.32 SD；head circumference 35.8 cm， -3.01 SD).**\n\n【28】**At 24 months of age， the weight gain of the infant was insufficient， and she also did not catch up on growth . (Weight 5.5 kg，-6.63 SD； height 74.1 cm， -3.60 SD；head circumference 43.5 cm，-2.64 SD) Therefore， genetic testing was performed at the hospital. Hypomethylation was detected in the H19-Differentially Methylated Region (DMR)， and the diagnosis of RSS was confirmed in the patient.**\n\n【29】**She is currently receiving growth hormones， has undergone cleft palate surgery， and is scheduled to be operated on at an orthopedic clinic due to a difference in low limbs of more than 2 cm.**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n【31】**The well-known features of SRS are as follows： Small for gestational age， postnatal growth failure， and relative macrocephaly at birth， protruding forehead，body asymmetry， and feeding difficulty. In addition， various clinical symptoms may also be present in the patient. In this study， the patient was Small for Gestational Age(SGA) due to Intrauterine Growth Restrictions (IUGR) and the development of Potter sequence， which included clinical features such as oligohydoramnios and renal hypoplasia. The most common cause of Potter sequence is kidney abnormality， and this patient had hypoplastic kidney. Her left kidney size was also small in size. However， even after rectifying azotemia， she could not catch up with growth and her body asymmetry worsened with age. Although feeding difficulties were not observed， she had a protruding forehead， a triangular face， a delay in speech， and motor delay. In addition， cleft palate was also observed in the baby. According to NH-CSS classification， since it is based on growth status after 24 months， we subsequentlyperformed genetic testing on patients who did not catch up with growth to diagnose SRS.**\n\n【32】**Kidneyproblems are uncommon amongthe clinical feature ofSRS. According to a study published by Haslam structural abnormalities of kidney were observed in 5 cases. This study also included cases of horse shoe kidney， renal tubular acidosis， and chronic kidney disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Walking compared ICR1 hypomethylation and mUPD7， identifying horseshoe kidney and unilateral kidney hypoplasia only in mUPD7 patients \\[11J.**\n\n【33】**However， ours is the first case of Potter sequence. The consensus statement of SRS was published in 2017. In this statement， kidney problem was not included as an additional clinical feature of SRS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.**\n\n【34】**However， a characteristic kidney problem may occur due to following reasons： Firstly， the molecular finding of the patient**\n\n【35】**may include hypomethylation of H19/IGF2 IG-DMR gene， which results in reduced expression of paternal IGF2 and an increased expression of maternal H19. This causes growth restriction of the patient. However， previous studies have reported about numerous Copy Number Variants (CNVs) associated with 11p15.5 region； the phenotype is dependent on the size of CNVs， their location， and their parental origin \\[13，14\\].**\n\n【36】**Therefore， there is aPpossibility that various undisclosed phenotypes appear， depending on the location or size of CNVs involved.**\n\n【37】**Second， in a study conducted by Eggerman multi-locus genetic testing wasperformed on 571 SRS subjects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. This study showed that7.1% of SRS children were diagnosed with ICR1 hypomethylation and other genetic mutations. A considerable number of 11p15-associated imprinting disorder patients show additional molecular findings. In addition， the various phenotypes may be shown depending on additional molecular findings.**\n\n【38】**Although ICR1 hypomethylation was detected in our patient， multi-locus genetic testing was not performed on our patient.**\n\n【39】**In addition， according to Schwaibold 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>，there are cases in which SRS and Sotos syndrome are diagnosed simultaneously. According to the article， this patient was determined through genetic testing， and although Sotos syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome， the child was severely short stature， and it was mentioned that further research is needed on the mechanism. Therefore， we only conducted SRS genetic testing for our case patient， but we cannot exclude the possibility of accompanying genetic diseases.**\n\n【40】**We reported the first case of an SRS patient with Potter sequence. The study has a limitation as we only identified the hypomethylation of 11p15. Even if NH-CSS scoring is low， genetic testing should be performed by consistent follow-up of patients， and it should be noted that various phenotypes may be shown in the imprinting disorder. In addition， individual genetic testing for accompanying diseases should be considered.**\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\. Welch RG.

Micro-Osteoperforation(MOP) has been introduced as one of the least invasive， flapless surgical methods of acceleration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this case report， MOPs were used to accelerate the distal movement of the mini-screws supported Fast Back appliance in an adult female patient.**\n\n【13】**Case Presentation**\n\n【14】**18-year-old female patient with a chief complaint of mal-aligned teeth presented for treatment. Extraoral examination revealed oval and symmetrical face. Lip competence was present at rest， and upon smiling， there was normal exposure of the incisors . Intraoral examination revealed anterior crowding in the upper and lower arch， and a dental midline deviation toward the left in both arches . Cephalometric data ， confirmed a skeletal class I， and normal growth pattern of the vertical dimension.**\n\n【15】**The primary aim of the treatment was to correct the dental class II malocclusion， and create enough space to relief the crowding. The treatment plan was to distalize the first molars as a first phase oftreatment， and then fixed appliance was used to align the teeth in the created spaces. Three MOPs were planned to be done distal to the upper first molar to enhance the movement. Two self-drilling 1.8 mm x8 mm mini-screws were inserted at 3 mm aside of the midpalatal suture， and implant supported fast back appliance was constructed according to manufacturer instructions and cemented in position 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.

After 1.3 years， skeletal class I as well as dental class I canine and molar relationships were achieved . The cephalometric changes included increase in vertical face height .**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**(CBCT) image of the maxilla were taken and 3D guide was printed for both right and left sides . The first， second， and third MOPs’ were 3 mm， 6 mm， 9 mm respectively from the crest of the bone and all of them were 5 mm in depth starting from the cortical plate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Consequently， the distalizer was cemented and activated. Follow up visits were scheduled every 4 weeks to reactivate the fast back appliance to produce the preset force of 300 gm.

In medical history of the patient， drug abuse was verified with a daily intake of 160 mg of furosemide during four years. The reason of selfinitiated excessive furosemide intake was allegedly face and limb swelling. Patient denied any previous kidney disease. The patient was normotensive with completely normalphysical status. Both， blood count and urinalysis were normal. Blood pH value was 7.43 and urine pH value was 6.5. Amount of 24h urine proteinuria was 200 mg. Electrolites and urine acid concentrations in blood and in 24h urine sample were normal.

It can take two different forms： medullary nephrocalcinosis is the most frequent form and is characterized by the exclusive involvement of the medullary pyramids. In a diffuse or cortical nephrocalcinosis， which is rare， the entire parenchyma is affected： this pattern is associated with severe metabolic disorders， such as hyperoxaluria， or end-stage nephropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【20】**The association between nephrocalcinosis andlong-term furosemidetherapy is well documented in infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Pyramidal involvement is present in more than 60% of preamature infants with low birth weight or full term infants with congestive heart failure， treated with furosemide for long periods. Although furosemide is widely used for various medical conditions in adults， its association with nephrocalcinosis is not well established. In adults， nephrocalcinosis induced by furosemide is rare and presents as medullary nephrocalcinosis without significant alteration of renal function. So far， only a few cases of nephrocalcinosis caused by furosemide in adult patients have been described in the literature， but just one of them included either imaging description ofkidney and histological documentation of the kidney biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【21】**A 50-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital for investigation of azothaemia. She was seen in another hospital for facial edema and swelling of the fingers and knees， and later was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. In previous medical history， she had tonsillectomy， fracture of left hand in a traffic accident. The patient entered menopause in her 37h year and was taking oral hormonal supplementation only for several months. Three years before admission she**\n\n【22】Figure 1： US kidney examination： diffuse pyramidal calcium deposits.\n\n【23】**Figure 2： CT kidney examination： tiny medullary hyperechogenicity.**\n\n【24】**had a parodontosis of upper teeth. During past several years she has been occasionally suffering from insidious lumbar pain. The patient has been self-administering furosemide 160mg/day for 4 years due to persistent facial and knee edema and allegedly low daily urine volume. Two weeks before hospitalization at our department she had cancelled furosemide intake according to advice of her general practitioner.**\n\n【25】**Methods and Results**\n\n【26】**On admission the patient was 161cm tall， weighted 53 kg and had high blood pressure (170 mmHg/110 mmHg). No edema was observed and physical examination was normal. We performed a broad laboratory analysis. Both， blood count and urinalysis were normal. Blood pH value was 7.43 and urine pH value was 6.5. Urine microbiology was sterile. Amount of 24h urine proteinuria(determined by Biuret test) was 200 mg. Initial metabolic evaluation was performed： concentration of creatinine， calcium， phosphorus， uric acid， sodium， potassium and chloride were measured both in blood and urine. 24-urine samples were also analyzed for volume， magnesium， oxalate and citrate.**\n\n【27】**Renal function was depressed (creatinine clearance was 62 ml/min). All the other parameters analyzed were normal. A parathyroid ultrasound was normal. Intact PTH was measured in the blood which was normal. Serum levels of renin and aldosteron as well as their ratio were regular. Urine concentration test showed izostenuric values (in first urine sample osmolality was 290 mOsm/L). Finally， we decided to make radio morfological and pathohistological investigation.**\n\n【28】**Figure 3： Only few cortical tubules.**\n\n【29】**We used Simens acuson ultrasound device and Siemns Somatom Sensation 16 CT system. A renal ultrasound showed medullary nephrocalcinosis with total involvement of medullary pyramids. An abnormal renal computerized tomography confirmed this sonographic finding .**\n\n【30】**Biopsy findings**\n\n【31】**Three peaces of kidney tissue measuring 4-10 mm were analyzed. About 70% of tissue was medulla and the rest was cortex with 11glomeruli. Two glomeruli were globally sclerotic and the all others had normal morphology. There were several foci of calcification in tubules and interstitium predominantly within medulla . Only few cortical tubules were involved by calcification. The all others cortical tubules had normal morphology. The foci of calcification were surrounded by interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. The blood vessels were unremarkable. There was no evidence of immune deposits in immunofluorescent stains and electron microscopy demonstrated the normal ultra structure of analyzed glomerulus and surrounding tubules.**\n\n【32】**Clinical follow-up**\n\n【33】**Two months after discharged from hospital， patient came to first control examination. In laboratory findings there were 24h proteinurialevel of0.7 gand better renal excretion parameters： serum creatinine 83 umol/L with creatinine clearance of 72 mL/min and normal serum potassium level (4.5 mmol/L).**\n\n【34】**Discussion**\n\n【35】**Nephrocalcinosis， is a term originally used to describe deposition of calcium salts in the renal parenchyma due to hyperparathyroidism. It is now more commonly used to describe diffuse， fine， renal parenchymal calcification on radiology. Nephrocalcinosis can be subdivided into the cortical type， which is classicallythe result ofacute tubular necrosis， and the medullary type seen in several metabolic disorders. Many causes of nephrocalcinosis have been added since the original description. These include causes of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria， medullary sponge kidney， hyperparathyreoidism， renaltubularacidosis _(_ (RTA)Sspecifically distal1RTA。renal tuberculosis， renal papillary necrosis， oxaluria， sarcoidosis and milk-alkali syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-7\\]</u>. Furosemide is a powerful diuretic drug which has been used successfully in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Hyponatremia， hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis are frequent side-effects of the treatment. An association of renal calcinosis with furosemide therapy in preterm infants was first reported in the early 1980's， the risk of developing nephrocalcinosis being highest**\n\n【36】**in the most premature ones. Furthermore， the risk of developing nephrocalcinosis was correlated with the dose of furosemide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In addition to， the period soon after initiation of furosemide therapy appears most sensitive in regard of developing nephrocalcinosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The calciuric action of furosemide is one of the most distinguished factors provoking nephrocalcinosis in preterm infants， but other provoking pathogenic mechanisms are undoubtedly also involved in most cases. Human and animal studies suggest that the development of nephrocalcinosis does not always require hypercalciuria， but alterations in urinary inhibitors of crystal formation (e.g. citrate， magnesium)， urinary excretion of oxalate and urine pH may also play a role \\[1，8\\]. The possibility of nephrocalcinosis being due to type I renal tubular acidosis must be excluded by a complete nephrologic examination (serum potassium，pH，bicarbonate， tubular acidification test with NH CD.**\n\n【37】**Our findings are consistent to previous reports suspecting long term furosemide treatment in adults may cause mild medullary nephrocalcinosis，characterized _by_ peripheral _d_ depositionof calcium salts in the pyramids with depressed renal function. In nephrocalcinosis， ultrasound examination shows an increase in medullary echogenicitiy which can be massive or appear only as an echogenic ring at the periphery of the renal pyramids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. This pattern is an early manifestation of nephrocalcinosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. This could be useful information to sonographers involved in the diagnosis of nephropathy. CT is the most accurate and sensitive technique and therefore the modality of choice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In conclusion， we considered that furosemide treatment should be part of differential diagnosis list of medullary nephrocalcinosis in adults undergoing long-term therapy with this drug， especially if the high dose of drug is used as in this case.**\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Abnormal fetal skull shape is a soft marker which indicates a higher risk of fetal aneuploidy. But evaluation of skull shape relies more on sonographer’s subjective judgement.

But the association between CI and adverse fetal outcomes is still controversial.**\n\n【16】**Method： Fourhundred twenty-five women with single pregnancywere included in our retrospective study in Tongji Hospital of Wuhan from January 1st， 2021 to December 31st， 2021.

The women’s demographic characteristics and fetal sonographic soft markers of each study group were analyzed.**\n\n【17】**Results： The demographic characteristics of each study group did not show statistical difference. Ultrasonographic gestational age increased with increasing fetal CI (p=0.0001) while the difference between clinical gestational age and ultrasonographic gestational age reduced with increasing fetal CI (p=0.0006). Fetal sonographic soft markers (p=0.09) and maternal gestational complications(p=0.09) did not show statistical difference among study groups. But statistical differences of fetal sonographic soft-markers were found between group 2 and 5 (p=0.002)， 3 and 5 (p=0.02)， 4 and5 (p=0.03). Five fetuses with CI lower than 72.0 were induced in this study due to serious fetal abnormalities. Group 3 had the highest incidence of induced labor (2.6%).**\n\n【18】**Conclusion： The fetus has the lowest incidence of fetal sonographic soft marker if the CI between76.0 and 79.9. The fetal CI seems to have no statistical associations with fetal abnormalities. Dolichocephalic fetus is more likely to be small for clinical gestational age. Maternal pregnancy complications would not affect fetal head shape as our results demonstrated.**\n\n【19】**Keywords： Fetus； Cephalic index； Antenatal diagnosis； Fetal sonographic soft marker**\n\n【20】**Introduction**\n\n【21】**Antenatal ultrasonography screening of the second trimester is the most comprehensive fetal assessment throughout pregnancy. The main object of this screening is to detect fetal abnormalities. The assessment of fetal head size is the most basic measurement ofeveryantenatal ultrasonography， which includes Biparietal Diameter (BPD) and Head Circumference (HC). According to some former literature，abnormal skull shape associates with fetal trisomy 21 because of a smaller frontal lobe would lead to a shorter frontal occipital brain length 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Moreover， fetal brain morphology， volume and growth had strong associations with skull shape 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Anomalies which may affect cerebral development could also lead to skull malformations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.**\n\n【22】**But in sonographic clinical practice， evaluating fetal skull morphology relies more on the sonographers'subjective judgements， which might lead to higher incidence of misdiagnose. Some scholastics suggested the Cephalic Index (CI) as a method to evaluate the variations of fetal skull shape. The definition of CI is the ratio of BPD to Occipitofrontal Diameters (OFD)， and multiplies by 100. According to former research， CI is gestational age-independent which remains 78.3±4.4between 14 to 40 weeks' gestation \\[4，5\\]. In a clinical practice， CI is used as a reliable indicator of dolichocephaly and brachycephaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The association between CI and adverse fetal outcomes**\n\n【23】**is still controversial. Recently， Kenneth et al. studied 597 fetuses retrospectively， a trend of CI towards significance was seen in21-trisomy fetuses， but no statistical difference was detected between study and control group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However， Kenneth Lim presented that there might be interethnic differences in CI between fetuses. Another recent study stated that a progress reduction in CI from the second trimester sonographic screening into the third trimester should be a hint of a thorough scanning of fetal cranial morphology通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【24】**Our research aims to investigate if the fetal head CI has any association with fetal sonographic soft markers. This research mainly studied the relevance between fetal head CI and the fetal sonographic soft markers. The secondary outcomes include the associations between fetal head CI and fetal structural abnormalities， fetal karyotype anomalies and/or Copy Number Variation (CNV) anomalies.**\n\n【25】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【26】**Participants**\n\n【27】**This retrospective study was approved by the ethical committee of Wuhan Tongji hospital (No.TJ-IRB20211147). This study analyzed pregnant women who came to Wuhan Tongji hospital for prenatal counselling from January 15， 2021to December 31s， 2021. One thousand eighteen pregnant women had their second trimester screening ultrasonography in our hospital were eligible for this study. Women were excluded because of multiple gestation (n=51)， taking Nuchal Translucency (NT) screening in other hospitals (n=576)， delivering in other medical institutions (n=587) or losing to follow-up. 425 women were included and analyzed in our study .**\n\n【28】**All the fetuses were examined by pediatricians and obstetricians afterbirth，and followed up from the first trimester to 42 days after birth. All UEs were done using Voluson E10 and Voluson E8 ultrasound machines (GE Healthcare， Kretz Ultrasound， Zipf， Austria) with a 4MHz to 8MHz transabdominaltransducer as defaultanda5MHz to 9MHz or 6 MHz to 12 MHz transvaginal transducer for cases in which transvaginal brain evaluation was needed. Clinical Gestational Age(CGA) was adjusted using the Crump-Rump Length (CRL) during11+0 weeks'and 13+6 weeks’ gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Fetal growth parameters were measured in each antenatal UE， which includes CRL， BPD， HC， abdominal circumference， femur length. The Ultrasonographic Gestational Age (UGA) was determined according to the growth parameters， and compared to CGA to assess whether the fetus has intrauterine growth restriction. The fetal CI was calculated using the formula described by Hadlock et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> BPD/Occipito Frontal Diameter (OFD)×100.BPD and OFD were measured at the level of the thalamus and cavum septi pellucidi plane， from the outer edge of the parietal skull (outer to inner) at the widest or longest part. BPD， OFD，HC，HC deviation of each fetus were recorded.**\n\n【29】**Grouping and analyze**\n\n【30】**All the women included in our study were grouped according to the CI of the second trimester screening ultrasonography. The woman was assigned into group 1 to 6 if the CI was less than 64.0， between 64.1 and 67.9，between 68.0 and 71.9， between 72.0 and 75.9， between 76.0 and 79.9 or more than 80.0. All the research data were compared between 6 groups . To get comparable group size of each study group， we set group intervals of 4.0 according to the maximum (91.6) and minimum (57.7) CI of our study. The demographic characteristics were compared between groups， which include women's age， gravidity and parity history， and pregnancy**\n\n【31】**complications.**\n\n【32】**Continuous variables were presented using means ± standard deviations， median and range. Categorical variables were presented with frequencies and percent's. Correlations of continuous variables between each two study groups were examined using a t-test. For categorical variables， Chi-square was used. The relative risks along with 95% confidence intervals were presented. Statistical analysis and data management were performed using GraphPad Prism 5(La Jolla， CA).**\n\n【33】**Results and Discussion**\n\n【34】**Demographic characteristics**\n\n【35】**From January 1， 2021 to December 315， 2021， a total of 425pregnant womenwere retrospectively analyzed in our study. Table 1 presented the overall demographic characteristics. And the demographic characteristics of each study group were listed in Table 2. The maternal age， gravidity and parity history， CGA did not show statistical significance among groups. Statistical differences were found in UGA among 6 groups (p<0.05)， which increases with increasing CI. The value of (CGA-UGA) reduced with increasing fetal CI and were statistically different among groups (p=0.0006).**\n\n【36】**Fetal and maternal outcomes of each group**\n\n【37】**Table 3 presented the main results of our study. We compared BPD among the six study groups. Fetal BPD and OFD seems to increase with CI and statistical differences were detected in fetal BPD and OFD among groups. Fetal Sonographic Soft Markers (SSM) in our study include thickened nuchal fold， echogenic bowel， mild ventriculomegaly， echogenic focus in the heart， choroid plexus cyst， single umbilical artery， enlarged cisterna magna， and pyelectasis. Fetal SSM and maternal gestational complications did not show statistical difference. Group 5 has the lowest fetal SSM rate (8.2%). Maternal complications did not show any statistical differences among 6 study groups or each two study groups.**\n\n【38】**Of all the women in our study， 38 had amniocentesis for fetal chromosomal/gene screening. And no serious chromosomal/gene defect was found in chromosomal/gene screening. Five women in this study chose induced labor due to serious fetal abnormalities which include fetal kidney malformation，hydrocephaly， hypospadias or multi-malformation. The CIs of the 5 induced fetuses were below71.9. The ratio of fetal gender in each study group did not show statistical differences. All the live birth fetuses complain of no serious congenital anomalies or other defects during the period of follow-up.**\n\n【39】**Table 1： Demographic characteristics of all the participants in our study.**\n\n| **Maternal age (years)**  | **31.1±4.1**  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Gravidity history**  | **2.1±1.4**  |\n| **Parity history**  | **0.4±0.6**  |\n| **CGA of second-trimester screening UE (days)**  | **162.3±5.8**  |\n| **UGA# of second-trimester screening UE& (days)**  | **160.6±1.0**  |\n| **CGA-UGA\\* (days)**  | **1.8±4.1**  |\n| **BPD=(cm)**  | **5.5±0.3**  |\n| **OFDF(cm)**  | **7.7±0.4**  |\n| **HC(cm)**  | **20.7±1.1**  |\n|  | **71.9±3.7**  |\n\n【41】**Clinical gestationalage；#； Ultrasonographicgestational age；&：Ultrasonographic examination；a： biparietal diameter；b： occipitofrontal diameters c： head circumference；d： cephalic index**\n\n【42】**Results of the fetal SSM between each two study groups**\n\n【43】**Table 4 presented the results of the fetal SSM between each oftwo study groups. Statistical differences were found between group 2 and5(p=0.002)，3 and5(p=0.02)，4and5(p=0.03). Fetal abnormality risk seems to be obvious when fetal CI is below 76.0， and the risk increases significantly if CI is less than 68.0.**\n\n【44】**Discussion**\n\n【45】**Many sonographers had impressions of abnormal fetal head shapes that might indicate of higher incidence of fetal aneuploid or other abnormalities. Those abnormal head shapes were described as “strawberry\" shaped or “lemon” shaped cranium. The judgement of fetal cranial shape relies more on sonographers’ subjective perception. Hadlock et al. proposed CI for evaluation of variations of skull shape 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.During clinical practice recently， CI was used to assess craniosynostosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> and fetal head shape 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. But the limited former researchers of CI drew different conclusions of the predictive value of CI during pregnancy. A study presented a case of rapidly decreased CI during 16 days and stated that CI could be a predictor of fetal demise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Kenneth et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> Retrospectively analyzed 46 fetuses with 18-trisomy or 21-trisomyand comparedto 551 normal controls. The CIs of 18-trisomy/21-trisomy fetuses and controls did not show statistical difference in their study. But their research found a trend towards statistical differences in Caucasian and Oriental ethnic fetuses. Similarly， another literature found no statistical association between fetal CI and Down syndrome \\[121.**\n\n【46】**In recent studies， CI was used to evaluate cranial shape and antenatal diagnosis of craniosynostosis. The cranium is diagnosed as brachycephaly if the CI is more than 85.0 and dolichocephaly if less than 75.0 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Those anomalies can possibly lead to cranium deformations， which could increase intracranial pressure and cause neurodevelopmental constrain and cognitive deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The morphology of cranial vault depends on the development of brain volume， morphology and growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Abnormalcranial morphology is usually a clinical manifestation of genetic or chromosomal disorders， infection， exposure to toxins， metabolic errors or intrauterine growth restriction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， and could possibly lead to adverse gestational outcomes. An article of last year stated that the mean CI of fetal with sagittal craniosynostosis was 74.5 in the third-trimester， statistically different from the mean CI of normal controls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. A Japanese article studied fetal brain volume by Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging as a method of antenatal evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Fetal CI was calculated using BPD and OFD measured in MR images， and a statistical correlation was detected between CI and total brain volume. Therefore， CI could be an evaluation method of not only variations of cranial shape， but also fetal brain growth.**\n\n【47】**The generally accepted fetal normal CI is 78.3± 4.4， which was reported by Hadlock et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and remains constantly from 14 to 40weeks' gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However， some scholars held different opinions. Diana et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> studied 1，361 normal fetuses and found a variation in CI with advancing gestational age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. They found fetuses of14-weeks'gestation has the highest value for CI (81.5)， and the lowest value appears at 28 weeks’ gestational age (78.0).

Ethnicity， gender， heredity and geography are the main factors causing the differentiation of CI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. According to recent Korean research， the cranial shape of Koreans had changed rapidly from mesocephalic to brachycephalic in the last century until early twenty-first century 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. However，the changing pattern has reversed to debrachycephalization in recent decades due to improvements in nutrition and health. A similar changing pattern was also detected in other countries or ethnicities， such as Japan， Mexico， Croatia， Hungary and American通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20-23\\]</u>. A Nepal study reported that the common cranial shape of Tharu population was dolichocephaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. The mean CI of the Nepal population was 75.99±4.97， different from the mean value reported by Hadlock et al. In our study， the mean CI of the 324 normal fetuses was 71.9 ± 3.7， which is lower than the value reported by Hadlock. Moreover， 253 (78.1%) of the normal fetuses were dolichocephaly because their CIs were below 75.0. And none of the normal fetuses were brachycephaly. It appears that dolichocephaly was more popular in the second-trimester of gestation. The reason for disparity of mean CI value might be ethnicity or gestational age. Large-scale research is required to verify the hypothesis.**\n\n【58】**In our 6 study groups， we found that the fetuses in group 5have the lowest incidence (8.2%) of fetal SSM， the differences have statistical significances compared with group 2 (32.8%， p=0.002)，3**\n\n【59】**(24.2%，p=0.02)and 4 (21.7%，p=0.03). Six women in our study chose to have induced labor because of serious fetal malformations. The CIs of the 6 induced-labor fetuses were all below 71.9. It seems like that fetus with a lower CI was more likely to have serious fetal structural abnormalities， which might lead to an induction of labor. The rest of fetuses in our study did not develop other abnormalities till births， and no serious neonatal complication was detected after birth. Thirty-eight women in our study had amniocentesis for fetal chromosomal/gene screening， and nonpathogenic DNA copy number variations were found in chromosomal/gene screening. However， the limited proportion of amniocentesis in this study might not be enough to analyze the statistical association between fetal CI and chromosomal/gene abnormality.**\n\n【60】**The UGA of brachycephalic fetuses are more likelytoconform with CGA. We suppose that dolichocephalic fetuses of second-trimester have a higher risk of developing intrauterine growth restriction(IUGR). However， recent research by Dana 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> studied the fetal head shapes of 65 preterm infants and deduced that dolichocephaly of the third-trimester is not associated with low birth weight of infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Further study is required to discover the association between fetal CI and IUGR**\n\n【61】**Ourstudywas conducted in Wuhan TongjiHospital. Overall， fetal CI in our study was less than the value reported by Hadlock. The fetal CI seems to have no statistical associations with fetal abnormalities. However， the fetus with a CI ranges between 76.0 and 79.9 has the lowest incidence of fetal abnormalities when compared to fetus whose CI ranges between 64.0 and 75.9. Dolichocephalic fetuses are more likely to be small for CGA. Maternal pregnancy complication would not affect fetal head shape as our results demonstrated. Because of the limited data of amniocentesis in our study， no statistical associations were detected between fetal CI and chromosomal/gene abnormality.**\n\n【62】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【63】**This research was supported by a grant from Science and**\n\n【64】Technology programs of Hubei Province 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2020CFB681)</u> and a grant from Funds of Tongji Hospital (No.2021A17).\n\n【65】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【66】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

A total of 42 bats， belonging to seven different species， were sampled from two different refuges/caves， located near to a pig fattening area where spontaneous outbreaks of PRV had occurred. Analysis by serum-virus neutralizing and immunoperoxidase monolayer assay revealed the presence of antibodies in fifteen out of 42 investigated bats (i.e. 35%)， six of them were also positive by Paramyxoviridae family using PCR assay targeting the L gene of paramyxoviruses. This case demonstrates for the first time antibodies detection of this virus in different bats species which is important for our understanding of PRV ecology， evolution and mechanism of cross-species transmission. These findings support the hypothesis that bats could act as an intermediate or natural host for interspecies transmission of certain paramyxoviruses.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Porcine orthorubulavirus； Bats； Epidemiology； Inter-species transmission**\n\n【19】**Introduction**\n\n【20】**Over the past years， a number of zoonotic and vector-borne viral diseases have emerged in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific，with fruitbats as a wildlife reservoir. Bats havebeen implicated in numerous new emerging infectious diseases， through its role as reservoirs for viruses with the ability to occasionally cross species barriers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. One family of viruses with a particularly strong link to bats is Paramyxoviridae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Bats seem to be an ancient reservoir of many paramyxovirus taxa通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， and it is possible to find a variety of paramyxovirus lineages in most bat families. In America， retrospective analyses have shown the presence of two different paramyxoviruses from the genus orthorubulavirus. One of them is Mapuera Virus (MapV) found in bats and the other is Porcine orthorubulavirus (PRV) found in pigs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Recently PRV was renamed Porcine orthorubulavirus-La Piedad Michoacan Mexico Virus (LPMV-PRV) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. This virus was actually known as La Piedad， Michoacan Virus (LPMV) and emerged spontaneously in pigs in Mexico in the early 1980s \\[6，7\\]. Veterinarians reported an outbreak of a new type of encephalitis (named blue eye disease， BED) among piglets on swine farms around the city of La Piedad， in the Mexican state of Michoacan. The clinical signs were characterized by neurological disorders in newborn piglets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and neurological and respiratory disease in suckling and growing pigs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， with or without corneal opacity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In adult pigs， clinical signs are mainly associated with reproductive failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-11\\]</u>. BED remains endemic in central and western-central parts of Mexico where there is a dense population of pigs. The disease has been serologically diagnosed in at least 16 states of Mexico， but has not yet been reported in other countries \\[12，13\\]. Since the first recognized outbreak in 1980， sporadic outbreaks of BED have continued to occur and the specific source of many of these outbreaks remains unknown. Genetic analysis has led to that PRV is classified within the genus orthorubulavirus and shows closest genetic relationship to the Mapuera virus (MapV， genus Rubulavirus) isolated from bats 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As fruit bats are considered to be the natural host of， not only MapV， but also of other related paramyxoviruses _(Hendra Virus (HeV) and Nipah， (NiV)， genus Henipavirus)， MapV and Tioman Virus (TioPV)，_ genus Rubulavirus) TioV) \\[4，14-18\\]， it has been suggested that bats could harbor the origin of the PRV responsible for the BED outbreak in pigs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Thus， there are many unanswered questions**\n\n【21】**Table 1： The number of specimens (perlocation) collected of each species of bat.**\n\n| **o Family**  | **Species**  | **Cave\\*1**  | **Cave\\*2**  | **No. of specimens**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Mormoopidae**  | **Pteronotus parnellii (Insectivorous)**  | **9**  | **0**  | **9**  |\n| **Molossidae**  | **Tadarida brasiliensis (Insectivorous)**  | **2**  | **0**  | **2**  |\n| **Phyllostomidae**  | **Artibeus hirsutus (Frugivorous)**  | **0**  | **15**  | **15**  |\n|  | **Artibeus jamaicensis (Frugivorous)**  | **4**  | **0**  | **4**  |\n|  | **Stumira filium (Frugivorous)**  |  | **1**  | **1**  |\n|  | **Glossophaga soricina (Nectarivorous)**  | **门**  | **5**  | **5**  |\n|  | **Macrotus waterhousif (Insectivorous)**  | **0**  | **1**  | **1**  |\n|  | **Desmodus rotundus (hematophagous)**  | **2**  | **1**  | **3**  |\n| **Emballonuridae**  | **Balantiopteryx plicata (Insectivorous)**  | **2**  | **0**  | **2**  |\n| **Total**  |  | **19**  | **23**  | **42**  |\n\n【23】**\\*Bat location： N. 18 42 32.4\"W 99\\*14 14.1\" 1004 MASL (cave 1)； N. 18\\*46 14.33\"W 98 537155.95\"1403 MASL (cave 2)**\n\n【24】**Case Presentation**\n\n【25】**Objectives**\n\n【26】**Study aimed to determine the antibodies presence of PRV in Mexican bats using a serological approach.**\n\n【27】**Discuss the approach about that PRV could be circulating in bat populations.**\n\n【28】**Materialand Methods**\n\n【29】**Bats were collected under the SEMARNAT DGVS permit FAUT-0211 following the guidelines of the Animal Care and Ethical Committee of Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Disciplinarias en Microbiologia Animal， INIFAP， Mexico City. The specimens were deposited at Coleccion de Mamiferos del Centro de Investigacion en Biodiversidad y Conservacion， Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Morelos. Atotal of 42 bats were caught from 2 different refuges/caves. The refuges were selected in a pig fattening area where spontaneous outbreaks of BED had occurred (central zone of Mexico). The specimen was classified by experts of Centro de Investigacion en Biodiversidad y Conservacion. In order to determine their immune state， the bats were placed under light anesthesia， bled to death， and a necropsy was conducted to collect serum and brain samples for serological analysis and PCR respectively \\[19，20\\]. Serum samples were tested by serum-virus neutralizing analysis in cell culture (VN) and Immunoperoxidase Monolayer Assay (IPMA) to PRV. All tests were performed by standard protocols \\[8，11\\].

The refuges were selected in a pig fattening area where spontaneous outbreaks of BED had occurred. Neutralizing antibodies against PRV were detected in 7serum samples with titers ranging between 1：20 to 1：1280. IPMA confirmed the presence of antibodies against PRV in all of the VN positive bat serum， as well as showed positive result for 8 additional bat serum samples with titers ranging from 1：10 to 1：40 serum dilutions. IPMA positive samples were characterized by the presence ofa fewirregular structures stained red in the cytoplasm， representing inclusion-like bodies . Serum from the controls were positive and negative respectively . Additionally， 6 out of 15 serological positive samples showed PCR positive result within _the Paramyxoviridae family； Avulavirus-Rubulavirus genus ._ Only a single sequence of 268 positions (access number MT636875) was correct assembly and the alignment results showed a nucleotide identity of 90.87% to PRV， 71.64% to MapV， 75.46% to Parainfluenza virus 5， 72.31% to Mumps virus，73.58% to Batparamyxovirus，73.56%to Tuhoko virus 2 and 72.37% to Menangle virus.

One of them is Mapuera virus， that was isolated from the salivary glands of a yellow-shouldered bat(Sturnira lilium) captured in the tropical rainforest of Brazil in 1979通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u> and the other is a Porcine rubulavirus (PRV) that was isolated from pigs and that was shown to be the causative agent behind several disease outbreaks in pigs in the early 1980's \\[6，7\\]. Molecular studies of PRV suggest that PRV has existed as a separated species for a long time in nature and that it could have been transmitted from a natural wildlife reservoir to domesticated pigs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29-31\\]</u>. More recent studies of these two viruses， comparing the completed genome sequence and the genome organization， indicates that PRV is more closely related to MapV than to other members of the subfamily Rubulavirinae suggesting that PRV may， possibly， also been originated from bat通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In addition， a serological analysis in 108 non-hematophagous bats from the Central Pacific coast of Mexico， showed the presence of antibodies against PRV in insectivorous bat (Rhogeessa parvula major). However， due to as a single bat was seropositive； the authors suggest that a bat in the surveyed localities does not play a role in the epidemiology of PRV. Thus， in this study serological analysis showed seropositivity in 15/42 of the investigated serum samples. The percentage of seropositive bats was high compared to the study from 2004 where only 1 of 108 bats was seropositive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. However， the sampling in this study was done at a location in a central zone of Mexico where spontaneous outbreaks of BED occurred； which could explain the differences observed. Also all bats， in this study， were trapped in two caves containing a dense bat population of mixed species. This close coexistence may play an important role in spreading the virus in this particular bat population by allowing easier transmission between immune and naive individuals and between different species through certain behaviors， such as mutual grooming and biting during mating 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Thus the presence of anti-PRV antibodies in the bat specimens， suggests that PRV is indeed circulating in bat populations. However， we cannot rule out that this is a related virus with cross-reactivity to PRV.In addition， some seropositive bat samples were PCR negative， it could be speculated that these individuals could carry the virus in other organs not tested in this study. The phylogenetic analysis of the unique aligned sequence， grouped together with PRV-LPMV， suggesting that they could belong to the same species of the porcine orthorubulavirus.**\n\n【39】**Conclusion**\n\n【40】**These findings provide serological evidence that bats could act as an intermediate or natural host of PRV. However， future studies are required to investigate the infection in bats， to determine the exact role of bats in PRV epidemiology， the tropism and the behavior of the virus in nature. Also further genetic analysis could be valuable to understand the evolution of the virus.**\n\n【41】**Funding**\n\n【42】The present work received support from The Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences， Sweden， SAGARPA-CONACYT-12159 and CENID-SAI/INIFAP (Mexico).\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Acknowledgment**</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**The authors would like to thank for the technical assistance MSc Laura Marquez Valdelamar (Instituto de Biologia， UNAM) and Ernesto Castrejon-Espinoza (Comite de Fomento y Proteccion Pecuaria y Salud Animal del Estado de Morelos A.C.).**</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

The majority of cases are a result of blunt mechanisms in India. Among these injuries， rib fractures are considered the most frequent type of clinically significant blunt thoracic trauma and are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Despite a large number of cases annually， there are no internationally recognized guidelines for rib fracture treatment yet. This controversy in treatment options can be attributed to the lack of high level convincing clinical research that confirms the benefits of surgical fixation over conservative treatment measures. Despite these developments， so far multiple clinical studies are required to prove the superiority ofone system over another. In this article， we would like to share our experience in this field including indications for surgical rib fixation and advantages of such procedures in complex chest trauma.**\n\n【5】**Keywords： Rib fractures； Rib fixation； Chest injury； Pulmonary contusion**\n\n【6】**Introduction**\n\n【7】**Chest injuries most often affect the ribs， upper part ofthe abdomen， lungs， blood vessels， heart， muscles， soft tissues， and breastbone. Sometimes the esophagus， collarbone， or shoulder blade is also injured. The chest can be injured by blunt force (such as in motor vehicle crashes， falls， or sports injuries) or by an object that penetrates it (such as a bullet or knife).

However， sometimes in older people who have osteoporosis， only a slight force (as occurs in a minor fall) is required. The fracture itself is rarely serious， although the force that caused the fracture occasionally causes other problems， such as a bruised lung (pulmonary contusion) or a collapsed lung (pneumothorax). An injury that fractures the lower ribs sometimes also damages the liver or spleen. The more ribs that are broken， the more likely lungs or other organs are to be damaged. Flail chest can result if several adjacent ribs are broken in more than one place. In flail chest， a segment of the chest wall separates from the rest and moves in the opposite direction from the rest of the chest wall when a person breathes. Breathing becomes more difficult and tiring. Usually， a blow strong enough to cause flail chest also bruises the lung beneath the injured area.**\n\n【23】**_Copyright C 2021 Sanjay Shah.

Initial patient's reports of patient showed an increase in creatinine with decrease in hemoglobin and leucocytosis， which later improved following Intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation and 2 units of packed red blood cell transfusion. Patient was shifted to our facility with increasing respiratory distress. Patient was tachycardiac， tachypneic**\n\n【33】**NRBM (Non-Rebreather Mask) on arrival to ER (Emergency Room). On examination Bilateral Air entry was decreased with paradoxical chest movements on right side. Immediately Intercostal Drainage(ICD) insertion was done on bilateral 5h intercostal space in mid axillary line and attached with water sealed bag. A collection of 500ml in left ICD bag and 200 ml in right ICD bag was seen. Patient was managed with IV antibiotics，IV analgesics， IV antiemetic， IV antacid， IV fluids and shifted to ICU. CT thorax plain was repeated showing left1 to 7 rib fracture and right 1 to 9lh rib fracture with subcutaneous emphysema mild hemothorax with pulmonary contusion and bilateral ICD in situ . Three unit of blood transfusion was given over next 48 h. Patient had increasing respiratory distress due to paradoxical chest wall movement which required BiPAP (Bi-level positive airway pressure) initially and later on invasive ventilator support in ICU. Hence it was planned for surgical fixation of rib fractures bilaterally. Next day， bilateral rib fixation of right 5h and6h rib fractures and left 54， 6h and 7th rib fractures done with using 2.5mm 8 hole with gap titanium plates and 10 mm cortical screws. Post rib fixation patient was transferred to ICU and kept on mechanical ventilation and could successfully extubated after 24 h and was maintaining saturation on 4 L/min oxygen by normal mask without respiratory distress . His pain score was 9/10 preoperatively with medications which reduced to 4/10 postoperatively. Left ICD was removed after 2 days and right ICD was removed after 3 days postoperatively . Patient was mobilized on post-op day 2**\n\n【34】**by unassisted walking and was doing incentive spirometry exercises regularly as advised. He was discharged on 5h postoperative day without any infective consequences like atelectasis， pnemonitis or surgical site infection .**\n\n【35】**Discussion**\n\n【36】**Multiple rib fractures are one of the most common causes of death in trauma patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Most patients do not undergo rib fixation and are managed conservatively. Factors that were associated with a higher morbidity and mortality included severe associated thoracic injuries， a high ISS (Injury Severity Score)， the presence of shock， falls from heights， and the combination of pulmonary contusion and flail chest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Among cohort of 1490 patients with blunt chest trauma， mortality was associated with presence of flail chest in addition to number of fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Flail chest alone is associated with mortality of 16% to 17% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Mortality risk increased to 42% when pulmonary contusion was present in addition to flail 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Surgical rib fixation study done by Leinecke showed a 57% decrease in mortality， 55%lower risk of pneumonia and 75% lower risk of tracheostomy while Slobogean study showed 57% lower odds of mortality， 55% lower odds of pneumonia， 75% lower odds of tracheostomy and 64% lower odds of septicemia \\[5，6\\]. Both this studies also showed the decreased ventilator duration， decreased ICU stay and decreased hospital stay with surgery \\[5，6\\]. 84% patient post-surgical rib fixation were found to have no pain after 2 to 4 weeks of surgery\\[5，6\\]. Forced vital capacity post surgical rib fixation was found to be 84% at 3 months and 85%at 6 months of a normal lung， while the Forced Expiratory Volume**\n\n【37】**(FEV1) was found to be 77% at 3 months and 79% at 6 months of normal lung \\[5，6\\]. In a 16-month survey， Majercik found that of the patients who were employed - 33 of 36 (92%) patients returned to work at the same job that they did pre-injury while the mean time to get back to full-time work was 7.9±1.0 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Majercik measured satisfaction with Rib Fixation on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 1 being not satisfied at all， and 10 being very satisfied) patients (n=50) rated their experience with Rib Fixation and the results of the procedure as 9.2±0.2 while 94% stated that they would recommend the surgery to injured friends/family \\[7，8\\].**\n\n【38】**Conclusion**\n\n【39】**Thus in our case the patient was managed with bilateral multiple rib fixation that resulted in faster recovery，lower risk ofcomplications and better prognosis than conservative management.**\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

The patient recovered without any sequala. HSV-1 meningitis is exceptional but could be more frequently observed linked to the epidemiological changes in HSV infections.**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Herpes Simplex Viruses (HSV) is known to invade the Central Neural System (CNS). HSV type 1 usually moves via the trigeminal and/or olfactory ganglia to the CNS， where it replicates， and causing life-threatening encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. HSV type 2 spreads from the sacral ganglia and is responsible for benign， spontaneously resolved but often recurrent， Mollaret’s meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.**\n\n【18】**This report describes the case of an immunocompetent 11 year-old boy admitted in emergency to the Toulouse University Pediatric Hospital in November 2019 suffering from a fever， pulsatile frontal headache，neck stiffness，phono-photophobia， nausea and vomiting. The fever，headache and vomiting appeared ten days earlier in a context of a herpes-like gingivostomatitis.**\n\n【19】**Physical examination confirmed the pyrexia and meningitis with no focal neurological deficit or symptoms of encephalitis. He had no rash or vesicular eruption. The admission cranial computed tomography scan was normal.**\n\n【20】**Examination of the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) revealed pleocytosis (548 cells/pl， 100%lymphocytes) and increased protein (2.7 N). CSF gram staining was negative as were cultures. Multiplex PCR targeting CNS bacterial， viral and fungal pathogens (n=14) (Film Array Meningitis/Encephalitis panel - BioFire Diagnostics， BioMerieux， France) was positive for HSV-1. This was confirmed with a specific in-house molecular system for detecting HSV-1 and 2 genomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The serum/blood C-reactive protein and white blood cell count were normal. Tests for HSV-1 and HSV-2 genomes were negative； that for anti-HSV-1 IgG was positive and that for anti-HSV-2 IgG was negative (Liaison XL HSV-1 and HSV-2 Type**\n\n【21】**Specific IgG-DiaSorin， Italy). At one month a control test for anti-HSV-1 IgG showed a four-fold increase in antibody titer. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging at diagnosis gave normal patterns.**\n\n【22】**The patient was given intravenous acyclovir (500 mg/m’every 8 h) for 2 weeks. He completely recovered and was discharged without any sequela. The detailed medical history， clinical manifestations and their evolution， anti-HSV-1-IgG kinetic suggest that the gingivostomatitis reflected a pauci-symptomatic HSV-1 primary infection. The virus probably migrated via the neurons to the CNS at the same time as the gingivostomatitis but needed 10 days to produce meningitis.**\n\n【23】**This case is one of exceptionally pure HSV-1 meningitis， with no clinical or radiological signs of encephalitis. HSV-1 has never， to our knowledge， been associated with such a syndrome， unlike enteroviruses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and HSV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， which can both result in viral meningitis.

Peritoneovenous shunts are an option when medical treatment or radiological shunts have failed or are contraindicated. The aim of this study was to see if in those patients with intractable ascites awaiting or considered unsuitable for liver transplantation， the insertion of aperitoneovenous shunt improved the clinical outcome of the patient.**\n\n【13】**Materials and Methods： Patients who had insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt for intractable ascites between January 2012 and October 2017 were studied. Clinical and biochemical data was compared before and after shunt insertion and outcomes reviewed.**\n\n【14】**Results： Fourteen patients who had a peritoneovenous shunt inserted were recruited into the study. The main indication was ascites arising from cirrhosis due to alcohol (43%). Of nine patients discharged from hospital， 8 (89%) decreased their ascites， with 4 of them (44%) not requiring further paracentesis. All 6 patients with renal impairment who were discharged improved their renal function after shunt insertion.**\n\n【15】**Discussion and Conclusion： Insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt is an option for patients with refractory ascites not responding to medical treatment， when other therapies are contraindicated. In addition to palliation of symptoms， it also improves clinical outcomes and can serve as a bridge to liver transplantation.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Ascites； Drainage； Liver Failure； Peritoneovenous**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Formation of ascites is the first sign of decompensation of liver disease in approximately half of cirrhotic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The etiology of ascites is multifactorial but revolves around sinusoidal hypertension producing outflow obstruction and increased retention of sodium and water in the kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The progression from compensated to decompensated disease， and refractory ascites not responding to diuretics results in a debilitating condition severely limiting the quality and length of life of the patient. Leveen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> first described the use of a surgically inserted single valve unidirectional shunt to return the ascitic fluid to the circulation in 1974. Since then several modifications have been made to make it more efficient and compact. We report our experience ofusing Peritoneovenous Shunts (PVS) in a single institution where liver transplantation is readily available. Our aim was to see if in those patients with intractable ascites awaiting or considered unsuitable for liver transplantation， the insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt improved the clinical outcome of the patient.**\n\n【19】**Methods**\n\n【20】**Patients who had insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt for intractable ascites from January 2012till October 2017 were studied. Case notes were reviewed retrospectively for each patient. Patient demographics were collected. Clinical and biochemical data was compared before insertion of shunt and post-operatively. Patients were usually considered for PVS if Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunting (TIPS) was contraindicated due to portal vein thrombosis， synthetic dysfunction， and malignancy， history of encephalopathy or short life expectancy. Patients whose peritoneovenous shunt was inserted for conditions unrelated to liver disease were excluded (Figure1).**\n\n【21】**Denver shunts (Denver Biomaterials， Golden， CO， USA) were used for this purpose and were**\n\n【22】**inserted surgically. A Denver shunt is a device consisting of two catheters connected to a flexible pump chamber containing one or two valves. A. small transverse subcostal incision is made. The rectus sheath is opened， muscle split， peritoneal cavity entered and ascites drained. In our institution enough ascites is drained as to make the patient comfortable. Depending on the amount drained， albumin may or may not be given. The fenestrated peritoneal limb is inserted through this opening into the peritoneal cavity and secured using purse string sutures. The muscles are approximated. Another incision is made at the level of the sternocleidomastoid in the neck. The venous catheter of the device is then tunneled subcutaneously and inserted through a venotomy made in the internal jugular vein， with the distal tip positioned into the superior vena cava/right atrial junction， and is also secured with sutures. The pump chamber is positioned in the lower chest and it is pumped to prime the device and the wounds are both closed. Prophylactic antibiotics are given for 24 h and the patient is instructed to press the chamber five times on four occasions each day in order to maintain patency ofthe shunt and prevent thrombosis at the tip of the venous catheter.**\n\n【23】**When the intra-abdominal pressure is 3 mmHg above the central venous pressure， ascitic fluid moves into the shunt and back into the circulation. The valves in the pump chamber prevent reflux of blood into the chamber. We use shunts with double valves. If a shunt with a single valve is used， as is ideal with thick viscous fluid like chylous ascites，the patient has to manually compress the venous catheter after pumping to prevent reflux. When diuretics have been stopped pre-operatively because of intolerance， they can be reintroduced gradually until the fluid overload is resolved. The patients were followed up till their death or July 2018. An interactive online software was used for statistical analysis and can be found at http：//www.quantpsy. org/chisq/chisq.htm. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.**\n\n【24】**Results**\n\n【25】**Baseline characteristics**\n\n【26】**Between January 2012 and October 2017， 16 patients with medically intractable ascites had insertion of a Denver shunt. Two patients with ascites secondary to chronic pancreatitis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia were excluded. Patient demographics are shown in Table 1. The cause of ascites is shown in Table 2. The main indication was ascites arising from cirrhosis due to alcohol related liver disease (43%) followed by hepatitis C (22%). 57% of patients had renal impairment with a median estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) of 54 mL/min/1.73 m² (IQR 42 to 90)， 64% had a history of variceal bleeding， 50% had previous episodes of hepatic encephalopathy and 36% had had spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Only one patient was listed for liver transplantation due to medical contraindications in the other patients， including persistent drinking， high cardiac risk for surgery， malnutrition， and sarcopenia.**\n\n【27】**Complications**\n\n【28】**Of 14 patients， 3 died within thirty days of valve insertion， with a 30-day mortality rate of 21%. A patient with Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis died within 9 days whilst another one with cystic fibrosis related liver disease died 13 days after insertion， both due to continued liver decompensation， rather than related to shunt insertion. Another patient with HCV recurrence in a liver graft (transplanted 8 years previously)， died 30 days after insertion due to sepsis and gastrointestinal bleeding.

This responded to antibiotics but was too unwell to have it removed. This patient had gastrointestinal bleeding and died two months postshunt insertion.

Serum bilirubin was lower post shunt in those who were relieved of their ascites. This reached statistical significance (p=0.001). Table 3 compares median variables pre- and post-shunt insertion in relation to clinical progress， i.e. whether they improved or not.**\n\n【39】**Of 9 patients who survived longer term follow up， 4 (44%) were permanently relieved of ascites and did not require further paracentesis. Four patients were improved but 3 patients required one paracentesis and one patient two paracentesis post-procedure. Pre-operatively the majority of these patients required weekly large volume paracentesis， giving a success rate in those patients who make it out of hospital of 89%. One patient (11%) was not helped by the shunt.

He recompensated and his liver function tests remained well， obviating the need for a liver transplant. One patient with Primary Bilary Cirrhosis was successfully transplanted 8 months after insertion and is clinically well 19 months post insertion.

Two patients with ALD and HCV cirrhosis died 26months after the PVS. In both cases the ascites was relieved although the patient with ALD required two further paracentesis. A patient with NASH was relieved of ascites but died 3 months post insertion. Another patient with ALD died at 8 months post insertion. The PVS did not relieve the ascites in this case.**\n\n【45】**Discussion**\n\n【46】**Leveen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， in their original paper， described their experience of 45 patients with intractable ascites treated with a Le Veen shunt. As in our series， some of these patients (n=9) were in the terminal phase of their disease. Two required shunt removal following infection. Of 34 patients， 26 (76%) cleared their ascites at a follow up of six to eighteen months. The authors confirmed this finding in a later paper通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> reporting their further experience with PVS. Of 9 patients with hepatorenal syndrome， 5 improved after PVS. These two papers showed that resolution of ascites led to better nutrition and increased muscle mass， as patients are able to eat more.**\n\n【47】**Subsequently， there have been conflicting reports as to the efficacy or otherwise of PVS. A comparison with TIPS by Rosemurgy et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> randomized 32 patients with medically intractable ascites to either TIPS or PVS. Median duration of shunt patency was similar between the two groups but assisted shunt patency (i.e. after intervention to unblock or replace the shunt) was longer after TIPS (31.1 months vs.13.1 months， p<0.01). Survival after TIPS was 28.7 months vs. 16.1months after PVS. Control of ascites was achieved more rapidly after PVS then TIPS (73% vs. 46% at 1 month) but longer-term efficacy favored TIPS (85% vs. 40% at 3 years). The authors of this paper therefore concluded that TIPS should be preferentially used if the patient with intractable ascites had prospects of long-term survival and concluded that their paper was “A requiem for peritoneovenous shunt.\"**\n\n【48】**Dumortier et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> compared 36 patients who had PVS insertion after being listed for liver transplantation with a historical cohort of 18 patients listed for transplantation without PVS insertion. The authors found that PVS provided effective palliation in 30 patients(83%) and median glomerular filtration rate improved significantly from 0.642 to 0.987 ml/s (p<0.05). Of 36 patients listed， 18 were transplanted. When compared to the historical cohort， they found that the incidence of post liver transplantation renal failure was significantly lower in the PVS cohort (3/18 vs. 13/18，p<0.05). During liver transplant， red blood cell transfusion requirements were significantly lower in the PVS groups (4 units vs. 7 units，p<0.05) and**\n\n【49】**concluded that PVS could be effective bridging therapy for listed transplantation candidates with refractory ascites， when the waiting time to transplant is not long.**\n\n【50】**More recently， Piccirrillo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> reported on 62 patients with intractable ascites who were not suitable for TIPS or regular paracentensis and underwent insertion of PVS. Median survival was13 months in patients with no complications，8 months in those with transient pain，and 3 months in those with blockage or infection. After shunt surgery，35 patients(56%) did not require paracentesis， 20(32%) required a single paracentesis，while 7 (12%) needed two paracentesis. Won et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> also reported their experience of percutaneous placement of Denver shunt in 55 patients with refractory ascites. 17 of these patients had ascites secondary to carcinomatosis. Symptomatic improvement was achieved in all but one patient. The overall survival rate was 70.3% at 30 days， 44.6% at 180 days，and 30.9% at 1 year， with a mean shunt patency of 77.5%. From the studies mentioned above only the latter one included malignant ascites. The other studies were concerned mainly with hepatic ascites arising mostly from either alcohol or viral related cirrhosis. Only the study by Rosemurgy et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> included patients being considered for liver transplantation.**\n\n【51】**Our group of patients was a heterogeneous group and included patients with end-stage liver disease and malignant hepatobiliary disease. Our overall mortality rate of 21% at 30 days has to be taken in context of some patients being very sick with disease at time of insertion. In several studies mentioned above， patients who were at the terminal stage of their disease were excluded. Our morbidity rate of 43% also compares well， with rates in the above studies varying from 18% to 50%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. Our out of hospital efficacy rate of 89% is similar to figures mentioned above. Even in the palliative setting the PVS helped. In one patient the PVS served as a bridge to liver transplantation. Another patient who was declined for liver transplant because of co-morbidities， improved to the point of recompensation postshunt insertion and not requiring transplantation. In those patients who were relieved of ascites， bilirubin and renal function improved， although the latter didn’t reach statistical significance.**\n\n【52】**An automated subcutaneous pump which moves ascites from the peritoneal cavity into the bladder has also been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In a recent randomized trial， this pump significantly decreases the requirements for paracentesis compared with standard large volume paracentesis. There was also a significant higher rate of adverse events in the automated pump group (mainly acute kidney injury and pump related issies) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.**\n\n【53】**Our study is a retrospective study with small numbers. However， peritoneovenous shunts continue to have a definite role in the management of selected patients with intractable ascites in the era of liver transplantation. They are of value if TIPS is contraindicated， and may improve renal function， even in patients with established hepatorenal syndrome. PVS can also be used effectively as a palliative measure and as a bridge to liver transplantation.**\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\. Planas R， Balleste B.

His heart rate was regular and blood pressure was 166/96mmHg. A chest computed tomographic scan revealed a massive pericardial effusion associated with type B aortic dissection. His family told us that he had a history of hypothyroidism， and that he had stopped taking medicine several years prior by his judgment. Blood test revealed that thyroid stimulating hormone， free triiodothyronine， and free thyroxine level were 200.93pU/ml， 0.88pg/ml， and below 0.1ng/dl， respectively. We strongly suspected that hypothyroidism caused the chronic pericardial effusion without apparent hemodynamic relevance. To get a definite diagnosis of the effusion， we drained the effusion through the left antero-lateral thoracotomy， considering a subsequent pericardial fenestration to the left pleural cavity. Then， we confirmed that the pericardial effusion was caused by chronic hypothyroidism because of a yellowish and transparent fluid. Treatment for hypothyroidism was initiated postoperatively.

Acute accumulation can cause cardiac tamponade associated with hemodynamic instability. By contrast， chronic fluid accumulation typically presents with limited clinical symptoms. Herein， we report a case of massive pericardial effusion associated with type B acute aortic dissection.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 73-year-old man was transferred to our emergency room with a sudden onset of severe back pain. The patient could not get us his medical history， as he was under mechanical ventilation for the intractable pain. However， his family told us that he had a history of hypothyroidism， but he decided to stop taking medicine several years prior by his own judgment. No other past and family histories were informed. Physical examination revealed normal heart sounds with no murmurs， and normal breathing sounds. His heart rate was regular and blood pressure was 166/96 mmHg. Electrocardiogram revealed a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 48 beats per minute. A chest computed tomographic scan revealed a massive pericardial effusion and type B aortic dissection with a small amount of pleural effusion . No intimal flap was observed in the ascending aorta and aortic arch. Dissection between the descending aorta and the bilateral common iliac arteries was observed. Echocardiographic findings revealed a massive pericardial effusion without paradoxical movements of the right heart showing cardiac tamponade and valve diseases.**\n\n【19】**Laboratory tests showed a c-reactive protein of 0.45mg/dl and a white blood cell count of 4，100/ug. Other blood tests revealed creatine phosphokinase of 1038U/L， total cholesterol of 187mg/dl， and triglyceride of 117mg/dl. In addition， thyroid stimulating hormone， free triiodothyronine， and free thyroxine level were 200.93pU/ml，0.88pg/ml， and below 0.1ng/dl， respectively. His stable hemodynamic condition with the massive pericardial effusion prevented us from performing a median sternotomy for drainage of the effusion. We chose a small left anterolateral thoracotomy for drainage considering a subsequent pericardial fenestration to the left pleural cavity. The effusion was yellowish and transparent. Then， we confirmed a chronic pericardial effusion induced by a long-**\n\n【20】**Figure 1： Preoperative chest computed tomographic scan(a-f).

The aortic dissection remained unchanged in diameter and longitudinal range for two weeks. The patient was transferred to another hospital for continued treatments for both diseases. He was doing well， without pericardial effusion and aortic enlargement， under a euthyroid condition 10 months after the surgery.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**Heart failure， type A aortic dissection， and pericarditis can produce accumulation of pericardial effusion， which can result in hemodynamic deterioration because of its rapid progress. Systemic diseases such as hypothyroidism， systemic lupus erythematosus， and renal failure are also associated with pericardial effusion \\[1，2\\]. Slowly developing pericardial effusion is seldom associated with clinical symptoms. By contrast， rapid accumulation of the effusion can result in cardiac tamponade even in a systemic disease \\[3，4\\].**\n\n【25】**Pericardial effusion is a common clinical manifestation in patients with hypothyroidism， although it is often unrelated to disease severity通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Dattilo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> reported a case of subclinical hypothyroidism with a ubiquitous pericardial effusion. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by elevated serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone， with normal levels of free thyroid hormones.

Some tumor localizations are extremely rare， such as SCC of the recto vaginal septum. To our knowledge this would be the third reported case of this entity.**\n\n【15】**Case Report： A 67-year-old， G2P2 female presented with impending large bowel obstruction. The CT showed a 7 cm mass anterior to the rectosigmoid colon， 8 cm from the anal verge， in close approximation to the uterus. Cervical exam and rectal mucosa on endoscopy were normal. Several deep endoscopic biopsies of the mass showed invasive squamous cell carcinoma， p16 positive. Treatment consisted of pelvic radiation therapy 45 Gy in 25 fractions， with subsequent reduced field boosts to the mass achieving a final dose of 65 Gy with concurrent cisplatinum at a dose of 40 mg/m²weekly. Surgery was performed 6.5 months after completion oftreatment. Pathology report showed no evidence of residual disease.**\n\n【16】**Conclusion： Because of the rarity of this entity there is a lack of evidence to guide management. Follow up imaging with MRI and PET CT may be difficult to interpret. Definitive treatment with chemo radiation may be a viable option given the complete pathologic response in this case.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 67-year-old， G2P2， retired female school teacher， presented with impending large bowel obstruction. She had a 3-month history of lower abdominal discomfort， bloating and a 2-month history of inability to have a bowel movement， but she was able to pass small-caliber pellets with no evidence of bleeding.**\n\n【19】**There had been no vaginal bleeding or discharge and Pap smears were normal up to 2017. Her family physician diagnosed diverticulitis， started antibiotics empirically， and ordered a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. The CT demonstrated of a 7 cm mass arising anterior to the rectosigmoid colon， 8 cm from the anal verge， in close approximation to the uterus. Prominent left iliac nodes were noted， up to 1.2 cm in diameter.**\n\n【20】**She was referred to a surgical oncologist and underwent a colonoscopy. The mass was encountered 8 cm to 10 cm from the anal verge， slightly to the left of midline. The overlying mucosa was completely normal in appearance. The scope was navigated past the mass and the remainder of the colon was normal apart from diverticulosis. Several endoscopic biopsies of the mass showed invasive squamous cell carcinoma， p16 positive.**\n\n【21】**She subsequently was referred to a gynecologist. The exocervix was normal on examination. A Pap smear and endometrial biopsy were taken and were normal. On bimanual pelvirectal exam， the recto vaginal septum was thin and smooth and the mass was palpable at the tip of the examining finger. Origin in the high cervical stroma could not be ruled out.**\n\n【22】**At this point the differential diagnosis included a stage 3B cervical cancer， primary tumour of the rectovaginal septum， or primary squamous cancer of the rectum.**\n\n【23】**Pelvic MRI  identified the mass arising behind the cervix and anterior to the**\n\n【24】**Figure 1： Pelvic MRI T2： Upper panel shows sagittal images. Lower panel corresponding axial images. A/B： Baseline； C/D： Immediately post-treatment completion； E/F： 5 months after treatment.**\n\n【25】**lower rectum and confirmed the proximal left internal iliac lymph node. FDG PET scan  showed the highly FDG-avid6 cm mass with SUVmax of 30， centered just anterior to the low anterior rectal wall abutting the posterior margin of the cervix. The cervix itself did not have any uptake. There was a 1.4 cm left internal iliac lymph node with SUVmax of 19.8. There was no other evidence of any lymphadenopathy or metastatic disease.**\n\n【26】**Squamous cell carcinoma antigen was elevated at 11 ug/L.**\n\n【27】**She was then referred to radiation oncology for assessment and management. As she had significant rectal obstruction， a diverting colostomy was performed prior to initiating treatment. Although the site of origin was still uncertain，the p16 positive squamous pathology suggested that the best course of action would be definitive radiation with concurrent cisplatin as per primary cervical cancer management. Both GI and gynecology multidisciplinary tumor boards concurred.**\n\n【28】**Radiation therapy consisted of 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the pelvis， with an integrated boost to 52.5 Gy to the involved left iliac lymph node. A Volumetric Modulated Arc Technique (VMAT) was used. Concurrent cisplatinum was administered at a dose of 40 mg/m²weekly. Since brachytherapy was not an option as it would be for a cervical primary， a VMAT boost was planned for a dose of 10 Gy in 5fractions to the residual primary mass. Replanning for an additional final phase of 10 Gy in 5 fractions allowed for further volume reduction as primary tumor mass had shrunk from 105 cc to 17 cc during the course of treatment. This brought the tumor dose to 65 Gy with concurrent platinum for the first 45 Gy. Treatment duration was7.5 weeks (52 days).**\n\n【29】**An MRI on the final day of treatment  showed**\n\n【30】**marked decrease in size measuring 3.2 cmx2.5 cm seemingly arising from the anterior wall of the rectum. The adenopathy was resolved. Her case was presented again at multidisciplinary conference as to whether surgical clearance was indicated given the residual disease. There was no clear consensiis.**\n\n【31】**Squamous cell carcinoma antigen had decreased from 11 ug/L to1.6 ug/L after treatment.**\n\n【32】**Two months after treatment she was well with overall functional status ECOG 0. On examination， there was no evidence of any residual mass between the cervix and the rectum， and the rectal space was quite clear. MRI and PET-CT  at 3 months after treatment showed further interval reduction in the residual tumor with significant decrease in FDG activity to SUVmax 6.8. The pelvic lymphadenopathy had resolved. Her case was presented at the multidisciplinary conference again， and the recommendation was to give her additional time to reevaluate response.**\n\n【33】**Two and a half months later (5.5 months from treatment) FDG PET-CT  showed a persistent exophytic mass on the anterior left rectum abutting the lower cervical segment measuring2.4 cm with a SUVmax of 8.3， and apparent involvement of the posterior lower cervical segment with a SUVmax of 9.6. There was also a new left external iliac lymph node measuring 0.9 cm with an SUVmax of 3.6. MRI  4 days later showed further interval size reduction， with the residual now measuring 2.5 cm， with no evidence of adenopathy.**\n\n【34】**Given the suspicion of residual disease in a location not easily accessible to ongoing surveillance or assessment， such as colposcopy or biopsy， it was decided the safest and most definitive course**\n\n【35】Figure 2： FDG PET-CT： Upper panel shows axial images. Lower panel corresponding coronal images. A/B： Baseline； C/D： 3 months post treatment； E/F： 5 months post treatment.\n\n【36】**of management would be a low anterior resection with en bloc hysterectomy， bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and diverting loop ileostomy.**\n\n【37】**Surgery was performed 6.5 months after completion oftreatment. Pathology report showed no evidence of residual disease. The “rectal mass” was comprised of foamy histiocytes and fibrosis extending from submucosa into pericolic fat， mild crypt architectural distortion and overlying mucosa with no dysplasia or malignancy. Thirty-two lymph nodes were removed and all were negative for carcinoma. Endocervical glandular epithelium showed atypia in keeping with radiation， but no cervical squamous epithelium was present.**\n\n【38】**She recovered well from surgery and underwent closure of the loop ileostomy 10 months after treatment. Given her complete pathologic response， no further adjuvant treatment is indicated. She will continue follow ups with SCC tumor marker， physical examination and periodic cross sectional imaging surveillance. SCC antigen remains normal at 1.1 ug/L.**\n\n【39】**Discussion**\n\n【40】**Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is a well described malignancy in pelvic cancers， especially those of the uterine cervix and anal canal associated with HPV infection \\[1，2\\].

The rectovaginal septum is a layer of connective tissue that separates the anterior wall of the rectum from**\n\n【42】**the posterior wall of the vagina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Tumors that arise from this location are mostly from endometriosis foci， and can undergo malignant transformation in about 1% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Other non-endometriosis tumors have been reported， such as Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GISTs)， adenocarcinoma， sarcomas or metastases from other sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.**\n\n【43】**Primary squamous cell carcinoma of rectum is also an extremely rare entity， accounting for 0.3% of all histological subtypes in this location， with an incidence of 1.9 to 3.5 per million population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Even though there is a strong association of Human Papilloma Virus(HPV) with anal squamous cell carcinoma， there is not enough evidence to support its correlation with primary rectal squamous cell carcinoma 7\\].**\n\n【44】**Symptoms vary in relation to the size of the tumor and degree of infiltration. Although about half of rectovaginal septum tumors remain asymptomatic， the most common symptoms include urinary retention， vaginal pressure， pelvic pain， and bleeding \\[4，5\\]. Our patient also experienced bowel obstruction requiring bowel diversion.**\n\n【45】**Extension from a gynecological or anal carcinoma should be ruled out. In addition， metastases to the rectum from other organs， or a fistulous tract involving the rectal area， can both masquerade as rectal carcinoma 7\\].**\n\n【46】**Physical examination and direct observation with colposCOpV and/or colonoscopy are extremely important. Changes in the mucosa of the cervix， anal canal or rectum can indicate a possible tumor etiology. In our case， the mucosa of the uterine cervix， the anal canal and rectum appeared completely normal， making the diagnosis of a rectovaginal septum SCC more likely.**\n\n【47】**Complementary imaging is also important to assess local and systemic extension. Transvaginal ultrasound is useful and can be complemented with an MRI \\[4，7\\]. PET-CT is also useful to determine systemic extension. There is no consensus as to the gold standard in investigation of this entity.**\n\n【48】**Serum SCC-antigen (SCCag) as a tumor marker for diagnosis and follow up lacks supporting evidence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， but may be useful to follow treatment response and screen for recurrence. Because of the rarity of this presentation and lack of evidence to guide management， there is not a definitive consensus on the optimal management. Patient involvement and preferences may be considered in the decision-making. Although the literature seems to favor a primary surgical approach， chemo radiation is clearly an alternative option in these radiosensitive tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.**\n\n【49】**Follow up imaging with MRI and PET-CT are both useful， although interpretations of findings can be challenging， as we have seen in this case \\[4，6\\]. The optimal frequency of imaging is unknown. If residual disease is suspected on imaging， biopsy may be difficult and surgery may be the only option.**\n\n【50】**Conclusion**\n\n【51】**Primary SCC of the recto vaginal septum is an extremely rare entity. Definitive treatment with chemo radiation may be a viable option given the complete pathologic response in this case.

The primary can occur in extra-uterine sites like ovary， fallopian tube， cervix， vulva， vagina， omentum and retroperitoneum. Cervical sarcomas are still rare comprising 0.5% of all primary cervical malignancies. Primary low grade ESS occurring in endocervix is reported very rarely and it mimics polyp which poses a diagnostic dilemma.**\n\n【12】**Case Report： We report a case of 40 years perimenopausal lady with HCV positive who presented in gynec-oncol OPD with complaints of irregular bleeding per vaginum and something coming out P/V since 4 months. T2W MRI shows large lobulated pedunculated heterogenous hyperintense mass arising from anterior lip of cervix. Histological examination revealed epithelioid cell tumor lined by endocervicalliningand tumor infiltrate to ectocervix and myometrium. The diagnostic challenge was to differentiate between epithelioid variant of leiomyoma and ESS for which immunohistochemistry was carried out which showed moderately positivity for Cluster of Differentiation 10 (CD10)， focal positivity for ER (Estrogen Receptor) & PR (Progesterone Receptor) and negative for SMA， DESMIN，CALDESMON，CD34，CD117. Ki-67-was <2%.**\n\n【13】**Conclusion： The case report emphasizes the need to include ESS in the differential diagnosis of cervical polyp.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Leiomyoma； Cervical polyp； Epithelioid cell tumor； Stromal sarcoma**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Cervical sarcomas comprise of 0.5% of all primary cervical malignancies \\[1，2\\].

Primary low grade ESS occurring in endocervix is very rare. After extensive research only one case report has been found. This case highlights occurrence of extra uterine ESS in the endocervix， presenting as a cervical polyp.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 40 years old perimenopausal P2L2 patient with HCV positive status presented with bleeding per vaginum since 4 months duration with a polypoidal mass coming out of vagina. Her menstrual cycle was regular and no history of taking any hormonal pills. Local examination revealed 10cm×8cm polypoidal growth arising from anterior lip of cervix lying outside vulva associated with cervical elongation. Cervical polyp had irregular surface with necrotic areas and had bleeding on touch. Per vaginum radiology shows growth was arising from anterior lip of cervix， uterus of normal size， B/L fornices and parametrium appeared free and rectal mucosa smooth. T2W MRI shows large lobulated pedunculated heterogenous hyperintense mass arising from anterior lip of cervix. A total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral-salpingo-oopherectomy was carried out and the specimen was sent for histopathological examination.**\n\n【19】**Gross appearance**\n\n【20】**Gross examination revealed specimen of TAH+BSO in which uterus measures 10 cmx4cm x 4 cm with endometrial thickness was 2 mm and myometrial thickness was 25 mm and cervix measures 5 cm.On cut section of uterus， cervix，bilateral fallopian tube and ovary was unremarkable. An ulcero-proliferative globular polyp sent separately measures 10 cm×8cm×4 cm . External surface was bosselated with ulceration and sloughing sat places.

High power of tumor proper shows round to oval nucleus with mild anisonucleosis， vesicular nuclear chromatin and mostly inconspicuous nucleoli with scant to moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm (Figure3). Atypical mitosis was negligible (<2mitosis/10 hpf). Section from ectocervix shows stratified squamous epithelium with underlying tissue shows infiltration by tumor cells. Multiple section from myometrium shows sheets of tumor cells separated by muscle fibers . On the basis of microscopy differential diagnosis of Leiomyoma (Epithelioid variant) and Endometrial stromal tumour was considered. Hence， a panel of immunohistochemical markers were put.

One fourth of patients are asymptomatic. Most patients present with abnormal vaginal bleeding， polypoidal vaginal mass and dysmenorrhea. The other symptoms could be urinary urgency， retention of urine or constipation. LG-ESS cells resemble proliferative phase endometrium.

Congenital malformation varies from patient to patient and may affect the skeletal system as well as organ systems. With an incidence of 1 to 5 per million， a highly variable phenotypic presentation with clinical manifestations makes difficult for diagnosis in some cases and Chromosomal Breakage Study induced by MMC (Mitomycin-C)/DEB(Diepoxybutane) provide a unique cellular marker for diagnosis.**\n\n【14】**Case Presentation： In this case report， a 4 year old Asian male child presented with tachypnea， progressive pallor， intermittent fever and non productive cough. He was found to be short stature， underweight for his age and had microcephaly. Cafe au lait spots were present with absent thumb on the right hand.**\n\n【15】**Conclusion： Peripheral smear showed pancytopenia， bone aspiration was inconclusive due to insufficient particulate matter. X-Ray showed absent radius on right side and USG revealed right sided renal agenesis. Chromosomal Breakage Study was positive.**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**FA was first described in 1927 by the Swiss Pediatrician， Guido Fanconi. It is a rare， genetically inherited autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital malformations， progressive pancytopenia， cellular hypersensitivity to DNA-cross-linking agents， predisposition to Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) and other malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The developmental and physical abnormalities may include hyperpigmentation， short stature， malformations of the thumb and forearms， skeletal anomalies， small head or eyes， renal problems， hearing defect， heart disease， gastrointestinal difficulties and hypogonadism \\[2，3\\].**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**A 4 year old Asian male child presented in pediatric emergency with complaints of tachypnea， progressive pallor， intermittent fever and non productive and non paroxysmal cough. He was born of 9 months of intrauterine life and delivered normally. After birth， the developmental milestones are delayed. Antenatally， mother had no specific complaints and was uneventful. He is the only child of his parents. Physical examination revealed patient had short stature as Height for Age (H/A) was below 3d percentile or 2 Standard Deviations. His Weight for Age (W/A) and Head Circumference was also below 3d percentile. He also had a triangular head， flat thenar eminence on the right hand with absent thumb on the same .**\n\n【20】**Further abdominal USG revealed absence of right kidney. Abdomen also showed outward projection of umbilicus which was not a herniation. Generalized hyperpigmentation with cafe au lait spots was present . Patient also had developmental delays along with learning disabilities. Peripheral smear revealed pancytopenia with anisocytosis. CBC revealed hemoglobin of 4 gm/dL. The platelet count was 20，000/uL which gradually improved on receiving PRBC and PC transfusions. ANC was decreased. Serum iron studies， B12 and Folic Acid levels were normal. Bone marrow was inconclusive due to hypoplasticity of the marrow. Echocardiography showed the presence of PDA . The blood and urine culture was sterile with normal thyroid profile. LFT and RFT were well within normal range. Patient also had very low oxygen saturation with a high respiratory rate. He was started on inhalation Oxygen.**\n\n【21】**Systemic examination of the respiratory system revealed crepitations in bilateral lung fields and diffuse rhonchi.

Oxygen inhalation was gradually tapered off as respiratory distress improved. X-Ray of right arm showed absent radius bone along with bowing of ulna as well as Clinodactyly of the fingers . Absence of the right thumb is also evident. The left arm was normal. Karyotyping found normal male (46；XY) Cytogenic findings of Chromosomal Breakage Study with MMC and DEB which are DNA cross-linking agents confirmed the diagnosis of FA along with ruling out other differentials like Macrophage Activation Syndrome .

Other therapies include androgens to raise the hemoglobin and platelet count， G-CSF and GM-CSF for neutropenia Definitive treatment includes bone marrow transplant for marrow failure in FA patients. Preventive measures can be taken by prenatal testing and family planning. Prenatal testing includes fetal ultrasonography evaluation， molecular genetic testing by amniocentesis or chorionic villous sampling and chromosomal breakage studies with DEB/MMC.

The screening of the FANCA gene for mutations supports the clinical diagnosis of FA. Further， it will help to plan appropriate treatment and also to select suitable donor for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and to plan for genetic counseling. Future studies would clearly advance the current understanding of FANCA regulation and function.**\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**l.

It is mainly described in Caucasian subjects in their sixties. However， it also exists in black African subjects， but occurs at a younger age. It is easily diagnosed by the association of vitamin deficiency and macrocytosis. However， various circumstances may mask the macrocytosis and thus complicate the diagnosis. The authors report the case of a patient presenting with normocytic normochromic anemia because of its rarity.**\n\n【16】**Case Report： The patient was 48 years old and was referred to a hematology consultation for investigation and etiology of a normocytic anemia of chronic evolution (Hb=8.5 g/dl， VGM=92fl， TCMH=32Pg). The diagnosis of Biermer’s disease was made on the basis of the criteria of chronic anemia of insidious evolution， medullary megaloblastosis， serum vitamin B12 deficiency and the positivity of the anti-intrinsic factor antibody test.**\n\n【17】**Conclusion： This observation reminds us that a normocytic anemia does not exclude the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Biermer's disease； Normocytic anemia； Vitamin B12**\n\n【19】**Introduction**\n\n【20】**_cited._**\n\n【21】**Biermer's disease is an autoimmune disease， characterized by malabsorption of vitamin B12， reversible in the presence of intrinsic factors， with the presence of autoimmune atrophic gastritis and various autoantibodies \\[1，2\\]. In Western countries， its prevalence is 9 to 17 new cases/100，000inhabitants/year and the disease affects 0.13% to 0.20% of the population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In Europe， Biermer's disease is the leading cause of megaloblastic anemia， and mainly affects Caucasian subjects， with a predominance in the elderly female subject. Indeed， 15% to 40% of patients diagnosed with Biermer’s disease are over 65 years of age； 1% are under 50 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-5\\]</u>. In Africa， data on the disease are scarce， but it is thought to be common in the southern part of the continent \\[21： In Zimbabwe， Mukiibi reported sixteen cases in 1990； Savage in 1992， identified eighty-five cases of pernicious anemia out of 144 patients with megaloblastic anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.In West Africa， there are fewer reported cases： Akinyanju in Nigeria， reported ten， Diop in Senegal， Two cases in 1999， and Segbena in Togo， four cases in 2003 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>.\"For all these authors， Biermer’s disease is under diagnosed in black Africa because of the ancient notion of its rarity， the systematic treatment of chronic anemia without thorough investigations and the inadequacy of endoscopy technical platforms and laboratories. Its classic (historical) presentation associates neurological signs with macrocytic anemia (neuro anemic syndrome)，evolving in an insidious way， giving it the name \"pernicious anemia\". However， it can also occur in atypical forms， both clinically and biologically. These are forms that make the diagnosis err and ignore the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-14\\]</u>. In addition to the demonstration of B12 deficiency and malabsorption，the diagnosis of Biermer’s disease is alsobased onthe demonstration ofautoantibodies against Intrinsic Factor (FI) which are of two types： type I antibodies， called \"blockers\"， and type II antibodies called \"precipitating\"通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Its evolution is marked by the occurrence of complications**\n\n【22】**such as gastric polyps to be carefully monitored， more rarely one can discover gastric adenocarcinoma and finally more frequently the occurrence of multiple carcinoid tumors 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> developed at the expense of Enterochromaffin -Like Cells (ECL) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Published cases are increasing and the condition is likely under diagnosed. The aim is to draw the attention of practitioners to atypical forms of Biermer’s disease， the description of which is increasingly increasing in Black subjects.**\n\n【23】**Observation**\n\n【24】**The 48-year-old AK patient， a shopkeeper with an unexplored history of chronic epigastralgia， was referred to our department for exploration and etiological research of chronic normocytic normochrome anemia (Hb=8.5 g/dL， VGM=92fl， TCMH=32Pg). The anamnesis found a gradual beginning of the symptomatology that would go back about 1 year by cephalea， and dizziness she consults in a medical structure where a blood count was performed which highlighted anemia， she would have received an iron-based medication. The evolution was marked by the persistence associated with paresthesia of the extremities， skin hyperpigmentation and the persistence of anemia， which motivated a consultation in our department for better management. The clinical examination noted： a general condition preserved WHO 1， cutaneous-mucosal pallor without jaundice， a deparpillated tongue (Hunter’s glossitis)， epigastricSsensitivity2and skin hyperpigmentation (forearm， abdominal and dorsal).**\n\n【25】**The blood count noted chronic normocytic normochrome anemia (Hb=7.5 g/dL， GMV=88fl，MCDH=28Pg).**\n\n【26】**Paraclinical examinations noted：A reticulocyte level =25000/mm²**\n\n【27】**On the myelogram： Megaloblastosiswith nucleocytoplasmic asynchronism**\n\n【28】**Vitamin B12 assay 72 pmol/l**\n\n【29】**Intrinsic factor antibodies =52.0u/ml**\n\n【30】**Esogastroduodenal fibroscopy concluded an erythematous pangastric without Helicobacter pylori.**\n\n【31】**Our patient is currently receiving specific treatment with cyanocobalamin 1，000 micrograms and proton pump inhibitor.**\n\n【32】**Discussion**\n\n【33】**Biermer’s disease is rarely suspected in the face of normocytic nor-chrome anemia. This clinical case first made us look for different causes of hemolytic anemia. However， the regenerative character objectified by low reticulocytosis and the absence of splenomegaly did not plead for the classic causes of hemolytic anemia. The first cases of Biermer's disease in black subjects appeared anecdotal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.However， more and more cases were subsequently reported \\[11，18-20\\]. In the majority of these cases， it should be noted the insidious nature of the pathology that has been at the origin of diagnostic wanderings with fortuitous discoveries in patients admitted or initially consulting for other conditions \\[18，20，21\\]. At this level， it should be emphasized that Biermer's disease is probably under diagnosed in sub-Saharan Africa， due to a lack of technical platforms. The other reason is the lack of knowledge of certain subtleties of presentation of this condition by uninformed practitioners 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. In the Black African subject， several striking characteristics of Biermers disease are to be remembered， first and foremost its occurrence at a young age，**\n\n【34】**compared to the age usually around 65 years in Caucasians \\[2，3\\]. Indeed， a first retrospective Senegalese work showed， between 2000and 2007， an average age at diagnosis of Biermer’s disease of 51years in 26 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. On the other hand， a second prospective study revealed， between 2007 and 2013， an average age of 43 years in 28 cases of Biermer’s disease in the same country 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The second characteristic is the constancy of mucocutaneous signs such as glossitis and especially palmoplantar acquired melanoderma\\[8，20，22\\]. Regarding this last cutaneous manifestation，it directs more towards adrenal insufficiency. However， it is found without further explanation in several African series and also disappears at the same time as the other signs of Biermer's disease， under well-conducted treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20-23\\]</u>. However， melanoderma is not yet considered a pathognomonic sign of this autoimmune disease. Neurological and mucous signs (Hunter’s glossitis) were present in our patient. The diagnosis of Biermer’s disease was retained on the criteria of chronic anemia ofinsidious course， medullary megaloblastosis，serum vitamin B12 deficiency and the positivity of the search for anti-intrinsic factor antibodies whose importance in the diagnosis of pernicious anemia has been demonstrated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Biologically， special presentations were noted. They consist of normocytic anemia that can be explained bythe association of macrocytic and microcytic anemia by inflammation， or even microcytic related to iron deficiency or inflammatory origin\\[11，20，23\\]. Anemia， when it occurs， is consistently profound， with an average hemoglobin level of 6 g/dL \\[20，21\\]. Treatment of Biermer’s disease is based on vitamin B12 administered intramuscularly as cyanocobalamin \\[231. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on all clinical signs and manifestations， with however a recovery of neuropsychiatric manifestations in less than half of cases.**\n\n【35】**Conclusion**\n\n【36】**This observation reminds us that normocytic anemia does not exclude the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. The main causes of normal mean blood volume in this situation are the association of vitamin B12 deficiency with microcytic anemia (iron deficiency， hemoglobinopathy with a microcytic tendency) and the coexistence of macrocytes with fragments of erythrocytes.**\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) has been shown to reverse cardiac arrest induced by LAST but there are also reports that suggest its role in reversing neurological complications due to local anaesthetic (LA).

Among RA techniques， peribulbar and retrobulbar blocks are the most commonly used， and those mostly associated with complications. In fact due to the particular anatomy of the eye， life-threatening complications such as retrobulbar haemorrhage， intra-arterial injection， with ensuing “local anaesthetic systemic toxicity\"(LAST)， and brain stem anaesthesia (BSA) are possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The first one is characterized both by neurological involvement， leading up to a coma， and by cardiovascular effects that can conduct towards a cardiac arrest. The second complication， described in 0.13-0.79 % of all retrobulbar blocks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， starts with drowsiness， headache and can progress eventually towards respiratory arrest and hemodynamic instability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) has been shown to reverse cardiac arrest induced by LAST 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and there are only a few reports about its use in neurological complications due to LA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. We present here a case of retrobulbar block complicated by systemic adverse effects， where ILE was also administered. A mixture of ropivacaine and mepivacaine was used for the block. Informed consent to publish the case was obtained from the patient.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 70 year-old female patient had to undergo vitrectomy for macular hole and pucker in retrobulbar block. Her past medical history included hypertension， non insulin dependent type II diabetes mellitus， hypercholesterolemia， past appendectomy， hysterectomy for uterine fibroid， oophorectomy for cancer，thyroidectomy for Basedow disease. Vitrectomy on the other eye for retinal detachment had been previously performed under GA without any consequences. She also had been treated with a PTCA with and drug eluting stent for coronary artery disease 9 months earlier. Before carrying out the block SpO， was 100% in room air oxygen， non invasive blood pressure (NIBP)158/76 mmHg， HR 70 bpm rhythmic and her respiratory rate (RR) 15/min.Retrobulbar block was carried out by the surgeon with a mixture of 5 ml ropivacaine 1% and 5 ml mepivacaine 1%. The anaesthetic mixture was injected through an Atkinson needle 25 G diameter and 22 mm length. Two minutes after the block the patient developed sinus tachycardia with HR 113 bpm and severe hypertension with NIBP 224/113 mmHg；headache and dizziness were also reported by the patient. After Urapidil 15 mg IV NIBP dropped to 160/74 mmHg and HR to 90 bpm. Five minutes after the completion of the block， the patient did not respond (GCS 3) and respiratory arrest followed. Hemodynamic stability was documented by a NIBP of 155/70 mmHg and HR 85 bpm. She was promptly intubated and mechanical ventilation was started. Assuming that the clinical picture was**\n\n【18】**due to LAST caused by inadvertent intra-arterial injection or to BSA， ILE (20% Intralipid， B Braun Melsungen AG， Melsungen， Germany) was administered to the patient in order to prevent the progress of toxicity. The dose was 1.5 mL\\*kg-1 of total body weight (TBW) bolus followed by an infusion of 0.25 mL\\*kg-1\\*min-1.**\n\n【19】**Transfer to the ICU was planned and 20 minutes after the admission (50 min after the block) the patient had completely recovered her pre-block neurological status and she was promptly extubated. A CT scan of the head， performed before extubation， did not show any neurological abnormality. No sedation had been given during that period. ILE therapy was interrupted after the extubation. A total amount of 580 mL， 10 mL\\*kg-1 of ILE was administered，as suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The patient was monitored for the following 12 hours in the ICU and then discharged to the ward. No blood test abnormalities were registered and no further complications developed caused by ILE. Vitrectomy was rescheduled and performed 2 months later under GA without any complication.**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**Neurological complications due to retrobulbar blockare unpredictable in terms of severity and clinical presentation. The broad spectrum of clinical scenarios that can occur \\[7，8\\] depend on local anaesthetic volume and its concentration， depth of the needle and spread to the cerebral area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Intra-arterial injections have been reported even following a negative-aspiration test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. However， the development of severe hypertension and sinus tachycardia two minutes after the block makes this hypothesis unlikely in our patient. Vagus and glossopharyngeal nerve involvement resulting in parasympathetic blockade and abolition of carotid sinus reflex， respectively， appears more likely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In fact it is more feasible that local anaesthetic (LA) spread had had an intra-cerebral or subarachnoid involvement through the optic nerve sheath leading to BSA. Usually these two potential mechanisms occur when needle tip perforates the sheath and the injected volume can spread in the subdural or in the subarachnoid space respectively. In this case report， the needle utilized was shorter than those commonly used to perform this block but local anaesthetic volume was 10 mL， greater than the usual 5-6 mL， and this could explain why neurological complications appeared. Another relevant consideration is that neither paralysis nor seizure activity developed， because the patient had a prodromic headache and dizziness， then a sudden loss of consciousness and respiratory arrest ensued.**\n\n【22】**ILE has been applied to reverse local anaesthetic cardiac toxicity\\[4，12\\] but there is also an increasing interest in its use to reverse neurological complications. Spence reported a case of inadvertent intravenous bupivacaine injection with central nervous system toxicity after epidural analgesia for labour. In that case the patient was treated with 20% lipid emulsion bolus of 100 ml followed by a continuous infusion ofthe drug. No cardiovascular toxicity developed and no eventful post-operative course was reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Another case of LAST after a lumbar plexus block with neurological symptoms， hypotension and ECG abnormalities was successfully dealt with 20%Intralipid bolus with a rapid normalization of ECG and a complete reverse of neurological status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. McCutchen and Gerancher 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> reported about a patient who had had a combined femoral and sciatic block and developed general seizures and ventricular tachycardia. He was treated with a bolus of 100 mL of 20% lipid with an additional infusion of 400 mL ofthe drug in the following 15 minutes， preventing cardiac arrest and obtaining a complete reverse of neurological**\n\n【23】**symptoms within two hours. Lange et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> have described a case of a patient who developed systemic neurological complications from lidocaine skin infiltration. In this case the patient was treated with a bolus of 1.5 mL/kg of 20% lipid emulsion not followed by a continuous infusion of the drug with improvement of neurological status and complete recovery within 12 hours.**\n\n【24】**Itseems that ILE rapidly decreases tissue _a_ and1 plasma concentrations of LA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and potentially hastens the disappearance of neurological symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>， possibly due to a “lipid-sink”mechanism， where infused lipids bind local anaesthetic/s lowering their /its plasma and tissue concentration with a partitioning effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. It is also reasonable that ILE could act with a “channel mechanism， where lipids reduce sodium channel inhibition by LA通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.**\n\n【25】**When BSA occurs a full recover it is difficult to be predicted in terms of time for the different spread of LA in the single cases and for metabolism of LA in itself \\[1，7\\]. In this situation we immediately started with a lipid bolus followed by an infusion with the main aim to avoid further cardiovascular toxicity. A full recovery of neurological status was obtained within 50 minutes but we don't know how much ILE has contributed to speed up it. It is necessary to have more studies to prove the efficacy of ILE in neuronal cells but lipid infusion is mandatory to be considered in life-threatening conditions related to LAs in order to avoid worsening and progressing of their complications.**\n\n【26】**Funding**\n\n【27】**This work was supported by the Section of Anaesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine of the Department of Health Sciences， University of Florence， Florence， Italy.**\n\n【28】**Author's Contribution**\n\n【29】**I.C.， C.A.， G.P.

The aim of this study was to show that Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) could reduce glycaemic excursions in patients with T1D already using insulin pumps， exercising at moderate to high intensity. Questionnaires were used to identify T1D patients using insulin pumps and naive to CGM use， who reported regular exercise. 6 were enrolled and trained on Enlite sensor use with Medtronic Minimed Paradigm° Veo\" system， and given activity trackers and written advice on adjustment of insulin or carbohydrate intake for exercise. Resting heart rate (HR) and age were used to determine HR surrogates of moderate and high intensity exercise. They were to exercise as usual for 3 weeks (run-in week， week 1 and week 2)， using the activity trackers and heart rate monitors. PAID，HFSII， DTQ and Gold scores were completed prior to run-in and at the end. The downloaded sensor glucose data was used to compare the change in time in range (glucose 3.9-10.0 mmol/l) from week 1 to week 2 For the duration of exercise this time in range glucose Range increased from 72 ± 20 to 88±16%， p=0.05. The time in hypoglycaemia range (glucose <3.9 mmol/l) went from 3.9± 7.9 to 2.4± 4.8%，p=0.39. The time in hyperglycaemia range (>10 mmol/l) reduced from 24±19 to 10±17%，p=0.04. These results demonstrate the benefit of CGM use for patients with T1DM doing moderate to high intensity exercise.**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**Exercise is recommended to patients with Type 1 Diabetes to improve their cardiovascular health and reduce their risk factors for cardiovascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However exercise， especially moderate to high intensity exercise， can lead to excursions in glucose levels that are difficult to manage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Education about appropriate insulin dose adjustments for different types of exercise can be very helpful， but is not always enough to eliminate this problem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The use of Insulin pump therapy instead of multiple daily injections can also help 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> but even patients using this form of insulin delivery， where the insulin basal rate can be adjusted readily， often continue to struggle to maintain good glycaemic control around the time of exercise \\[5，6\\]. Nocturnal hypoglycaemia after aerobic exercise sessions is a typical problem \\[7，8\\]， but hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia during or immediately after exercise also occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Hyperglycaemia is more likely to occur after high intensity or anaerobic exercise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Patients sometimes target hyperglycaemia before exercise as a mechanism of avoiding hypoglycaemia during it. A useful tactic to avoid hypoglycaemia during exercise is to intersperse a 10 second sprint into a lower intensity aerobic exercise session 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Studies in controlled settings have demonstrated the benefit of using real-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) to inform insulin and carbohydrate adjustments to avoid wide glycaemic excursions \\[12，13\\]. The aim of this study was to examine the benefit of CGM for patients involved in regular moderate to high intensity exercise， in the real-life setting.**\n\n【20】**Approval for the study was obtained from Galway University Hospital Clinical Research Ethics committee. Questionnaires were sent to all type 1 Diabetes patients using insulin pumps attending the Diabetes clinic at Galway University Hospital. Those naive to real-time CGM use， who reported regular (at least twice per week) moderate to high intensity exercise were invited to participate. 6were enrolled and trained on Enlite sensor use with Medtronic Minimed Paradigm°Veo\" system. All were given written general advice on adjustment of insulin or carbohydrate intake， for different exercise intensities， duration and proximity to mealtime .

We measured their resting heart rate， and together with age this was used to calculate the age predicted maximum heart rate (220-age=HRmax). Using the Karvonen method we determined heart rate reserve (HRR=HRmax-HRrest). HR ranges 40% to 70% and 70% to 80% of HRR added to HRrest were used as surrogates of moderate and high intensity exercise respectively. Weight， BMI and BP were recorded at baseline， and a blood sample was sent to test Hbalc (IFCC assay). They were instructed to exercise as usual for 3 weeks， turning the Polar watch on for the duration of exercise. The Moves app was installed on their own smartphones that they were asked to carry always to monitor their level of activity at times when they were not exercising. At the end the run-in (week-1) subjects were contacted to troubleshoot any calibration or sensor change problems. If they consistently wore the sensor， exercised at least twice per week and used the Polar~ watch for exercise during the run-in week they were included in the study.2 subjects were not included. In one case this was because regular exercise was not carried out due to an injury， in the other case it was because there was difficulty using Polar watch and heart rate monitor**\n\n【27】**for exercise sessions which involved rugby training.**\n\n【28】**Problem areas in Diabetes (PAID) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， Hypoglycaemia fear survey II (HFSII) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， Diabetes Technology Questionnaire (DTQ)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> were completed prior to run-in and at the end ofthe study and the Gold score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> was obtained from each individual before the study to assess their level of hypoglycaemia unawareness. (This is a simple score from 1-7 in response to the question： Do you know when your hypos are commencing? Where 1 is where you are always aware and7 means you are never aware). These are all validated questionnaires designed to quantify quality of life and hypoglycaemia unawareness and changes in these parameters over time.**\n\n【29】**The downloaded sensor glucose data on Carelink\" Personal通用删除1(英):<u>(Medtronic software for patient and health professional review of insulin and glucose data)</u> was analysed in SPSS. Thresholds for glucose levels were set as follows： target range 3.9 mmol/l to 10 mmol/l， hypoglycaemia range <3.9 mmol/l，hyperglycaemia range>10 mmol/l. All available sensor glucose values were included in the analysis (one value is provided every 5 minutes while the sensors are worn).

Student's paired t-test was used to compare time in the range， in week 1 to week 2.**\n\n【34】**Additional recommendations**\n\n【35】**If first-time exercise there is a prolonged hypoglycaemia risk so the basal rate should be reduced for the entire night using temporary basal rate setting， if on MDI the long acting dose should be reduced that day/night. Hypoglycaemia risk is also higher if exercise is carried out on sequential days， or there was ahypoglycaemic event on the day preceding exercise. Alcohol also increases the risk of hypoglycaemia. If hyperglycaemia is encountered post-exercise (especially likely if mod/high intensity exercise at the anaerobic/lactate threshold) a cool-down over 20 minutes to 30 minutes will reduce the need to give a correction bolus. A 10-second sprint done before and/or during low/moderate intensity exercise will elevate glucose levels and reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia during or after exercise.**\n\n【36】**Results**\n\n【37】**Figure 2 the sensor glucose values were binned into time in target， time in hypoglycaemia range and time in hyperg ycaemia range and are shown as percentage in each range.

There was an increase in the time in the target glucose range during exercise， in week 2 compared to week 1 72.4±20% to 88.1±15.6% p=0.05)， and a reduction in the time in the hyperglycaemia range (24±19%**\n\n|  | **Mean (stdev)**  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **No. of Subjects**  | **4**  |\n| **Age (stdev)**  | **38 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>**  |\n| **Male**  | **4**  |\n| **Duration of Diabetes (in years)**  | **21 通用删除7(英):<u>(9)</u>**  |\n| **BMI(kg/m²)**  | **28 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>**  |\n| **HbA1c (mmol/l)**  | **58通用删除7(英):<u>(9)</u>**  |\n\n【39】**to 10±17% p=0.04 . There was no significant reduction in hypoglycaemia， however the improvement in the time in target is not all attributable to reduction in the time in the hyperglycaemia range-the mean time in the hypoglycaemia during exercise reduced from 3.9±7.9% to 2.4±4.8%，p=0.39. When the sensor glucose data Vas for the entire 2 week period was evaluated， there was no significant difference from week 1 to week 2 ， or for the time from 1hour before to 4 hours after exercise .**\n\n【40】**The Gold score ranged from 1-4 indicating no hypoglycaemia unawareness in one individual， and a mild to moderate degree in the other subjects. The other quality of life measures showed low levels of anxiety (HFS II Worry scale scores were 13 ± 16 out of a possible0-72)， and behaviour due to fear of hypoglycaemia (14 ± 7 out of a possible 0-48). The PAID scores were also moderate (16± 14 out of a possible 0-80). Nonetheless all of the QOL scores showed a non-significant trend toward improving following use of the CGM for the duration of the study.**\n\n【41】**Discussion**\n\n【42】**This small real-life study demonstrates the potential benefit of using CGM for exercise. We showed that there was a significant improvement in the time that interstitial glucose was in the target**\n\n【43】**Table 2： Quality of Life Questionnaire Scores.**\n\n| **Questionnaire**  | **Before Study** **Score**  | **At end of studyScore**  | **Change in Score**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **PAID**  | **16±14**  | **15±11**  | **\\-1.5±6**  |\n| **HFS IBehaviour**  | **14±7**  | **9±2**  | **\\-5.5±8**  |\n| **HFS II Worry**  | **13±16**  | **9±9**  | **\\-3.8±12**  |\n\n【45】**range (3.9 mmol/l to 10 mmol/l) during exercise. These patients were involved in a variety oftypes ofexercise， cycling， running， soccer and weight lifting and all had improvements in their glycaemic control during exercise between week 1 and week 2 of the study. Although there was no significant change in the time in the hypoglycaemia range from week 1 to week 2， there was a trend in this direction， and the time spent in the hypoglycaemia range was small. This difference didn't reach significance probably in part due to the small number of subjects. The same reason may explain the lack of difference in the time in target range overall from week 1 to week 2 (including time exercising and not)， where time in the hypoglycaemia reduced from 5.6 ± 3.1% to 3.4±1.2% p=0.15， and hyperglycaemia time reduced from 29 ±16% to 25± 15% p=0.11. Similar results were found for the time from 1 hour before and exercise session started to 4 hours afterward. This is a period that carries a high risk for wide glycaemic excursions； we expect a larger study would show significant reductions in time in the hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia ranges during this period. Our study showed a high proportion of time in hypoglycaemia during this time (8.9±14.9% in week 1， 4.1±3.8%in week 2).**\n\n【46】**The subjects used the CGM system for a run-in week and there were no overall significant improvements demonstrated between that week and subsequent weeks， suggesting that these patients needed some time to get used to the device and how to adjust their insulin according to the CGM glucose data available. The only input from the Diabetes research team was at the beginning of the study - when subjects were given basic instructions on insulin adjustment for exercise ， and shown how to use the study devices. There was a further contact after the run-in week， in person or by phone， to trouble-shoot any problems， but we did not review their data or provide individualised advice until the end of the study. Each subject had access to Carelink\" Personal and reviewed their data both in realtime and retrospectively to help to inform insulin dose adjustment. All of the patients were already insulin pump users， so the benefits they gained demonstrate the role of CGM in addition to insulin pump therapy in the setting of exercise. HbA1cs varied from on target to significantly elevated indicating a wide range of glycaemic control at baseline.**\n\n【47】**The HFSII and PAID questionnaires show there was a moderate level of fear ofhypoglycaemia and anxiety around management oftheir Diabetes in general. The DTQ showed the most consistent responses at the end of the study were of a slight or great reduction in the stress around participating in sport and avoiding hypoglycaemia(Results not shown). All 4 found the CGM device user-friendly， for the 2patients that did not pass the run-in phase CGM compliance was not the issue， it was due to inability to exercise and difficulty with the heart rate monitor and exercise watch.**\n\n【48】**Technology for the management of Diabetes continues to advance and health care professionals involved in Diabetes management are challenged with the question of which patients are likely to benefit from the use of CGM. As it stands CGM in the UK and Ireland is funded in cases where there is a specific need such as hypoglycaemia**\n\n【49】**unawareness or recurrent hypoglycaemia. More research is needed to determine what other patients are likely to benefit not just in terms of HbAlc， but also in terms of reduction of glycaemic excursions and improvement in quality of life measures. There is some evidence to suggest the amplitude of glycaemic excursions and not just HbA1c is correlated and positively associated with development of Diabetes complications， but more longitudinal CGM based studies are needed通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. CGM use has the potential to reduce these excursions thereby possibly reduce the risk of development or progression of these complications. There is some evidence to demonstrate the benefits to be gained in terms of quality of life for patients who access CGM after previously relying on finger-stick tests for self-monitoring of blood glucose 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Not all patients report reduced anxiety， but the continuous glucose data along with trend arrows， predictive alarms， and low-glucose suspend features in some cases provide great reassurance and in cases of hypoglycaemia unawareness have the potential to avoid life threatening hypoglycaemia. There are tools that help predict whether individual children with T1D will benefit from the use of CGM particularly in terms of consistent use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Further study is needed to determine how to predict the type of adults with T1D that will benefit.**\n\n【50】**To date cost-effectiveness analyses have not shown clear indications for the use of these devices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. The cost involved is not just that of the sensor enabled pump and sensors， but also the cost of the Diabetes educator hours involved in training patients on how to use these devices effectively. Here we have shown that a variety of insulin pump users can achieve benefits from the additional use of CGM with minimal input form the Diabetes team. All of these patients had previously attended a structured education course so had good baseline knowledge of how to adjust their insulin doses themselves. There also may be an element of selection bias and the individuals who agreed to participate may represent a cohort with a high level of motivation. However we feel this study demonstrates that a short trial of CGM use can quickly determine whether patients already using insulin pump therapy， are likely to be compliant with CGM use. Those patients participating in regular moderate to high intensity exercise are a cohort who can quickly benefit from the addition of CGM to improve their glucose time in the target range， and also improve their quality of life.**\n\n【51】**Type 1 Diabetes has a major impact on an individual's lifestyle， including their ability to partake in exercise safely and enjoyably. Progress in technology for the treatment of Diabetes makes this more attainable. CGM whether as an integrated sensor augmented pump system or stand-alone device is available for selected patients， but many more stand to benefit from it especially those involved in regular moderate to high intensity exercise. New developments hold even more promise to improve the lives of these individuals. One study in the real-life setting to investigate the use of CGM along with an accelerometer and algorithm that incorporated the exercise intensity， showed reduction in hypoglycaemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. The future incorporation of heart rate and other data into a closed loop device should further facilitate avoidance of glycaemic excursions around exercise. In the meantime， as we have shown in this small pilot study， sensor enabled insulin pumps have the potential to allow these patients to exercise while reducing their glycaemic excursions and anxiety about hypoglycaemia.**\n\n【52】**Compliance with Ethical Standards**\n\n【53】**Conflict of interest： none.

In the personal history there was a high blood pressure treated with ACE inhibitor and multiple sclerosis. Palpatory finding of the thyroid gland on admission was normal， and markers of inflammation， fibrinogen， and CRP were positive. The treatment with antibiotics for suspected urinary infection has been started， due to a finding of a positive urine culture. Given that the pain persisted， the tenth day of hospitalization thyroid hormones analyses were done， showing increased free fraction of thyroid hormones and suppressed TSH， with， still elevated fibrinogen. At this point， the patient was clinically moderately thyrotoxic with palpable， uneven， movable on swallowing thyroid gland， with slightly painful left lobe. On echosonography， thyroid gland was slightly diffusely enlarged， diffusely very heteroehogenous， predominantly hypoechogenic， with predominantly isoechogenic nodal formation distally in the right lobe， with diameter around 15，8x12，5x15，8 mm. Pertechnetate scan indicated the existence of a functional tissue in the lower half of the right lobe， with total suppression of surrounding thyroid tissue . Thyroid scintigraphy with methoxy-isobutyl-**\n\n【18】**Figure 1： Echosonagraphic findings and pertechnetate thyraid scan in a patient during fallaw-up (a) the 1 visit.

Glucocorticoid therapy was started with a gradually decreasing doses on five days， with a total length of about a month， along with monitoring of thyroid status. Clinical and biochemical thyroid status normalized about 6 weeks after diagnosis . Control echosonography about 3 months after diagnosis， showed the existence of slightly hypoehoic nodule in the distal part of right lobe with diameter around 16x9x12 mm， with moderately heteroechogenous parenchyma outside the nodule. Control pertechnetate scan confirmed the existence of functioning adenoma in the distal part of right lobe and the recovery of uptake in the surroundingtissue of the thyroid gland . The last check-up， about a year from the acute phase showed normal functional thyroid status ， echosonographically， finding was similar to the previous one， and on a thyroid pertechnetate scan functional adenoma with slightly decreased uptake in the surrounding tissue was present (functional adenoma of the right lobe) .**\n\n【20】**Discussion and Conclusion**\n\n【21】**The cause of subacute thyroiditis is rarely possible to determine.

In our experience in the present case， the binding of MIBI in thyroid in the acute phaseis rather impaired than enhanced，which can be interpreted as a result of destructive changes in the thyroid also， knowing that MIBI is taken by viable cells.

Standard gray scale sonography shows characteristic irregular hypoechogenic fields of affected thyroid parenchyma， whose extensiveness is usually a measure of severity of clinical manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.**\n\n【32】**Conditions which may be similarly clinically manifested as SAT and come into consideration as a differential diagnosis entities are pharyngitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>， temporal arteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>， pain in the jaw teeth of origin通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>， bleeding in thyroid cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>， less often Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In atypical， painless or minimally painful cases SAT， this should be distinguished from the autoimmune painless thyroiditis，lymphocytic thyroiditis variants， in which no systemic inflammatory signs and symptoms are present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Focal SAT can mimic suppurative thyroiditis， and thyroid cancer as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.**\n\n【33】**The therapeutic approach depends on the severity of the clinical picture. In some patients， there is no need for any medical therapy. Some times it is necessary to apply non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin to reduce pain. In cases of severe symptoms**\n\n【34】**Figure 2： MIBI thyroid scan in patient at acute phase of the disease 19. 12. _2914._**\n\n【35】**glucocorticoid therapy could be indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. It is usualy given in a single daily dose of 40 mg of prednisone and at 7 days the dose is gradually reduced by 5 mg for 6 weeks. An oral therapy with cholecystography agents (sodium ipodate or sodium iopanoate) were reported as safe and effective in controlling thyrotoxicosis induced by subacute thyroiditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. In the case of the development of permanent hypothyroidism after an episode of SAT， levothyroxine substitution is indicated.**\n\n【36】**We present an unusual case of a minimum painful SAT associated with functional adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid gland，which scintigraphy presented as a toxic adenoma in thyrotoxic phase， and in fact was a functional adenoma tissue unaffected with destructive thyroiditis. On the standard sonography adenoma tissue was more echogenic than the surrounding thyroid parenchyma， which showed a typical heterogeneous hypoechoic appearance， and the MIBI scan showed moderately intense tracer binding in the thyroid gland. Serum markers of inflammation were typically high， with suppressed TSH and elevated serum thyroxin in the acute phase， with a gradual normalization during follow-up， but without transient hypothyroid phase， probably as a consequence of the existence of regional autonomy. Pertechnetate scan during follow-up showed the functional recovery of the previously affected gland parenchyma with destructive thyroiditis.**\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**l.

Aneurysm of the arch and the descending aorta along with vertebral destruction is a very rare combination with no observations in the global clinical practice. Only one scientific review has mentioned a similar pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 43-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with complaints of foreign body sensation， periodic pressing chest pain， shortness of breath on slight exertion， and paroxysmal dry cough. According to anamnesis， at the age of 20， the patient had a fall from approximately 6-m height. His six-month-old radiograph showed an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta . Multi-Spiral Computed Tomography (MSCT) angiography identified signs of aneurysm of the thoracic aorta that infiltrated its wall， neoplasm of the upper floor of the posterior mediastinum， and destruction of vertebral bodies (Th3， Th4， And Th5) and fourth rib on the left . Considering failure of the aortic arch with the spread of the descending thoracic aorta， it was clear that stenting of this segment should be performed after the preparatory stage of the brachiocephalic arterial switch**\n\n【18】**Figure 1： (A) lmages of X-ray of the chest.

In addition， given the probability of finding a tumor mass in the projection of the aneurysm， an open heart surgery was decided to be performed.**\n\n【21】**Operative technique**\n\n【22】**The operation was planned as follows： after the median sternotomy， cardiopulmonary bypass connection was provided； arterial cannula was inserted into the right subclavian artery， and venous cannula into the right atrium； cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated； and the patient's body was cooled to 24℃.**\n\n【23】**On visualization of the aorta， its diameter at the sinotubular junction was about 30-35 mm and that at the level of the ascending portion and the aortic arch was 60 mm. Majorinflammation was noted in the projection of the upper and middle third of the descending aorta， distal to the arch； the aorta soldered to the upper lobe of left lung and vertebral bodies， th3 and th4. When the temperature reached 24C， cardiopulmonary bypass was abandoned； this was followed by antegrade perfusion to the brain at a flow rate of 15 ml/kg/minute，andaortotomy was performed. Thelumen of the aorta had thrombotic masses with varying degrees of organization. Vertebral bodies with erosive changes were visualized on these masses after they were removed . According to express histological analysis， a modified aneurysmal aortic wall tissue was involved in the destruction of the vertebral bodies. Sinuses of valsalva were not expanded， when viewed from the tricuspid aortic valve without pathology. Prosthesis in the ascending portion of the arch and the descending thoracic aorta at the level of the 5-6， and brachiocephalic arteries were manipulated using vascular prosthesis (vascutek siena plexus 26). On the fourth day after surgery， the patient was transferred from the intensive care unit to the profile department. During post-operative period， the patient showed symptoms of respiratory failure， severe asthenic syndrome， signs of exudative pleurisy that required pleural puncture， and prolonged antibiotic therapy (sulperazon) due to the long sub-febrile fever. On the forty-sixth day after operation， the patient left the hospital in good condition. Post-operative most showed defects on the left surface of the vertebrae th3-th4-th5 and the head of the fourth rib at the level of diligence modified para-aortic tissue. This is a type of atrophy caused by chronic aneurysmal pressure .**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**Chronic-Contained Rupture of the aorta is relatively rare in the abdomen (2.7% of cases have reported pathology of the abdominal aorta) and very rare in the thoracic aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In the literature， only few similar clinical cases have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Patients with this condition are usually haemodynamically stable and do not perform acute symptoms， although they always have a high risk of rupture of the aortic wall. Persistent pressure on the surrounding tissue due to pulsation of the aorta over a period is probably the cause of destruction of solid structures such as vertebral bodies. In such cases， a differential diagnosis must be made using msct between primary tumours or metastatic vertebral tumours， vertebral fractures， osteoporosis， and other possible diseases \\[3，5\\].**\n\n【26】**ConcerningSurgical Treatment， aggressive _Iremoval_ of aneurysmal wall near the spinal cord is not recommended because of possible damage to the spinal cord. Sometimes， it is sufficient to eliminate the pressure pulsating aneurysmal wall to prevent compression of the surrounding tissues. In such cases， it is possible to insert a stent-graft in the absence of inflammation. However， there are reports that indicate the progress of symptoms of compression in the surrounding tissues after the stent-graft， thus requiring another open intervention in the long term.**\n\n【27】**In the clinical case presented here， the strategy of performing an open heart surgery was chosen as a tumour process was suspected in the projection of the aneurysm， and the spinal cord was located at a sufficient distance from the site of destruction of the vertebrae (as seen in the most findings).**\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

The patient's medical history includes myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation3 years ago， treated with coronary angioplasty with Drug Eluting Stent implantation (DES). Additionally， the patient suffered from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation， type 2 diabetes， hypertension， obesity and ulcerative colitis. Due to the presence of significant primary mitral regurgitation， the patient underwent biological mitral prosthesis implantation 3 years ago. One year after cardiac surgery， due to the presence of contraindications to the use of anticoagulants (recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown etiology)， the patient had left atrial appendage closure using the Amplatzer occluder. The coronary angiography showed a multivessel disease. The TTE showed elevated gradients through the mitral bioprosthesis (PG max 30 mmHg， PG mean 14 mmHg). Additional echostructure was visualized， suggesting the presence of a thrombus in the left atrium. Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) confirmed the presence of a massive thrombus with the largest thickness of 30 mm attached to the implanted occluder.PG mean was assessed at 13 mmHg with normal mobility of the bioprosthesis cusps. Additional parameters such as： EOA (Effective Orifice Area)-1.6cm andEOAi-0.75cm/m'prompted us to suspect Prosthesis-Patient Mismatch(PPM) Figure 1，2.**\n\n【20】**Figure 1： Thrombus on the left atrium. Figure 4： Occluder related thrombosis.**\n\n【21】**Figure 2： Thrombosis on the left atrial appendage occluder. Figure 5： A thrombosis in the left atrium appendage.**\n\n【22】**The second patient is an 80-year-old man with a medical history of permanent atrial fibrillation， hypertension， bladder cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Eight years ago， the patient underwent percutaneous closure of ASD II with the Amplatzer occluder. A year later， the patient underwent CABG due to multivessel coronary disease， during which a biological mitral valve was implanted due to severe secondary mitral regurgitation. Patient on chronic warfarin therapy with labile International Normalized Ratio (INR) values due to poor adherence. Currently， the patient has been admitted to the Department of Cardiology due to exacerbation of chronic heart failure. TTE showed a reduced ejection fraction up to 30% and the presence of akinesia of the interventricular septum and the anteroseptal wall. Gradients through the mitral prosthesis were proper. The presence of a massive thrombus in the left atrium was visualized. A massive thrombus \"papered up\" the wall of the left atrium it was mainly related to the occluder. There was also a thrombus in the left atrium appendage. Additional views showed the**\n\n【23】**presence of a leak around the occlude Figures 3-6.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**Echocardiographic control in patients with biological mitral valve and percutaneous occluder is not currently standardized. The reported cases of massive left atrial thrombosis in patients with mitral bioprosthesis and percutaneous occluder are still missing. It seems rational for patients with risk factors for thrombosis， the presence of biological valve prosthesis， and a percutaneous occluder to undergo routine TTE annually. However， this requires further researches and standardized guidelines. There is still an unanswered question whether patients with implanted biological valve prostheses should be candidates for occluder implantation? The need for research also applies to anticoagulant therapy. Should Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anti-Coagulation Agents (NOACs) be always used， or should Vitamin K Antagonists (VKAs) be used in the case of a patient suspected of PPM?**\n\n【26】**Conclusion**\n\n【27】**Late device-related thrombosis is very rare. The same applies to patients with a biological mitral prosthesis. In the cases described above， a thrombotic complication was found several years after the cardiac surgery. The common element of these patients was the presence of percutaneous occluders implanted into the left atrium. In both cases， the major mass of the thrombus was on the occluder. Is it a coincidence or is the presence of valve prosthesis and an additional device in the left atrium a \"thrombogenic duo\"?**\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Choroid plexus neoplasms constitute about 0.5% of all intracranial neoplasms.Majority are found in lateral ventricles. Most of these neoplasms are benign papillomas， while one-fifth are malignant carcinomas. The present communication describes a rare case of a choroid plexus papilloma leading to CSF ascites following Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt.**\n\n【11】**Case Presentation**\n\n【12】**A 5 year old boy presented to us with complaints of progressively increasing abdominal distension from past 6 months and respiratory distress for 2 days. There was no history of jaundice or bleeding manifestations. Patient was aknown case ofhydrocephalus for which medium pressure VP shunt (chabra shunt) was placed at the age of 3 years. On examination child was having massive ascitis with positive fluid thrill sign. There was no hepato-spenomegaly and other signs of hepatocellular failure. Neurologically the child was conscious and oriented and there were no signs of shunt dysfunction. Shunt bulb was palpable and soon gets refilled after compressing the bulb. Paracentesis showed clear transudate fluid with no evidence of infection (WBC= 5 cells/mm’， all lymphocytes， sugar= 72 mg/dl and protein = 24 mg/dl). Ascitic fluid culture was sterile and was negative for Acid fast bacilli. In addition， cytology was negative for malignant cell. Liver and renal function test were essentially normal (serum bilirubin =0.6 mg/dl，SGOT=36 U/I， SGPT=11U/I， serum albumin =3.8 gm/dl， urea = 27 mg/dl， creatine =0.8 mg/dl). Echocardiography revealed a normal functioning heart. The patient tested negative for HIV. Abdominal Ultrasound and CT scan showed no abnormality in relation to abdominal viscera or peritoneum. CECT head showed gross communicating hydrocephalus with choroid plexus papilloma (Figure1) in bilateral lateral ventricle which was later confirmed by histopathological examination of postoperative specimen.**\n\n【13】**Despite diuretic treatment and peritoneal tapping the ascites re-accumulated. Based on impression of CSF ascites the lower end of the shunt tip was exteriorized and was maintained as ventricular drain so as to relieve intracranial and intra-abdominal pressures， which continued to drain 1200-1500 ml of CSF daily and ascites resolved within 2 weeks postoperative. Surgical resection of choroid plexus papilloma was done on both sides of lateral ventricles and shunt was removed. The postoperative period was uneventful. Sections from both right and left tumour tissue show multiple fragments composed of delicate fibrovascular fronds lined by single layer of monomorphic cuboidal cells with basal round nucleus. No necrosis， mitosis or pleomorphism seen. S-100 immunostain shows positivity in tumour cells. Above histological features are suggestive of choroid plexus papilloma .**\n\n【14】**Discussion**\n\n【15】**Ascites has been defined as accumulation of excess fluid within the peritoneal cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The commonest cause of ascites is cirrhosis oftheliver， closely followed by other serious hepatic diseases通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In children， hepatic， renal and cardiac diseases are the most common causes. CSF ascites is a rare complication of Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. VP shunts are usually placed for obstructive or progressive hydrocephalus. Occlusion of the shunt tube and infection are frequently observed as V-P shunt complications. Overproduction of the CSF will be the likely possibility once the shunt infection had been ruled out. Early detection of shunt ascitis (noninfective) which is an uncommon occurrence and its aetiology will be helpful for better management.**\n\n【16】**Different intervals (2 months- 13 years) between shunt placement and symptomatic ascites**\n\n【17】**Figure 1： CEFT head showing gross hydrocephalus with choroid plexus papilloma.**\n\n【18】Figure 2： Photamicragraph (H&E) showing fibrovascular fronds lined by single layer of monomorphic cubaidal cells with basal round nucleus of choroid plexus papilloma.\n\n【19】**have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-6\\]</u>. Our case develops ascitis after two and half years of shunt placement. Several etiologic factors had been discussed in literature， but it is the imbalance between peritoneal absorption capacity and amount of CSF Production is the major cause. By this definition， patients with excessive amount of CSF production like choroid plexus papilloma are at risk to developing CSF ascites following VP shunt \\[3，7，8\\]. On the other hand， patients with high CSF protein due to chronic infection (tuberculous meningitis)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> or brain tumors -especially optic glioma \\[4，8，10\\] may have difficulties in CSF absorption through peritoneum. Under such circumstances， inflammation has been associated with an increase in leukocytes，impairment of lymphatic flow， and a subsequent increase in intraperitoneal protein concentration due to impaired protein absorption causing ascitis.**\n\n【20】**Peritoneal inflammation due to repeated shunt revisions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> or non-specific inflammatory response to shunt material 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>，play role in the other side and decrease absorptive ability of peritoneum. Also in brain tumors， especially in astrocytoma and glioblastoma， increased vascular permeability can cause microvascular extravasation of plasma into the peritoneal cavity and cause ascites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-14\\]</u>. A large series of twenty-eight patients with cerebrospinal ascites have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Their ages ranged from 10 days to 53 years， but most**\n\n【21】**patients were children， especially infants. Common etiological factors responsible were congenital hydrocephalus， obstructive hydrocephalus， choroid plexus papilloma， craniopharyngioma and posterior fossa tumour. In our patient choroid plexus papilloma was found to be the cause of CSF ascites. This is thought to be due to imbalance between excess production and its absorption.**\n\n【22】**Treatment for cerebrospinal ascites is revision of the V-P shunt to ventricular-atrial shunt but in choroid plexus papilloma revision will only relieve ascitis with associated risk of congestive heart failure and bacteraemia. Surgical resection of the papilloma is the definitive cure.**\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\. Podolsky DK， Isselbacher K. Major complications of cirrhosis.

The CMT4H subtype is an autosomal recessive demyelinating form of CMT due to the mutations in the FGD4， which encodes frabin， involving in regulating the activities of Schwann cells and maintaining the structure and function of the myelin development and homeostasis. To enhance earlier recognition and promote the pathogenic and molecularly targeted therapeutic study for this disease.**\n\n【22】Methods： Detailed clinical evaluations， nerve biopsy， and whole-exome sequencing were performed. The sequence and co-segregation of the variants in the family was confirmed by Sanger sequencing\n\n【23】**Results： The proband was a 12-year-old Chinese boy from a non-consanguineous family. Clinical evaluations revealed that the patient presented with early-onset，slowly progressive gait disturbance， and pes cavus. Electrophysiological examinations showed markedly reduced conduction velocities. Nerve biopsy disclosed a demyelinating neuropathy with thickened and excessively folded myelin sheath. Exome sequencing identified two novel compound heterozygous FGD4 variants with c.1688C>A(p.T563K) and c.1951C>T (p.Q651X).**\n\n【24】**Conclusion： We described a Chinese CMT4H patient with novel FGD4 mutations. CMT4H is a very early onset demyelinating disease with variable phenotypes. By studying and reviewing the disorder， we summarized the phenotype， expanded the genotype spectrum. CMT4H may be a disease of various impaired signaling pathways.**\n\n【25】**Keywords： Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease； CMT4H； FGD4； Folded myelin**\n\n【26】**Introduction**\n\n【27】**Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT)， a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous peripheral neuropathies with an overall prevalence of approximately 1-4/10，000\\[1，2\\]，are classically characterized by progressive muscular and sensory defects starting at the distal extremities with chronic weakness， skeletal deformities (pes cavus， hammer toe， or scoliosis)， and loss of deep tendon reflexes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Clinically， CMT can be subdivided into demyelinating (CMT1， CMT3 and CMT4) and axonal forms (CMT2) based on electrophysiological and histopathological characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The demyelinating neuropathies are mainlyassociated with reduced Nerve Conduction Velocities (NCVs；<38 m/s) due to the damage to the myelin sheath. Axonal forms of CMT are assumed to originate on the neuronal side and present with decreased compound muscle action potential amplitudes. Besides， the other CMT types with electrophysiological and histopathological presentations overlapping CMT1 and CMT2 are referred to as “intermediate CMT”(NCVs range from 38 m/s to 48 m/s) \\[4，5\\]. So far， over 80 genes are known to be a cause of CMT with autosomal dominant， autosomal recessive， or X-linked inheritance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. CMT4 is an autosomal recessive demyelinating form that has an earlier onset and more severe phenotypes than CMT1. In 2007， FGD4 was first identified as the causative gene for CMT4H，which islocated to chromosome 12p11.21-q13.11 intwo consanguineous families of Mediterranean origin by homozygosity mapping\\[7，8\\].FGD4 encodes frabin， an F-actin GDP/GTP nucleotide exchange factor， specific to Cell-division cycle 42 (Cdc42)**\n\n【28】**and Racl， which belong to the members of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins (Rho GTPases)， to control several aspects of Schwann cell biology and function \\[9，10\\]. All patients described to date， with mutations in FGD4are affected with early-onset and slowly progressive demyelinating CMT， presenting severely reduced motor NCVs and loss of myelinated fibers companion with focally folded myelin \\[8，11，12\\]. With the widespread use of molecular genetics technology， more CMT4H cases with a broad phenotypic spectrum have been reported. Due toa strong clinical variability and progressive course， the current information concerning frabin function is limited. Herein， a Chinese patient with novel FGD4 mutations was described and a further overview ofCMT4H was made to summarize the clinical and genetic spectrum， as well as the current pathogenesis progress of the disease to discuss genotype-phenotype correlations， and shed light on the pathogenic and molecularly targeted therapeutic study for this disease.**\n\n【29】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【30】**Patients**\n\n【31】**Extensive clinical evaluation including medical history， physical and electrophysiological examination was performed in a 12-year-old Chinese male patient.

Putative pathogenic variants were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing of both the forward and reverse strands among family members.**\n\n【37】**Results**\n\n【38】**Clinical findings**\n\n【39】**The index patient was aa 12-year-old boy from a：non·consanguineous family referred to our neurology department with a complaint of 1-year history of progressive gait disturbance， toe walking. Through detailed medical history tracking， the boyhad slow running with occasional falls since middle school when at exercise training time. The patient had normal developmental milestones， and there were no similar affected family members. Neurological examination showed a toes walking， bilateral mild pes cavus deformities， and deep tendon are flexia. Cranial nerve examination was normal， and Babinski signs were not elicited. No weakness， amyotrophy， sensory deficits， and scoliosis were observed. Motor conduction studies revealed slightly reduced amplitudes (1.08 mV to 4.0 mV)， prolonged distal motor latencies， and severely reduced velocities (17.6 m/sec) at bilateral median nerve， while no motor or sensory action potentials could be obtained in the lower limbs. Needle electromyography examination found no abnormalities. The X-ray showed bilateral foot deformities with pes cavus .**\n\n【40】**Neuropathological findings**\n\n【41】**Electron micrographs from transverse sections of sural nerve revealed a moderate decrease in density of myelinated fibers， scattered thinly myelinated fibers， accompanied by a small amount of thickened， grossly distorted， and excessively folded eccentric myelin.**\n\n【42】**Genetic findings**\n\n【43】**Exome and Sanger sequencing identified the patient carried the**\n\n【44】represented for FGD4， the FAB (F-actin binding)， DH (Dbl hamalagy)， PH (Pleckstrin homology) and FYVE (Fab 1， YOTB， V ac 1， and EEA1zinc finger) domains.

Both two variants are novel， which were not found in 1000 Genomes Project， dbSNP， and ExAC database， and pathogenicity assessment according to the ACMG revealed that both the mutations are likely pathogenic.**\n\n【46】**Discussion**\n\n【47】**In our study， we described a Chinese case with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of CMT4H. The patient displayed marked demyelinating peripheral nerve， from clinical manifestations to electrophysiological and neuropathological features. Since the first two families with CMT4H were described， this condition has been regarded as a very early onset demyelinating disease with a severe phenotype that involves delayed walking， pes cavus， kyphoscoliosis， and an early loss of ambulation \\[11，14，15\\]. To date， 40 cases from 24families with CMT4H have been reported， the average age of onset is 5.5-year-old， ranging from early infancy to the late second decade， and the disease course is chronic and progressive \\[8，11，12，14-18\\]. Individual CMT4H cases have recently been reported with pupil asymmetry \\[17，19\\]， multiple cranial nerve involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>， sensory ataxia \\[15，21\\]， spinal syringomyelia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>， autonomic neuropathy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， and cauda equina thickening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， hence gradually broadening the known CMT4H phenotype. However， the significant clinical variability even among siblings with identical FGD4 genotype， suggesting a high clinical heterogeneity among individuals \\[17，23\\]. Including the present case， almost all the affected patients were showed severely reduced velocities in electromyogram. In addition， nerve biopsies disclosed a demyelinating neuropathy characterized by myelin thickening， redundant myelin loops， and numerous infoldings and outfoldings of the myelin sheath 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， which were taken as the striking pathological hallmarks of the disease， although these features can also be found in other CMT4 subtypes (CMT4B or CMT4F)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.**\n\n【48】**The responsible gene FGD4 contains 17 exons， of which 15 are coding exons . The encoding protein frabin is a 766-amino acids GDP/GTP Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF)， a member of the Rho GTPases， and plays a role in Cdc42-mediated cell shape changes \\[9，25\\]. The ubiquitously expressed protein contains， in order from the N- to the C-terminus， five functional domains： One F-Actin Binding (FAB) domain， one Dbl Homology (DH) domain， two Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domains， and one cysteine-rich FYVE domain . DH domain plays a vital role in the catalysis of GDP-to-GTP exchange， whereas PH and FYVE domains are mainly involved in interactions with different forms of phosphoinositides and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase \\[8，26\\]. As a GEF， frabin stimulates the exchange of GDP for GTP to generate the activated form， which then modulates the activity of downstream targets and effect or molecules. It was demonstrated that frabin likely has a key role in proliferation， polarization， endocytosis， and survival of Schwann cells， all of which are distinctively required for correct nerve development and accurate myelin maintenance \\[8，10\\]. In cultured Schwann cells， the normal form of frabin colocalized with F-actin and induced the formation of microspikes， whereas the expression of truncated frabin significantly inhibited this effect \\[8，27\\]. What’s more，lack of frabin causes dysmyelination in mice in early peripheral nerve development， followed by profound myelin abnormalities at later stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Besides， the Frabin-Cdc42 axis exerts a crucial effect on developmental Schwann cells and myelination. When frabin was over expressed in cultured cells， it can enhance GTP-loading of GTPases， then Rho GTPases function as molecular switches that are implicated in a wide variety of downstream signal-transduction pathways， including regulation of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton during cell migration， morphogenesis， polarization， and proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Previous studies have demonstrated that Cdc42 and Racl are required for Schwann cells migration and proliferation， and regulate Schwann cells process extension and stabilization， allowing**\n\n【49】**efficient radial sorting and myelin sheath folding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. A significant reduction in active Cdc42 was found in FGD4knockout mice. Genetic disruption of Cdc42 in Schwann cells of myelinated nerves resulted in demyelination similar to those observed in frabin-deficient mice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， while axon sorting deficits in Schwann cells lacking laminins were improved after forced activation of Cdc42 and/or Racl 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.Overall， it is strongly suggested that CMT4H is a disease of various impaired signaling pathways.**\n\n【50】**Up to now， about 29 FGD4 mutations have been reported in patients with CMT4H， most of them predicted to result in truncated or absent protein (nonsense， frame shift， or splicing mutations)\\[17，18，23，30\\]. The mutations mainly affect the DH domain， two PH domains， and FYVE domain . It seems that patients homozygous for nonsense or splicing mutations may be related to an infantile-onset and delayed motor milestones. However， there is no notable trend between the disease progression， phenotypic severity and the mutations of different types or in different domains. Previous studies suggested that a nonsense variant might translate a truncated protein since the affected mRNA wasn’t degraded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Additionally， reduced microspike formation was found in cell cultures transfected with truncated forms of frabin \\[8，27\\]. The two novel mutations described here were highly functional conservative and located in domains FYVE and PH2， which were interacted with polyphosphoinositides and implicated in morphogenesis， membrane trafficking， signal transduction， and cytoskeleton dynamics \\[8，26\\]. In addition， the nonsense mutation c.1951C>T (p.Q651X) in our study resulted in a prematurely truncated protein. Thus， we can speculate that the rapid protein degradation and resulting haploinsufficiency caused by the mutations may consequently result in the impaired Rho GTPase signaling and dysregulation of membrane-transport processes， which subsequently perturb Schwann cell morphology， polarity， or proliferation， and impel the formation of myelin outfoldings， causing aberrant myelination in peripheral nerves\\[8，10\\]. Further detailed molecular mechanism underlies the signaling is warranted to be explored. Since the relative rarity and progressive course， affected patients with autosomal recessive or sporadic early-onset， slowly progressive CMT disease should be considered to screen the FGD4 mutations. Currently， there is no therapy progress for this hereditary peripheral neuropathy. Individuals with CMT4H are often evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists， physiatrists， orthopedic surgeons， and physical therapists. Rho GTPases and the frabin-Cdc42 axis are promising candidates for molecules that are involved in several aspects of Schwann cell biology， including those associated with myelin development and homeostasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. The knowledge about the involvement of Rho GTPase signaling in an inherited neuropathy provides a direction to a better understanding of the development， degeneration， and regeneration of the peripheral nervous system. It is noteworthy that complicated signaling pathways leading to the pathology remain to be elucidated， which may shed light on the pathogenetic studies and achieve a breakthrough in therapeutic approaches \\[32，33\\].**\n\n【51】**Conclusion**\n\n【52】**In conclusion， we described a Chinese CMT4H patient with novel FGD4 mutations. CMT4H is a very early onset demyelinating disease with variable phenotypes. By studying and reviewing the disorder， we summarized the phenotype， expanded the genotype spectrum. However， we are still far from a comprehensive picture**\n\n【53】**of the information concerning frabin function and the following molecular signaling. Identification of the underlying mechanisms of Schwann cell damage in inherited neuropathies may hold promise for the development of therapies not only for these rare entities but also for a broad spectrum of more acquired demyelinating disorders of the peripheraland central nervous system.**\n\n【54】**Funding**\n\n【55】**This work was supported by the Grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81870889 and 82071258)</u> and Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning(No.20184Y0056).**\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Due to insufficient diagnostic evidence at clinical presentation， there is a need for additional diagnostic tests. Thus myocardial perfusion imaging aids in complementing the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of these patients.**\n\n【16】**A 52-year-old woman presented acute chest pain in the Nuclear Cardiology waiting room.

In these cases， high-sensitivity cardiac enzymes alone could be insufficient to confirm an Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). However， the use of technetium-99(99Tc) Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) in the acute phase of an Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) may be useful in detecting abnormalities of coronary blood flow during acute myocardial ischemia.**\n\n【20】**In this article， we describe the case of a patient who presented with unstable angina while in the waiting room for a myocardial perfusion study. Gated-SPECT confirmed the diagnosis of Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI).**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 52-year-old female patient with a history of tobacco use came to our Nuclear Cardiology Department for myocardial perfusion assessment due to atypical angina. During her preparation for the test in the waiting room， she suddenly presented with oppressive chest pain 10/10 on the Visual Analogue (VAS)Scale whichlasted 10 min； and was accompanied by dyspnea and adrenergic symptoms. Three 12-lead EKGs taken at rest showed no ST-segment abnormalities ， while two more subsequent EKGs showed dynamic changes in the ST-segment . With the possibility of unstable angina， 10 mCi of Tc99m MIBI radiotracer was administered intravenously， and the patient was referred to the cardiology department for classification and management. Myocardial perfusion images during this period showed a non-transmural perfusion defect from the apical to the basal third of the inferior wall and in the inferolateral region (Right Coronary Artery\\[RCA\\]/Circumflex Artery \\[Cx\\] territory)， and a transmural apical and middle-third of anteroseptal perfusion defect， which extends as non-transmural to the middle-third of the septal and inferolateral walls (left anterior descending arteryterritory)，. The enzyme curve confirmed a NSTEMI. The patient was admitted to the catheterization laboratory， where an obstructive lesion was observed in the proximal segment of the Left Anterior Descending artery (LAD). Thus angioplasty with drug-eluting stent placement was decided. The Cx and RCA were dominant and chronically occluded， however， these occlusions were collateral and without significant functional impact on myocardial**\n\n| 坐 全1 -0.1.-04 V  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| aVR-0.2.-0.1 V4 0.1.02  |  |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n\n| B V1 V4  |\n| --- |\n\n|  |  | Eawf  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n【28】**Figure 1： (A) 12-lead EKG.

In NSTEMI events， an enzymatic curve is useful to differentiate between myocardial infarction and unstable angina. In patients with unstable angina， mortality risk stratification scales like GRACE， TIMI or HEART are useful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. High-risk patients are submitted to coronary intervention，while intermediate-to-low risk patients have been shown to benefit more from noninvasive anatomical or functional studies， such as Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) or SPECT.

Nuclear cardiology studies offer considerable advantages in a cardiology department， such as safe radiotracers use without prior renal or hepatic function evaluation； the versatility of usage in patients with cardiac devices (e.g.， pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators)； and the ability to demonstrate which territory ofthe myocardial wall is most affected.**\n\n【33】**Additionally， in patients that present in the acute phase ofan ACS， complete revascularization in comparison to revascularization of only the affected vessel is a current controversy.

Myocardial perfusion studies allow physicians to determine which myocardial territories are at higher risk and if an invasive and aggressive revascularization strategy might be more appropriate.**\n\n【37】**The radiotracers of choice for these protocols are typically technetium-containing agents. Their physical and pharmacokinetic properties allow image acquisition of up to 6 h after administration， reflecting myocardial perfusion at the moment of intravenous injection. Most of the studies that have used SPECT in cardiology departments show both high sensitivity and a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) close to 100% for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction， especially if the radiotracer is injected during an episode of chest pain or during the 6 following hours. Its high sensitivity comes at the**\n\n【38】**expense of its low negative predictive value and specificity which is close to 75%. Another disadvantage is the requirement of an in-situ99Mo/99mTc generator for radiotracers preparation， in addition to the need for trained personnel and an exclusive emergency-image-acquisition gamma camera \\[10，11\\].**\n\n【39】**A future direction for research could be the inclusion of Tc-containing agents (which give a “frozen\" image at the moment of administration) while comparing different revascularization strategies in patients with an ACS， aiming to identify the amount of viable myocardium.**\n\n【40】**Because of the above-mentioned advantages， myocardial perfusion imaging is an extremely useful tool in patients with chest pain and unclear or unavailable EKG or cardiac enzymes. Myocardial perfusion studies may be used to guide diagnosis， management and as a prognostic tool in patients that are admitted to the cardiovascular emergency room.

It is a rare tumor but probably under-diagnosed because it is often confused with other entities. It is mainly localized in the deep soft tissues of proximal regions of the limbs and trunk.

It is a rare tumor but probably under-diagnosed because it is often confused with other entities. It is mainly localized in the deep soft tissues of proximal regions of the limbs and trunk， but other locations were also reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Only isolated head and neck cases are reported \\[3，4\\]. We report a 70 old patient with LGFMS located in the right supra-clavicular area.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 70 years old woman， admitted in ENT consultation department， with a painless cervical mass evolving for 17 months， progressively increasing in volume. She had no history of trauma or neck radiation. The clinical exam showed a right supra clavicular mass， without inflammatory signs or fistula， solid， well-delineated and mobile. There were no lymphadenopathies **\n\n【19】**The patient reported no signs of dyspnea or dysphonia or dysphagia. The cervical CT-Scan showed a large mass in right supraclavicular area， measuring 8，5x6x5cm， without bone lyses， isodense， repressing the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the right thyroid lobe， and taking the vascular carotid jugular package. The enhancement was heterogene . Histological exam showed a fibro -adipose tissue， dissociated by a malignant mesenchymal tumor proliferation of spindle and globular cells with moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm.**\n\n【20】**Nuclei were hyperchrom and irregular with many atypical figures andmitosis. Immunohistochemistry exam was positive for cytokeratin， MUC4 and CD34. It was negative for smooth muscle lactin， desmine and PS100. Low-Grade Fibromyxoid Sarcoma of the neck was retained . Resection of the tumor was discussed but since it takes large vessels of the neck， the patient was directed to oncology department for palliative chemotherapy.**\n\n【21】**_Citation：_**\n\n【22】**_is properly cited._**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Figures of the mass in the supraclavicular area.**\n\n【24】**Figure 2： Axial section of the neck before and after injection of contrast product with enhancement showing the invasion of the vascular carotid jugular package， the right thyroid lobe (nodule)， with an intact larynx.**\n\n【25】**Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma was described for the first time by Evans in 1987. He presented two deceptively benign-appearing， unclassifiable but very similar fibromyxoid sarcoma characterized histologically by bland， innocuous-appearing fibroblastic cells and a swirling and whorled growth pattern. He suggested the designation《 low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma 》 for these tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It’s very particular morphology， its biological evolution sometimes aggressive despite a benign histological appearance， the existence of remarkable**\n\n【26】**morphological variants， its association with specific genetic alterations and its immunophenotype make it a topic of interest to pathologists.**\n\n【27】**The Evans' tumor occurs most often among young adults (range20 to 50 years) but can affect people of any age， including children and elderly people. Tang reported a case of a 22-month old boy with a large LGFMS in the right cheek 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The male predominance appears to be a typical feature of LGFMS in most studies \\[2，4\\]. Our patient was a female aged 70 years. LGFMS occurs in the soft tissues of the extremities， but cases have been reported involving the thoracic cavity， abdomen and bowel， and peritoneum， superficial locations are rarely observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-8\\]</u>. Localization in head and neck is very rare. Morgan reported four head and neck cases. The tumors were located in the posterior cervical spine， facial skin， mandible and larynx 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Tang， in a data review based on the medline database， reported only17 head and neck cases of 245 LGFMS of deep soft tissues cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The size may vary from 1 cm to over 20 cm in diameter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The case we present were located in the right supra clavicular area.**\n\n【28】**CT scan demonstrates a well-delineated， relatively low density to isodense tumor.

In our case， the tumor was isodense， repressing the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the right thyroid lobe， and takingthe vascular carotid jugular package. The enhancement was heterogene. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is admitted to be more efficient.**\n\n【31】**Histologically， LGFMS are characterized by alternating fibrous and myxoid areas， with a swirling， whorled growth pattern， at least in some parts， low to moderate cellularity， and bland， deceptively benign-appearing fibroblastic spindle cells， with no or slight nuclear pleomorphism and few mitotic figures. Enrolled vessels with hypercellularity and perivascular sclerosis are often visible.**\n\n【32】**It is more common for recurrent and metastatic neoplasms to closely resemble the primary tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>. Sometimes， Evans'tumor may also have collagen rosettes made of a rounded sclerotic center surrounded by a palisade of plump fibroblasts. When the tumor is particularly rich in rosettes， the designation“hyalinizing spindle cell tumor with giant rosettes”(HSCT) may be used. It is just a special morphological variant of Evans tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.**\n\n【33】**Sometimes a \"epithelioid sclerosing fibrosarcoma\" is developed in an Evans' tumor background， and this is quite obviously a different morphological variant of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In our case， histological exam showed a fibroadipose tissue， dissociated by a malignant mesenchymal tumor proliferation of spindle and globular cells with moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm. Nuclei were hyperchrome and irregular with many atypical figures and mitosis which is consistent with literature. In immunohistochemistry exam， LGFMS may be occasionally positive for desmin， smooth muscle actin， epithelial membrane antigen and CD34， but it is generally negative for S100protein， Leu-7， and neuron-specific enolase. Recently， MUC4 is**\n\n【34】**observed in the majority of Evans’ tumors， including HSCT and sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma \\[11，12\\]. The sensitivity， but is not100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Specificity is excellent. Immunohistochemestry exam， in our patient， was positive for cytokeratin， MUC4 and CD34. It was negative for smooth muscle lactin， desmine and PS100.**\n\n【35】**Molecularly， Evans tumor is characterized by a translocation of chromosomes 7 and 16 or a ring chromosome juxtaposing portions of genes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Wide surgical resection was considered the best treatment of LGFMS by many investigators. In addition， adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy were mentioned in some reports. No evidence was found that radiotherapy or chemotherapy might cure the disease effectively. Because of the relative high rate of recurrence and distant metastasis， long time follow-up is advised 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Many recent larger series of LGFMS did not identify any cases in the head and neck region， which means that our case is exceptional.**\n\n【36】**Conclusion**\n\n【37】**Low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma is a rare tumor of deep soft tissues， rarely developed in head and neck. Its diagnosis is not always easy. The progress in immunohistochemistry and molecular biology may help to diagnose this deceptively bland malignancy tumor.**\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\. Evans HL.

However， few literatures have been focused on surgical treatment for the cases of vestibular schwannoma coexisted with high jugular bulb (HJB). Here we report our experience in dealing with such a case. A 37-year-old man presented with a6-month-history ofprogressive tinnitus andhearing impairing on his right side. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies revealed a homogeneous enhanced tumor in the right cerebellopontine angle (CPA)， with extension into the internal acoustic meatus (IAM). Thin layer computerized tomography (CT) with bone window demonstrated a HJB. By adopting special techniques to drill off the posterior wall of IAM and remove the tumor through“membrane dissection\"，the tumor was completely resected with the preservation of HJB and facial nerve. The post-operative recovery was uneventfully. The details of the case are described in the following， with the attached surgical video.**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Vestibular schwannoma is a benign tumor arising from the myelyin-forming cell of the vestibular nerve. The estimated incidence of vestibular schwannoma is about 1 in 100，000. Microsurgical resection of vestibular schwannoma through the classic retrosigmoid approach has been the standard treatment for this benign tumor. Due to the common extension of this tumor into the internal acoustic meatus， it is critical to drill off the posterior wall of internal acoustic meatus， in order to achieve complete removal of this part of tumor. In doing so， there is possibility that the jugular bulb will be encountered， if it is high riding.**\n\n【14】**The jugular bulb is situated between the horizontal course of the sigmoid sinus and the upper end of the internal jugular vein (IJV) at the skull base. The sigmoid sinus and the inferior petrosal sinus join the jugular bulb and it opens directly into the IJV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Couloigner et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> summarized various definitions and criteria for high jugular bulb (HJB). HJB has been defined when the dome of jugular bulb reaches above the inferior part of the round window (RW) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， the inferior edge of the internal acoustic meatus (IAM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， the inferior part of the cochlear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> and the inferior bony annulus of the tympanic membrane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. For each type of HJB different occurrence rates were reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. From a neurosurgical point of view， a jugular fossa above the inferior edge of the IAM is classified as a high one. HJB were classified into three grades by Samii et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> as follows： Grade I， jugular bulb situated less than 1.5 mm above the low border of the IAM； Grade II， jugular bulb between 1.5 and 3.0 mm above the low border of the IAM； Grade III， jugularbulb>3 mm above the low border of IAM通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.**\n\n【15】**Even though the co-existence of HGB and vestibular schwannoma is a rare condition， when encountered， there will be additional technical obstacle for exposing the internal acoustic meatus. Here，bypresenting a vestibular schwannoma case accompanied with HJB， we report our experience in overcoming this difficult circumstance.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 37-year-old man presented with a 6-month-history of progressive high tone tinnitus and hearing impairing on his right side. The physical examination showed the patient’s facial function was normal. Audiometric and audiological examination was normal. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies showed a homogeneously enhancing tumor in the right cerebellopontine angle (CPA)，with extension into the IAM. The pre-operative diagnosis was vestibular schwannoma graded as T3a， according to the classification system proposed by Samii 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. High-resolution thin layer (2mm) computerized tomography (CT) scan with bone window revealed that there was a HJB**\n\n【18】**(Grade III).**\n\n【19】**Microsurgical resection of this tumor was performed via the retrosigmoid approach， with the patient in the lateral position. After dura incision， the cerebrospinal fluid was released from the cisterna， and thus relaxing the brain immediately for further expose. The cerebellum was gently retracted back and the tumor was seen. Electrophysiological stimulation of the dorsal part of the tumor was undertaken， which excluded the existence of facial nerve on this part of tumor， after this insurance， intra-capsular central debulking was performed， creating working space for the subsequent procedure. An arc-shaped excisionofthe durabehind theposteriorlip ofthe IAMover an area of about 1 cm， the posterior wall of the IAM was progressively removed with a diamond drill. A large drill (4 mm in diameter) was used at the beginning， but as the fundus was approached，smaller drill(1-2 mm in diameter) was used. During the drilling， irrigation was used to cool the bone. We identified the jugular bulb under a thin shell of bone. After compressing the jugular bulb， the fundus was extensively exposed. Smaller drill was used to remove fundus again. In the area of the fundus， tumor removal should proceed in a medial to lateral direction until the right-angle dissector could touch the end of IAM. At last， we used gelatin sponge to seal off jugular bulb by glue. We used right-angle dissector to remove the tumor in the IAM slightly and electrophysiological response could prompt us the position of the facial nerve in IAM. As soon as the pressure of the tumor on the adjacent structures is reduced， dissection of the tumor from the surrounding neural and vascular structures is performed by strictly gripping the tumor capsule and dissecting in the level of the arachnoid plane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The tumor was removed totally and the facial nerve was intact. At last， the posterior wall of IAM was sealed off by muscle debris with glue. Postoperative pure tone test showed hearing level of bone conduction decreased about 10dB.**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**The retrosigmoidapproach has been considered by neurosurgeons as the standard method for the surgical management of vestibular schwannoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In the retrosigmoid approach， drilling the posterior wall of IAM to remove the tumor is one of the essential steps. In this step，the posterior semicircular canal， the vestibular aqueduct， and the jugular bulb may be injured when drilling the posterior wall of IAM. Injury of the semicircular canal or vestibular aqueduct may cause a deterioration of hearing with vestibular disturbance. Inadvertent injury of the jugular bulb causes massive bleeding. Preoperativehigh-**\n\n【22】**resolution CT with thin slices (1-2 mm) and bone win dow is essential for assessing the HJB position and its adjacent structures including the posterior semicircular canal and the vestibular aqueduct.**\n\n【23】**In this case， we found the position of HJB in high-resolution CT. After drilling a thin layer of the posterior wall bone of IAM， and identifying the jugular bulb under a thin shell of bone in the operation， then compressing the HJB in order to expose the posterior wall of IAM. A smaller drill was used to remove the bone. The surgical management in this case avoided massive bleeding from jugular vein and removed the tumor in IAM.**\n\n【24】**In conclusion， with preoperative CT bone window assessment of the HJB and careful intraoperative management as mentioned above， we think that the vestibular schwannoma can be removed totally， especially in the IAM and avoid massive bleeding from HJB.**\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**1\\.

Presently neuroimaging， blood and CSF biomarkers are expensive and invasive to perform and are considered impractical for research purpose. The retinal presents a readily accessible tissue for monitoring the brain and could potentially be used in combination with or as a substitute for current ADand other neurodegenerative disease biomarkers. Data on retinal involvement in AD and neurodegenerative diseases have been controversial and inconsistent. So， we are reporting a case of choroideremia with neuropsychiatric presentations and complications.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Choroideremia； Neuropsychiatry； Retina； Vision**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Choroideremia is a x-linked recessive， progressive， degenerative disorder of retina and choroid that mainly affects males. It is caused by loss of function mutations in the choroideremia gene resulting in decreased Rab Escort Protein-1(REP-1) expression which leads to degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium， photoreceptors， and choroid. The first symptom of this condition is usually an impairment of night vision (night blindness)， which can occur in early childhood. A progressive narrowing of the field of vision (tunnel vision) follows， as well as a decrease in the ability to see details (visual acuity) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. These vision problems are due to an ongoing loss of cells (atrophy) in the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (retina) and a nearby network of blood vessels (the choroid). The vision impairment in Choroideremia worsens over time， but the progression varies among affected individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Visual impairments due to Choroideremia are associated with emotional， functional， and economic burden. Prevalence is 1 in 50，000 to 100，000and accounts 4% of all blindness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. There have been some reports of choroideremia patients with neurological complications. But there is scarcity of literature on neuropsychiatric symptomatology and choroideremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 65-year-old gentleman， right-handed， educated up to post graduation， non-hypertensive， non-diabetic and a known case of choroideremia which was diagnosed with genetic and ophthalmic investigations， with complains of Increased irritability for 2 years， dizziness and frequent falls， for1.5 years and increased for 1.5 months， tremulousness of right side of hands at rest for 1.5 years， forgetfulness for 6 months increased for 1.5 months. On further enquiry patient reports that he is also having bi-occipital dull aching headache for 1.5 months which gets partially relieved on he turns his head upwards. So， most time of day he would keep his head upward position. He is dependent on family members for daily activities for and unable to handle his finance，laundry， medications for1.5 months. History of frequent head injury due to fall. In premorbid personality he had obsessive compulsive personality traits. On general examination he was conscious， oriented. Neurological examination suggestive of cogwheel rigidity in right upper limb，power， reflexes in all limbs normal. Pill rolling tremors in right hand at rest. For walking he needed assistance and had shuffling gait with stopped posture. Bilateral pupils reacting to light but only perception of light was present. On Mental Status Examination- recent memory impaired， with Mini Mental Status Examination score22/28， copying and writing he could not do due to vision impairment .**\n\n【18】**Treatment**\n\n【19】**Considering irritability patient started on tablet Quetiapine 25 mg at night and as per needed.

Then peripheral field loss occurs over the next few decades. The disease presents with patchy areas of depigmentation which spreads from periphery to central part of choroid retinal laver with a characteristic salt and pepper mottling \\[5，6\\]. In the involved areas， there is diffuse atrophy of the choriocapillaries and retinal pigmented epithelium. The central visual acuity is preserved until the patient's 50s， and retinal blood vessels are not affected. The macular area remains intact until late in the course of disease， with preserved visual acuity. There are case reports of choroideremia with clinically undiagnosed psychiatric syndromes. Some case has presented with isolated symptoms of nyctalopia， progressive visual painlessness， painless and foreign body sensation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-11\\]</u>. In this case report subiect had unreported visual symptoms till the age of 30. He started symptoms of difficult vision in night at his 30’s but he was diagnosed with the condition from ophthalmologist by genetic testing and with optical coherence tomography. Although neuropsychological symptoms are difficult to diagnose and under reported and this case report shows the rarest presentation of choroideremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>. As the disease is x-linked his son has got a risk of developing the condition so the genetic counseling was also conducted. The absolute diagnosis of choroideremia is based on the identification of clinical features combined with additional imaging exams which is done in all the reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-12\\]</u>.**\n\n【27】**Prognosis**\n\n【28】**As this a genetic condition with unsatisfactory prognosis symptomss canbDecontrolled withhperiodiccophthalmologic examination especially when central vision is affected， and cystoid macular edema is suspected. The neuropsychiatric sequel can be successfully controlled with early diagnosis and preventive measures.**\n\n【29】**Conclusion**\n\n【30】**Choroideremia is a genetic retinal disease which is rare and causes blindness mainly in middle-aged men. We are yet to know how the biochemical defect that causes the retinal-specific disease and if it has any hidden effects on the rest of the body especially the brain. This case report throws light into the unusual neuropsychiatric symptoms in an established case of chloridemia.**\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**References**</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\. Ohba N.
