This is a 27-year-old female， who presented with headache， right-sided body weakness， dysarthria， blurred vision， and progressive altered level of consciousness over a course of 2 days， preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection 7 days prior to the onset of the above - mentioned symptoms. Brain MRI showed extensive abnormal white matter lesions which appear hyperintense， involving occipital， parietal， and temporal lobes， more on the left side. CSF exam showed high protein. According to the clinical and MRI findings， she was diagnosed as severe ADEM. She was started on high dose steroids and plasma exchange. Unfortunately， her condition deteriorated rapidly with sudden drop in her level of consciousness with fixed dilated pupils. Urgent imaging showed uncal herniation. Lifesaving urgent left decompressive hemicraniectomy was performed with subsequent resolution of herniation radiologically and clinically. She was kept on steroid and plasmapheresis， followed by Intravenc Immunoglobulin (IVIG) with gradual improvement. After one month， she completely recovered and became independent in her activities， with significantly improved MRIlesions. In conclusions， severe ADEM complicated by uncal herniation is an extremely rare presentation of the disease. Urgent and aggressive interventions， including decompressive surgeries， can save lives and lead to favorable outcomes.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： ADEM disease；Decompression； Craniectomy；IVIG**\n\n【19】**Abbreviations**\n\n【20】**ADEM： Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis； IVIG： Intravenous Immunoglobulin； GCS：Glasgow Coma Scale； FLAIR： Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery； ICP： Intracranial Pressure**\n\n【21】**Introduction**\n\n【22】**ADEM (Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis) is an autoimmune disease， characterized by demyelination of the CNS， which is commonly preceded by viral disease or vaccine administration， with a latent period of 4 to 21 days before the onset of symptoms， although the inciting event could not be found in many cases \\[1\\]. This disease occurs more commonly in children and adolescents than adults. It’s a rare disease and its actual incidence is still unknown \\[2\\]. Typically， ADEM is monophasic， and patients usually present with an acute onset of multifocal neurologic symptoms with encephalopathy. Motor deficit is the main presenting symptom \\[1，2\\]. The diagnosis of ADEM disease is clinical and supported by neuroimaging. MRI usually shows demyelinating lesions in the white matter of the brain \\[1，2\\]. CSF analysis usually shows non-specific changes \\[2\\]. Management of ADEM disease includes high dose steroid， Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG)， and plasmapheresis， with no definite guidelines regarding the optimal therapeutic approach\\[2-5\\].**\n\n【23】**Rarely， ADEM disease can be complicated by significant Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP) due to massive brain edema， brain herniation and death. After reviewing the literature， we found that only very few cases of severe ADEM disease complicated by uncal herniation that required**\n\n【24】**Figure 1： Initial brain MRI.

Herein， we report a case of a 27-year-old female， who was diagnosed with severe ADEM， complicated by significant brain edema， and uncal herniation， that was managed by left decompressive hemicraniectomy with full recovery within one month of therapy.**\n\n【26】**Case Presentation**\n\n【27】**A 27 year old female patient， with unremarkable past history， was admitted to our hospital with a history of headache， nausea， vomiting， right-sided body weakness， dysarthria， blurred vision， and progressive altered level of consciousness over a course of 2 days. These symptoms were preceded by upper respiratory tract infection(dry cough and general weakness) 7 days prior to the onset of the above mentioned symptoms.**\n\n【28】**At presentation， her examination was remarkable for altered sensorium with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13/15， preserved pupillary response， right sided hemiplegia with a power of 0/5， weakness of her left side with a power of 1/5， extensor plantar reflex bilateral. Brain MRI showed extensive abnormal white matter intensities which appear hyperintense on T2/Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)， involving occipital， parietal， and temporal lobes， more on the left side， associated with local edema but with no herniation or significant midline shift (Figure 1). Laboratory investigations were unremarkable. CSF analysis was normal except for high protein levels. Coronavirus PCR test was negative. All other viral serology and PCR were negative.**\n\n【29】**Due to her acute presentation and the MRI findings， severe**\n\n【30】**ADEM disease was diagnosed. She was started on medical treatment with IV Methylprednisolone 1 gram daily for 5 days， and anti-edema medications (IV Mannitol and PO Acetazolamide) to decrease the ICP. As the presentation was severe， plasmapheresis was started as an additional therapeutic approach.**\n\n【31】**Unfortunately， on the next day， her condition deteriorated as she developed a sudden onset drop in her level of consciousness with fixed dilated pupils. Intubation was done to secure the airways； an urgent brain CT scan showed midline shifting to the right and uncal herniation. Urgent left decompressive hemicraniectomy was performed. After the procedure， pupils returned to be reactive， and controlbrain CT scan showed resolution ofthe midline shift and uncal herniation， with the same finding of brain edema. She was continued on medical treatment that included 7 sessions of plasmapheresis， and5 days of pulse steroid， followed by tapering oral prednisolone.**\n\n【32】**Two weeks after the procedure she was fully conscious， power in the left side improved to 3/5， but her right-sided hemiplegia did not improve. She was successfully weaned from the ventilator and extubated. Control Brain MRI done atthat time showed improvement in the brain edema and the intensity of the previously mentioned lesions (Figure 2).**\n\n【33】**As patient’s right sided hemiplegia did not improve， she was given IVIG 1 gm/Kg/dose for 3 days as a third -line medical treatment. The patient showed good clinical response after IVIG， manifested by a gradual improvement in her right side power (around 3 weeks after the decompression) with a gradual return to her activities of daily livings. After then， the patient was discharged home after 50 days**\n\n【34】**Figure 2： Control brain MRI. A， B： Shows improving hyperintense lesions on T2， FLAIR， respectively， C： shows improving hypointense lesion on T1.**\n\n【35】**of hospitalization， in good general condition， ambulating without assistance， and with full power in her four extremities.**\n\n【36】**Discussion**\n\n【37】**As ADEM is an autoimmune disease， immunosuppressive therapy is widely used as a first line management， including high dose steroid.Other treatment modalities include IVIG and plasmapheresis in patients who show poor response to steroid \\[2，5\\]. Severe forms of ADEM with a fatal outcome despite optimal medical therapy have been described. ADEM can rarely be complicated by massive brain edema， with life threatening increased ICP， and brain herniation that may not respond to the standard edema medical management(osmotherapy， hyperventilation， and sedation).TTheCoptimal management of such an extreme presentation is not yet clear.**\n\n【38】**Our patient had severe ADEM presentation according to the clinical and MRI findings. Her condition continued to deteriorate and she developed uncal herniation， despite optimal medical therapy with high dose steroid and plasmapheresis. Lifesaving decompressive hemicraniectomy was urgently performed to reduce the ICP， and the patient has fully recovered after that with no residual deficits. Surgical decompression for elevated ICP is a well-established neurosurgical intervention in other diseases like infarction， infection， and trauma\\[7\\]. In severe ADEM， such intervention was only reported as a successful therapy in a very few cases worldwide \\[3-6\\]， and so long term outcome and quality of life of these patients remain a concern， especially if this intervention was performed in tthe dominant hemisphere of the brain.**\n\n【39】**This report emphasizes that aggressive intervention such as decompressive hemicraniectomy may be a lifesaving decision in some patients with severe ADEM who deteriorate despite standard immunosuppressive and anti-edema therapy， and this and support what was reported in other previous reports.**\n\n【40】**Conclusion**\n\n【41】**Severe ADEM disease complicated by significant brain edema and uncal herniation is an extremely rare presentation of this disease. Urgent and _d_ aggressive interventions， including decompressive craniectomy， can save lives and lead to favorable outcomes.**\n\n【42】**References**\n\n【43】**1\\. De Seze J， Debouverie M. Zephir H.

Both fetuses presented dysmorphic features at expulsion and were found to have an Xp22 deletion， encompassing 9 genes among which the SHOX gene. The mother carries this deletion and presents very mild phenotypic features. We believe this deletion is responsible for intrauterine demise in male fetuses.**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Miscarriages occur in about 5 to 10% of all pregnancies. In approximately 50% of the cases a chromosomal anomaly is found to be the cause of the miscarriage. Unfortunately， in up to 50% of the cases the etiology remains unknown \\[1\\].**\n\n【15】**For couples with repetitive miscarriages， it is very important to find the underlying problem， in order to give a useful counseling， as their wish for a healthy child is not fulfilled yet and anxiety for another miscarriage grows.**\n\n【16】**From a genetic point of view， new perspectives are rising with the development of new techniques in cytogenetics， such as the CGH-array， especially in a prenatal setting. By using array-CGH an additional 5% of submicroscopic chromosomal rearrangements can be detected，enabling a correct diagnosis for a miscarriage that would otherwise be classified of unknown etiology.**\n\n【17】**In this case report we describe a pedigree in which a couple had one healthy boy and two pregnancies which ended in late miscarriages. These were pregnancies of male fetuses with fetal demise at 18 and 22 weeks of gestation. Both fetuses presented dysmorphic features and an Xp22deletion， encompassing9 genes among which the SHOX gene.**\n\n【18】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【19】**After diagnosis of fetal demise in the second fetus， thorough examination of both mother and fetus was carried out， following the available guidelines.**\n\n【20】**Personal and familial history， with assessment of the pedigree and clinical examination of both fetus and parents were carried out.**\n\n【21】**Radiological examination involved prenatal ultrasound， a total skeletal X-ray， MRI en CT-san of the fetus post-miscarriage.**\n\n【22】**Pathological examination of the fetus was performed subsequently.**\n\n【23】**Karyotyping wasperformed on cultured amniotic cells， obtained by a 10 ml amniotic fluid sample in a syringe.

It was a male fetus， who presented acrocrania due to distinct hydrocephaly and intracranial hemorrhage. Schizencephaly could not be totally excluded. Labor was induced and a male fetus was stillborn with following parameters： weight 495 g(P12-25)， length 260 mm (P25)， HC 210 mm (>p97)， femur length32 mm (p5)， humerus length 30 mm (p5) and AC 190 mm (>p97).**\n\n【35】**A 26 year old woman was referred to the prenatal team because of intrauterine demise ofher fetus. This was seen during routine second trimester ultrasound examination by her gynecologist. At that time it concerned a pregnancy of 22 weeks of gestation.**\n\n【36】**Pedigree examination revealed short stature in the patient (152cm)， her mother (150 cm) and maternal grandmother (140 cm). The grandmother had several miscarriages， but no detailed information was available. The patient has one younger healthy brother， who has no child wish yet. The couple has a healthy son， who is almost 3years old and developing well. Clinical examination of both parents shows normal findings and stature for the father. Examination of**\n\n【37】**At clinical examination the fetus was found to have several dysmorphic features. The face was round with a high forehead， telecanthus with narrow palpebral fissures， small nose with anteriorly rotated nosetrils， smooth philtrum， short broad neck， small dysplastic ears， short but proportionate aspect of the limbs with chubby hands and a distended abdomen (Figure 3-5). Skeletal dysplasia was suspected and X-rays showed moderate shortening of the long bones， but no morphological anomalies of the skeleton， besides a subtle bell shaped thorax (Figure 6-8).**\n\n【38】**Subsequently a CT-scan and MRI were performed (Figure 1) CT-scan showed definite nuchal edema， flat nose， short long bones**\n\n【39】**findings were confirmed. No other associated organ anomalies were found. Placental examination showed normal findings for the age of pregnancy.**\n\n【40】**Genetic results**\n\n【41】Prenatal conventional karyotyping on amniotic cells revealed 46， XY normal karyotype with G-banding in nineteen metaphases\n\n【42】**Array-CGH on amniotic cells revealed an aberrant male arrXp22.33 (60701-2730700)x1； arr Xp22.33(2741300-3419600)x0. A 3.4 Mb terminal deletion of chromosome band Xp22.33 was thus detected. This terminal deletion was also found in the mother and confirmed by FISH technique. Consequently， we considered this3.4 Mb Xp22.33 deletion as an inherited deletion from the mother， probably responsible for lethality in male fetuses.**\n\n【43】**Discussion**\n\n【44】**Figure 7：**\n\n【45】**Figure 8：**\n\n【46】**Figure： 9 Post Mortem lmaging a) Computed Tomography showing nuchal oedema and short long bones without any associated pathological pattern. MRI b) saggital and c) coronal images show severe destructive ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex.**\n\n【47】**without associated bulging nor pathological pattern. The fingers were quite slender. The MRI showed explicit anomalies of the brain， probably caused by several cerebral infarctions with associated hemorrhage en regions with porencephaly. Recent infarctions were described in the cerebellum. There were however no arguments for shizencephaly (Figure 9).**\n\n【48】**In the present report we describe a pedigree marked by several miscarriages in females with short stature. Our patient was diagnosed twice with fetal demise in the second trimester of pregnancy， both times concerning male fetuses. At the time ofthe second miscarriage thorough examination was carried out and a 3.4 Mb Xp22.33 terminal deletion was found by array-CGH on amniotic cells. This region encompasses 9 genes， includingthe SHOX gene. Terminal Xp deletion leads to SHOX haplo insufficiency， and when it exceeds Xp22.33 it causes a variant of Turner syndrome in which gonadal function is preserved and short stature constitutes the major clinical feature \\[2\\]. Other Turner-like stigmata may be present， such as a high-arched palate， abnormal auricular development， cubitus valgus， genu valgum and short metacarpals. Heterozygous defects in the pseudoautosomal SHOX gene or deletion of the SHOX downstream regulatory domain are known to cause Leri-Weil Dyschondrosteosis (LWD)\\[3，4\\].LWD is a dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasia characterized by short stature， mesomelia， and Madelung wrist deformity. Although the disorder occurs in both sexes， it is usually more severe in females， perhaps due to sex difference in estrogen levels. However， pubertal development and fertility are generally normal in both sexes with the disorder \\[3\\]. Deletion of this gene is unlikely to be responsible for all phenotypic features in the fetus， but can be correlated to the phenotype of the mother. Up to now there are no cases described in literature with fetal demise due to LWD. One of the other genes concerned in this deletion is the ARSE gene， in which mutations are responsible for Chondrodysplasia Punctata 1 (CDPX1)).. _This_ is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by failure to thrive， mental retardation， and atypical facies \\[5\\]. Dysmorphic features include short stature， depressed nasal bridge and hypoplasia of the distal phalanges， which is a distinctive feature. These features were all found in both fetuses. In previous reports describing families with CDPX1， fetal demise of male fetuses has been reported a few times. Male patients with deletion of both SHOX gene and ARSE gene have also been reported， having a severe but not a lethal phenotype\\[6\\]. Nevertheless， we believe that in this case the Xp22.33 deletion is probably responsible for the fetal demise， as it is giving rise to a contiguous gene syndrome with recognizable features of LWD and CDPX1 on one hand \\[7\\]， but being lethal due to interactions with other genes included in the deleted region or perhaps epigenetic factors. Nevertheless， this case beautifully shows the difference in phenotypic feature expression between affected males and females for some genetic entities \\[7\\].**\n\n【49】**At pathological examination of the fetus， clinical and radiological This couple was counseled and prenatal diagnosis and pre-**\n\n【50】**implantation genetic diagnosis was discussed. In a subsequent spontaneouspregnancy array-GCHwas performed on chorionic villi sampling. The female fetus did not carry the deletion and showed normal evolution on consecutive ultrasound examinations.**\n\n【51】**References**\n\n【52】**1\\. van den Berg MM， van Maarle MC， van Wely M， Goddijn M.

It is a rarer**\n\n【28】**variant of GB syndrome and usually presents with at least two of the following features： Ataxia， areflexia， and ophthalmoplegia. This disorder is treated by the immunoglobulin and plasma exchange. It is heterogeneous autoimmune disease. Autoantibodies are present against various antigens in peripheral nerves. The Miller Fisher Syndrome is commonly associated with the involvement of the lower cranial and facial nerves and does not usually involve motor weakness of limbs. However， in some cases weakness of the respiratory system and limbs has been described \\[2-6\\].**\n\n【29】**1\\. Mazidi M， Imani B，Norouzy A， Rezaei P. Guillain Barre Syndrome： A case report.

Signet ring is a term used to describe the histologic appearance of a tumor cell with a crescent-shaped nucleus made by cytoplasmic vacuole compression. It is more common in the stomach， followed by colon， pancreas and less commonly in the bladder. Generally， PSCADCP is diagnosed at a later stage and， consequently， has a worse prognosis when compared to conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma \\[1\\]. The grim prognosis and rarity of PSCADCP warrant closer investigation， and much of the literature on this neoplasm is based on case reports. We report a very rare case of early diagnosis in a young man. The treatment and follow-up protocol of these cases has not been established due to the rarity of the disease. However， the literature describes the need for aggressive treatment and very close surveillance.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**A 54-year-old man was referred for evaluation by urology in June 2021. He had lower urinary tract symptoms， but he was asymptomatic on observation by the urologist. The calculated IPSS was 9. Symptoms improved with an alpha-adrenergic blocker. The rectal examination revealed a prostate with about 40cc， unsuspected. He performed an uroflowmetry which was inconclusive because urine volume was <150 ml. The total PSA was 4.23 ng/ml with a 12% free/total PSA ratio.A multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed in August 2021 and revealed a suspicious area in the right lobe， poorly defined， involving the anterior and posterolateral zones of the middle third and apical region， measuring 28 mm x9 mm. There was capsular irregularity， which increases the suspicion of extracapsular extension. The findings classified the lesion as PI-RADS v2.1-5. A prostate biopsy identified acinar adenocarcinoma in 15% of the fragments of the right lobe， Gleason 8 (4+4). Staging was performed with PET-PSMA， which described a high**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： HE 20x， prostate acinar adenocarcinoma.**\n\n【22】**Figure 2： HE 100x， prostate acinar adenocarcinoma Gleason 4 pattern and signet ring cells.**\n\n【23】**intensity focus on the right lobe， centered on the middle floor， lateral and posteriorly and nonspecific bilateral pulmonary nodules. Chest computed tomography detected uncharacteristic micronodules. Thus， the patient underwent retropubic radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection in November 2021. There were no complications， and the patient was discharged on the third postoperative day. The histology revealed a poorly differentiated acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate， histological variant signet-like cells (30%). About 60% of neoplasia was classified as Gleason pattern 4 (cribriform pattern) and 10% as pattern 3 (Figures 1-4). The neoplasia was graded Gleason 9 (4+5)，pT2aN0， negative margins， International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade 5. The neoplasia involved 10% of the right lobe tissue (peripheral zone of apex，lower and middle floor). After surgery， he had PSA<0.06 ng/ml.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**PSCADCP can present with voiding problems， but it can present with symptoms related to metastasis since the diagnosis is usually made at an advanced stage of the disease. In our case the patient reported lower urinary tract symptoms that resolve with an alfa-adrenergic blocker. The diagnosis of PSCADCP requires histopathologic examination of the tissue， and it is necessary to prove the prostatic origin of the primary tumor， classically it was necessary to exclude metastases of other organs to the prostate， namely gastrointestinal tract. Currently， available imaging tests allow targeting the origin of the tumor in the prostate. Due to a slightly elevated PSA with a free/total PSA ratio <15%， the patient underwent a multiparametric MRI that was compatible with right lobe prostate carcinoma (PI-RADS v2.1-5) which was confirmed by biopsy. Staging**\n\n【26】**Figure 3： HE 200x， prostate acinar adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells and perineural invasion.**\n\n【27】**Figure 4： HE 400x， prostate acinar adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells.**\n\n【28】**PET-PSMA also revealed intense marking of the right lobe of the prostate，which indicates a neoplasm of prostatic origin. Adjacent foci of more typical prostatic adenocarcinoma strongly favor a prostatic origin， as described in the literature \\[2\\]. There are reviews that admit that the minority ofpatients (31%) had a documented gastrointestinal work-up to determine the primary signet cancer cells source \\[3\\].**\n\n【29】**The name signet cell was given because of the appearance of the cell， since large vacuoles push the cell nucleus to the periphery. The4h edition of the Classification of Tumors of the Urinary System and Male Genital Organs， from World Health Organization， in agreement with other authors， considers that to diagnose PSCADCP， signet cells should comprise more than 25% of the tumor \\[2，4\\]. Immunohistochemical techniques can be performed when there are doubts. In fact，certain histologic appearance can belike the signet ring cell， such as vacuolated lymphocytes and altered smooth muscle cells after radiotherapy or hormone therapy. Guerin et al. \\[5\\] suggested that signet ring carcinoma cells should be classified as a variant of high-grade adenocarcinoma rather than a separate histologic classification. In support of this proposition， a signet ring carcinoma cell is often found in the presence of other high-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma patterns. The diagnosis of PSCADCP is certainly a histologic diagnosis that can be done using needle biopsy，endoscopic resection specimens， orprostatectomy specimens. Gleason score sum of 9 or 10 is typical and is usualy associated with a high stage， early spread to bones and viscera， and poor outcomes. In our patient， the radical prostatectomy specimen revealed 30% of the tumor formed by signet ring cells. About 60% of the neoplasia is classified as Gleason pattern 4(cribriform pattern) and 10% as pattern 3. Thus， the prostate**\n\n【30】**cancer was classified as Gleason 9 (4+5)， ISUP grade group 5.**\n\n【31】**Warner et al. \\[3\\] in their review of 9 cases of PSCADCP calculated that mean age was 68.2 years. Blas et al. \\[6\\]， in 2019，reviewed 5 cases of PSCADCP and found a mean age of 77.8 years and mean PSA level of 18 ng/ml (10.6 ng/ml to 331 ng/ml). The patient described in this article is young when compared to the mean ages described in the literature. In addition， it had a slightly increased PSA level， little suspicious of neoplasia， different from the values described in some reviews. Wang et al. \\[7\\] identified that younger age (40 to 50vs. >70) was a predictor of worse cancer specific survival， despite more aggressive therapy. This information could be useful when counseling these patients and emphasizes the need for new strategies and molecular-based therapeutic approaches for these cases.**\n\n【32】**Fujita et al. \\[2\\] presented a case series of 42 patients with PSCADCP and found that up to 75% of cases present with locally advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Stage IV disease was a predictor of poor survival. Furthermore， they showed that the survival rates after the initial diagnosis was 82.3% in the first year， 54.7% in the third year and 11.7% in the fifth year. Warner et al.\\[3\\] showed an average survival time of 29 months and 33% of patients presented at diagnosis with stage IV cancer. Bronkema et al. \\[8\\] also concluded that metastatic disease was most common with PSCADCP(10.3%) compared to non-variant cases (4.2%)； PSCADCP presents with higher local stage than non-variant tumors. Warner et al. \\[3\\] reviewed 9 cases and all were diagnosed at an advanced stage and， despite multidisciplinary treatments， the mortality rate was very high， around 66%. Recent case reports continue to alert for diagnosis at a very advanced stage of the disease， which implies a poor prognosis\\[1，9\\]. Kim et al. \\[9\\] reported a 56-year-old man with hematuria which exams identified a bladder mass. Consequently， transurethral resection was performed， and histological evaluation revealed a signet ring cancer invading muscularis propria. He was submitted to radical cystoprostatectomy. The histology revealed that tumor involved both prostate and bladder， but its center was in the prostate and definitive diagnosis was PSCADCP. Chemoradiotherapy was initiated two months later， but patient developed bone and liver metastases and died. Despite the poor prognosis and description of mortality in practically all cases， there are more recent case reports of therapeutic success. Gok et al. \\[10\\] presented a case without any evidence of disease 16 months after combination of hormone therapy and radiotherapy. Fortunately， the case described in this case report was diagnosed at a very early stage， which is very rare and may imply a better prognosis for the patient.**\n\n【33】**The optimal treatment strategy for this subtype of prostate cancer is unknown because few cases were reported. Historically， the treatment approach for PSCADCP has been like that for traditional prostate adenocarcinoma， involving combinations of hormonal therapy， radiation， and surgery. However， the response to hormonal therapy is unpredictable \\[3\\]. Kim et al. \\[9\\] concluded that instead of conventional hormonal therapy， aggressive treatment and close follow-up are necessary. Kwon et al.\\[11\\] reported a patient that started traditional androgen blockade and， nine months later， he was**\n\n【34】**diagnosed with hormone refractory prostate cancer. The patient died after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. Wang et al.\\[7\\]， in their review of 93patients with PSCADCP， concluded that local disease， younger age and being married were predictors of radical prostatectomy. Younger age was a predictor of aggressive local therapy and was the strongest predictor for radical prostatectomy rather than external beam radiotherapy.Our patient was young and refused blood transfusions， so radiotherapy was a poor option due to its long-term sequela， for example， radiation induced cystitis**\n\n【35】**Conclusion**\n\n【36】**PSCADCP occurs in 2.5% of cases of prostate carcinoma and requires careful histological diagnosis. It has a poor prognosis that is correlated with the diagnosis at a very advanced stage. The diagnosis in an early phase， as in our case， is very rare. Although it is difficult to define an optimum treatment strategy， early diagnosis， aggressive treatment， and close follow-up might improve prognosis.**\n\n【37】**References**\n\n【38】1\\.

Genetic aberrations of the tumor suppressor gene VHL cause it. Based on the reports in VHL， the most common initial presentation tumors are hemangioblastoma in the CNS and retina. In addition， patients can be present with signs and symptoms of other visceral organ involvement， such as the CNS，adrenal gland， the kidney， pancreas tumor and others.**\n\n【12】**Here we report a 34 years old woman presented with signs and symptoms of ICSOL secon dary to hemangioblastoma， confirmed after the patient’s surgery. After years of the smooth postoperative period， she developed a carcinoid tumor at the head of the pancreas and left supra renal mass， for which she was operated and improved. Subsequent follow up detected recurrence and proper Whipple surgery was done and confirmed the diagnosis of VHL.**\n\n【13】**From this case report easily can observe， regular and proper follow up lead early recognition and on-time appropriate treatment remain the mainstay of management in this group of patients.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease； Hemangioblastoma； Multiorgan involvement**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Von Hippel-Lindau(VHL)syndrome is an autosomal dominant，multi-organ， familial neoplastic syndrome caused by genetic aberrations of the tumor suppressor gene VHL located on chromosome\\[1-3\\]. The prevalence of VHL is estimated to be between 1： 35，000 to 1： 40，000. The mutation of the VHL gene leads to develop benign and malignant tumors of several visceral organs like the central nervous system， kidneys， pancreas， adrenal， and reproductive organs. The most common VHL associated tumors are hemangioblastomas involving the brain， spinal cord， and retina； clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)； pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas of the adrenal gland and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. The current case report is a young woman with VHL disease involving hemangioblastoma of the posterior fossa followed by visceral multi-organ involvement.**\n\n【17】**Here I am presenting a 34-year-old woman， a mother of two presented with a history of progressive global headache followed by nausea and vomiting of months duration. The intensity of the headache has increased， and it started to have an imbalance， followed by blurring of vision on and off， vertigo and ataxia of one week duration. She gave a history of long-standing dyspepsia and abdominal discomfort. After having an MRI of the brain， hemangioblastoma in the posterior fossa of the brain was diagnosed， and surgery was performed (Figure 1) \\[4\\].**\n\n【18】**After eleven months of a smooth postoperative period， she started to experience dyspepsia， abdominal discomfort on the right side， anorexia， and weight loss. After investigation， a CT scan of the abdomen revealed a pancreatic head and suprarenal mass with multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies with the impression of a carcinoid tumor and poorly controlled hypertension. She has been referred abroad (India)， where the Whipple procedure was done. Histopathology confirmed pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm PT2N1； all margins are negative one out of 12LN+ve. She had regular follow-ups for almost two years， her blood pressure was well controlled， and after a while， she started to have anorexia， abdominal discomfort， itching sensation all over the body，and right-side abdominal swelling. On physical examination，poorly controlled hypertension(160/112mmHg) and right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness were observed. Whole body PET-CT images were obtained with few somewhat defined enhancing lesions in the right suprarenal-retrocaval region showing mild tracer uptake； a tiny sub-centimetric enhancing lesion involving**\n\n| **Table 1： VHL subtypes.**  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Type**  | **Clinical findings**  | **Mutations**  |\n| **Type 1 (decreased risk for PCC)**  | **Retinal and CNS HB， RCC， pancreatic cysts， and neuroendocrine tumors**  | **Truncating or missense mutations**  |\n| **Type 2 (increased risk for PCC)**  |  |  |\n| **Type 2A (low risk for RCC)**  | **PCC， retinal HB， CNS HB**  | **Missense mutation**  |\n| **Type 2B (high risk for RCC)**  | **PCC， RCC， Retinal HB， CNS HB， pancreatic cyst， and neuroendocrine tumors**  |  |\n| **Type 2C**  | **PCC only**  |  |\n\n【20】**Figure 1： MRI of the brain.**\n\n【21】**the medial limb of the left adrenal gland- the possibility of multiple pheochromocytomas is considered.

These are benign tumors. Some hemangioblastomas remain unchanged in size over several years，and if they do not cause symptoms， their surgical removal may not be necessary. The symptoms of hemangioblastoma are usually caused**\n\n【26】**by the expansion of tumors in the intracranial space and spinal cord. Asymptomatic small tumors are carefully watched until the onset of symptoms. Surgical resection is the best treatment modality for this tumor； in cases of enormous tumor burden where surgical resection is not possible， gamma knife surgery can substitute the treatment modality. The most common sites for hemangioblastoma development are the cerebellum and spinal cord， as evident in our patient. Our patient presented with signs and symptoms of Cerebellar Hemangioblastoma (CHb) and was operated on time. Pathological confirmation was done， and routine investigationslike organ function tests， abdomen ultrasound， and chest X-ray showed no abnormality. Unusual sites of hemangioblastomas in VHL include the anterior lobe of the pituitary， pituitary stalk， hypothalamus， optic nerve， corpus callosum， wall of the third ventricle， the temporal horn of the lateral ventricles， frontal and temporal lobe， meninges \\[5\\].**\n\n【27】**In VHL， Renal cysts are much more common than Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)， with an incidence of 60% and 24% to 45%subsequently.Renalinvolvement in VHL is multi-centric and bilateral in at least 75% of patient's microscopic solid tumors identified within the renal parenchyma of patients with VHL， which progress into giant macroscopic tumors. The renal tumor observed， on average， grow at the rate of 1.6 cm/year， which is somewhat faster than those in sporadic renal cell carcinoma \\[6\\].**\n\n【28】**In the VHL pancreas， different types of lesions like cysts， serious micro-cystic adenomas， and even malignant pancreatic lesions(adenocarcinoma) can be involved. The pancreatic cyst is the most common among the above lesions. Adrenal gland involvement in VHL having pheochromocytomas occurs only 7% to 18%. There are multiple case reports and involvement of different organs with VHL lesions like malignant lesions on the thyroid (Medullary and papillary type)， liver and pulmonary hemangioblastoma， ovarian and omental cysts， hemangioma of skin， and skeletal muscles \\[7\\].**\n\n【29】**Patients can have variable presentations depending on the primary site； the diagnosis is often confirmed by positive family history and the presence of one VHL-associated tumor. In cases with no known history of VHL， multiple tumors are needed for diagnosis since approximately 20% of cases result from de novo mutations. Specific genotype-phenotype correlations in affected families led to the classification of VHL subtypes into types 1 and 2 (Table 1)， primarily based on the presence of a pheochromocytoma. Type 1disease has a shallow risk of pheochromocytomas. Type 2 VHL is further categorized into type 2a (low risk of RCC)， type 2b (high risk ofRCC)， and type 2c， which only presents with pheochromocytomas\\[8，9\\].**\n\n【30】**Based on the above classification， our patient belongs to type 1because she had CNS HB，pancreatic cystic mass， and neuroendocrine tumor. The sex and genotype of the patient influence survival. Female patients have a significantly higher risk of VHL-related death than**\n\n【31】**male patients (HR=2.25，95% CI 1.20 to 4.20，p=0.011).Overall，79%(53 of 67) of deaths were VHL-related， but the risk of VHL-related death has decreased over time， as has the frequency of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) -related death. Surveillance is especially beneficial for truncating mutation carriers with the greatest RCC and Central Nervous System (CNS) hemangioblastoma risk \\[10\\].**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**The current study reinforces the importance of regular follow-ups with proper evaluation by appropriate diagnostic modalities. As we observed from our patient， these tumors often have multiple periods of tumors growth separated by periods of arrested growth， and different kinds of literature informed us the possibility of many untreated tumors might remain static for several years， yet follow-up of VHL patients must not be discontinued after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Advisable to make maximum effort to analyze the chromosomal mutation of the patient， which will help and lead us to offer the option ofpre-symptomatic gene testing and early treatment. The advantage of regular follow-ups and checkups lead to early detection， which emphasizes better treatment outcomes.**\n\n【34】**1\\.

Malignant transformation of a teratoma (TMT) is defined as a non-germ cell malignant tumor arising in a preexisting mature teratoma， and it is a rare occurrence.

This report describes a case of a 41 year old female presenting with metastatic adenocarcinoma to the hip as the initial clinical manifestation of malignant transformation of a mediastinal teratoma， along with a review of relevant literature.**\n\n【10】**Introduction**\n\n【11】**Teratomas are germ cell tumors composed of cells recapitulating the three germ cell layers. They are most common in the gonads； however they can occur any where along the midline axis due to migration of germ cells during embryogenesis. Teratomas are the most common germ cell tumor of the mediastinum \\[1\\]. Malignant transformation of a teratoma (TMT) is defined as a non-germ cell malignant tumor arising in a preexisting mature teratoma， and it is a rare occurrence. The non-germ cell component can be a carcinoma or sarcoma. This is to be differentiated from malignant teratoma， which includes TMT， as well as teratoma with a malignant germ cell component， and a combination of germ cell and non-germ cell components \\[2\\].**\n\n【12】**Metastases associated with malignant transformation are even more infrequent， mostly having been reported arising from gonadal teratomas. This report describes a case of metastatic adenocarcinoma to the hip as the presenting manifestation of malignant transformation of a mediastinal teratoma.**\n\n【13】**Case Presentation**\n\n【14】**A 41-year old female presented with several months of right hip pain following a fall. There was no improvement with medications and physical therapy， and so the patient was evaluated by orthopedics. She was found to have an expansile lesion in the right femur， with impending fracture， as well as multiple other areas suspicious for metastatic disease. She under went an orthopedic pinning procedure， and a biopsy taken at the time of surgery demonstrated a metastatic adenocarcinoma of nonspecific phenotype (Figure 1). Immunohistochemical stains revealed the tumor to highlight with chromogen against pankeratin， polyclonal CEA， and CK 20. The neoplastic cells werenegative for CK7， as well as TTF-1， CDX2， GCDFP，ER， PR， CA19.9， CA125， and p63. These results were considered non-specific with respect to a possible primary site.**\n\n【15】**Subsequent imaging demonstrated an anterior mediastinal mass. The resection of the mass was a 4.5x2.5x2 cm unilocular cyst containing hair and sebaceous material. The cyst wall ranged in thickness from 0.1 to 1.0 cm， and areas of the lesion were completely solid， consisting of tan-white soft tissue. Microscopic examination revealed the presence of bone， smooth muscle，hair，respiratory epithelium， and intestinal epithelium， consistent with a teratoma. Within the intestinal epithelium， there were dysplastic changes， which ranged from low grade， as in a tubular adenoma， to high grade， with loss of nuclear polarity and increased nuclear pleomorphism. This latter area was associated with invasive glands present in the wall of the tumor， consistent with invasive adenocarcinoma(Figure 2). The majority of the adenocarcinoma was poorly differentiated， growing in cords， sheets， and single cell pattern. Immunohistochemical stains on the mediastinal mass revealed the tumor was positive for CK20 and CDX2 and negative for CK7 and TTF-1. Given the presence of an in situ component to the tumor， as well as the immunohistochemical staining pattern， the tumor was diagnosed as an invasive adenocarcinoma of intestinal type， arising in a mature teratoma.**\n\n【16】**Figure 1： Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in right femur curettings.**\n\n【17】**The patient received chemotherapy and radiation for her metastatic disease. The last report available had her doing well at a 2month post-operatively. The patient was subsequently lost to follow-up.**\n\n【18】**Discussion**\n\n【19】**TMT is a rare occurrence； present in 1-2% of ovarian mature teratomas \\[3\\]. The incidence in mediastinal teratomas has not been widely studied， however one large study of 322 cases of primary mediastinal germ cell tumors found it to occur in 4% of teratomatous lesions in this site \\[2\\]. The majority of cases ofTMT have been reported in men \\[4，5\\]. A study of 17 male patients found that TMT localized to the testis had a better prognosis than those with disease outside the testis， including the mediastinum \\[5\\]. Several studies have found that the most common malignant non-germ cell differentiation in men with TMT was sarcomatous， followed by carcinomatous； the usual types of sarcoma included rhabdomyosarcoma， undifferentiated sarcoma， primitive neuroectodermal tumor， chondrosarcoma， and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor \\[5-8\\]. In contrast， the majority of females with ovarian TMT show an epithelial malignancy， with squamous cell carcinoma being the most common diagnosis \\[3\\].**\n\n【20】**Four cases of metastatic disease arising from a mediastinal TMT have been reported previously. As opposed to the current case， the metastasis in these cases were found after the primary tumor had been diagnosed or in conjunction with the primary tumor. The metastatic tumor in these cases was sarcoma in two cases and adenocarcinoma in the other half \\[9-12\\]. One paper describes that half of the patients with malignant teratomas have metastasis outside of the mediastinum， however it does not distinguish between the different types of malignant teratoma， and so the true incidence of metastatic disease in mediastinal TMT is still not known \\[13，14\\].**\n\n【21】**To the best of our knowledge， this is the first reported case of a metastasis as the presenting manifestation of a TMT arising in the mediastinum. In addition， this case is in a female， which is not widely reported in the literature. This case illustrates the need to keep a wide differential when faced with a metastatic carcinoma with an unknown primary. Had the metastatic carcinoma showed the same immunohistochemical profile as the primary tumor (CK 20 and CDX2 positive， CK7 negative)， the likely interpretation would have been that of a gastrointestinal， probably colonic，primary malignancy.**\n\n【22】**Figure 2： Mediastinal mass with mesenchymal tissue， adenomatous tissue， and infiltrative carcinoma.**\n\n【23】**This could have led down the wrong diagnostic pathway， and demonstrates a possible pitfall of depending on immunohistochemical stains to determine the primary site of a metastatic carcinoma. It is well known that the decalcification process can lead to false results with immunohistochemical staining. We submit the proposal that after the diagnosis of metastatic tumor， especially adenocarcinoma， is made， a thorough work-up， by imaging and blood work， may be the best way to discover the primary site. While immunohistochemical stains can be instrumental in narrowing down the possible primary sites of a metastatic tumor， care should be taken to not exclude other possibilities based on their results.**\n\n【24】**References**\n\n【25】**1\\.

After cauterization， she developed symptomatic acute hypocalcaemia with hypoparathyroidism. This resolved with calcium and vitamin D supplementation and she did not require any long-term vitamin D or calcium. This case is interesting because while hypoparathyroidism is a commoI1complication of parathyroidectomy or other neck surgery， it is not typically associated with tonsillectomy. Moreover， rat's post-parathyroidectomy has been demonstrated to have survival benefit after implantation of differentiated human mesenchymal stem cells obtained from the tonsils \\[1-3\\]， so this report may support a common origin of tonsil and parathyroid mesenchyme.**\n\n【13】**Background**\n\n【14】**Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are among the most commonly performed surgeries， with400，000 tonsillectomies being performed annually in the European Union \\[4\\]. While the procedure is more common in the Pediatric age group， it is also quite common in the adult population for problems such as recurrent acute pharyngitis and chronic tonsillitis， suspicion of malignant disease， and refractory halitosis. There are many well-known adverse outcomes of tonsillectomy. However， hypocalcaemia and hypoparathyroidism are not well described.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 28-year-old female presented to emergency department with a chief complaint of bleeding coming from her pharynx eight days after having an uncomplicated tonsillectomy. Herhemoglobin level was 84 g/L， likely indicating significant blood loss (there was no preoperative hemoglobin for comparison， as the patient was healthy and did not receive a preoperative or postoperative blood count). The patient was not coughing or vomiting any blood， was not bleeding anywhere else， and did not have any fever. The patient was taken to operating room， where a pumping vessel was visualized between the right-sided oropharyngeal muscles and subsequently cauterized with suction. Several sutures of 3-0 vicryland 3-0 chromic were placed in a figure-of-eight. Besides minor blood lost during the procedure， 200 mL of swallowed blood was aspirated from the stomach via nasogastric suction.**\n\n【17】**Two hours postoperatively， the patient complained of new-onset tingling in her fingers. She did not have any other symptoms of hypocalcaemia such as perioral tingling or numbness. Her serum calcium level returned at 6.9 mg/dL (reference 8.5 to 10.5 mg/dL). The patient received one gram of calcium gluconate intravenously which resolved her symptoms. Twelve hours post-operatively， more complete labs were drawn which showed a serum calcium level of 8.3 mg/dL， phosphate2.6 mg/dL (reference 2.5 to 4.5)， magnesium 1.5 mEq/L (reference 1.3 to 2.1)， total 25-hydroxy vitamin D 12.2 ng/mL (reference 25.0 to 80.0)， parathyroid hormone level 9.5 pg/mL (reference 14to 55.7 pg/mL)， thyroid stimulating hormone 0.25 IU/mL (normal 0.35 to 4.01)， free T3 2.6 pg/mL(reference 2.8 to 4.4)， and free T4- 0.83 ng/mL (reference 0.61 to 1.37). The patient had not been transfused any blood at any time (as her hemoglobin was always above 85 g/L)， nor did she receive any intravenous fluids other than Ringer's lactate， which at our hospital， contains 200 mg (2.7mEq) of calcium chloride per liter and would be expected to forestall any hypocalcaemia.**\n\n【18】**Outcome and Follow-Up**\n\n【19】**The patient was discharged two days afterwards and did well without any further symptoms. At**\n\n【20】**the time of discharge， total serum calcium level was 8.11 mg/dL. One month after discharge， her serum ionized calcium level was checked in lieu of the total calcium， and it returned 1.13 mMol/L (normal 1.1to 1.3). TSH was normal 1.17 uIU/mL， and hemoglobin level was marginally low at 11.9 g/dL.**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**Include a very brief review of similar published cases：**\n\n【23】**Although about 1.5% ofadults are reported to have bleeding after tonsillectomy and 20% of adults have some other complication such as pain， postoperative nausea and vomiting， delay to oral intake， or airway obstruction \\[5\\]， to the best of our knowledge， hypocalcaemia following tonsillectomy is not typical. It is quite common for physiological stress to cause thyroid hormone abnormalities， but this hasn’t been as recognized with parathyroid hormone levels. We suspect that the bleeding and cauterization in the proximity of the parathyroid glands may have interfered with parathyroid function and resulted in hypocalcaemia.**\n\n【24】**Studies sshowed that rats _P_ post-parathyroidectomy have demonstrated survival benefit after implantation of differentiated human tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells \\[1-3\\]. So，putting these two things together， tonsil and parathyroid mesenchyme may have related origins**\n\n【25】**Learning Points**\n\n【26】**Hypocalcaemia occurs oftentimes after neck surgery and can have many etiologies， such as blood transfusions (blood**\n\n【27】**anticoagulants such as citrate may chelate calcium)， volume repletion with intravenous fluids which do not contain calcium (such as sodium chloride)， and sepsis.**\n\n【28】**The most common cause of chronic hypoparathyroidism is an injury to the parathyroid glands， such as head and neck surgery.**\n\n【29】**This case is unusual because tonsillectomies are not typically associated with acute hypocalcaemia or hypoparathyroidism.**\n\n【30】**References**\n\n【31】1\\.

Considering the complications of this rare disease， it is essential to pay more attention to sleep disorders， especially sleep-related breathing disorders， in these patients.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Asternia； Sleep disorder； Obstructive sleep apnea；Iran**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Asternia or complete sternal cleft is a very unusual chest wall deformity caused by a sternal fusion deficiency during embryonic development. This anomaly can cause serious consequences and，like other congenital anomalies， can be linked to other birth disorders \\[1\\].**\n\n【19】**Asternia carries several risks， including mediastinal injury， hypothermia， and insensible fluid losses. Also， respiratory and dynamic complications may occur. Paradoxical breathing pattern can lead to cyanosis and recurrent chest infections due to impaired gas exchange and inadequate secretion clearance. In addition， changes due to intrathoracic pressure can decrease venous return2.**\n\n【20】**Another sternal cleft abnormality includes Pentalogy of Cantrell (POC)， which involves abnormalities of the sternum， pericardium， heart， diaphragm， and abdominal wall. Seemingly unrelated processes such as PHACE (posterior fossa anomalies， hemangioma， arterial anomalies， cardiac anomalies， and eye anomalies) syndrome can also be present \\[3\\].**\n\n【21】**The optimal time to conduct sternal cleft repair is during infancy， when the chest wall is extremely malleable and can therefore be initially closed without considerable cardiac constraint. As the patient ages and the chest wall stiffens， closure might become progressively more challenging as venous return and lung flexibility are reduced \\[4\\].**\n\n【22】**Given that respiratory disorders induced by defects in the chest wall muscles during sleep are likely to worsen and no study has been conducted on sleep disorders in patients with sternal defects， this study aimed to evaluate sleep parameters in patients suffering from this rare disease.**\n\n【23】**Case Presentation**\n\n【24】**The patient was a 20-year-old female with a history of congenital sternum cleft and repair in childhood. The patient referred to a pulmonologist and complained of daytime shortness ofbreath. The patient was referred to the Sleep Clinic of Rasoul Akram Hospital in Tehran， Iran to be assessed for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). All necessary tests were performed and paraclinical parameters， including spirometry were normal.**\n\n【25】**According to the patient’s records， she complained of fatigue， excessive daytime sleepiness，and morning headaches. The patient did not report snoring or breathing problems during sleep and complained of frequent inability to sustain sleep， which raised the possibility of OSA. The patient got into bed at 12 AM， fell asleep in about half an hour， and woke up at 10 AM in the morning.

Also， there was no history of using medications， smoking cigarettes， using drugs， or a family history of sleep or psychiatric disorders.**\n\n【28】**The patient’s blood pressure was normal (80/110)， Body Mass Index (BMI) was 18 kg/m， neck circumference was 34 cm， the distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin was 9 cm， and Mallampati score was 2.**\n\n【29】**Herscores in the Restless Legs Syndrome Screening Questionnaire， STOP-BANG Questionnaire， Insomnia Intensity Index， Epworth Sleepiness Score， and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were zero， one， nine， four， and three， respectively (Table 1).**\n\n【30】**In polysomnography， various sleep parameters were assessed. _：_ The sleep parameters， including total sleep time， sleep latency， REM latency (the time between the onset of sleep and the first stage of REM sleep)， and Periodic Leg Movement index (PLMS； average frequent movements of the lower limbs in one hour of sleep) were normal. Heart rate was also normal and no snoring was reported. The number of sleep cycles， including both the REM and non-REM sleep， was also normal for the age of the patient. However， sleep efficacy (the ratio of a person's total sleep time to bed time) decreased slightly. AHI (the average of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep) was equal to seven， which is classified as mild OSA syndrome.**\n\n【31】**Discussion**\n\n【32】**The present study examined sleep parameters in a patient with asternia， which is an extremely rare condition that can develop alone or in conjunction with other malformations of abdominal wall， diaphragm， pericardium， or heart. The baby will have the highest chance of survival if diagnosed and treated early \\[5\\]. The prevalence of asternia has been reported as one per 100，000 live births \\[6\\].**\n\n【33】**In fetal life， the sternum develops from the mesoderm's outer surface. In the tenth week， the cells from the two mesoderm bands on either side of the anterior chest wall migrate to the midline and fuse together to form the sternum. Primordia between the ventral ends of the growing clavicle produce the manubrium. The sternum columns fuse in a cephalocaudal manner. The sternal columns do not always unite in the middle， resulting in a complete sternal cleft \\[7\\]. The etiology of the sternal cleft is unknown.**\n\n【34】**External clefts can be classified into three main groups： (A) sternal cleft without associated abnormalities； (B) thoracic or true ectopia cordis with varying degrees of sternal cleft where the heart is outside the thoracic wall； and (C) thoracoabdominal ectopia cordis， also known as POC \\[8\\].**\n\n【35】**In her childhood， the patient under study had her congenital sternal cleft corrected by posterior sternal wall plus chondral grafts plus total correction surgery.**\n\n【36】**During infancy and youth， the chest wal and upper airway alter to accommodate the growing organism's physiological needs. Compression is possible in the newborn's chest wall， which aids in the removal of pulmonary fluid. The adaptation rate of the chest wall in infants is three times that of the lung \\[9\\]. This causes paradoxical movement ofthe chest inward， especially during Rapid Eye Movement(REM) sleep， which is associated with increased respiratory activity and decreased intercostal muscle activity during inhalation. The sternum and vertebrae ossify in the womb and continue until the age of 25， resulting in chest wall rigidity.**\n\n【37】**In our patient， the look of the chest was unaffected and there were no paradoxical chest motions. Children with upper airway obstruction sleep with more inconsistency compared to adults. Normal adolescents do not experience paradoxical internal chest movement during inhaling. The form of chest might also change during childhood. The ribs are placed horizontally in babies， resulting in a circular chest with limited expansion potential. As a result， at one month of age， the share of chest breathing current in non-REM sleep is just one-third of that in adults \\[10\\].**\n\n【38】**Tomohisa Nagasao et al. concluded that when the full length of the sternum is missing， chest breathing is substantiallyhampered，and that correction of the defect is required to treat the disorder. However， since the upper half of the sternum is more crucial for respiration， the upper part should be prioritized in reconstruction \\[11\\].**\n\n【39】**There are some limited studies on the respiratory disorders associated with sternal cleft. However， no studies have been carried out on sleep disorders in patients with asternia so far. Although some respiratory illnesses， such as sleep apnea， exclusively occur during sleep， practically all respiratory disorders， including upper airway obstruction， central hyperventilation， and chronic lung disease， get worse during sleep than wakefulness. Thus， the impact of sleep on breathing is a crucial concern because when we are awake， we breathe more deeply than sleeping； also， ventilation is reduced during sleep\\[12\\].**\n\n【40】**Respiratory drive is reduced and breathing becomes irregular， especially during the REM sleep. The respiratory rate and current volume are variable and are associated with recurrent central apnea. REM sleep is also associated with decreased intercostal and upper airway muscle tone. Therefore， breathing is impaired during sleep compared to wakefulness， and REM is more impaired during sleep. This is especially important in children， as they sleep more than adults and have relatively more REM sleep.**\n\n【41】**The patient under study was diagnosed as having normal sleep parameters， except for sleep efficacy and Apnea-Hypopnea Index(AHI). The patient’s AHI was indicative of mild OSA \\[13\\].**\n\n【42】**OSA is the most common sleep disorder characterized by recurrent collapse of the soft tissue in the rear of the throat during sleep. According to the latest research， its prevalence is 17% in women and 35% in men \\[14\\]. These intermittent collapses reduce airflow， which lead to two consequences： Arousal in sleep to resume airflow， and gas exchange disorders caused by hypopnea (decreased breathing) or apnea (stopped breathing) \\[15\\]. Frequent arousals in OSA lead to neurological cognitive consequences， such as decreased memory， daytime drowsiness， and decreased quality of life. However， the mechanisms contributing to these adverse outcomes are complex and not yet fully understood.**\n\n【43】**Also， Mallampati score was equal to 2 in our patient. This has been identified as an independent risk factor for OSA in previous studies， so that for each degree of increase in Mallampati score， the chance of OSA doubles \\[171； this should be considered in the analysis of results.**\n\n【44】**Conclusion**\n\n【45】**This case report evaluated the parameters and sleep disorders in a patient with asternia. Considering the complications of this rare disease， it is essential to pay more attention to sleep disorders， especially sleep-related breathing disorders， in these patients. Further studies are needed to investigate the chest anatomy defects causing OSA syndrome in patients with congenital sternum cleft.**\n\n【46】**References**\n\n【47】1\\.

It usually develops in the retroperitoneum and lower limbs. Although this tumour usually metastasizes to various sites such as the lungs， chest wall and retroperitoneal space， cardiac metastasis especially to the pericardium is extremely rare. This may prove to be a diagnostic and treatment challenge with regards to other types of lesions in the pericardium. An accurate diagnosis， identifying the location， tissue composition and nature of the mass is vital in deciding on early surgical treatment. We report a case of metastatic pericardialliposarcoma that presented with cardiac tamponade after 25 years of the initial liposarcoma in the popliteal fossa.**\n\n【10】**Case Presentation**\n\n【11】**A 55-year-old gentleman with underlying hypertension and dyslipidaemia presented to us in December 2015 with increasing shortness of breath for the past 2 weeks. He has a history of left knee liposarcoma at the popliteal fossa and underwent complete surgical excision in 1990， with no evidence of recurrence since then. Chest radiography (Figure 1) revealed an enlarged cardiac shadow with some widening of the mediastinum and atelectasis of the right lung in the mid zone. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm and the cardiac enzyme markers were within normal limits. An echocardiogram was also performed and showed global pericardial effusion with features of pericardial tamponade. There was also a mass noted lateral to the left ventricle. Urgent pericardiocentesis was done and 1.3 litres of haemorrhagic fluid was drained.**\n\n【12】**A CT thorax with contrast (Figure 2) done a week later revealed left posterior pericardial mass measuring 4.6 cm x 4.7 cm x 5.0 cm with minimal right pericardial effusion and scattered non-specific lung nodules in both the lung fields (<5 mm). An initial diagnosis of pericardial cyst was made and patient was kept under surveillance. Hence a repeat surveillance CT thorax (Figure 3) was performed 6 months later and showed the mass had enlarged in size to 6.9 cm x5.0 cm x5.7 cm with resolved pericardial effusion and stable non-specific lung nodules. He subsequently underwent a left Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) biopsy of the mass which turned out to be a myxoid liposarcoma of intermediate grade. The mass was found to be densely adhered to the pericardium.**\n\n【13】**He then underwent a cardiac MRI (Figure 4) which showed a soft tissue mass arising from**\n\n【14】**Figure 1： Chest Radiograph on initial presentation.**\n\n【15】**Figure 2： CT Thorax in Dec 2015 showing the left posterior pericardial mass with minimal right pericardial effusion.**\n\n【16】**Figure 3： Repeated CT Thorax in Jul 2016 showing an enlarged mass with resolved pericardial effusion.**\n\n【17】**Figure 4： Cardiac MRI demonstrating adherence of the mass to the descending aorta and oesophagus.**\n\n【18】**the pericardium adjacent to the left ventricle with involvement of the descending thoracic aorta， thoracic oesophagus and left hemidiaphragm. As the lesion was invading surrounding structures he was then subjected to 25 cycles of neoadjuvant radiotherapy in November 2016 and a repeat CT scan (Figure 5) a month later showed significant reduction in tumour size to 2.1 cm x5.6 cmx4.5cm with a clear fat plane between the mass and adiacent structures plus no evidence of distant metastasis. The non-specific small lung nodules (<5 mm) remain unchanged. In view of this， we planned for a curative resection of his tumour. To further clarify the nature of the lung nodules， we carried out a PET-CT scan which confirmed no FDG-avid lesions elsewhere.**\n\n【19】**In January 20177 patient underwentLca leftposterolateral thoracotomywith en bloc resection ofthe left pericardial mass (Figure**\n\n【20】**Figure 5： CT Thorax after completion of neoadjuvant radiotherapy showing a reduction in tumour size.**\n\n【21】**Figure 6： Left pericardial mass which has been resected en bloc.**\n\n【22】**Figure 7： Prolene mesh covering the pericardial defect.**\n\n【23】**6) and implantation of a prolene mesh over the pericardial defect with plication of the left hemi-diaphragm (Figure 7). The tumour which had a solid and cystic component was densely adhered to the lateral epicardial surface of the heart. A portion of the epicardium of the lateral wall of the heart was taken together as en bloc resection with the mass. An on table frozen section of the epicardial surface adjacent to the tumour showed no evidence of malignancy with just hypertrophied myocytes (Figure 8). Enlarged lymph node samples taken from stations 6， 9， and 10 also showed no evidence of malignancy. The histopathology result of the tumour itself confirmed a myxoid liposarcoma. The patient recovered well from his surgery and was discharged home within a week. He has remained well since. He is currently on a 6-monthly follow up under the Oncologist and his latest repeat CT thorax (Figure 9) in June 2018 which showed no evidence of tumour recurrence.**\n\n【24】**Figure 8： Tumour has been successfully resected away from the lateral surface of the heart.**\n\n【25】**LL： Left Lung； Ao： Aorta； LV： Left Ventricle Exposed； D： Diaphragm**\n\n【26】**Discussion**\n\n**Liposarcoma has been classified by WHO into four distinct histological subtypes as follows： well-differentiated， myxoid/round cell，pleomorphic and dedifferentiated \\[1\\]. They have a propensity for local recurrence in about 40% of the cases， but very rarely metastasise\\[1\\]. Despite metastatic lesions ofextracardiacliposarcoma being more common than the development ofprimary cardiac liposarcoma itself， the incidence of metastasis to the pericardium remains extremely low， with only ten cases that have been reported in the literature up to the year 2015 \\[2-31. The time interval between the initial presentation of liposarcoma and the cardiac metastasis can be quite long， ranging from 7 to 25 years 3|.**\n\n【28】**The initial presentation of cardiac metastasis of liposarcom depends on the part of the heart involved and the size of the tumour. Mostly they remain undiagnosed until patients develop symptoms mainly due to compressive effects on the heart chambers which could manifest as congestive heart failure， arrhythmia，pericarditis，angina， syncope and sudden cardiac death \\[3-5\\]. Pericardial invasion may also lead to effusions of various sizes that can result in tamponade and diastolic cardiac impairment， as what we experienced with our patient \\[2，6\\]. This could turn out to be a critical and life-threatening situation if not addressed in a timely manner.**\n\n【29】**The first-line treatment for primary liposarcoma is surgical excision with complete resection of the tumour whenever possible\\[1-2\\]. Local recurrence or distant metastasis can occur many years after treatment of the primary tumour， hence the past history of**\n\n【30】**liposarcoma is important here \\[2，4\\]. Although there is no standard treatment for cardiac or pericardial metastases， radical surgical resection of the metastatic tumour provides the highest chance of long-lasting survival \\[2，4，6\\]. When combined with neoadjuvant radiotherapy， this may significantly reduce the rate of disease progression and recurrence \\[2，5，6\\]. Chemotherapy has been shown to be effective in a fraction of cases of metastatic or unresectable soft tissue sarcoma，however the overall response rate was only 46% and it is still lacking in evidence \\[1，4，5\\].**\n\n【31】**In our patient，transthoracic echocardiography initially identified the mass， which was further delineated by CT thorax. However the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) demonstrated that the mass had invaded the surrounding structures， which was in keeping with the feature of a malignant tumour. This was significant in presurgical planning as it enabled the patient to have neoadjuvant radiotherapy. MRI is a well established imaging modality in assessing any suspected cardiac lesions， plus it can be useful for tissue characterization and differentiation between benign and malignant tumours \\[7，8\\]. The integration of all the information provided by various imaging methods enabled us to provide the most appropriate treatment for this patient.**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**Metastatic pericardial liposarcoma can prove to be a diagnostic challenge and multimodal imaging is highly recommended for optimal preoperative assessment to evaluate the differential diagnosis and deciding on appropriate treatment. Aggressive surgical resection with the intention of resolving any cardiac impairment is thetreatment of choice and combination with perioperative radiotherapy may help to prolong survival and avoid recurrence. However， continued surveillance and long-term follow-up with serial imaging is required for all cases of cardiac liposarcomas.**\n\n【34】**References**\n\n【35】**1\\. Steger CM.

We managed a pediatric case that combined two complications at one time.

To the best of our knowledge，this is the fourth case published.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Echinococeus granulosus； Liver hydatid；Spontaneous cutaneous fistulization； Pleural cavity**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Hydatid liver disease is the most frequently infestation caused by genus Echinococcus granulosus\\[1\\]. Complications like cyst rupture and infection may occur， sites of rupture including： bile ducts， gastrointestinal tract， bronchic， peritoneal and pleural cavity \\[2\\]. Rupture into the subcutaneous tissue followed by external fistula and the involvement in pleural cavity is an extremely rare presentation \\[3\\]. We reported a pediatric case who presented this combination. The aim of this study is to consider the parietal complications of the hydatid cyst of the liver associated to pleural one.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 14 years old girl presented a painful lumbar masse with a discharge of fluid pus. Clinical checkup found a high fever 39.5， cutaneous mucosa pallor and lumbar masse redness； swelling in or around (Figure 1).**\n\n【17】**Ultrasound examination showed hydatid cyst in segment IIV； IV of liver forming a fistula opening at the pleural cavity and following into a cyst in the lumbar side. CT scan has gift a cartography illustration of the fistula and of the hydatid cyst confirming the diagnosis of infected of the liver hydatid associated with its fistulization in lumbar side also in pleural cavity (Figure 2).**\n\n【18】**An under costallaparotomy was done under general anesthesia. After opening the abdomen one large cyst was founded in the right liver lobe. This one was forming a cutaneous fistula at the lumbar side and in the pleural cavity. After sterilization of the entire cavity with hypertonic saline. Liver hydatid was aspirated. The cyst was opened with a small incision and a suction tip was introduced to evacuate the remaining fluid. Proligerous membrane was easily removed after widening the incision and visible biliary opening were sutured (Figure 3). Resection of rounded roof projection**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： Lumbar abscess already drained.**\n\n【20】**Figure 2： Scannagraphic picture of the liver hydatid with parietal fistula.**\n\n【21】Figure 3： Proligerous membrane.\n\n【22】**and excision of the fistula tract a drain was inserted in the peritoneum near the residual cavity in the liver. Postoperatively， the patient was given antibiotics for 10 days the laparotomy and the lumbar fistula site healed well after surgery. Follow up checkup control did not reveal recurrence of the disease.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**Hydatidosis， a zoonotic infection is due to the larval stage of tapeworm Echinococcus this infection is acquired through infestation of parasite egg released in feces of the definite host bearing the adult worm in it gut \\[3\\]. The disease can be developed anywhere in the human body it also has a worldwide distribution due to increasing migration and growing global travel \\[4\\]. In Morocco it’s an endemic disease.**\n\n【25】**The most frequently involved organ is the liver (52% to 77%). Its can because complication in about 40% cases the common complications are infection or rupture into the biliary tree. Whereas rupture in pleural cavity and the spontaneous cutaneous fistulization are exceptionally rare one by one \\[5\\]， the association of both is more rare. Thoracic complications of hepatic hydatid cyst result from the proximity of hydatid cyst in the liver and the diaphragm. Spontaneous cutaneous fistulization of hydatid liver is one of the exceptional presentations \\[6\\]. It’s different than the direct rupture in the abdominal tissue which results without creation of a fibrosis tract \\[3\\]. This complication interest almost of hydatid liver. Usually right hepatic lobes invade the right lateral abdominal wall \\[7\\] same as \\[4\\]. They are especially with exoliver development. Although the cyst from left lobe invade the anterior abdominal wall \\[5，7\\]. This cyst are commonly old， the pericyst has been inflammatory reshuffle and calcifications. Such as our reported cases， many characters explain the factors of fistulization： Mechanic and inflammatory ones. Mechanic reasons are the continued expansion of the cyst causing pressure erosion and adhesion to the adjacent structure \\[81. In the same time inflammatory factors exist with increasing intracystic pressure， the**\n\n【26】**cyst rupture and inflammation lead to necrosis consequently causing fistulization.Occult trauma could be one of the causes for rupture of hydatid cyst leading to fistula formation \\[9，10\\]. Some subcutaneous hydatid cysts are more likely to be a primary invasion of hepatic Echinococcus is or contamination during previous surgery rather than hematogenous metastasis 4\\].**\n\n**There is a classification of rupture hepatic hydatid cyst posted by Lewall and MCorKELL \\[11\\]. They have separated rupture hydatid liver cyst into 3 categories： Contained， communicating and direct. Contained rupture occurs when only the endocyst ruptures and the cyst contents remain confined to the intact pericyst. Communicating rupture consists of a rupture of the endocyst with the escape of cyst contents into bronchioles or biliary radicals that are incorporated into the pericyst. Direct rupture is when both the endocyst and pericyst tear， causing a leakage of contents into the pleural or peritoneal cavities or other adjacent tissues 12|.**\n\n【28】**The operating procedure seems extremely necessary associated to medical treatment in the way to remove the cyst \\[13\\]. Surgical gesture includes resection of the primary cyst with excision of the fistula tract and disease skin. Benzimidazolecarbamates (mebendazole and albendazole) are antihelmintic drugsthat kill the parasite byimpairing its glucose uptake. Albendazole is the drug of choice because of its better absorption and better clinical results in comparison with mebendazole.

Referring to the report of the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network on the situation of COVID-19 in Spain， it reports that from the beginning of the pandemic until May 215，2020：37.3% of the infected population are over 70 years of age with a mortality rate of 87%\\[1\\]； while from June to the present this percentage decreases to 11.4% with a mortality rate of 41.9% of those who died from SARS-CoV-2 infection \\[2\\]. These reflect that this population is a highly affected age group. Following the evolution ofthe pandemic， more has been learned about the virus， its management and treatment， as well as its implications in terms of mortality and morbidity. Data on the medium- and long-term consequences on the health status of older people who have been affected by COVID-19 \\[3\\] are still limited. The follow-up of these patients represents a new healthcare need that requires a multidisciplinary，protocolised and equitable approach throughout the National Health System \\[4\\]. Therefore， this brief report aimed to analyze factors associated with mortality at 6 months and readmissions， functional and cognitive decline， and affective disorders in patients aged >70 vears surviving after hospital admission for SARS-CoV-2.**\n\n【22】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【23】**Longitudinal observational study of patients >70 years discharged from the Hospital Central de la Cruz Roja， Madrid， from March 204 to May 315， 2020 with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection， defined according to PCR confirmation criteria or as suspected cases according to compatible clinical， analytical and/or radiological data. OCTA-COVID Cohort.**\n\n【24】**Data collection process**\n\n【25】**At admission， socio-demographic variables were collected from the clinical history (age， sex)； comorbidity (Charlson Index，>2high comorbidity)； polypharmacy， the Quick Sepsis related Organ Failure Assessment score (Q-Sofa)之2 as high risk of mortality in suspected sepsis. Functional status using Barthel Index (BI) (independent： 100， mild dependency： 60-99， moderate dependency：40-59， severe dependency： 20-39 and maximum dependency： 0-19 points). Cognitive status with Red Cross Mental (RCM) which ranges from 0 (no cognitive impairment) to 5 (severe cognitive**\n\n【26】**impairment)， ≥ 2 as dementia. Frailty using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS)， 1-4 as non-frail， 5-6 as mildly to moderately frail and7-9 as severely frail. At discharge， functional status and length of hospital stay were collected. At 3 and 6 months post-discharge， a telephone interview was conducted by a trained geriatrician with the patient or， in the presence of cognitive decline， the reference family member or the nursing home staff. The following outcome variables were collected： Mortality and hospital readmission were collected from the computerized primary care program； functional decline (decrease ≥10 points in the BI compared to the baseline)； cognitive decline (decrease of 1 point on the RCMS compared to the baseline)； depressive semiology (the presentation of one or more of the criteria for the diagnosis of depressive disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V (DSM-V))and the presence of dyspnea according to the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) (level of dyspnea according to physical activity).**\n\n【27】**Statistical analysis**\n\n【28】**Continuous variables are descriptively summarized using the mean ± Standard Deviation (SD)， and categorical variables are expressed as percentages. Student\\`s t test was used to compare the quantitative variables， and the x’test for categorical variables. The influence of the baseline variables on the outcome variables at 6months was analyzed by binary logistic regression model， calculating the Odds Ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95% Confidence Interval(CI). The significant baseline variables in the univariate analysis were adjusted for age and sex. The statistical analysis was performed in SPSS 26.0.**\n\n【29】**Ethical approval**\n\n【30】**The studywasapprovedbythe ClinicalResearch Ethics Committee of the Hospital Universitario de La Paz， Madrid，registered PI-4131.**\n\n【31】**Results**\n\n【32】**During the period from March 20h to May 315， 2020，300 patients older than 70 years were admitted to hospital， 187 were discharged， of whom 8 were readmitted 48 hours after discharge， and 14 were excluded for refusal of consent， leaving a sample for analysis of 165patients. The baseline characteristics of the sample are shown in Table1. The functional， cognitive and depressive impairment at 3 months are described in Table 2. At 6 months， 21 patients (13%) died in the hospital and 23.8% required at least one readmission to hospital. Of those who died， 57% occurred in the first month post-discharge， the main causes being respiratory (57.14%) and cardiac (14.29%) pathology， the most frequent causes of readmission were respiratory(36.1%)， cardiological (25%) and urinary (16.7%) pathologies. Of the survivors at 6 months， more than half of the sample had some of the following sequela： Functional impairment (41.7%)， cognitive worsening (31.3%) or depressive symptoms (42.4%). In the multivariate analysis adjusted for age and sex of the baseline variables associated with mortality， readmissions， functional or cognitive deterioration or mood disorder at 6 months； the presence of functional deterioration at discharge and its persistence at 3 months were associated with a higher risk of mortality. In addition， cognitive worsening or the readmissions at 3 months were also associated with mortality. Functional impairment at discharge and its persistence at 3months as well as cognitive and mood deterioration and the presence of dyspnea at 3 months were associated with persistence of functional impairment at 6 months (Table 3). Finally， the presence of functional impairment and cognitive worsening at 3 months were significantly associated with cognitive worsening at 6 months.**\n\n【33】**Table 1： Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample of >70vears old survivors of SARS-CoV-2 infection.**\n\n| **Age (years， SD)**  | **85.85±6.73**  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Female (%)**  | **69.1**  |\n| **Nursing home pre-admission (%)**  | **65.5**  |\n| **Length of hospitalization (days)**  | **15.63±8.63**  |\n| **Frailty (SD)**  | **5.89±1.95**  |\n| **Clinical Frailty Scale (%)**  |  |\n| **1-4**  | **27.3**  |\n| **5-6**  | **4.8**  |\n| **7-9**  | **47.9**  |\n| **Charlson Index >2(%)**  | **33.9**  |\n| **Q-Sofa≥2(%)**  | **13.3**  |\n| **CURB-65≥2(%)**  | **53.3**  |\n| **Polypharmacy (%)**  |  |\n| **<5**  | **32.10%**  |\n| **5-9**  | **43.60%**  |\n| **210**  | **24.20%**  |\n| **Pneumonia at admission(%)**  | **82.3**  |\n| **Previous Barthel index <40**  | **26.6**  |\n| **Functional decline at discharge (%)**  | **23.6**  |\n| **Previous dementia (%)**  | **43.6**  |\n| **Previous depressive disorder (%)**  | **38.8**  |\n\n【35】**Table 2： Variable at 3 months.**\n\n| **Functional decline (%)**  | **27.2**  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Readmission(%)**  | **20**  |\n| **Dyspnea at 3 months (%)**  | **29.8**  |\n| **Functional impairment(%)**  | **27.2**  |\n| **Cognitive decline (%)**  | **25.8**  |\n| **Presence of depressive symptoms (%)**  | **51**  |\n\n【37】**Discussion**\n\n【38】**We describe the health status after hospitalization for COVID-19in a cohort of patients older than 70 vears who survived admission. The OCTA-COVID study \\[5\\] describes in-hospital mortality in 37%； and the presence of delirium， dementia and high CURB-65 values as predictors of mortality. It should be noted that the patients studied were not ICU candidates and were treated on the ward. With respect to high comorbidity and frailty \\[6\\] there are differences with other studies that do relate it. We found that mortality at 6 months was13%， lower than that described by Walle Hansen et al. \\[7\\] in a cohort of patients over 60 years of age (21%)， a younger population and a quarter developed severe COVID， twice that in the present sample The readmission rate of 23.8% was very similar to that described in the3-month follow-up (20%)， with respiratory pathology being the main cause. The incidence of post-hospitalization functional impairment6 months after discharge was 41.7% higher than that described at 3months (27.2%)， which could be related to dyspnea as a persistent symptom limiting ambulation and the performance of basic activities of daily living. According to Lloyd \\[9\\]， the presence or absence of functional recovery after 1 month was associated with long-term outcome. A functional dependence is described as factor associated**\n\n【39】Table 3： Logistic regression analysis of baseline variables associated to mortality risk， readmission， functional and cognitive decline， and depressive symptoms at 6months (adjusted for age and sex).\n\n|  | **Mortality**  | **Readmission**  | **Functional decline**  | **Cognitive impairment**  | **Depressive symptoms**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Charlson Index >2**  | **1(0.18-5.65)**  | **1.97(0.68-5.74)**  | **2.04(0.96-4.31)**  | **0.51(0.22-1.19)**  | **1.71(0.81-3.62)**  |\n| **B<40 baseline**  | **5.36(1.1-26.24)**  | **1.21(0.38-3.86)**  | **0.54(0.23-1.29)**  | **0.33(0.11-0.94)**  | **0.53(0.22-1.26)**  |\n| **B<40 at 3 months**  | **20.01 (2.24-178.39)**  | **2.56(0.89-7.43)**  | **1.23(0.57-2.66)**  | **0.61(0.26-1.45**  | **0.74(0.34-1.62)**  |\n| **Functional decline on admission**  | **5.33(1.11-25.73)**  | **1.73(0.59-5.12)**  | **3.92(1.68-9.12)**  | **2.21(0.99-4.96)**  | **1.71(0.77-3.79)**  |\n| **Functional decline at 3 months**  | **9.23(1.6-53.28)**  | **2.53 (0.89-7.15)**  | **14.44(5.10-40.85)**  | **3.02(1.36-6.69)**  | **1.42(0.66-3.08)**  |\n| **Cognitive deterioration at 3 months**  | **8.67(1.58-47.58)**  | **2.13(0.74-6.18)**  | **2.88 (1.28-6.49)**  | **20.89(7.69-56.8)**  | **1.93(0.87-4.27)**  |\n| **Mood disorder at 3 months**  | **2.55(0.48-13.69)**  | **1.39(0.5-3.92)**  | **2.06(1.04-4.06)**  | **2.33(1.13-4.84)**  | **4.11(2.01-8.43)**  |\n| **Readmissions at 3 months**  | **14.69(2.6-82.99)**  | **5.45(1.83-16.18)**  | **0.98 (0.39-2.47)**  | **1.26(0.48-3.29)**  | **0.61(0.23-1.62)**  |\n| **Dyspnea at 3 months**  | **0.91(0.17-5.01)**  | **1.98(0.67-5.80)**  | **7.08(3.03-16.51)**  | **1.98(0.67-5.80)**  | **3.87(1.80-8.33)**  |\n\n【41】**BI： Barthel Index**\n\n【42】**with mortality and readmission \\[8\\]，which highlights the need for early follow-up of this group affected by a new disease that is impacting on all areas of comprehensive geriatric assessment. The presence of affective disorder at 3 months was the only factor associated with functional， cognitive and mood worsening at 6 months. A quarter of the patients were cognitively worse and almost half of the patients had some depressive symptomatology， almost twice as many as described by Huang et al. \\[10\\]， in a younger population and with a better baseline functional status. This high percentage of depressive disorder could be related to the presence of depressive disorder in39% oftheir medicalhistory.Despite the limitations ofour study，such as the small sample size and being a single-center study， we would like to highlight the prevalence of functional impairment， cognitive worsening and the presence of affective symptomatology in a typical geriatric population (high frailty， polypharmacy and comorbidity) that is usually underrepresented in research studies.**\n\n【43】**Conclusion**\n\n【44】**COVID-19 causes a worsening of the health of the elderly after hospitalization， highlighting not only the presence of severe functional impairment， but also the important role of cognitive and mood impairment， whose early detection could contribute to the selection of patients at higher risk of medium-long term sequela for closer follow-up.**\n\n【45】**Acknowledgem ent**\n\n【46】**Geriatrics Unit of the Hospital Central de la Cruz Roja.**\n\n【47】**References**\n\n【48】1\\.

The patient's medical history includes myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation3 years ago， treated with coronary angioplasty with Drug Eluting Stent implantation (DES). Additionally， the patient suffered from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation， type 2 diabetes， hypertension， obesity and ulcerative colitis. Due to the presence of significant primary mitral regurgitation， the patient underwent biological mitral prosthesis implantation 3 years ago. One year after cardiac surgery， due to the presence of contraindications to the use of anticoagulants (recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown etiology)， the patient had left atrial appendage closure using the Amplatzer occluder. The coronary angiography showed a multivessel disease. The TTE showed elevated gradients through the mitral bioprosthesis (PG max 30 mmHg， PG mean 14 mmHg). Additional echostructure was visualized， suggesting the presence of a thrombus in the left atrium. Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) confirmed the presence of a massive thrombus with the largest thickness of 30 mm attached to the implanted occluder.PG mean was assessed at 13 mmHg with normal mobility of the bioprosthesis cusps. Additional parameters such as： EOA (Effective Orifice Area)-1.6cm andEOAi-0.75cm/m'prompted us to suspect Prosthesis-Patient Mismatch(PPM) Figure 1，2.**\n\n【20】**Figure 1： Thrombus on the left atrium.

Figure 5： A thrombosis in the left atrium appendage.**\n\n【22】**The second patient is an 80-year-old man with a medical history of permanent atrial fibrillation， hypertension， bladder cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Eight years ago， the patient underwent percutaneous closure of ASD II with the Amplatzer occluder. A year later， the patient underwent CABG due to multivessel coronary disease， during which a biological mitral valve was implanted due to severe secondary mitral regurgitation. Patient on chronic warfarin therapy with labile International Normalized Ratio (INR) values due to poor adherence. Currently， the patient has been admitted to the Department of Cardiology due to exacerbation of chronic heart failure. TTE showed a reduced ejection fraction up to 30% and the presence of akinesia of the interventricular septum and the anteroseptal wall. Gradients through the mitral prosthesis were proper. The presence of a massive thrombus in the left atrium was visualized. A massive thrombus \"papered up\" the wall of the left atrium it was mainly related to the occluder. There was also a thrombus in the left atrium appendage. Additional views showed the**\n\n【23】**presence of a leak around the occlude Figures 3-6.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**Echocardiographic control in patients with biological mitral valve and percutaneous occluder is not currently standardized. The reported cases of massive left atrial thrombosis in patients with mitral bioprosthesis and percutaneous occluder are still missing. It seems rational for patients with risk factors for thrombosis， the presence of biological valve prosthesis， and a percutaneous occluder to undergo routine TTE annually. However， this requires further researches and standardized guidelines. There is still an unanswered question whether patients with implanted biological valve prostheses should be candidates for occluder implantation? The need for research also applies to anticoagulant therapy. Should Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anti-Coagulation Agents (NOACs) be always used， or should Vitamin K Antagonists (VKAs) be used in the case of a patient suspected of PPM?**\n\n【26】**Conclusion**\n\n【27】**Late device-related thrombosis is very rare. The same applies to patients with a biological mitral prosthesis. In the cases described above， a thrombotic complication was found several years after the cardiac surgery. The common element of these patients was the presence of percutaneous occluders implanted into the left atrium. In both cases， the major mass of the thrombus was on the occluder. Is it a coincidence or is the presence of valve prosthesis and an additional device in the left atrium a \"thrombogenic duo\"?**\n\n【28】**References**\n\n【29】**1\\.

Common symptoms were headaches， visual disturbances， chronic fatigue， galactorrhea， secondary infertility， weight gain. Schizophrenia is the most common functional psychotic disorder， and individuals with the disorder can present with a variety of manifestations. There is much unknown about the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders. In this case report present a young patient with empty sella turcica presented with psychotic symptoms diagnosed as schizophrenia. It is possible that both conditions could result from the same genetic origin.**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Empty Sella Syndrome (ESS) is a disorder that involves the sella turcica， a bony structure at the base of the brain that surrounds and protects the pituitary gland \\[1\\]. Empty Sella Syndrome (ESS) is where the pituitary gland shrinks or becomes flattened， filling the sella turcica with cerebrospinal fluid on imaging instead of the normal pituitary \\[2\\]. There are two types of ESS： primary and secondary. Primary ESS happens when a small anatomical defect above the pituitary gland increases pressure in the sella turcica and causes the gland to flatten out along the interior walls of the sella turcica cavity. Secondary ESS is the result of the pituitary gland regressing within the cavity after an injury， surgery， or radiation therapy \\[3\\]. The cause of primary empty sella syndrome is a congenital defect (Diaphragma Sellae). Secondary empty sella syndrome happens when a tumor or surgery damages the gland， this is an acquired manner of the condition \\[4\\]. Common symptoms were headaches， visual disturbances， chronic fatigue， galactorrhea， secondary infertility， weight gain \\[1\\]. The major differential to consider in empty sella syndrome is intracranial hypertension， of both unknown and secondary causes \\[51.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 24 years male， single， unemployed，low educated， with 2 brothers， 4 sisters， his rank 6h. Premorbidly well-functioning with no family history of mental illness being reported and no history of substance and alcohol abuse， recently visited the psychiatry outpatient department along with his mother， against his will few days after disorganized behavior. His mother was surprised when he suddenly entered his home wearing a woman's wedding suit with full bride-like makeup. Also she stated that he involved in many quarrels with other family members. He presented with disorganized speech， behavior，low mood， and visual hallucination of religious theme， feel watched by others that tryto harm him. No auditory hallucination， grandiose delusion， insomnia， poor appetite，aggressive bouts， Suicidal and homicidal threats， social isolation. His condition was associated with headache， decreased visual acuity， rhinorrhea.**\n\n【17】**Past psychiatric history： multiple episodes of disorganized behavior， impulses， wondering， but without psychiatric consultation. No past medical and surgical history.**\n\n【18】**Personal history： he was born by caesarian section delivery， no history of hospitalization， no jaundice， no seizures， no delayed mile stone， enter school at 7 years of age， good relation with peer and teachers， Poor school performance， leave school at 10 years age at 4h primary class. Have history ofhead trauma，loss of consciousness for 30 min， admitted to hospital. Work as clean worker at age22 years， good performance， but left job under pressure of his brother.**\n\n【19】**Premorbid personality： anxious， fearful， with no forensic history.**\n\n【20】**On mental status examination he was look healthy， in his age， conscious and oriented with**\n\n【21】**poor eye contact， decreased psychomotor activity and talk， guarded about revealing the details of his persecutory ideas and described visual hallucinations of seeing holy Imam， maintained attention， concentration， and immediate memory with partial insight， dressing well， cooperative coordinated， touch with surrounding， try to express himself， coherent relevant speech， fluent， low tone， slow rhythm， monotonous，low volume， low pitch， good quantity， with difficulty in articulation like hot potato speech. Low mood， restricted affect， No formal thought disorder， Suicidal ideation， Homicidal ideation， grandiose delusion and persecutory delusion.**\n\n【22】**His investigations revealed the thyroid stimulating hormone(TSH) levels， T4 levels， T3 levels within normal range. Morning serum cortisol and serum testosterone levels within normal range. His routine blood examination， routine urine examination，routine blood sugar， serum sodium， calcium， bicarbonate and potassium， renal and liver function test， and lipid profile were normal. Growth hormone， follicular stimulating hormone， and luteinizing hormone were normal. CT scan of the head and Magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed an empty sella.**\n\n【23】**Differential diagnosis： Psychosis secondary to another medical condition (DSM-V)and Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (DSM-V)\\[6\\].**\n\n【24】**Treatment： Patient put on olanzapine 10 mg at night for his psychotic symptoms with resulting improvement of the symptoms. Outcome and follow-up outpatient card record was done for follow up appointments.**\n\n【25】**Discussion**\n\n【26】**The case report of patient with empty sella turcica presented with psychotic symptoms that was diagnosed as schizophrenia since he met the DSM-V criteria for diagnosis of schizophrenia. Empty Sella syndrome (ESS) is where the pituitary gland shrinks or becomes flattened， filling the sella turcica with cerebrospinal fluid on imaging instead of the normal pituitary \\[3\\]. ESS can be found in the diagnostic workup ofpituitary disorders，or as an incidental finding when imaging the brain \\[7\\]. Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental illness that affects1% of the population in all cultures \\[8\\]. The term schizophrenia was introduced by Bleuler over a hundred year ago to describe the breaking up or splitting of psychic functioning he observed in these patients and the diagnosis ofthis disorder is still based exclusively on clinical symptoms \\[9\\]. As we progress through the 215 century， we are looking for understanding the neurobiology behind the psychiatric illnesses \\[10\\]. Schizophrenia is the most common functional psychotic disorder， and individuals with the disorder can present with a variety of manifestations \\[9\\]. The heritability of schizophrenia is substantial， but the etiology of the disorder is poorly understood \\[11\\]. Empty sella is a radiographic term \\[11\\]. Some reviews showed progressive brain changes in schizophrenia but there was no evidence of any relationship between schizophrenia and empty sella in the literature**\n\n【27】**\\[12\\]. Although historically not much evidence were found to support any correlation between Schizophrenia and ESS， case report of a set of monozygotic triplets， with schizophrenia with ESS was found， which discuss possible correlation between the two \\[13\\]. The triplets with similar psychotic symptoms were found to have empty sella turcica in MRI findings， along with other identical abnormalities， suggesting a common genetic origin of ESS and schizophrenia \\[12\\].**\n\n【28】**Conclusion**\n\n【29】**Empty sella turcica among patients with schizophrenia may be incidental radiological finding. It is possible that both conditions could result from the same chromosomal alteration.**\n\n【30】**References**\n\n【31】1\\. Nwafor NN， Akhigbe AO.

As imaging modalities improve， accessory spleens are frequently detected as an incidental finding on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonanc imaging (MRI) which may mimic a neoplasm. We report a case of intrapancreatic accessory spleen simulating a neuroendocrine neoplasm and a case of accessory spleen presenting as a submucosal mass suggestive of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Finally， we discuss the common differential diagnosis， radiologic features， and possible management of accessory spleens.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Splenic tissue； Neoplasm； Neuroendocrine tumor**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**An accessory spleen is an congenital foci of normal splenic tissue separate from the main body of the spleen \\[1\\]. This entity is relatively common. According to autopsy studies， accessory spleens occur in about 10-30% of the population and in 16% of patients undergoing contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen \\[2，3\\]. Accessory splenic tissue have been identified in areas along the splenic vessels， the tail of the pancreas， in the wall of the jejunum， within intestinal mesentery， the greater omentum， the pelvis， and the scrotum \\[4\\]. However， the splenic hilum is the most common location for accessory spleens.**\n\n【20】**Accessory spleens are usually asymptomatic and clinically insignificant， but in some situations they simulate tumors. Currently， there are no definitive clinical or radiologic criteria for the differentiation of ectopic splenic tissue from malignancy. Definitive diagnosis is primarily attained from surgical resection. In this report， we analyze two cases of surgically treated accessory spleens which radiologically mimicked a neoplasm.**\n\n【21】**Case 1**\n\n【22】**A 77 year old gentleman with a recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with underlying hepatitis C disease was referred to H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center after surgical resection of his malignancy for further treatment recommendations. His past medical history was significant for prostate cancer treated with radiation seed implants and multiple previous surgeries secondary to a motor vehicle accident and electric bicycle accident. A routine follow-up CT of the chest and abdomen identified a 2.0 cm mildly hyper vascular solid nodule in the tail of his pancreas. Clinically， the imaging findings were highly suggestive of a neuroendocrine tumor. The patient underwent an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the lesion which demonstrated a hypoechoic mass in the tail ofthe pancreas corresponding to the CT findings. Unfortunately，the FNA specimen comprised of only scattered lymphocytes， degenerated cells， and debris. Surgical resection of the indeterminate lesion was recommended. The patient received a distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy. Grossly， sections of the pancreas revealed a 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.1 cm accessory spleen. The remaining pancreatic tissue and spleen was unremarkable. Histologic sections demonstrated an intra pancreatic accessory spleen (Figure 1) and focal pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN1b). The intra pancreatic accessory spleen is composed of red pulp， made up of numerous vascular sinuses， and white pulp， consisting of lymphoid follicles and cells ofthe reticuloendothelial system. There was no evidence of malignancy. The patient's postoperative course was complicated by bilateral pulmonary embolisms and a persistent fluid collection near his incision site. A month**\n\n【23】**pancreatic parenchyma (Hematoxylin and Eosin staining，4X).**\n\n【24】**after surgery the fluid collection at the operative site resolved and he remained stable on his Coumadin regimen.**\n\n【25】**Case 2**\n\n【26】**A 49 year-old gentleman with a remote history of multiple injuries secondary to a motor vehicle accident including a ruptured spleen presented to his primary care physician complaining of atypical substernal chest pain. A CT angiogram of his coronary vessels and a nuclear stress test was unremarkable. He received a chest CT as part of the work-up for his chest pain which identified an incidental soft tissue lesion between the left diaphragm and the stomach measuring 2.6 cm in greatest dimension. There was no lymphadenopathy or effusions seen. An esphagogastroduodneoscopy was performed which identified a submucosal lesion in the fundus of the stomach corresponding to the CT findings. There were no infiltrative characteristics， hyervascularity， or surface ulceration seen. Unfortunately， the fundic mucosal biopsy revealed only mild chronic gastritis. At this point， a EUS with FNA of the lesion was recommended. The EUS procedure identified a hypoechoic mass arising from the muscular wall of the stomach. The FNA specimen demonstrated a few spindle cells and capillaries in a background of abundant lymphocytes. A portion of the specimen was sent for flow cytometry studies that revealed a mixed population of polyclonal B lymphocytes and reactive T lymphocytes. In regards to the gastric mass， clinicians suspected a possible gastrointestinal stromal tumor(GIST). However， after two attempts to biopsy the mass resulted in no definite diagnosis， surgical resection was recommended. The patient underwent a partial gastrectomy with a portion of his left diaphragm excised. Gross evaluation ofthe resection specimen revealed an ovoid， well-defined encapsulated nodule， measuring 1.3 cm in greatest dimension， between the diaphragmatic tissue and gastric wall. Cut surfaces of the nodule were soft， red-brown. Microscopically the nodule was composed of lymphoid follicles and splenic pulp (Figure2). The gastric mucosa showed chronic gastritis with reactive changes. There was no evidence of malignancy. The findings were compatible with an accessory spleen. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.**\n\n【27】**Discussion**\n\n【28】**Intrapancreatic accessory spleen has been documented and described in numerous previous case reports \\[4-19\\]. On the other hand， accessory spleen masquerading as a gastric submucosal tumor has been rarely reported \\[20-22\\]. We report a case of intrapancreatic accessory spleen and a case of an accessory spleen involving the stomach. Since their origin is congential， they are primarily found in**\n\n【29】**Figure 2： Gastric submucosal splenic tissue (Hematoxylin and Eosin staining，4X).**\n\n【30】**areas within the embryologic dorsal mesentery of the stomach and pancreas \\[23，24\\]. They are usually asymptomatic as in our cases， but symptoms may arise and have clinical significance in certain situations which include torsion， spontaneous rupture， hemorrhage or causes hematologic disorders such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura \\[4\\].**\n\n【31】**Due to advanced imaging techniques， accessory spleens are often detected incidentally. On sonography， intrapancreatic accessory spleens are well-defined and round or ovoid with a mildly echogenic and homogenous texture identical to that of the main spleen， surrounded by a high-amplitude interface and showing enhancement behind the lesion \\[7，25，26\\]. On color or power Doppler sonography images， blood supply to intra pancreatic accessory spleens from splenic artery or vein can be seen in some patients \\[7\\]. In contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (US) of intrapancreatic accessory spleens using Levovist， an ultrasound contrast agent containing air micro bubbles， show in homogenous enhancement related to the different flow rate through the cords of the red and white pulp in the arterial phase. In the portal venous phase， intra pancreatic accessory spleens become homogenous. Lastly， during the “hepatosplenic”phase the micro bubbles become trapped within the splenic parenchyma showing prolonged enhancement \\[27\\]. In comparison to surrounding pancreatic parenchyma， the intra pancreatic accessory spleen appears to show greater echo enhancement.**\n\n【32】**There are several characteristic features associated with intra pancreatic accessory spleens on CT and MRI imaging. On CT imaging they are well-defined，round homogenous masses usually smaller than2 cm in diameter \\[71. However， in rare instances accessory splenic tissue may appear hypodense in comparison with surrounding pancreatic tissue and the main spleen because enhancement can be retarded byliver cirrhosis \\[26\\]. Pancreatic tumors share similar signal characteristics with that of the spleen on MRI imaging modalities making it difficult to differentiate an intra pancreatic accessory spleen from a pancreatic tumor \\[26\\]. Interestingly， octreotide scintigraphy used to show the expression of somatostatin receptors in neuroendocrine neoplasms demonstrates somatostatin receptor expression in splenic tissue also \\[18\\]. However， super paramagnetic iron oxides (SPIO)-enhanced MRI technique demonstrate similar degree of signal drop in intra pancreatic accessory spleens as compared to native spleen \\[28\\]. Similar to technetium-99m heat-damaged red blood cells (HDRBC) scintigraphy in which injected HDRBCs are trapped by splenic tissue， SPIO-enhanced MRI requires the administration ofSPIO particles intravenously to be phagocytosed by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system in the spleen \\[281.**\n\n【33】**Although technetium-99m HDRBC scintigraphy is highly specific for detecting splenic tissue， the visualization of minute functioning splenic tissue is difficult. Furthermore， MRI imaging offers superior spatial resolution compared to scintigraphy \\[26\\].**\n\n【34】**The imaging findings in the cases presented in this report were not characteristic of accessory splenic tissue. The patient with the intra pancreatic accessory spleen had CT imaging findings demonstrating mild hypervascularity which can be associated with pancreatic endocrine tumors. In the evaluation of intra pancreatic masses with hypervascularity the differential would include pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors as well as lymphomas， hypervascular metastases， solid pseudopapillarytiimnors and pancreatic adenocarcinomas.However， benign entities should not be disregarded like intra pancreatic accessory spleen or even lymphoepithelial cyst \\[4，13\\]. The patient with the gastric submucosal mass had CT imaging findings suggestive of a GIST. Differential diagnosis for submuocosal gastric masses may include leiomyoma， schwannoma， fibromatosis， inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor， neuroendocrine tumor，leiomyosarcoma， and more. But an accessory spleen should be included in the differential. Therefore， a clear-cut distinction between accessory splenic tissue and a neoplasm/malignancy is extremely important when considering the possible differential but， is hard to attain with current technology.**\n\n【35】**EUS-guided FNA may provide a reliable diagnosis， thus avoiding unnecessary surgery. Schreiner et al. \\[29\\] reported the first series of intra pancreatic accessory spleen diagnosed by EUS-guided FNA. The cytologic features were nonspecific and included predominantly small lymphocytes with a subset of histiocytes， eosinophils， and plasma cells. Thin-walled blood vessels may also be seen，representing splenic sinuses. Interestingly， endothelial cells lining splenic sinuses are CD8 positive whereas systemic endothelial cells and hemangioma are negative \\[29\\]. There is the potential to diagnose accessory splenic tissue without resulting in surgery. Unfortunately， cytologic specimens may be suboptimal or insufficient as seen in our cases. Surgery in certain situations may be the best method for diagnosis and provide peace of mind to patients， in that； they are able to know definitively that their mass is benign.**\n\n【36】**In conclusion， modern imaging modalities will likely lead to an increase number of accessory spleens being discovered which will pose a diagnostic challenge. When an asymptomatic mass is detected involving the embryologic region of which ectopic splenic tissue may arise， an accessory spleen should be within the differential as well as a neoplasm/malignancy. Non-invasive diagnostic techniques are required including imaging with possible biopsy (either FNA or core needle biopsy). Hopefully， the diagnosis of an accessory spleen may be obtained and obviate unnecessary surgery decreasing overall patient morbidity. However， when a tissue diagnosis cannot be obtained from a biopsy， imaging findings are not conclusive， and the clinical suspicion for a neoplasm is high surgical resection is warranted.**\n\n【37】**References**\n\n【38】**1\\.

It is a benign lesion that composed of angiomatous and lipomatous structure. It can be diagnosed via the magnetic resonance imaging. Spinal cord compression is common and the neurological symptoms may also appear. Surgical resection is the most important treatment that relieved the symptoms. Spinal angiolipoma rarely recurred. However， some residual lesions may cause newly developed neurological symptoms. Adjuvant radiotherapy is a choice after the surgical resection.**\n\n【13】**Most of the patients underwent surgical resection. After the surgical treatment， the neurological deficit in this patients vanished. However，some studies shows treatment ofinfiltrating angiolipomas is aimed at wide excision with radiotherapy indicated for cases of recurrence.**\n\n【14】**Surgical removal should be followed by closely monitoring with physical examination and image even when the pathologically reported benign tumor. Further radiotherapy may be taken into consideration if this benign tumor has any malignant potential.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Angiolipoma； Tumors； Treatment**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Spinal angiolipomas are benign tumors histologically， and most of them are found in the spinal axis， especially the thoracic epidural space. However， it is a kind of rare neoplasm. In the spinal region， spinal cord compression syndrome caused by the angiolipoma can be usually resolved with surgical intervention \\[1\\]. Aspinal angiolipoma with malignant behavior extending outside of the spinal region has not been reported previously. Here， we describe a refractory case of a benign tumor that was diagnosed as an angiolipoma.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**Consent was obtained from the patient to publish her case. A 60-year-old woman presented to our hospital with numbness and weakness of the lower limbs and unstable gait for 6 months. The physical examination revealed Lhermitte’s sign and positive Spurling's sign. The blood hemogram revealed normal results. The chest roentgenogram showed spondylosis， degenerative disc disease as marginal spur formation， and a mass lesion at the aortic level. Chest Computed Tomography(CT) revealed an oval mass measuring 3.7 cm x 2.6 cm in the left posterior mediastinum with surrounding bone destruction. The thoracic spine CT showed a 4.8 cm enhancing tumor in the long axis of the spinal canal with left lateral extension into the pleural space (Figure 1). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the thoracic spine showed a 4.85 cm ×4 cm lobulated soft-tissue mass involving the extradural space at the T5 level on the right side (Figure 2A，2B).**\n\n【20】**Result**\n\n【21】**To relieve the patient's symptoms， total laminectomies of the T4-6 vertebrae with resection of the spinal tumor and Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) for resection of the paraspinal tumor were completed. After surgical treatment， her symptoms improved； however， the presence of malignancy was unclear， and her muscle strength was still poor.**\n\n【22】**Postoperatively， the microscopic examination (Figure 3) showed an angiolipoma composed of medium-sized to small-sized vessels and many capillaries with mature adipocytes as well as**\n\n【23】**_cited._**\n\n【24】**Table 1： Characteristics of similar patients treated by surgical resection reported in the literature and our case.**\n\n| **Study**  | **Age (years)/sex**  | **Symptoms**  | **Duration ot** **symptoms**  | **Spinallocation**  | **Extraspinaltumor**  | **Treatment**  | **Follow-up** **duration**  | **Outcome**  | **Time of symptomreliet**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Reyes et al.9**  | **68/M**  | **Lumbago**  | **3 years**  | **T12 to L1-L2**  | **No**  | **Surgery**  | **N/A**  | **Resolvec**  | **1year**  |\n| **Rkhami et al.\\[10\\]**  | **65/F**  | **Paraplegia** **and sphincter** **disorders**  | **7 months**  | **T7-T10**  | **No**  | **Surgery**  | **5 years**  | **Recoverec**  | **1 year**  |\n| **Mohammed andAhmed \\[11\\]**  | **35/F**  | **Lower limb** **paralysis** **and urinary** **incontinence**  | **Acute onset**  | **T5-T8**  | **No**  | **Surgery**  | **1year**  | **Recoverec**  | **1 year**  |\n| **Ramdasi et al.\\[12\\]**  | **58/M**  | **Neck and** **interscapular** **pain， paraplegiaand sphincter** **incontinence**  | **48 hours**  | **C7-T1**  | **No**  | **Surgery**  | **2 years**  | **Rapid recovery**  | **2 years**  |\n| **Chotai et al.\\[13\\]**  | **68/M**  | **LBP and** **progressiveparesthesia**  | **5 years**  | **T9-T11**  | **No**  | **Surgery**  | **N/A**  | **Improved**  | **N/A**  |\n| **Isutsumietal.\\[141**  | **26/F**  | **Paraplegia and** **incontinence**  | **Acute onset**  | **T3-T4**  | **No**  | **Surgery**  | **1 year**  | **Improved**  | **1year**  |\n| **Akhaddar et al.15**  | **47/m**  | **Back pain，paresthesia** **completeneurological** **palsy**  | **Acute onset**  | **T2-T3**  | **No**  | **Surgery**  | **\\>2 years**  | **Improved**  | **Immediately**  |\n| **Lacour et al. \\[16\\]**  | **17/M**  | **Acute paraplegia**  | **Acute onset**  | **T7-T12**  | **No**  | **Surgery**  | **N/A**  | **Improved**  | **2 months**  |\n| **Present case**  | **60/F**  | **Numbness andweakness of thelower limbs**  | **6 months**  | **T4-6**  | **Yes**  | **Surgery**  | **6 months**  | **Recurrence**  |  |\n\n【26】**M： Male；F： Female； LBP： Low Back Pain； N/A： Not Applicable**\n\n【27】**Figure 1： Preoperative thoracic spine contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans showing a lobulated mass in the left paraspinal region with thoracic extension into the extraspinal cannel and cord compression at the dorsal horn.**\n\n【28】**Figure 2A： Preoperative T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan at the T5 level in the sagittal view.

Regarding immune histochemistry findings， the angiolipoma stained diffuse and strongly positive for CD34. These cells failed to express S100， the glial fibrillary acidic protein， CK， epithelial membrane antigen， and D2-40. Therefore， the patient was diagnosed as having an angiolipoma.**\n\n【30】**Three months later， the postoperative spinal thoracic MRI with contrast showed a mass lesion measuring about 3.0 cm x 1.9 cm ×5.8 cm in the extradural space at the T4-T6 level with extension into the left T5/6 neural foramen. T5 vertebral body involvement (Figure4A) and spinal cord compression were also indicated. The tumor with mass extension into the left paraspinal region that was observed previously was not seen (Figure 4B). Thus， she underwent regular Stereotactic Radiation Therapy (SRT) for the suspicious recurrent lesion.**\n\n【31】**Figure 2B： Axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan.**\n\n【32】**developed new neurological symptoms under regular SRT.**\n\n【33】**Discussion**\n\n【34】**Currently， she is undergoing regular outpatient follow-up and weekly SRT.

T5 vertebral body involvement is also seen.**\n\n【38】**extended into the left paraspinal region has disappeared.**\n\n【39】**forearms，trunk， neck， and proximal upper extremities，but it is a rare， benign tumor when located in the thoracic posterior epidural spaces\\[3\\]. Histologically， it is a benign tumor， and it can be confused with a hamartoma orbenign tumor that develops from dural mesenchymal cells \\[3\\]. An angiolipoma with a malignant tendency is very rare.**\n\n【40】**MRI is the most valuable modali1OSIty for determining the characteristics of an angiolipoma \\[4\\]. A lipomatous mass has a different appearance from the spine， which appears as a high-density structure， and this type of mass has a relatively lower density than the bone material when viewed by CT； thus， an angiolipoma may appear as a lipomatous extradural mass. Bone erosion may also be visible because of tumor compression \\[5\\]. As its name suggests， an angiolipoma is composed of fat and vascular elements. The vascular**\n\n【41】**part appears as a hypodense lesion on T1-weighted imaging， whereas the fat part appears as a hypo intense lesion on T2-weighted imaging After contrast enhancement with gadolinium， the vascular element appears as trabeculated bone tissue with a netted texture or like a reticular structure. On T1-weighted sequences， fat saturation can be seen clearly. However， the vessel part is hypointense and can manifest an obvious enhancement on T1-weighted sequences with contrast enhancement using gadolinium \\[6\\].**\n\n【42】**Because of the richness of vessels，a highly vascularized tumor can be predicted preoperatively from a T1 void signal \\[7\\]. The differential diagnosis includes lipomas and spinal vascular tumors， such as fistulas， metastases， meningiomas， and hemopathies. Angiography is helpful with the differential diagnosis， and it can be used to assess vascularization of the lesion， which is important for tumor removal using embolization \\[8\\]. On T2-weighted images， hyperintensity is a common finding ofvascular content \\[7\\].**\n\n【43】**Surgical treatment was the only treatment performed in similar patients to ours with the symptom of compression， as shown in Table 1 \\[9-16\\]. All patients in previous studies showed good improvement postoperatively without recurrence. Most patients can achieve complete symptom relief. However， our patient had symptoms of paraplegia only a few days postoperatively. Because of the intra spinal origin and dumbbell shape， a neurologic tumor or malignancy was suspected. Thus， the differential diagnosis included a neurogenic tumor， ganglioma， hemangioma， hemangiopericytoma， or angiolipoma. However， the contrast-enhanced CT showed a strong enhancing lesion， which was considered hyper vascularity that was different from the presentation of a neurogenic lesion. Because of the worsening symptoms on postoperative month 3， an imaging study was performed and revealed a focal mass lesion at the spinal cord， although the prior mass disappeared. For this type of tumor， surgical treatment can be used to easily remove the tumor； nevertheless， some debris may remain without complete removal because ofhyper vascularity of the tumor \\[17\\]. It has been reported that treatment of an infiltrating angiolipoma focuses on wide excisionplus radiotherapy in the case of recurrence \\[18\\]. Thus， we administered regular radiotherapy in our patient because of her refractory lesion.**\n\n【44】**In our patient， the entire operation was performed without incident. After total laminectomies of T4-6 vertebrae with resection of the spinal tumor， she underwent VAT'S for resection of the paraspinal tumor. Some authors reported that thoracoscopic tumor removal after laminectomy is the most appropriate and reliable surgical treatment of a spinal dumbbell tumor. Because tumors are vessel-rich， some lesions may infiltrate the vertebral body. Furthermore， the residue may possibly become enlarged and case the prior symptoms to recur. Our patient experienced partial clinical improvement with partial recovery within 1 week postoperatively. In the outpatient department follow-up， the patient experienced weakness of both lower limbsat3 months postoperatively. Radiotherapy was administered because of the newly developed lesion in the spinal region， although surgical pathological results revealed that the prior lesion was benign**\n\n【45】**Conclusion**\n\n【46】**Surgical resection should be followed by basic monitoring with a physical examination and imaging study even when the pathological results indicate a benign tumor. Furthermore， radiotherapy may be considered if the benign tumor has any malignant tendency.**\n\n【47】**References**\n\n【48】1\\. Fourney DR， Tong KA， Macaulay RJ， Griebel RW.

Giant Cell Tumor (GCT) and Aneurismal Bone Cyst(ABC) may give the same clinical and radiological pictures. GCT is a rare benign bone lesion most often found in the extremities of women in the third and fourth decades of life. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment and usually consists of intralesional curettage. Local control rates range from 80% to 90% after this procedure. ABC is a reactive lesion of bone， locally destructive and not considered as a true neoplasm. Most common in proximal humerus， around the knee and spine. Treated by curettage and bone graft with a recurrence rate up to 20%. Aggressive inaccessible lesions may be treated by arterial embolization or low dose radiation \\[2\\]. Aggressive ABC and GCT occur in the metacarpal bones， grow fast and tend to recur after curettage removal. They can be multicentral and destroy the whole bone and the Metatarsophalangeal Joints (MPJ) \\[3-5\\]. These conditions can affect greatly the function ofthe hand. Drastic treatment is by ray amputation whichleaves immense dysfunction. Complete en bloc removal ofthe affected bone with adjacent soft tissue and replacement provide cure，preservation of function and cosmoses of the hand \\[6，7\\]. Replacement of the removed metacarpal can be done by different modalities； autografting with metatarsal bone， \\[6-8\\] vascular or non-vascular fibular graft \\[9\\] silicone end prosthesis and iliac crest graft \\[10\\]. A small subset of patients with incompletely resectable GCT or with lesions that are surgically inaccessible may be treated with moderate-dose radiotherapy (45-50 Gy) and have a 65% to 80% likelihood of being locally controlled \\[11\\]. We report 2 cases of aggressive ABC and GCT of the second metacarpal with gross destruction of bone， removed and replaced completely with the third metatarsal bone successfully**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**Case 1**\n\n【19】**Eight years old boy presented with painful swelling of the left hand in the area of the second metacarpal bone of three months duration. The swelling was spontaneous with no history of previous trauma or infection in the hand. On physical examination， hard oval swelling on the dorsum ofthe hand in the second metacarpal area measuring 3 cm x2 cm. The mass was moderately tender on deep palpation. The range of movement of the second MPJ was moderately affected， and the neurovascular bundle was intact. Radiological examination revealed a largelytic lesion involving the whole second metacarpal bone， expansile ballooning in shape reported as aneurismal bone cyst(Figure 1).**\n\n【20】**Decision was made to do en bloc removal and replacement with complete third metatarsal**\n\n【21】**Figure 2： Clinical photo of case No. 1 Aneurismal bone cyst， section showing dilated vascular channels with hemorrhage and scattered multinucleated qiant cells.**\n\n【22】**Figure 3： Clinical photo case No. 2 GCT section shows heavy infiltration by osteoclastic multinucleated giant cells in a compact fashion surrounded by mono-nuclear stromal cells.**\n\n【23】**bone. Dorsal approach was appropriate， lazy S incision done， separation and isolation of the extensor tendons， then removal of the whole MC with its periosteum. The harvested metatarsal， with its periosteum， was implanted at the site of the removed metacarpal and fixed with intramedullary K wire for eight weeks. Care was taken to reconstruct the MPJ. Plaster of Paris (POP) volar splint keeping slight dorsiflexion of the wrist and 80 degree flexion of the MPG kept for 8 weeks. The K wire was removed by the end of 12 weeks when index mobilization started.Histopathologic examination of the excised metacarpal revealed aneurismal bone cyst (Figure 2). After18 months follow up， the graft was completely incorporated and the second MPJ movements were satisfactory， no recurrence at the site， normal appearance of the hand and no morbidity at the donor foot.**\n\n【24】**Case 2**\n\n【25】**Thirty six years old housewife referred with a painful swelling of her left hand for six months. She carried a histopathological report of giant cell tumor from a biopsy of the second metacarpal bone(Figure 3). Radiological examination showed complete destruction of the bone. Treatment was by en bloc removal of the affected second metacarpal bone with replacement by the left third metatarsal bone**\n\n【26】**Figure 4： Clinical photo of case No.2，(a) Swelling of the hand.

(h) Donor site x-ray.**\n\n【27】**placed and fixed by K. wire for 12 weeks. Dorsal approach was used as well， care taken to reconstruct the second MPJ. Rehabilitation by passive and active movement of the joint after three weeks from surgery. After 42 months the hand was free of recurrence and maintained good function with no morbidity at the donor left foot(Figure 4).**\n\n【28】**Discussion**\n\n【29】**Aggressive benign tumors of the hand are rare； they can destroy the whole metacarpal bone. They occur in young age group， grossly affecting the function of the hand. These tumors can be multicentric and tend to recur after local removal \\[4，7，9，12\\]. En bloc resection is the preferred method to ensure the cure of the disease. To preserve the function of the hand， replacement of the removed metacarpal is done by several methods； free fibular graft， vascular iliac crest strut， cement spacer， all with or without endoprosthesis， and autotrasplant of metatarsal bone \\[6-9，13-15\\]. We presented two cases of successful autotransplant of metatarsal bone for a completely destroyed second metacarpal with the MPJ. The first was for a child with aneurismal bone cyst， and the second for a woman with aggressive giant cell tumor. After 18-42 months of follow up this method proved to cure the disease with retrieval of a good satisfactory function as well as the cosmetic appearance of the hand. Mikkelsen OA and Menon J used metatarsal head to replace destroyed MPJ in rheumatoid patients with satisfactory results \\[6，7\\]. Saikat Sau also used metatarsals to replace destroyed metacarpal bones by giant cell tumors with satisfactory**\n\n【30】**functional results \\[16\\]. Because of the rarity of theses tumors， studies of large number of patients are not available， however many case report studies have been published consistent with our results. We recommend metatarsal replacement as it is more physiological and less demanding. In addition， it provides cure with satisfactory function and cosmoses.**\n\n【31】**References**\n\n【32】**1\\.

Luxturna is a major medical advance since it is the first gene therapy to be granted approval by FDA that targets on a single gene. Approval of Luxturna may provide new prospects for curing various intractable and life-threatening rare diseases. As indicated by the former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb， FDA can see a bright future of gene therapy， through which many dreaded， usually terminal medical problems may be solved， and now it is a critical time for the development of this novel form oftreatment. As a result， FDA has been devoted to establishing an integrated， appropriate policy framework to encourage and administrate gene therapy research. FDA will also gradually promulgate a series of disease-specific guidance papers to demonstrate the clinical development and detailed approval process of investigational gene therapy products to discuss some critical and creative thinking that might be helpful to evaluate the efficacy of GT products and accelerate approval process. In this article， FDA guidance on clinical trial design issies for gene therapy development of rare diseases and some current innovative statistical considerations are reviewed. In addition， a case study of Luxturna， the first approved gene therapy for a rare disease is discussed.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Rare disease drug development； Demonstrating effectiveness or not in effectiveness； Real-world evidence； Therapeutic index**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Gene therapy is a technique to treat diseases by introducing exogenous normal genes into targeted cells to destroy abnormal genes or compensate beneficial protein products. There are three main mechanisms of gene therapies， namely， (i) replacing a defective gene with a normal copy of the gene， (ii) inactivating a defective gene， and (iii) transmitting a functional gene which can effectively treat the disease to the human body \\[1\\]. As indicated in the 2020FDA guidance on Long Term Follow-Up after Administration of Human Gene Therapy Products， human gene therapy attempts to treat or cure human genetic diseases by gene modification technologies that help certain biological processes return to normal \\[2，3\\]. Gene therapy products can be applied in a wide range of illnesses， such as cancer， communicable diseases， and hereditary diseases.**\n\n【18】**Without a carrier called vector， the modified gene cannot be inserted into body and work successfully. Certain vectors include plasmid DNA， viral vectors and bacterial vectors \\[1\\].A plasmid is often a circular DNA molecule separated from bacteria， which can reproduce in other organisms. Thus， plasmids are a suitable tool to deliver therapeutic genes to specific tissues. Viral vectors are another natural carrier in gene engineering. Before being used as vehicles to transfer genetic materials， infectious viruses have to be modified to become a harmless form. Many gene therapy products are derived from viruses， such as lentiviral vectors used to treat sickle cell disease， AAV virus vectors applied in tuberous sclerosis \\[4，5\\]. The mechanism of bacterial vectors is similar to viral vectors， which is firstly removing the infectivity and then inserting the combination of bacteria and the therapeutic gene into human tissues. In addition to vectors， human gene editing technology and patient-derived cellular products are frequently used in gene therapy. For human gene editing technology， the principle is to stop the activity of defective genes or repair mutated genes. Forpatient-derived cellular gene therapy products， we directly extract pathological cells from the patient and finally returned the genetically modified cells to the patient \\[1\\].**\n\n【19】**As indicated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reports， there are about 7，000 rare diseases and over 25 million people in the United States suffer from them. Research shows that approximately80% of rare diseases are due to single gene mutation， and are commonly diagnosed in children \\[3\\]. Moreover， most of the rare diseases are very hard to cure and usually fatal. However， effective therapies are limited. Thus， it becomes necessary for the research of effective treatments for rare diseases. Additionally， many rare diseases exhibit multiple sub-types or variations. As a result， the development of gene therapy products in the area of rare diseases has become very popular.**\n\n【20】**The remaining of this article is organized as follows. In the next section， FDA's guidance on gene therapy for rare diseases is reviewed. Some statistical considerations are given in Section 3， while Section 4provides a detailed discussion of a recent FDA approved gene therapy regulatory submission. Some concluding remarks are given in the last section of this article.**\n\n【21】**FDA Guidance on Gene Therapy for Rare Diseases**\n\n【22】**To assist the sponsors for developing a human Gene Therapy(GT) product for rare diseases， FDA released an industry guidance _document on Human Gene Therapy for Rare Diseases in 2020 \\[3\\]. The_ guidance is aimed to offer recommendations to researchers who seek to promote human gene therapy medication development targeting a specific rare disease in terms of the possible elements and issues necessary to be considered during each stage of the clinical trial design program. It should be noted this document does not establish a golden standard.FDA encourages any alternative method to support your product as long as it follows all the statutory requirements determined by FDA.**\n\n【23】**Although one rare disease affects only a few people， the total number of people suffering from rare diseases is enormous. Moreover， many rare diseases have no approved efficient therapies. Phenotypic heterogeneity and multi-subtypes of disease also add the difficulty of treatment. Therefore， natural history studies are quite important in treatment development for rare diseases since natural history studies can provide comprehensiveknowledge of a disease. However，limited information from the natural history of rare diseases is available for clinical trial development \\[3，6，7\\].**\n\n【24】**Many factors should be considered during all phases of clinical trials design. One example is ethical issues since most of the rare diseases happen during childhood which involves enrollment of children and permission from parents. Human Gene Therapy for Rare Diseases proposes an outline of suggested elements could be considered into the development of rare diseases treatments (focus on， but not limited to gene therapy). The content is as follows \\[3\\]：**\n\n【25】**Study population**\n\n【26】**For the selection of study population， two points should be taken into account： First， potential adverse events and benefits should be identified in advance based on previous preclinical or clinical data. Second， the study population should be representative and have the potential to generate instructive safety and efficacy data \\[3，8\\]. When conducting gene therapy clinical trials for rare diseases， the following general principles should be considered \\[3\\]：**\n\n【27】**①) If the disease is caused by a genetic defect， the sponsor should perform genetic tests for the specific defects in all clinical trial**\n\n【28】**subjects. This information is important to ensure correct diagnosis of the disorder of interest. Since many of the disorders may involve different mutations of a specific gene， safety and effectiveness may be linked to specific genotype in unpredictable ways. Thus， early understanding of such associations may help in planning future clinical trials.**\n\n【29】**(ii) As pre-existing antibody to any component of the GT product may pose a potential risk to patient safety and limit its therapeutic effect， FDA suggested that sponsors may exclude patients with pre-existing antibodies to the product. In such cases， it is strongly suggested that the sponsor should develop a companion diagnostic to detect antibodies to the product.**\n\n【30】**(iii) At the stage of clinical GT trials design， adverse events， the anticipated risk， and potential benefits to subjects should be considered \\[3，8\\]. In addition， subjects with severe or advanced disease who might experience confounding adverse events related to the underlying disease should also be considered.**\n\n【31】**(iv) Since most rare diseases are pediatric diseases or show symptoms in childhood， pediatric studies are a critical part of drug development and need to be considered seriously. FDA also offers additional safeguards for children in clinical investigation. As indicated in 21 CFR 50.51， a clinical investigation should not show a risk greater than minimal risk unless presenting the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects (21 CFR 50.52). If neither condition is satisfied， but the study may yield generalizable knowledge about the disorder or condition， may involve children as set forth in 21 CFR50.53. Note that adequate provisions must be made to obtain the permission of the parents and the assent of the child as per 21 CFR50.55.**\n\n【32】**(v) The risks of most GT products include the possibility of permanent unintended， along with adverse effects due to invasive procedures that may be necessary for product administration. Because of these risks， it is generally not acceptable to enroll normal， healthy volunteers into GT studies. A well-written informed consent document is also essential.**\n\n【33】**Study design**\n\n【34】**For rare diseases drug development，limited number of qualified patients can be enrolled in each phase of clinical studies is the most challenging issue. Insufficient study subjects increases the pressure for more pertinent data (e.g.， adverse events， efficacy outcomes， biomarkers) collected from each patient， which is beneficial for further trials design. As a result， it is suggested that the sponsor should refer to the following general principles for selection of an appropriate study design \\[3\\]：**\n\n【35】**(i) A randomized， concurrent-controlled trial is generally considered the ideal standard for establishing effectiveness and providing treatment-related safety data. Randomization in early stages of development is strongly encouraged when feasible.**\n\n【36】**(ii) Sponsors should consider designing their first-in-human study to be an adequate and well-controlled investigation that has the potential to provide evidence of effectiveness and safety of the test treatment under study in support of regulatory submission and marketing application.**\n\n【37】**(iii) Placebocontrols are suggested to be adopted for interpreting both safety and efficacy results. In a study that has multiple dose-level cohorts，each cohort should consider establishing a placebo group**\n\n【38】**(iv)In case where the performance of the test treatment under study depends upon subjects with different disease stages or severities， sponsors are encouraged to consider stratified randomization based on disease stage/severity.**\n\n【39】**(v) For some gene therapies with different indications (e.g.， a genetic skin disease)， the use of an intra-subject control design(e.g.， a cross-over design such as n-of-1 trial design) may be useful\\[9\\]. Comparisons of local therapeutic effects can be facilitated by the elimination of variability among subjects in inter-subject designs.**\n\n【40】**(vi) A single-arm trial using historical controls， sometimes including an initial observation period， may be considered if there are feasibility issues with conducting a randomized， controlled trial. If this design pattern is used， then knowledge of the natural history of disease is critical， which may provide the basis of a historical control， but only if the control and treatment populations are adequately matched， in terms of demographics， concurrent treatment， disease state， and other relevant factors.**\n\n【41】**(vii) As the study's power to detect treatment-effects diminishes due to small sample size and potential high inter-subject variability， alternative trial designs and statistical technigues that maximize data from a small and potentially heterogeneous group of subjects should be considered. Ideally， an endpoint based on a treatment outcome that virtually never occurs in the natural course of the disease would facilitate the interpretability of small trials.**\n\n【42】**(viii) Adequate measures are suggested to minimize bias. The preferred approach is to use a study design that includes blinding.**\n\n【43】**(ix)SSponsors are also encouragedto identifIyyrrelevant biomarkers early and to leverage all available information from published investigations for the disease of interested (or related diseases). Some biomarkers or endpoints are very closely linked to the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. In this case， changes in such biomarkers could be used during drug development for dose selection， or even as an early demonstration of drug activity.**\n\n【44】**Dose selection**\n\n【45】**Dose selection is crucial in GT drug development forrare diseases. The following principles are from FDA guidance \\[3\\]：**\n\n【46】**(i) Dose selection should be informed by all available sources of clinical information (e.g.， publications， experience with similar products and experience in related patient populations).**\n\n【47】**(iii))Leveraging non-human data obtained in animal models of disease and in vitro data maybe， in some cases， the only wayto estimate a starting effective human dose. Additional dosing information can be obtained from predictive models based on current understanding of in vitro enzyme kinetics，and allometric scaling.**\n\n【48】**(iii)For early-phase studies in subjects under serious conditions， it is better to start with a potentially therapeutic dose.**\n\n【49】**(iv) In practice， some GT products may have an extended duration of activity， so that repeated dosing may not be an acceptable risk until there is a preliminary understanding of the product's toxicity and duration of activity， and a comprehensive assessment of the product's immunogenicity.**\n\n【50】**Safety considerations**\n\n【51】**FDA indicates that the first necessity of designing a gene therapy clinical trial is to ensure the safety of patient subjects， and previous**\n\n【52】**human experience of identical or similar gene therapy products can provide valuable reference. However， if few such experiences exist， it is dangerous to conduct large-scale first-in-human trials. To reduce the potential risk， FDA suggests sponsors stagger administration to consecutively enrolled subjects， followed by staggering between dose cohorts \\[3，8\\].**\n\n【53】**Immunogenicity is another factor that can affect safety. Thus， FDA implies that we should develop an effective test for specific immune reactions and keep paying attention to any immune responses against the proposed gene therapy drug during the whole process of the clinical trial \\[10\\]. Moreover， possible long-term side effects resulted from gene engineering technology has always been contested. One gene therapy product might not expose safety issues until years later. Therefore， a long term follow-up survey for those patients who received the gene therapy is necessary \\[2，3\\].**\n\n【54】**FDA also notes that a complete protocol of gene therapy research should cover stopping rules， which require a forceful pause once any adverse events hope. These stopping criteria are significant to protect subjects from any unanticipated injury or safety threats \\[3\\].**\n\n【55】**Efficacy endpoints**\n\n【56】**An endpoint in a clinical trial is a measurable parameter (usually displays a patient’s physiological state) that could provide substantial evidence showing a clinical meaningful benefit of the drug/product. Selection of the primary efficacy endpoint is relevant to whether a drug can be approved. FDA proposes the following guidelines for appropriate endpoint selection for gene therapy rare diseases clinical trials 3\\]：**\n\n【57】**(i) Sponsors should understand the pathophysiology and natural history ofa disease as fully as possible at the outset of product development. Full understanding of disease pathophysiology is important in selection of endpoints or identifying potential surrogate endpoints which are especially helpful for sponsors who are considering seeking accelerated approval of a GT product.**\n\n【58】**(ii) Sponsors should identify specific aspects of the disease that are meaningful to the patient and might also be affected by the GT product's activity.**\n\n【59】**(iii) Considerable information can be gained by collecting clinical measurements repeatedly over time. Such a longitudinal profile allows the assessments of effect， largely based on within-patient changes， that otherwise could not be studied.**\n\n【60】**Patient experience**\n\n【61】**Since patient experience data may provide important additional information about the clinical benefit of a GT product， FDA encourages sponsors to collect patient experience data during product development， and to submit such data in the marketing application.**\n\n【62】**Statistical/Scientific Considerations**\n\n【63】**In addition to the above important elements to be considered， the following statistical considerations are necessarily implemented during the conduct of gene therapy rare diseases clinical trials.**\n\n【64】**Small sample size**\n\n【65】**In clinical research，power analysis is often performed for sample size calculation. The purpose is to achieve a desired power of correctly detecting a clinically meaningful difference at a pre-specified level of significance if such a difference truly exists. However， this method**\n\n【66】**may not be appropriate for rare disease clinical trials due to limited available patients can be enrolled. To solve this problem， Huang and Chow proposed an innovative method based on a probability monitoring procedure to calculate the sample size in 2019 \\[11\\]. The concept is to select an appropriate sample size for controlling the probability of crossing safety and/or efficacy boundaries at a pre-specified level of significance. For rare disease clinical development， an adaptive probability monitoring procedure may be applied if a multiple-stage adaptive trial design is used. More details regarding the probability monitoring procedure for sample size determination of rare diseases can be found in Huang and Chow \\[11\\].**\n\n【67】**Endpoint selection**\n\n【68】**In experimental treatment trials， the determination of a proper clinical endpoint is essential to project success since the endpoint or outcome provides evidence of whether a clinical benefit exists.A good endpoint should demonstrate both the safety and effectiveness of a proposed treatment with statistical significance and the treatment benefit must be clinically meaningful. In real cases， we sometimes find that there are multiple choices of clinically meaningful endpoints， all of which well measure or characterize the therapeutic effect of interest. Since the study endpoint is important for further decision of the sample size under a desired power， it is important to choose the primary endpoint which can best inform the disease status and measure the treatment effect. To better understand how to choose a primary study endpoint， the concept of therapeutic index was created by Chow and Huang. Each candidate endpoint is assigned a pre-specified weight based on previous observed -values and then apply a linear model to develop the therapeutic index function. More details regarding the development of therapeutic index can be found in Chow and Huang \\[12\\].**\n\n【69】**The use of biomarkers**\n\n【70】**A biomarker is a measurable characteristic which can reflect your physiological changes to a medical treatment (e.g. blood pressure). Since we do not have a full understanding of most rare diseases， using a biomarker as the endpoint might be more appropriate than a standard endpoint such as survival rate. There are several advantages of using biomarkers： (i) it is easily monitored and can be measured frequently during the whole trial， (ii) it is sensitive to minor treatment effect under a small sample size， (iii) it can predict/explore the promise of an investigational drug in early stage， and (iv) it may help accelerate the process of study and approval for the drug. In addition， biomarkers are able to guide adaptive trial designs \\[13\\]. In some cases， the study treatment does not show significant improvement in general population but might be effective in a fraction of people who manifest some similar characteristics. Biomarkers can be utilized to identify the target population. Thus， under the assumption that there is a well-established relationship between a biomarker and clinical outcomes， the use of biomarker in rare disease clinical trials cannot only allow screening for possible responders at enrichment phase， but also provides the opportunity to detect signal of potential safety concerns early and provides supportive evidence of efficacy with a small number of patients available \\[14\\].**\n\n【71】**The Use of RWE for regulatory approval**\n\n【72】**FDA recommends proper use of Real-World Data (RWD) and Real-World Evidence (RWE) as support for regulatory decision making in clinical research. The 21 Century Cures Act， which was enacted back in 2016， turns the attention to the utilization of such data for the purpose of promoting approval of new therapy \\[15\\].**\n\n【73】**For example， advanced electronic tools， mobile devices and other healthcare applications allow people to generate massive amounts of valuable health data， which is an excellent complement to data generated from Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs). Although the real-world evidence is considered as a powerful support for regulatory decision making， the assessment of treatment benefit based on RWE could be biased due to lack of randomization and heterogeneity of RWD. Thus， in real clinical trials， where there are inconsistencies between RWE and substantial evidence， measures are needed to filter those qualified RWD and diminish the variability of RWD from standard substantial data for an accurate evaluation of the therapeutic benefit \\[14\\].**\n\n【74】**Demonstrate not-ineffectiveness**\n\n【75】**A standard statistical test to support the efficacy of the drug is to reject the null hypothesis of ineffectiveness， in turn； we can accept the alternative hypothesis of effectiveness. However， Chow and Huang challenged this interpretation， proposing that rejecting ineffectiveness _implies not-ineffectiveness (or non-inferiority) instead of effectiveness_ (or superiority) \\[16\\]. The concept of“not-ineffectiveness” should include \"inconclusiveness\"and\"effectiveness\". For this reason， Chow and Huang pointed out that effectiveness of the test treatment could be concluded iftwo conditions are met： (i) ineffectiveness is rejected；(ii) the probability of inconclusiveness is negligible. Chow and Huang have therefore developed a groundbreaking two-stage drug discovery trial method for rare diseases. At the first stage， employ a small number (n ) of patients from targeted population， then test for not-ineffectiveness at a pre-specified significance level. Note that ny may be determined by the probability monitoring procedure as mentioned in small sample size section. If the null hypothesis of ineffectiveness is rejected， move to the second stage. To achieve the statistical power (like 80% power)， N subjects are needed. It is suggested to recruit n， patients and borrow N-n2 data from Real-World Data (RWD) to eliminate inconclusiveness. If the test result indicates that the probability of inconclusiveness can be neglected(like<5%)， effectiveness of the studied therapeutic intervention under investigation is claimed \\[16\\].**\n\n【76】**Innovative trial design**\n\n【77】**As we mentioned before， small available sample is the main difficulty to conduct clinical study for rare diseases. Thus， it is impossible to use traditional clinical trial design methods to meet FDA's standards for approval of products for rare diseases. In some cases， we need to adopt some innovative trial designs which could help us obtain substantial evidence of effectiveness and safety of the product with small sample size. These innovative trial designs include， but are not limited to， the n-of-1 trial design， an adaptive trial design， master protocols， and a Bayesian design. The flexible use of combination of these innovative trial designs with the innovative thinking discussed earlier is not only to fix the dilemma of sample available (e.g.， n-of-1 trial design and master protocol) but also to ensure effectively， accurately， and reliably assess the treatment effect and increase the probability of success of the intended clinical trials(e.g.， adaptive trial design in conjunction with Bayesian approach for borrowing real-world data) \\[14\\].**\n\n【78】**Case Study-Approval of Luxturna**\n\n【79】**In this section， we will discuss a case study regarding gene therapy product Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) approved by the FDA on December 184， 2017. Luxturna is a novel gene therapy that was specifically developed for patients with an inherited retinal**\n\n【80】**Table 1： Efficacy results of the phase 3 study at year 1， compared to baseline.**\n\n| **Efficacy Outcomes**  | **LUXTURNAn=21**  | **Control n=10**  | **Difference (LUXTURNA minus Control)**  | **P-value**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **MLMT score change using both eyes， median (min， max)**  | **2(0，4)**  | **0(-1，2)**  | **2**  | **0.001**  |\n| **MLMT score change using the first treated eye， median** **(min，max)**  | **2(0，4)**  | **0(-1，1)**  | **2**  | **0.003**  |\n\n【82】**Source： FDA Statistical and Clinical Reviews**\n\n【83】**disorder resulted from biallelic RPE65 gene mutation. Luxturna is a major medical advance since it is the first gene therapy to be granted approval by FDA that targets on a single gene \\[17\\].**\n\n【84】**Background**\n\n【85】**Biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder often diagnosed in young children. Patients inherit one copy of mutated RPE65 gene from both parents (mutation site may be different). The function of RPE65gene is to make RPE65 protein， an enzyme involving in the visual cycle (converts light into electrical signals) which is important for normal vision. If two copies of RPE65 genes are mutated， the number of RPE65 proteins will rapidly decrease or disappear， resulting in the block of the visual cycle and causing visual impairment. The condition of vision loss will become worse with age， and the patients may even be totally blind in young adulthood. In the United States， almost 1，000 to 2，000 people are affected by eye diseases due to biallelic RPE65 mutation.**\n\n【86】**There was limited effective drug or treatment to cure the biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy prior to Luxturna. A common applied treatment is using the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System， an artificial device that can help patients with blindness caused by outer retinopathy restore a basic vision. This device is first approved in the United States under a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) and is now commercially allowed in many countries. The Argus II System includes external components (a pair of glasses with camera and a portable computer) and internal components (a specific microelectrode implanted into eyes by surgery). The camera on the glasses can capture external images and the computer translates the light perception into electricalstimulation and is received by implanted electrode to activate retinal cells. The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System is proved to be relatively safe and effective； however， the recovery of vision acuity varies in different patients \\[18\\].**\n\n【87】**The mechanism of Luxturna is to transmit a normal copy of the RPE65 gene directly to living retinal cells through a transformed adeno-associated virus as a vector. Thus， RPE65 proteins can be complemented and the visual cycle can continue again.**\n\n【88】**FDA review of clinical safety and efficacy**\n\n【89】**This section discusses the clinical trial program of Luxturna， including _t_ thestudyydesign， important resultsand FDA's recommendations. The Luxturna regulatory approval is based on a clinical phase 1 analysis and a clinical phase 3 studies that established the key safety and efficacy proof for the BLA submission \\[19\\].**\n\n【90】**Phase 1 and phase 3 studies： The phase 1 study was an open-label， dose-escalation protection study in a total of 12 patients with reported retinal dystrophy associated with biallelic RPE65 mutations. Eleven of 12 patients with an injection time of 1.7 to 4.6 years received subretinal Luxturna injection to either eye. One patient got just one eye with a subretinal injection. Additionally， the Phase 1 analysis evaluated three doses and results indicated that no apparent dose**\n\n【91】**Table 2： Magnitude of MLMT score change using both eyes at year 1.**\n\n| **MLMT Score Change**  | **LUXTURNAn=21**  | **Control n=10**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **1**  | **\\-0**  | **3(30%)**  |\n| **0**  | **2(10%)**  | **3(30%)**  |\n| **1**  | **8(38%)**  | **3(30%)**  |\n| **2**  | **5(24%)**  | **1(10%)**  |\n| **3**  | **5(24%)**  | **0**  |\n| **4**  | **1(4%)**  | **0**  |\n\n【93】**Source： FDA Statistical and Clinical Reviews**\n\n【94】**that might affect safety， bioactivity， or preliminary efficacy. The high dose (1.5×10\" vector genome in an injection volume of 0.3 mL) was chosen for the phase 3 study.**\n\n【95】**The Phase 3 study was an open-label， randomized， controlled， cross-over trial. It was developed to test the effectiveness and efficacy of Luxturna sequential subretinal injection into each eye. Patients were randomized to either the Luxturna therapy group or the observational control group in a 2：1 ratio，and were monitored for the primary efficacy evaluation for duration of one year. After one year of study， patients in the control group were crossed over to receive Luxturna. The phase 3 study recruited 31 patients in the United States from two locations. At the stage of baseline evaluation， 21 of the 31participants were randomized to the therapy group with one drop. Ten patients were randomized to the control group with withdrawal of consent of one patient at the screening visit. A crossover study was conducted in the nine patients with one-year observation of Luxturna injection. The mean age was 15 years (4 to 44 years)， including 20(64%) pediatric patients (4 to 17 years) and 11 adult patients. The subretinal injection period ranged from 6 to 18 days for each patient's two eves.**\n\n【96】**Efficacy evaluation： The primary efficacy endpoint in the phase3 study was change in Multi-Luminance Mobility Testing (MLMT) performance from baseline to one vear after Luxturna administration. MLMT assessed the ability of a patient to traverse a course correctly and at a fair speed at various degrees of ambient light. The MLMT was measured at one or more of seven light levels， ranging from 400lux (corresponding to a brightly lit office) to 1 lux (corresponding to a moonless summer night)，using both eyes andeach eye independently. A score code ranging from 0 to 6 was assigned to each light level. A higher score implied that a patient was able to pass the test at a lower light level. Patients who did not pass MLMT in the brightest environment (400 lux) were given a score of -1. Each patient's MLMT was recorded and tested by independent， blinded graders. The MLMT score was the lowest light level at which the patient successfully passed the MLMT. Another parameter defined in this study is the MLMT score change from baseline to the end of study. An increase of the MLMT score suggested an improvement of eyesight. Additional efficacy endpoints included Full-Field Light Sensitivity Threshold(FST) and Visual Acuity (VA). The phase 1 and phase 3 regulatory review analyses are summarized below.**\n\n【97】**The results of the primary endpoint (MLMT score change) from**\n\n【98】**Figure 1： MLMT time-course over two years (using both eyes).**\n\n| **X180 X365** **Study Duration (Days)** **Figure 1： MLMT time-course over two years (using both eyes).** **Table 3： Magnitude of MLMT score change using individual eyes at year 1 (ITT).**  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Change Score**  | **First-Treated Eye (N=21)**  | **Control(N=10)**  | **Second-Treated Eye(N=21)**  | **Control (N=10)**  |\n| **\\-1**  | **0**  | **1(10%)**  | **0**  | **2(20%)**  |\n| **0**  | **4(19%)**  | **6(60%)**  | **2(10%)**  | **5(50%)**  |\n| **1**  | **2(10%)**  | **3(30%)**  | **4(19%)**  | **3(30%)**  |\n| **2**  | **8(38%)**  | **门**  | **8(38%)**  | **0**  |\n| **3**  | **6(28%)**  | **0**  | **5(23%)**  | **0**  |\n| **4**  | **1(5%)**  | **0**  | **1(5%)**  | **门**  |\n| **5**  | **0**  | **门**  | **1(5%)**  | **0**  |\n\n【100】**Source： FDA Statistical and Clinical Reviews**\n\n【101】**baseline to year one are summarized in Table 1. A median MLMT score change of two and zero were observed in the Luxturna treatment group and control group， respectively， independent of the use of both eyes or the first-treated eye. An MLMT score change oftwo or greater is considered a clinically meaningful benefit for functional vision.**\n\n【102】**Table 2 and Table 3 illustrate the number and percentage of patients with different magnitudes of MLMT score change using both eyes and individual eyes， respectively， at year 1. If we consider both eyes， eleven patients (11/21，52%) in the Luxturna treatment group had an MLMT score change of two or greater， while only one patient(1/10，10%) in the control group had an MLMT score change of two(Table 2)， (Figure 1).**\n\n【103】**On the other hand， if we consider the first-treated eye and second-treated eye separately， fifteen patients (15/21，71%) in the Luxturna treatment group had an MLMT score change of two or greater， while no patient in the control group had a score change of 2 or greater(Table 3).**\n\n【104】**Safety assessment： Twenty-seven (27/41，66%) ofthe 41 patients(12 from phase 1 and 29 from phase 3， totally 81 eyes) receiving Luxturna had ocular adverse reactions in 46 injected eyes (46/81，57%). The most common adverse reactions (incidence 2 5%) were conjunctival hyperemia， cataracts， increased intraocular pressure， retinal tears， dellen， macular hole， eye inflammation， macular breaks， subretinal deposits， eye irritation， eye pain， and maculopathies (Table4). Whether these ocular adverse symptoms are associated with injection of Luxturna is not clear. However， most of these adverse**\n\n【105】**events were temporary and controllable. There were no deaths in the clinical studies. There were two serious adverse reactions， including (i) endophthalmitis (infection inside of the eye) with a series of subsequent complications， and (ii) loss of vision due to fovea thinning as a result of the subretinal injection. Systemic adverse events included hyperglycemia， nausea， vomiting， and leukocytosis. These systemic events were likely caused by systemic corticosteroid use and reactions to anesthesia.**\n\n【106】**As noted by the FDA， Luxturna subretinal injection should be given only to patients who have viable retinal cells as determined by the treating physician (s). Treatment with Luxturna must be done separately in each eye on separate days， with at least six days between surgical procedures. Patients should be treated with a short course of oral prednisone to limit the potential immune reaction.**\n\n【107】**Summary： The safety and efficacy of Luxturna were well established in a clinical trial with 41 patients aged between 4 and44. All participants had confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations. The primary efficacy endpoint of Luxturna was based on the phase 3 study with 31 participants by measuring the change from baseline to one year in a subject's ability to navigate an obstacle course at various light levels. The treatment group demonstrated significant improvements in their ability to complete the obstacle course at low light levels as compared to the control group. The most common adverse reactions， such as eye redness， cataract， can be mitigated by medical care.**\n\n【108】**Advisory committee recommendations**\n\n【109】**The Cellular， Tissue， and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee**\n\n【110】**Table 4： Ocular Adverse Reactions Following Treatment with Luxturna (N=41).**\n\n| **Adverse Reaction**  | **Patients n=41**  | **Treated Eyes n=81**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Any ocular adverse reaction**  | **27 (66%)**  | **46 (57%)**  |\n| **Conjunctival hyperemia**  | **9(22%)**  | **9(11%)**  |\n| **Cataract**  | **8(20%)**  | **15(19%)**  |\n| **Increased intraocular pressure**  | **6(15%)**  | **8(10%)**  |\n| **Retinal tear**  | **4(10%)**  | **4(5%)**  |\n| **Dellen (thining of the corneal stroma)**  | **3(7%)**  | **3(4%)**  |\n| **Macular hole**  | **3(7%)**  | **3(4%)**  |\n| **Subretinal deposits\\***  | **3(7%)**  | **3(4%)**  |\n| **Eye inflammation**  | **2(5%)**  | **4(5%)**  |\n| **Eye irritation**  | **2(5%)**  | **2(2%)**  |\n| **Eye pain**  | **2(5%)**  | **2(2%)**  |\n| **Maculopathy (wrinkling on the surface of the macula)**  | **2(5%)**  | **3(4%)**  |\n| **Foveal thinning and loss of foveal function**  | **1(2%)**  | **2(2%)**  |\n| **Endophthalmitis (infection inside of the eye)**  | **1(2%)**  | **1(1%)**  |\n| **Fovea dehiscence (separation of the retinal layers in the center of the macula)**  | **1(2%)**  | **1(1%)**  |\n| **Retinal hemorrhage**  | **1(2%)**  | **1(1%)**  |\n\n【112】Note： \\*Transient appearance of a ring-like deposit at the retinal injection site 1-6 days after injection without symptoms Source： Madified from the applicant's BLA submission\n\n【113】**(CTGTAC) evaluated the safety and effectiveness of Luxturna， giving several feedbacks. First， a 2-score increase of MLMT is clinical meaningful. Second， the potential risks of Luxturna are acceptable. Third， Luxturna may not work until 8 to 12 months of age because the retina has not been fully developed. Fourth， it should be considered if the efficacy of Luxturna declines over time. Consequently， the CTGTAC voted 16(Yes) to 0(No) in favor the approval of Luxturna.**\n\n【114】**Concluding Remarks**\n\n【115】**In this paper， a case study regarding Luxturna which is a gene therapy drug intended treating a rare disease of an inherited form of vision loss that may result in blindness. The FDA granted Luxturna(i) priority review， (ii) breakthrough therapy and (iii) orphan drug designations to assist the sponsor in Luxturna development. As discussed in Section 4， FDA's recommendation for regulatory approval of Luxturna was made based on a phase 1 clinical study and a phase 3 clinical study.**\n\n【116】**Although the CTGTAC voted for approval of Luxturna， several questions and concerns remain. These questions， which are likely to occur due to small sample size， include， but are not limited to (i) the treatment effect may have been contaminated by some covariates and/or interaction/confounding factors， (ii) no scientific/clinical or statistical justification for the selection endpoint and/or clinically meaningful difference， (iii) it is not clear that the study design can provide an accurate and reliable assessment of the treatment effect， and (iv) statistical methods for assessment of treatment may not be adequate (e.g.， shift analysis before and after treatment was not done). In addition， one of the major concerns is probably that whether the performance of Luxturna based on limited number of patients is not by chance alone and hence is reproducibility. Based on a quick assessment， the reproducibility probability was calculated based on the observed responses and the variability associated with the responses of the 31 subjects. The result indicates that there is a less than 60% probability of reproducibility if the study is conducted under similar experimental conditions in the future.**\n\n【117】**Thus， it is suggested that statistical considerations as described in Section 3 and some innovative thinking regarding study design and analysis should be taken into consideration when conducting rare diseases clinical trials.**\n\n【118】**Author Contributions**\n\n【119】**SCC conceived the idea and designed the work； WZ and CZ drafted the manuscript.

Presently neuroimaging， blood and CSF biomarkers are expensive and invasive to perform and are considered impractical for research purpose. The retinal presents a readily accessible tissue for monitoring the brain and could potentially be used in combination with or as a substitute for current ADand other neurodegenerative disease biomarkers. Data on retinal involvement in AD and neurodegenerative diseases have been controversial and inconsistent. So， we are reporting a case of choroideremia with neuropsychiatric presentations and complications.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Choroideremia； Neuropsychiatry； Retina； Vision**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Choroideremia is a x-linked recessive， progressive， degenerative disorder of retina and choroid that mainly affects males. It is caused by loss of function mutations in the choroideremia gene resulting in decreased Rab Escort Protein-1(REP-1) expression which leads to degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium， photoreceptors， and choroid. The first symptom of this condition is usually an impairment of night vision (night blindness)， which can occur in early childhood. A progressive narrowing of the field of vision (tunnel vision) follows， as well as a decrease in the ability to see details (visual acuity) \\[1\\]. These vision problems are due to an ongoing loss of cells (atrophy) in the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (retina) and a nearby network of blood vessels (the choroid). The vision impairment in Choroideremia worsens over time， but the progression varies among affected individuals \\[2\\]. Visual impairments due to Choroideremia are associated with emotional， functional， and economic burden. Prevalence is 1 in 50，000 to 100，000and accounts 4% of all blindness \\[3\\]. There have been some reports of choroideremia patients with neurological complications. But there is scarcity of literature on neuropsychiatric symptomatology and choroideremia \\[4\\].**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 65-year-old gentleman， right-handed， educated up to post graduation， non-hypertensive， non-diabetic and a known case of choroideremia which was diagnosed with genetic and ophthalmic investigations， with complains of Increased irritability for 2 years， dizziness and frequent falls， for1.5 years and increased for 1.5 months， tremulousness of right side of hands at rest for 1.5 years， forgetfulness for 6 months increased for 1.5 months. On further enquiry patient reports that he is also having bi-occipital dull aching headache for 1.5 months which gets partially relieved on he turns his head upwards. So， most time of day he would keep his head upward position. He is dependent on family members for daily activities for and unable to handle his finance，laundry， medications for1.5 months. History of frequent head injury due to fall. In premorbid personality he had obsessive compulsive personality traits. On general examination he was conscious， oriented. Neurological examination suggestive of cogwheel rigidity in right upper limb，power， reflexes in all limbs normal. Pill rolling tremors in right hand at rest. For walking he needed assistance and had shuffling gait with stopped posture. Bilateral pupils reacting to light but only perception of light was present. On Mental Status Examination- recent memory impaired， with Mini Mental Status Examination score22/28， copying and writing he could not do due to vision impairment (Table 1).**\n\n【18】**Treatment**\n\n【19】**Considering irritability patient started on tablet Quetiapine 25 mg at night and as per needed.

Then peripheral field loss occurs over the next few decades. The disease presents with patchy areas of depigmentation which spreads from periphery to central part of choroid retinal laver with a characteristic salt and pepper mottling \\[5，6\\]. In the involved areas， there is diffuse atrophy of the choriocapillaries and retinal pigmented epithelium. The central visual acuity is preserved until the patient's 50s， and retinal blood vessels are not affected. The macular area remains intact until late in the course of disease， with preserved visual acuity. There are case reports of choroideremia with clinically undiagnosed psychiatric syndromes. Some case has presented with isolated symptoms of nyctalopia， progressive visual painlessness， painless and foreign body sensation \\[7-11\\]. In this case report subiect had unreported visual symptoms till the age of 30. He started symptoms of difficult vision in night at his 30’s but he was diagnosed with the condition from ophthalmologist by genetic testing and with optical coherence tomography. Although neuropsychological symptoms are difficult to diagnose and under reported and this case report shows the rarest presentation of choroideremia \\[7-9\\]. As the disease is x-linked his son has got a risk of developing the condition so the genetic counseling was also conducted. The absolute diagnosis of choroideremia is based on the identification of clinical features combined with additional imaging exams which is done in all the reported cases \\[10-12\\].**\n\n【27】**Prognosis**\n\n【28】**As this a genetic condition with unsatisfactory prognosis symptomss canbDecontrolled withhperiodiccophthalmologic examination especially when central vision is affected， and cystoid macular edema is suspected. The neuropsychiatric sequel can be successfully controlled with early diagnosis and preventive measures.**\n\n【29】**Conclusion**\n\n【30】**Choroideremia is a genetic retinal disease which is rare and causes blindness mainly in middle-aged men. We are yet to know how the biochemical defect that causes the retinal-specific disease and if it has any hidden effects on the rest of the body especially the brain. This case report throws light into the unusual neuropsychiatric symptoms in an established case of chloridemia.**\n\n【31】**References**\n\n【32】1\\. Ohba N.

Urgent diagnosis and treatment is required. In cases without history of trauma， rare causes like coagulation defects， dural vascular malformations， craniofacial tumors and intracranial infections should be investigated. With this case our aim was to report a rare case of pediatric intracranial epidural hematoma as a result of sinusitis.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Epidural； Hematoma； Pansinusitis**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**The first sinusitis related Intracranial Epidural Hematoma (IEH) was reported by Kelly in 1968and the most recent was a review article in 2014 by Aviner et al. \\[1，2\\]. As IEH generally occurs due to trauma， rarely coagulation defects， dural vascular malformations， craniofacial tumors and intracranial infections may be the cause \\[3，4\\]. Intracranial complications as a result of sinusitis are known； however，IEH is a very rare condition \\[5\\]. In this case report we described a pediatric patient presenting with fever and headache due to IEH.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A fifteen year old male patient presented with rhinorrhea， fever， headache and swelling of the forehead. No history of trauma or bleeding disorders was present. There was no other neurological finding other than neck rigidity. The laboratory findings were as follows： C-Reactive Protein (CRP)51.4 mg/L (reference range 0 to 6)， WBC： 11.88 K/mm’(reference range 4.5 to 11)， Mon： 13.27%(reference range 3% to 8%)， Baso： 0.79% (reference range 0% to 3%). Coagulation panel， liver and kidney function tests， and electrolytes were all normal. On Computerized Axial Tomography Scan of the Brain (CT)； on the left frontal area a highly attenuated epidural collection with 27 mm thickness， and millimetric air densities compatible with hemorrhage were detected.Maxillary， ethmoidal and frontal sinusitis were also present (Figures la-1c). On the Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain(MRI)； a hyperdense left frontal epidural hemorrhagic collection with milimetrica air densities， accompanied by infection， thickenning of the neighbouring dura and contrast enhancement， maxillary， ethmoidal and frontal sinusitis (Pansinusitis) was detected (Figure 2). The patients were operated， and the hematoma discharged with a burr-hole. The specimens obtained from the hematoma were evaluated on direct microscopy； showing 95% of polymorphonuclear leucocytes，4% oflymphocytes. No microorganisms were grown on culture.**\n\n【19】**In the postoperative period the patient was admitted to the pediatric department for antibiotic treatment without any neurological deficits. After a 14 days course of empirical Ceftriaxone， Metronidazole and Vancomycin treatment CRP was <3 mg/L，WBC9.15K/mm'and the patient was discharged in a good general condition. In one month follow-up the patient’s cranial CT findings were compatible with postoperative findings (Figure 3).**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**In the neurosurgical practice IEH is a condition that needs fast diagnosis and emergency surgery. On contrary the possibility of morbidity and mortality is very high. It is known to occur often due to trauma. Otherwise， rarely the causes are bleeding disorders， dural vascular malformation， neighbouring infections and tumors \\[3，4\\].**\n\n【22】**Sinusitis， maylead to intracranial complications such as meningitis， subdural abscess/empyema， epidural abscess/empyema， cerebral abscess， deep and superficial vein thromboses \\[5-8\\]. However IEH is a rare condition caused by sinusitis.**\n\n【23】**In previous cases of sinusitis and intracranial epidural hematomas various microorganisms(Hemophylus influenzae， Staphylococcus aureus， Streptococcus anginosus ve milleri， Pseudomonas**\n\n【24】Figure 1： 1a-Preoperative CT： Maxillary， ethmoidal and frontal sinusitis were also present. 1b-There is rupturing frontal sinus posterior wall. 1c-On the left frontal area a highly attenuated epidural collection with 27 mm thickness， and milimetric air densities compatible with hemorrhage were detected.\n\n【25】**Figure 2： Preoparetive MRI： A hyperdense left frontal epidural hemorrhagic collection with milimetrical air densities， accompanied by infection，thickenning of the neighbouring dura and contrast enhancement was detected.**\n\n【26】**cepacia) have been grown in the cultures from the specimens obtained from the hematoma during surgery \\[2\\]. This could also be one of the theories proving that IEH is caused by sinusitis through neighbouring.**\n\n【27】**The mechanism of sinusitis that leads to IEH has not yet been clearly described. It was tried to be explained with the process of retrograde advancement of inflammation through the diploic vascular canals reaching the intracranial space and rupturing the vessel via inflammation \\[5，8\\].**\n\n【28】**It can be envisioned that sinusitis erodes the posterior wall of the frontal sinus， and chronic polymorphonuclear infiltration and irritation causes the vessels in the epidural space to rupture. In our case it is in our opinion that the inflammation reached the epidural area eroding the vessels and causing IEH. The free air densities in the intracranial space supports the theory that sinusitis may have eroded the posterior wall of the frontal sinus. As a matter of fact， in Aviner et al. \\[2\\] review， 13 patients were included of which 9 were children； thus the thin bone structure at this age group makes us believe that inflammation leads to sinus wall erosion more easily \\[2\\]. This also supports our theory.**\n\n【29】**The patient history should be integrated with radiological findings. Headache， fever and neurological findings； hemorrhage and**\n\n【30】**Figure 3： In one month fallow-up the patients cranial CT findings were compatible with postoperative findings.**\n\n【31】**air densities on CT and MRI， contrast enhancement of the paranasal sinuses and the dura， bone destruction or osteomyelitis are all findings that would help make the diagnosis \\[2\\].**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**High fever， headache and change in mental state particularly in childhood should suggest of sinusitis and IEH as a complication. Emergency surgery after a fast diagnosis is of ominous significance. On contrary besides the morbidity and mortality； more difficult to treat and fatal complications such as epidural/subdural empyema， cerebral abscess may develop.**\n\n【34】**References**\n\n【35】1\\.

The MRI reports an 8 mm nodular formation in contact with the humeral artery and vein between the middle and distal third of the right arm that undergoes enhancement after administration of venous contrast in close contact with branching of the radial artery.

He hadn’t suffered any accident before. Clinically， there was a palpable tumor without pulse. An ultrasound from another center reported a possible schwannoma or a peripheral sheaths tumor. The first diagnostic imaging came from an MRI that reports an 8 mm nodular formation in contact with the brachial artery and vein between the middle and distal third of the right arm that undergoes enhancement after administration of venous contrast in close contact with branching of the radial artery. A saccular aneurysmal dilation of the brachial artery cannot be ruled out. With these results， a new ultrasound with a high-frequencylinear probe was performed. It shows a hypoechoic nodular lesion with well-defined edges， measuring 8.5 mmx5.5mmx13mm in size， in contact with the posterior wall of the brachial artery in which it imprints and generates slight compression， as well as with slight contact with the posterior part of the median nerve. In surgery it was observed a pedunculated lesion from the brachial artery， in principle compatible with a pseudoaneurysm which compromised the integrity of the vascular lumen， so a bypass was performed with a basilic branch graft (Figure 1). The resection piece was sent to pathology， but not the extension of the margins made before the bypass. The anatomopathological result showed a highly vascularized tumor proliferation and hemorrhagic suffusions made up of epithelioid cells that suggest the differential diagnosis between epithelioid hemangioendothelioma，pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma or epithelioid angiosarcoma among other vascular tumors (Figure 2). When in doubt about having tumor margins， a new MRI of the entire upper limb was performed to rule out focality and residual macroscopiclesion. Although normal results， we decided to widen the margins and a new bypass with the ipsilateral saphenous vein (Figure 3). The diagnosis of the piece described a residual focus oftumor proliferation of 1 mm with free borders as well as practically total occlusion of the arteriallumen. In molecular studies CD34， CK， ERG and FOSB were ++++ (Figures**\n\n【18】**Figure 1： Intra-operative photography of the second intervention shows the first bypass in the brachial artery with the branch of the basilic vein (A). Ta its right is the median nerve (B) and to its left is the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve (C).**\n\n【19】**4-6). The presence of EGFL7-FOSB fusion gene was demonstrated by Archer’s PLEX fusion NGS panel. The definitive diagnosis was epithelioid hemangioma. In the one-year follow-up， there was no**\n\n【20】**local recurrence and the bypass was functional.**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**Epithelioid hemangioma is a benign vascular neoplasm composed ofwell-formed blood vessels lined by plump， epithelioid (histiocytoid) endothelial cells， with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and a variable eosinophilic infiltrate. As many as half of the cases show recurrent gene fusions in the FOS and FOSBS genes. Cutaneous and soft tissue lesions are most commonly located in the head and neck region， especially the forehead， preauricular region， and scalp， followed by the distal extremities and trunk. The penis is uncommonly located involved. Visceral occurrences are exceedingly rare \\[1\\]. Some arise in large vessels \\[2，3\\]. Epithelioid hemangioma occurs over a wide age range， with a peak incidence in the fourth decade of life and no sex predilection. The etiology is unknown. Superficial epithelioid hemangiomas are usually 0.5 cm to 0.2 cm in size， only rarely exceeding 5 cm. Most have a nonspecific nodular appearance. On MRI imaging intravascular presentation of epithelioid hemangioma is always in the form of an arterial aneurysm \\[4\\]. Yu-Ching Lin et al. consider that TWIST MR angiography (a non-invasive time-resolved3-dimensional MR angiography technique， which can yield dynamic angiographic images from early arterial to late venous phase in high temporal and spatial resolution， comparable to conventional catheter angiography) \\[5\\]， is beneficial in the evaluation of vascular lesions\\[5\\] as assisted pathologists to differentiate epithelioid hemangioma from Masson's hemangioma and Kimura disease (lesions with similar histologic features). Furthermore， TWIST MR angiography also clearly delineated the vascular anatomic relationship of the lesion， which is beneficial for pre-operative planning \\[6\\]. Typically exhibits a proliferation ofwell-formed small blood vessels lined by plump and epithelioid endothelial cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and enlarged round nuclei. The tumor is typically well-demarcated and has a distinctive lobulated growth at low power. Moreover， it shows increased maturation of the vascular lumina at the periphery of the lesion. The stromal component is often edematous， and the tumor may show hemorrhagic changes within the solid component. A subset of cases may display centrifugal growth around a central small artery and evenly complete intravascular growth. So the essential diagnostic criteria is a lobular architecture with vasoformation； lining endothelial cells are epithelioid， with eosinophilic cytoplasm and enlarged round nuclei； loose hemorrhagic stroma， often with eosinophilia. Demonstration of FOS/FOSBrearrangements or expressions may be helpful in selected cases. There are various treatment methods for epithelioid hemangioma that includes steroid**\n\n【23】**Figure 3： A.

Surgical excision is considered the optimal treatment choice \\[7\\]. The prognosis is as many as one-third of patients experience local recurrence， related to incomplete excision or multicentricity. Most**\n\n【28】**of the recurrences are indolent and can be cured by re-excision， although very rare recurrences can be locally aggressive. Rare lymph node metastasis may occur. To date， no patients have developed distant metastases.**\n\n【29】**Conclusion**\n\n【30】**Although rare， vascular tumors should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a mass is associated with an artery. In our experience， the definitive diagnosis of epithelioid hemangioma is pathological， since imaging is inconclusive. It is of the utmost importance to perform a complete resection of the tumor， analyzing all the samples to ensure that free borders are obtained， given the risk oftumor recurrence and malignancy.**\n\n【31】**References**\n\n【32】1\\.

She was hospitalized after a suicide attempt and released few days after. In the two following months she was readmitted three times for other suicide attempts. Each time， emergency staff had the same defeated reaction： “Eventually， she’s going to succeed in killing herself.\" This attitude is more common than we would think among caregivers. But if caregivers themselves do not hope for better， who will? It was vital for her that someone believed she would live. So when I met her， I started to hope instead of her， in spite of her. After one year of intensive psychotherapy，hope was restored and Mrs L. was able to start over.

The clinical significance of nasalseptalpneumatization is still unknown. There are multiple reports ofnasalseptalpneumatization as an anatomical variation. But mucocele formation in these cells is a very rare finding. We have seer less than 10 reported cases in literature and here we present another patient with nasal obstruction and headache with this diagnosis.**\n\n【14】**Case Report： A27 year old man referred us complaining of nasal obstruction and frontal headache years after septoplasty. A nasal septal mass was seen in exam and imaging. The cystic mass treated through endonasal approach.**\n\n【15】**Conclusion： Generally nasal obstruction， pain and septal mass are presenting symptoms and signs. An expansible fluid filled mass is seen in bony nasal septum in imaging. Transnasal endoscopic marsupialization is the treatment of choice.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Nasal septum； Pneumatization； Mucocele； Marsupialization**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Mucoceles of sinonasal tract are relatively common findings \\[1\\]. Histologically they are benign lesions， but their gradual expansion can cause local destruction and injury of surrounding structures\\[2-4\\]. Presentation depends on anatomical site of origin and nearby structures. Clinically proptosis and displacement of the orbit are the most common presentations \\[5\\]. Nasal obstruction is a rare symptom and commonly is seen in maxillary sinus mucoceles \\[6\\]. A large mucocele produces a classic radiographic appearance of an enlarged， distorted sinus with a large bony defect representing a breakthrough into the adjacent structures. Not all mucoceles are classic， and there are many with subtle bone erosion. Bone remodeling， gradual pressure atrophy and erosion of the bone by the enlarging soft-tissue mass of mucocele， produces the expansile appearance on CT scanning \\[7\\]. Erosion oflamina papyracea， orbital rim and skull base are common CT findings in huge mucoceles\\[5\\]. Mucoceles are typically seen on MRI as hypointense or less frequently as hyperintense images on Tl-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted MR scans. Because of variable protein content within long-standing mucoceles， signal intensity can be highly variable on both Tl-weighted and T2-weighted MR sequences \\[7\\].**\n\n【19】**Fronto-ethmoidal mucoceles are the most common.Maxillary and sphenoid mucoceles is seen less commonly \\[2，3\\]. Mucocele of other areas of sino-nasal tract is very rare and recently mucocele of the nasal septum has been reported and we found less than 10 cases in literature.**\n\n【20】**Case Presentation**\n\n【21】**Our patient was a 27-year-old man complaining of nasal obstruction and frontal headache since four years ago. He had a history of previous septoplasty and turbinoplasty procedures 5years ago because of septal nasal deviation and hypertrophy of inferior turbinates. After a period of improvement postsurgically， nasal obstruction gradually has returned. Past medical history was insignificant. Physical examination revealed slight septal deviation and septal-middle turbinate synechia. There was bulging in dorsal septum bilaterally. During endoscopic examination， a submucosal mass more prominent in left side was detected in anterosuperior septum， which had firm and bony consistency.**\n\n【22】**Paranasal sinus CT scan in axial and coronal views showed an expansile cystic mass with homogenous hypodense appearance lying in between bony septum and inferior skull base， below the nasal bones and eroding left nasal bone. The dimensions were 25 mm x 15 mmx 10 mm. Paranasal sinuses were clear. There was no crista galli pneumatization and we did not see any bony defect or erosion in other areas of skull base. In T1 and T2 weighted images， the mass was**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： CT without contrast in axial (a) and coronal (b) views. There is an expansile mass in upper part of nasal septum with remodeling and bony defect in left side.**\n\n【24】**Figure 2： MRI of the patient： axialT1W (a)， axial T2W (b)， axial with contrast(C) and sagittal T2W (d) views of the lesion.**\n\n【25】**moderately hypersignal and hyposignal respectively and there was no enhancement after intravenous injection except than peripheral area. In MR examination， we did not find intracranial communication(Figures 1-3).**\n\n【26】**Based on clinical and especially imaging findings we could rule out some important differential diagnoses such as neoplasm， polyp， fungal infections or intracranial connection and we went for surgical exploration for correction of airway and establishment of final diagnosis.**\n\n【27】**Endoscopic approach was chosen for surgery. Under general anesthesia， on the left side of the septum， mucosa was incised on the antero-inferior border of the mass and a posteriorly based mucosal flap was elevated. The bone of the anterosuperior part of the septum**\n\n【28】**Figure 4： Postoperative view of mucocele cavity. The space， which previously was occupied by the mass， is now clear and pneumatized， connecting with the left side of the nasal cavity.**\n\n【29】**was so thin； it fractured with slight freer elevator pressure. A white thick fluid expelled which was sent for culture. The cavity was large and covered by mucosa with no septationor solid mass while inspecting by 70-degree endoscope. Left nasal bone seemed eroded and by pressing the left nasal bone externally， the movement could be detected internally. The cavity was irrigated. Left bony wall of cavity was removed completely. After trimming septal mucosal flap， the cavity marsupialized to the nasal space. Histologic examination revealed respiratory mucosa with chronic inflammatory infiltration. Culture result was negative. Retrospectively， our patient was a case of perpendicular plate mucocele in anterosuperior part of nose. Our patient's complaints were improved after surgery. CT scan showed the cavity connecting to nasal space completely， fully pneumatized and no signs of recurrence， 6 months postoperatively and the previously eroded bone seemed to begin ossification (Figure 4). After 2 years， he had no symptoms and mucocele cavity was connected freely to the nasal space in endoscopic examination.**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n【31】**Pneumatization of paranasal sinuses has variable course； it may extend sinus borders into pterygoid plates， crista galli， uncinate process， middle turbinate， nasal bony septum and greater wing of sphenoid \\[8，9\\]. The Pneumatization has two stages. During primary pneumatization stage， ethmoid cells invade frontal， maxillary and ethmoid bones. In secondary pneumatization， these epithelialized structures extend through adjacent bony structures， which happen mainly in postnatal growth \\[10\\].**\n\n【32】**In recent years， because of extensive use of CT examination of sinonasal system and increasing familiarity with anatomical details of this area， interest in evaluation of clinical significance of extra-sinus pneumatization has increased. In this background， there is**\n\n【33】**Figure 3： Views of coronal MRl in T1W (a)， T2W (b) images and after lV contrast (C). There is no increased enhancement of lesion after contrast injection. Peripheral enhancement is evident (image c).**\n\n【34】**little information about nasal septalpneumatization and its clinical significance in English references. In most articles， pneumatization of nasal septum has considered as an anatomical variant in sinus and nose anatomy. This finding has a different prevalence from 0.5%to 18%. Lang stated that septalpneumatization is not common and it may occur through frontal sinus and is accompanied by crista gallipneumatization. Krmpotic-Nemanic has reported septateseptal sinus. He showed that sometimes sphenoid could project into septum. Schwartz detected septal sinus in 2% of cases in his radiologic study \\[11\\]. Due to Chao the incidence of septalpneumatization in patients with sinusitis is 2% \\[8\\]， while Lei reported it to be 18% and it may affect anterior or posterior part of perpendicular plate \\[9\\]. In contrast to pneumatization of nasal septum， septal mucocele is a very rare finding. We found only 7 reported cases in literature search and present patient is the eighth. Gall and Witterick presented a case report of bilateral nasal obstruction and midline nasal masswhomhad underwent surgery 20 years to 30 years ago and they marsupialized it endoscopically as a septal mucocele in 2002 \\[12\\]. This was the first report of septal mucocele. The authors believed that mucocele formation was traumatic in origin due to sequestration of mucosa in septum after first surgery. Herman and Jahnke reported a case of left facial pain and a septal mass \\[13\\]. In 2004 Lei et al.， reported a 32years old patient with progressive septal mass，underwent endoscopic surgery \\[9\\]. They related mucocele formation to obstructed pneumatization of nasal septum. Aynali et al. reported a giant septal mucocele in a patient with rhinoplasty history \\[14\\]. Safavi Naini reported a case of septal mucocele without history of surgery \\[15\\]. Hong et al. reported a case of septal mucocele treated endoscopicall\\[16\\]. Huang et al. evaluated the incidence of nasal septal cellule in CT， which was 19 out of 173. In all of these cases the cellule was in the ethmoid bone locating in upper part in 8 and in middle part of septum in the rest. Septal mucocele was present just in one \\[17\\]. Considering epithelial coverage of the cavity， it is probable that its mucosa is involved in sinonasal pathologies especially inflammatory processes. Theoretically epithelium of this cavity can be a source for benign or malignant tumors.**\n\n【35】**Mucocele is an epithelial-lined， mucus-containing sac completely filling sinus cavity and is capable of expansion. Frontal and fronto-ethmoid areas are the most common places， which is probably due to complexity of drainage in these regions. Other less common sites are： sphenoid and maxillary sinuses. Particular comorbidities were reported with mucocele： chronic rhinosinusitis， sinonasal trauma， polyposis， cystic fibrosis， granulomatous diseases and osteoma \\[18\\]. In one study 38.6% of mucocele cases had previous history of sinus surgery \\[19\\]. Patients with history of sinus surgery have increased susceptibility for mucocele formation.**\n\n【36】**In some cases， mucocele has been reported in association with tumors of sino-nasal tract， so in every case of mucocele， tumor should be ruled out. MRI with IV contrast is useful in this way and is recommended for diagnosis of solid components \\[3\\].**\n\n【37】**Our patient had complained of nasal obstruction since long time ago. So if we imagine that septalpneumatization is an evolutionary process， obstruction of the ostium of this cell may be due to prolonged nasal mucosal inflammation or iatrogenic， secondary to surgical procedure. These two factors are among important causes of mucocele formation. Since the appearance of mucocele is due to obstruction of the orifice accompanied by inflammation， there may be a time lag between effect of these factors and beginning of**\n\n【38】**symptoms \\[18\\]. We think septal mucocele is related to obstruction of septal pneumatization because of trauma or in an inflammatory background and consequently enlarges as an expansile mass in the bone in contrast to nasal septal cyst that is a rare complication of septoplasty because of entrapment of nasal mucosa in submucosal space \\[20\\]. It seems that mucosal sequestration in nasal septum is not an acceptable explanation for evolving mucocele in a bony cavity as in our case. Septal mucocele must be differentiated from some midline nasal cystic masses such encephalocele， meningocele， epidermoid， dermoid， septal abscess and finally nasal septal cyst. Classically in T1 weighted MR， mucocele presents as a hyposignal mass which is hypersignal in T2 weighted MR. Though as our case， these views may change according to water and protein content of the mucocele(increasing signal in T1 if protein is dominant) \\[21\\]. Van Tassel and colleagues reported two basic MRI pattern of mucocele in their study：either moderate to marked hypointensity in T1 and T2 weighted images or moderate to marked signal hyperintensity on T1 and T2weighted images that correlate with inspissated or hydrated content respectively.**\n\n【39】**The most efficacious way of treatment is creating a large communication between mucocele cavity and nasal space as in other mucoceles \\[19\\]. It is probable that some part of bony erosion could be reversible as in our case， which postoperative CT shows ossification in left nasal bone.**\n\n【40】**Conclusion**\n\n【41】**Nasal septal mucocele is a rarely reported entity. We found 7cases in literature and it seems that our case is the eighth reported case. Obstructive symptoms and pain are common presentations. It should be considered in differential diagnosis of midline nasal masses. Endoscopic marsupialization is the treatment of choice.**\n\n【42】**References**\n\n【43】**1\\.

The intestinal obstruction in a virgin abdomen may be a clue for diagnosis \\[2\\].**\n\n【23】**Computerized tomography may be helpful by certain pointing findings or by specific findings for intersigmoid hernia like U- or C-shaped cluster of small bowel posterolateral to the sigmoid colon. Early imaging and surgical intervention will improve the survival \\[3\\].**\n\n【24】**Intersigmoid hernia is rarely reported. This is a case ofintersigmoid hernia in a 70 year old person presenting with acute small bowel obstruction. This condition is rarely diagnosed preoperatively even though CT may show signs to suggest internal hernia.**\n\n【25】**Case Presentation**\n\n【26】**A 70 year-old female presented to surgical casualty with abdominal pain， vomiting and obstipation. There was no significant history except for past CAD and on Ecosprin.**\n\n【27】**General examination was unremarkable. Abdominal examination revealed a tense distended abdomen with marked tenderness in the left iliac fossa. There was an increased bowel sound and Clinical diagnosis of small bowel obstruction was entertained.**\n\n【28】**Conservative management was initiated with IV fluids and Nasogastric decompression. All blood investigations were normal and no abnormality was detected on X-ray chest. Plain X-ray abdomen had features of small bowel obstruction. After failed Conservative management patient underwent a midline laparotomy. It was found that a loop of small bowel was found to be with doubtful viability within the intersigmoid fossa.**\n\n【29】**Figure 1： Loop entering into the intersigmoid fossa.

Caleb Hillier Parry and Moritiz Heinrich Romberg were the first to describe the case in 1825 and 1846 \\[1\\]. The incidence is about three cases per 100，000 people per year and occurs more commonly among females \\[1\\]. The disease manifests between the age of 2and 20 years with a slow and progressive course \\[2\\]. The pathogenesis of this disease is unknown\\[3\\]； nevertheless， a variety of theories have been proposed， including immunological， traumatic， infectious， endocrinological， neurological， and genetic causes \\[1，4\\]. Epilepsy is the most frequent abnormality associated with Parry-Romberg syndrome.**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**A 9-year-old male child presented to the outpatient department with his mother for evaluation of seizures. He was the firstborn child， delivered by vaginal route to non-consanguineous parents. He was apparently well and developmentally normal till the age of 6 years， when he started developing discoloration (hyperpigmentation) on the left side of the face， which became progressive over the year. Parents did not seek medical consultation for the same， and by the age of 8 years， parents also noticed a gradual change in his facial features， noticeably a slow shrinking of the left side. At eight and half years of age， he had a seizure episode of a generalized tonic-clonic type， lasting for about 30 min. At first， he was treated with Ayurvedic medications， but since the seizure episodes recurred mother brought him to our center for further evaluation and management. On examination， the child was moderately built and nourished. We observed an atrophic lesion on the left side of the face， extending from the trichion down to the chin with a depth of 2 mm (Figure1). Madarosis was noted on the left side. A zone of alopecia was found in the left frontal region(Figure 2). Blood workup， including complete blood count， electrolytes， and calcium， was found to be normal. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a well-defined FLAIR and T2W hyperintense oval area in the caudate nucleus and thelentiform nucleus on the left side (Figure3)， which also appeared hyperintense on the T1W images. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed diffuse changes in the temporal region， suggestive of seizures. He was started on Sodium valproate and has been on regular follow-up thereafter. The dosage required optimization for control of seizure attacks.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**Parry Romberg syndrome is a rare and sporadic condition reported to be more common in females \\[5，6\\]. The onset of the disease is in the first two decades， with a progressive phase lasting for 2 to 20 years. This is followed by a stable phase which usually culminates in resolution \\[7\\]. Patients distinctly experience atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues， and as the disease progresses， they could develop atrophy of the underlying muscular， cartilaginous， bony， and**\n\n【26】**Figure 1： Atrophic lesion on the left side of the face， extending from the trichion (red arrow) down to the chin (white arrow). Madarosis can be seen on the left side (black arrow).**\n\n【27】**Figure 2： The same child with alopecia noted on the left frontal region.**\n\n【28】**glandular structures \\[8\\]. The etiology of Parry-Romberg syndrome is still undetermined； however， the most accepted hypothesis is the autoimmune etiology \\[9\\]. Diagnosis of Parry Romberg syndrome is based on patient history and clinical examination and is supported by imaging and histopathological studies \\[10，11\\]. This child was normal till six years of age， when the clinical symptoms began to develop. The anatomic changes of Parry-Romberg syndrome impact the growth potential of hard tissue， preventing an increase in size during active growth periods. The dominant clinical feature noted is atrophy of the facial tissues， usually adipose tissue \\[12\\]. Seldom， skin， and other connective tissues， including bone， could be affected. The severity of the atrophy can range from barely noticeable asymmetry to severe disfigurement \\[13\\]. The present case showed a clear line of demarcation from the forehead down to the chin on the left side. Around 10% to 35% of patients show ocular involvement； the most encountered manifestation is enophthalmos characterized by sunken**\n\n【29】**eyes due to loss of adipose tissue around the orbit \\[12\\]. We did not observe any orbital changes in our case. Around 50% of affected individuals show dental changes \\[9\\]， though our child did not have any findings. While the most frequent neurological manifestation of Parry-Romberg syndrome is epilepsy (60.5%)， focal seizures ipsilateral to brain calcifications are also common (50%). Secondary epilepsy， seen in about 30% of the cases， is very difficult to treat. Headache (44%)， behavioral disturbances， and trigeminal neuralgia(8.5%) may also be present \\[1，14，15\\]. Our child had seizure episodes which were consistent with the EEG findings. He also had behavioral disturbances. MRI showed hyperintensity areas of the white matter， similar to the description in several previous case studies \\[14，16-19\\]. Parry-Romberg syndrome has a significant biopsychosocial impact on the patient’s life due to functional and aesthetic limitations \\[11\\]. There have been proposals to restore facial asymmetry through surgical approaches. Treatment of mild and moderate cases is performed with silicone fillers， collagen， porous polyethylene implants， and autologous fat grafting. The grafting of cartilage， bones， fat， and skincare treatment are reserved for more severe cases \\[20，21\\]. The main aim ofpsychological treatment is the social reintegration of these patients \\[21\\].**\n\n【30】**Conclusion**\n\n【31】**Parry-Romberg syndrome is an uncommon condition， which manifests as atrophy of one side of the face. In most cases， Parry-Romberg syndrome appears to occur randomly from unknown etiologies. The pathophysiology of the syndrome remains largely unknown. We present a case of Parry-Romberg syndrome with classical facial features and magnetic resonance imaging findings.**\n\n【32】**References**\n\n【33】**1\\. Vix J， Mathis S， Lacoste M.

On admission， the patient was in moderate-to-severe condition， conscious， verbally responsive， with marked respiratory effort and saturation of about 75% without oxygen therapy， whereas after passive oxygen therapy through a mask with an oxygen reservoir and oxygen flow of 15 l/min， the saturation level maintained at 92% to 94%. A CT pulmonary angiogram showed an approximate involvement of70% of the pulmonary parenchyma， with ground-glass opacities typical of COVID-19， pulmonary embolism was excluded. In laboratory tests： Acute phase protein CRP-228 mg/1 \\[N<5 mg/l\\]， procalcitonin PCT 0.27 ng/ml \\[N<0.5 ng/ml\\]，leukocytosis 8.12×1000/ul \\[N 4-10×1000/ul\\]. As a result of the applied treatment， on the 3 day of hospitalization stabilization was achieved， followed by a gradual improvement of the general condition. A follow-up pulmonary computed tomography was performed， which showed an involvement of about 40% of the pulmonary parenchyma. The patient continued to require passive oxygen therapy， with a lower oxygen demand. However， due to persistent fever episodes， mainly in the evening， and elevated inflammatory parameters， the treatment was empirically supplemented with ceftriaxone administered intravenously at a dosage of 2 g every 24 h. A decrease in inflammatory parameters and improvement of arterial blood gas parameters were observed. On hospitalization day 14， the general condition deteriorated again， dyspnea at rest worsened and the patient required intensified passive oxygen therapy. Pulmonary computed tomography was performed again， which revealed involvement of approx. 60% of the pulmonary parenchyma. After analysis of the CT scans， the different nature of the radiological changes was noted. Apart from visible areas of consolidation of the pulmonary parenchyma， which could indicate either the evolution of previously described ground-glass lesions or bacterial super infection (ceftriaxone antibiotic therapy in progress)-interstitial inflammatory lesions were described， mainly within the lower lobe of the right lung. The radiological picture indicated a suspicion of pneumonia caused by atypical bacteria. Importantly， this type of lesion could be seen in lesser intensity already on the first computed tomography scan， but due to the extent of the lesions typical of COVID-19， it was largely masked and not so obvious. Only after the treatment and resolution of some of the radiological changes caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection， changes that could represent atypical pneumonia were better visible \\[1\\]. Material for serological tests was collected blood for determination ofantibodies against Mycoplasma preumoniae，Chlamydophila preumoniae and CMV， and urine for determination of Legionella spp. antigen. The treatment was empirically supplemented with clarithromycin administered intravenously at a dosage of 500 mg every 12 h. A clear correlation was observed between the inclusion of macrolide and a visible improvement in the patient's general condition. The results ofantibodies determination for C. pneumoniae IgG and IgM negative， against CMV-IgM negative， IgG positive， no Legionella spp. antigen was present in urine. Antibodies to M. pneumoniae IgM negative， IgG positive. Another M. pneumoniae antibody test was scheduled in about 14 days， but the patient was discharged from the hospital at his own request in good general condition.**\n\n【16】**Despite a negative titer of IgM antibodies directed against M. preumoniae， in this case we should consider the possibility of co-infection by this microorganism \\[2，3\\]. The first serological test for atypical infection was performed on day 19 after the first test for SARS-CoV-2 infection and on day 26 after the first symptoms of respiratory tract infection. In this interval， IgM antibody titre may already be negative and the analysis of the dynamics of IgG antibody accumulation is of diagnostic valie.**\n\n【17】**The diagnosis ofatypical pneumonia in a patient with viral pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2**\n\n【18】**infection can be challenging for the treating physician. In the era of COVID-19 pandemic and positive results of molecular tests， the physician's attention may focus on the diagnostically confirmed etiological agent ofpneumonia-SARS-CoV-2\\[4\\]. A careful analysis of the patient's condition in the course of the disease and consideration of another etiological agent on the basis of comparative diagnostic tests (CT) is very important. The ground-glass radiological changes on computed tomography， which are the characteristic image of COVID-19， often mask a parallel infection caused by atypical bacteria. The localization of lung lesions in atypical pneumonia may be considered as lesions corresponding to a viral infection. In addition， the clinical picture of both diseases partly overlaps， which only makes the correct diagnosis more difficult \\[1，4\\].**\n\n【19】**References**\n\n【20】1\\.

However， its side effects have seldom been mentioned. Hereby we report an impressive case of post-operative hemorrhage， which were probably caused by miss-chosen and mal-positioned CSD system. Meanwhile， invasion of vertebral venous plexus should also be taken into consideration when unexpected hemorrhage happened. After adjusting the type and position of the CSD system， this patient healed without any complication.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Closed suction drain； Post-operative hemorrhage； Cervical surgery**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Closed Suction Drain (CSD)， a medical drainage system consisting of an internal drain tube that connected to a pre-vacuumed container or grenade-shaped bulb， is commonly used as a direct and effective method to achieve evacuation of liquids or debris from cavities or wounds in surgical procedures \\[1\\]. Generally，CSD has been a routine procedure in orthopedics practices \\[1\\]. However， seldom studies have recognized the possible hazardous consequence bought by this technique. Recently， our institution confronted a case of unexpected post-operative iatrogenic hemorrhage caused by CSD system.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**A 50-year old female patient was admitted to our institution with a diagnosis of atlantoaxial dislocation and paraplegia on basis of conventional physical examination， CT scan， and MRI(Figure 1). She accepted posterior cervical surgery soon after. A posterior reduction of atlantoaxial dislocation and internal fixation with rod-and-screw system was then performed as described before \\[2\\] (Figure 2A， 2B). Both sides of vertebral venous plexus were invaded when placing the C1 lateral mass screw， and led to profuse bleeding， which was stopped by pressing and stuffing with gel-foam. Prior to closure， any existing bleeding was stanched with bipolar cautery， and the wound was irrigated copiously with saline to clean away all the debris， blood and devitalized tissue. A pre vacuumed closed wound drainage system (Medinorm， Germany) was applied to avoid problems caused by potential bleeding and no vacuum suction was used before closure. The wound was then conventionally closed by intradermal suture after obtaining a dry wound. To our surprise， a profuse and rapid blood flow into the drainage container occurred right after the tube was connected to the 600 ml pre-vacuumed container and filled up to more than 200 ml in 60 sec. The vacuum suction was terminated immediately and incision was re-opened to the surgical field. However， no active bleeding could be found. The tip of drainage tube was found right point to the left side of invaded venous plexus. The drainage tube was then repositioned to keep away from both sides of venous plexus and gel-foam area， and incision was closed as above. A French JP drain was used instead. Finally， no more sustained blood loss occurred. The drainage tube was removed 48 h after surgery and the incision healed without any problem. No more complaint during the 10 months postoperatively.**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**As described by Dougherty and Simmons， CSD mainly shows its values in reducing wound hematoma and post-operative edema， which would help to decrease the morbidity of infection and external contamination \\[3\\]. Nevertheless， side effects， such as multiple intracranial hemorrhages due to the over-drainage of cerebrospinal fluid \\[4\\]， increased total blood loss and higher homologous blood transfusion rate \\[1\\]， should also be given enough significance during daily applications. Hence， the application of CSD could be a potential risk for post-operative blood loss. In our case，**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： The AP open-mouth-projection of the odontoid peg showed atlantoaxial instability proved by CT scan with 3D reconstruction (A and B). The dynamic X-ray demonstrated an obvious instability of atlantoaxial joint(C and D).**\n\n【24】**Figure 2： After surgery， the atlantoaxial was stabilized (A and B). The 3D reconstruction of CT scanning showed that the screw probably invaded the both sides of vertebral venous plexus just beneath the lateral mass of C1 (C and D).**\n\n【25】**we figured out that mal-positioned drainage tube and miss-chosen aspiration system should be the reason of such unexpected post-operative hemorrhage. The tip of tube was found right pointed to the invaded venous plexus， so was unsuitable for focal hemostasis and likely triggered direct suction. Moreover， the stuffed gel-foam， together with drainage tube， might work as a Vacuum Suction Drainage (VSD) system and then creates a vacuum phenomenon established through the drainage tube lying in it. Such specific device was associated with elimination oflocal tamponade effect and resulted in a continuous aspiration of blood from venous plexus. According to the Boyle's law \\[5\\]， the 600 ml container provides higher and more persistent aspiration power comparing to the JP drain. Overwhelmed aspiration power might enlarge side effects of CSD， for instance， eliminated tamponade effect and dislocated local tissues induced by suction， and lead to terrible hemorrhage consequently. Hematoma is one of the main complications after orthopedic surgeries. The incidence of symptomatic post-operative spinal epidural hematoma， which requires intervention， has been reported to range from 0.1% to**\n\n【26】**3%\\[6\\]. Post-operative hematoma can be resulted from either patient-or surgical-related factors. Among those， the injury of venous plexus is a predisposing element. With its thin and fragile wall， venous plexus is vulnerable even to blunt traction. In addition， lack of valve deteriorates the local hemostasis and leads to disastrous hemorrhage eventually. The reported number of incidence and mortality of pre-sacral venous plexus injury were 9.4% and 4.3%， respectively \\[7，8\\]. Various hemostasis techniques have been introduced to clinical practice， including package of glue (gel-foam， fibril collagen， surgical and bone wax)， thumbtacks and coagulation. However， unexpected blood loss in certain structures still takes places \\[9\\]. The invasion of vertebral venous plexus is another important factor contributing to post-operative hemorrhage in our current case (Figure 2C， 2D). The vertebral venous plexus， accompanying with deep cervical veins and anterior internal vertebral venous plexus， is a composition of vertebral venous system. Its initial portion starts from the atlanto-occipital space and connects with the anterior internal vertebral venous plexus in the manner of an intervertebral vein \\[10\\]. To our knowledge， neither clinical research nor case report could be found to convincingly clarify the occurrence or treatment of post-operative hemorrhage caused by this venous plexus system. This may result in deficient understanding to many spine surgeons and inevitably leads to unconscious damage as well as inadequate treatment. Summary， we present a new view of the merits of CSD system， which is not only for the prevention of post-operative hematoma，but also accompanying by accidental stimulation of iatrogenic hemorrhage. Mal-positioned drainage tube and miss-chosen aspiration system are two significant considerations. Besides， to master the local anatomy also should be kept in mind for orthopedic surgeon. We believe that improvements of above will benefit both orthopedic surgeon and patients.**\n\n【27】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【28】**The study was sponsored by Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (LQ15H060001， to Zi-Ang Hu) and National Natural Science Fund of China (81501912， to Zi-Ang Hu).

Invasive mole， also known as chorioadenoma detrusens， is one such entity which involves trophoblastic tissues， penetrating deep into the myometrium， and at times， involving peritoneum， adjacent parametrium or vaginal vault. They are locally invasive but generally lack tendency to develop wide spread metastasis. Classic presentation of invasive mole is history of amenorrhea， bleeding per vaginum and pain abdomen. However， it may present as massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage， following uterine perforation. We report a rare case of chorioadenoma detrusens， presenting as massive hemoperitoneum in a nulliparous woman， in which， a challenging decision of conserving the uterus was taken in low resource settings.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**A 25-years-old nulliparous female was referred from a small public hospital to the casualty department of a tertiary care hospital， as a case of ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The patient had history of dilatation and curettage done four months back in view of missed abortion at eight weeks gestation， in a private hospital. No histopathology had been sent. Patient remained asymptomatic for one month and developed bleeding per vaginum thereafter. She assumed it as menstruation， though pattern of bleeding was different from normal. After five days of bleeding， she developed acute pain in abdomen for which she consulted the public hospital. There， her ultrasound showed normal size uterus with endometrial thickness of 12 mm. Bilateral ovaries were normal，however， increased vascularity in bilateral adnexa and mild amount of heterogenous collection in pouch of Douglas was noted. The BhCG levels came out to be 2，97，198 IU. With these reports， patient was referred to our hospital.**\n\n【21】**On admission， patient was conscious but had signs of hypovolumic shock (blood pressure of80/60 mmHg， pulse rate of 130 bpm to 140 bpm). She had severe pallor. Abdominal examination revealed a distended and tense abdomen with tenderness in lower abdomen. Vaginal examination showed minimal bleeding， closed external OS and fullness in fornices. Uterine size and bilateral adnexa could not be assessed due to tense abdomen. Paracentesis showed non-clotting blood. Patient was taken for laparotomy immediately.Operative findings showed hemoperitoneum of 1000cc， uterus enlarged to 10-12 weeks size with a rent of 2 cm ×1 cm on fundus with torrential bleeding through it and grape-like vesicles popping from it. Two more thin uterine blebs (2 cm x1 and 4 cm**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： Uterus enlarged to 10 to 12 week's size with a rent of 2 cm x1cm on fundus with torrential bleeding through it， held by Green Armytage Forceps.**\n\n【23】Figure 2： Grape-like vesicles popping from the rent in uterus.\n\n【24】**x4 cm)， bluish in color， representing thinned out myometrium， were seen on the anterior and right lateral surface of uterus on the verge of rupture (Figure 1-3). Bilateral fallopian tubes were normal but bilateral ovaries enlarged with theca-lutein cysts. A clinical diagnosis of invasive mole or choriocarcinoma was made. Keeping in mind， the nulliparous status of patient， uterine conservation seemed to be important. However， risk of rupture of the blebs was a prime concern. Moreover， there was a possibility of inability to achieve hemostasis. The patient's husband was explained about the gravity of situation and requirement of relaparotomy if she bleeds again. Hemostatic sutures were applied on the rent and bleeding was controlled. The protruding grapelike tissues was sent for histopathologic examination. Intraperitoneal drain was inserted due to risk of subsequent rupture of the blebs leading to hemoperitoneum. As ultrasound revealed no mass in uterine cavity， no evacuation was attempted.**\n\n【25】**Patient remained stable in postoperative period with her stitches and drain removed on 84 postoperative day. Her histopathology showed hyperplastic trophoblasts， generalized cystic degeneration of chorionic villi and presence of molar villi within myometrium. Her BhCG had fallen to 56，781 IU/ml by 8th post operative day. No metastasis found in her chest X-ray and USG whole abdomen. Oncology consultation was done. After reviewing all reports and prognostic scoring (=7) patient was put on multiple agent chemotherapy (EMACO) on outpatient basis by oncology department； patient discharged with proper contraceptive and follow up advice. She received eight cycles of EMACO. Weekly BhCG follow up was done and it was found to be 1.5 IU/ml after 20 weeks follow LP.**\n\n【26】**Discussion**\n\n【27】**Invasive moles comprise of 15% cases of gestational trophoblastic**\n\n【28】**Figure 3： Two more thin uterine blebs (2 cm x1 cm and 4 cm x4 cm)， bluish in colour， representing thinned out myometrium， were seen on the anterior and right lateral surface of uterus on the verge of rupture (Shown by arrow).**\n\n【29】**neoplasia. They almost exclusively originate from partial or complete mole. Indicative signs of disease are persistent unexplained metrorrhagia or abnormal ultrasound appearance (large size uterus for gestational age and theca-lutein cyst >6 ml)， non-normalization of serum βhCG at 6 months after evacuation of hydatiform mole or massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage \\[1\\]. These are definitely diagnosed on the basis of myometrial invasion on histology.**\n\n【30】**Management of invasive mole basically depends on two factors-prognostic scoring of GTN and parity of patient. Low risk GTN includes both non-metastatic and metastatic GTN with prognostic score <7. In patients with stage one disease， the selection oftreatment primarily depends on whether patient desires to retain fertility. If patient does not want to preserve fertility hysterectomy with adjuvant single agent chemotherapy is performed as primary treatment. But in patients wanting to preserve fertility， management solely rests on chemotherapy.**\n\n【31】**Mitani et al. \\[2\\] proposed partial resection of uterus for young women if invasive mole presents with hemoperitoneum. Five women have been reportedly treated this way and four of them delivered healthy babies with cesarean section. Local uterine resection together with bilateral internal iliac artery ligation to combine hemostasis with preservation of fertility has been reported by Goldstein et al.\\[3\\]. Atala et al. \\[4\\] reported a case of chorioadenoma detrusens with uterine rupture where trophoblastic tissue invaded broad ligament and right ureter \\[4\\]. Hysterectomy followed by chemotherapy was done although it could not save the patient. In our case， the nulliparous status of patient along with point source of bleeding which could be easily controlled by hemostatic sutures deferred us from hysterectomy. Nonetheless there was further risk of uterine perforation through those thinned out blebs but we undertook that risk and left an intraperitoneal drain to watch for any further episode of hemoperitoneum. Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE) is an alternative and has been reported by Shen et al. \\[5\\] to successfully control internal hemorrhage caused by invasive trophoblastic disease. But UAE was not an option for us， as the facility is not available in our setting. If available， preoperative or immediate postoperative UAE could have been an option in our patient， as it would have alleviated the risk of further hemorrhage to an extent. In patients with stage one disease who desire to retain fertility chemotherapy is preferred option with excellent remission rates. Though a case has been reported by Sunesh et al.\\[6\\] where local uterine wedge resection following uterine evacuation without any chemotherapy cured the patient.**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**nulliparous patient and hysterectomy should only be opted as last resort. Conservative approach should be considered.**\n\n【34】**References**\n\n【35】**1\\. Mackenzie F， Mathers A， Kennedy J. Invasive hydatidiform mole presenting as an acute primary haemoperitoneum.

All patients were initially given behavioral and pharmacological products for their insomnia (e.g. iron supplementation， antihistamines， immediate-release melatonin) with no or partial success and subsequently prescribed PedPRM. Following PedPRM dose optimization， all patients attained acceptable sleep maintenance (longest sleep episode >6 h)， initiation (sleep onset latency <30 min) and duration (>8 h at age 3 to 5 and >7 h at age 5 to 17 years). Significant positive effects on daytime behavior and parent satisfaction were noted in all cases.**\n\n【19】**Thus， real life evidence supports PedPRM clinical trial outcomes in which PedPRMis effective and safe strategy for managing insomnia in pediatric patients with ASD or SMS.**\n\n【20】**Keywords： Melatonin； Pediatric prolonged release sleep； Insomnia； Autism spectrum disorder**\n\n【21】**Introduction**\n\n【22】**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex， pervasive， multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder (DSM-5) \\[1\\]. Its core features are persistent deficits in social interaction and communication and restricted， repetitive patterns of behavior or interests. Co-occurring mental health or psychiatric conditions such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and sleep disorders， particularly insomnia， are highly prevalent in autism， impairing quality of life of children and their families \\[2\\]. Children with ASD sleep less than acceptable Total Sleep Time (TST) for their age according to the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recommendations \\[3，4\\]. Other difficulties include Sleep Onset Latencies (SOL) of over 30 min， less than 6 h of uninterrupted sleep(Longest Sleep Episode LSE) and early morning awakenings \\[5\\]. Co-occurring sleep problems in children with ASD have been shown to predict more severe autistic core symptomatology， later development of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms in younger children and somatic complaints in older children， irritability， aggressive behavior， regression， stereotypic behavior and anxiety， poor cognition (memory， attention， overall IQ) as well as performance and delayed language acquisition \\[6-11\\]. Specifically LSE shows promise as being responsive to change， and appears to be correlated with changes in the child's behaviors and parent’s quality of life \\[11，12\\]. Additional reports link chronic sleep disturbance in children with ASD with increased**\n\n【23】**risk of physical health problems， including changes in cardiovascular， immune， endocrine and nervous system function， as well as poorer overall health-related quality of life \\[13\\]. Both parents and children perceive insomnia to be one of the most challenging health effects of autism and generally regard improved sleep as one of the most important benefits sought when considering treatment options for autism \\[14\\]. Thus， identification and appropriate treatment of sleep problems in children with ASD may subsequently improve their development and the quality oflife of both the child and family \\[5\\].**\n\n【24】**As a general tenet of pediatric practice， sleep hygiene measures and behavioral therapy are recommended first-line approaches to insomnia \\[15\\]. However， the response rate in children with ASD to these first line therapeutic approaches is just about 25% \\[16\\]. Until recently， there was no approved drug for insomnia in children and various medications that were used“off label” have limited evidence and no long term data to support their efficacy and safety in treating insomnia， particularly in children with ASD \\[15\\]. Melatonin is the neurohormone produced by the pineal gland during nocturnal periods to properly time circadian sleep-wake rhythms and enhance sleepiness \\[17\\]. Exogenous melatonin (mostly immediate release formulations (IR melatonin) available as food supplements in some countries， or as pharmaceutically compounded preparations， is effective mainly for sleep onset problems in children with ASD\\[18\\]， but evidence-based data are needed to support clinical recommendations regarding their quality， effective doses， duration and safety of long-term treatment \\[19\\]. Pediatric appropriate formulation of Prolonged-Release Melatonin (PedPRM) available commercially as Slenyto' (Neurim Pharmaceuticals Ltd) is the first drug approved by the EU-EMA and other regulatory agencies for the treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents with ASD or Smith Magenis Syndrome (SMS). PedPRM (3 mm diameter odorless and taste-free film-coated mini tablet available as a prescription medicine at 1 mg and 5 mg dose strengths) can be easily swallowed by young children and circumvents the fast clearance of the hormone by releasing the hormone in the gut over an extended period of time\\[20，21\\]. Clinical trials of PedPRM in children and adolescents with ASD or SMS (age 2 to 17 years) demonstrated improvements in TST， LSE and SOL， and subsequently in child's externalizing behaviors， caregiver’s quality of life and satisfaction of the child’s sleep \\[22-241. Somnolence and headaches were twice as common in PedPRM treated children compared to placebo. Fatigue， agitation， cough， and dyspnea were less common but more frequently reported in the PedPRM-treated group， whereas mood swings and nightmares were more commonly reported in placebo-treated children \\[22\\]. During the 2 year follow-up period \\[25\\] the most frequent treatment-related adverse events associated with once daily PedPRM doses (2 mg to 10mg p.o.) intake were fatigue (6.3%)， somnolence (6.3%)， and mood swings (4.2%) with no evidence of effect on height， BMI or pubertal development. There were no withdrawal effects following long-term use and no safety concerns on concomitant therapy with stimulants. For treatment optimization the starting dose is 2 mg once-daily， which is escalated to 5 mg and then 10 mg/day， independent of the child's age or weight， if the predefined treatment success criteria (LSE>6 h， SOL <30 min and TST acceptable for their age， 10 h to 13 h for age 3 to 5 years ， 9 h to 11 h for 6 to 13 years and 8 h to 10 h for teenagers 14 to 17 years and no less than 8 h at age 3 to 5 and 7hat age 5 to 17 years) are not met \\[5\\].**\n\n【25】Randomized clinical trials are essential to demonstrate drug efficacy and safety in a defined target population as well as gaining\n\n【26】**regulatory marketing approval. Following the release of the new medicinal product as an approved medication， it is then essential to consider its benefits in clinical practice， taking into account the patient's perceptionand functioning， as well as the family situation. In this brief report， we present a case series of 6 children and adolescents with ASD treated with several drugs for insomnia， including PedPRM， demonstrating the decision-making process involved in the choice of drug， formulation and dose effects on child’s sleep and behavior as well as family satisfaction (Table 1).**\n\n【27】**Case Series**\n\n【28】**Case 1**\n\n【29】**C1 is a 5.5-year-old female diagnosed with ASD (at age 20months) secondary to Phelan McDermid syndrome (22q13 deletion)， with moderate intellectual impairment， and comorbid ADHD. Her main clinical manifestations include deficits in reciprocal social interaction (although functional language is present)， repetitive play， motor stereotypes， and severe hyperactivity. She has suffered since infancy from severe difficulty falling asleep (60 min to 90min) and maintaining sleep (LSE~1.5 h)， frequent awakenings during the night， and short sleep duration (TST~7 h) with early morning awakenings. Polysomnography recording (PSG) ruled out sleep disorders other than insomnia. C1 would be put to bed， following a good evening routine， between 19h30-20h30， fall asleep only with parental presence around 21h30 and experience five to six awakenings per night， 10 min to 60 min each (first awakening at around 23h00， for 1 h would end with her joining her parents in their bed). Her final awakening occurred at 6h00-6h30 and was almost always accompanied by crying. She did not sleep at all during the day， even during long car journeys. C1’s impaired sleep affected her daytime behavior， with severe hyperactivity， inattention， temper tantrums， auto- and hetero-aggressive behavior (she bit herself on the back of her hand)， and frequent crying. Parents described severe repercussions on the family's well-being including physical exhaustion， daytime sleepiness， and anger management issues for the father and mild depression for her mother. Former treatment for C1’s sleep problems included sleep hygiene， behavioral therapy， iron supplementation and Vitamin D and finally Immediate-Release(IR) melatonin (1 mg) given at bedtime， and at two additional time points over the night (latest at 3h00)， for 3 consecutive nights that had a paradoxical effect as C1 barely slept at all over the three nights(Table 1).**\n\n【30】**PedPRM treatment was then initiated at 2 mg， daily， at 19h00， for a bedtime between 19h30-20h00. After 2 weeks with PedPRM 2 mg C1 fell asleep quicker (SOL 30 min to 45 min)； nocturnal awakenings decreased to 3 on average， with a consecutive increase in LSE to about2.5 h， and a morning awakening at 6h30. Due to a positive but sub-optimal response， the dose was increased to 5 mg daily resulting in further shortening of SOL to 15 min to 30 min， with one single， short duration， awakening during the night， and a morning awakening at 6h30-7h00. LSE increased to around 7 h and TST increased to10.5 h (Table 1). Sleep was now considered within the norm for her age \\[3\\]. Moreover， parents described C1 to be calmer during sleep and waking up without crying. Finally， her daytime behavior also improved significantly at school (she was able to sit for 30 min during group activities) and at home (less impulsive with her siblings， less crying， fewer tantrums， decrease in hyperactivity and no auto- or hetero- aggressive behaviors).

His main clinical manifestations include no interest in social interaction， repetitive play and motor stereotypes. C2 needs global therapeutic support， weekly speech therapy， parent-child therapies， and psychomotor therapy. He also experiences severe allergies (e.g.， eczema， food allergies). The families are immigrants， under challenging living conditions and both parents are unemployed. C2’s sleeping problems were present almost since birth and occurred every night. His night routine included a bottle of formula milk at 21h00， going to bed with his mother at 22h00 and falling asleep between 23h30-24h00 (SOL of 90 min to 120 min). C2had very agitated sleep (LSE<2h)， with 3 to 4long awakenings (lasting5 min to 40 min each)， during which he could drink between 250 mlto400 ml milk. He finally woke up at 7h30(TST~6.5h)，had no daytime naps in his bed， however， could fall asleep for short periods of no more than 20 min in his stroller. During the day C2 suffered from severe hyperactivity， significant crying， and frustration intolerance with several tantrums a day， in addition to social withdrawal and a constant sad facial expression. The severe sleep problems caused the parents to be very tired during the day， adding to the stress related to the recent ASD diagnosis and migration process.**\n\n【35】**C2's former insomnia treatment included iron supplementation，3 drops nightly of alimemazine 4% for 3 weeks with limited treatment response and then 6 ml nightly of hydroxyzine syrup 2 mg/ml for2 months， which was also stopped due to lack of efficacy. C2 was prescribed 2 mg Immediate-Release (IR) melatonin， given at 21h00. Sleep onset latency shortened significantly to 10 min to 45 min， TST improved to ~7.5 h but he continued to wake up 3 to 4 times during the night (5 min to 20 min each)， LSE still was 2.5 h and his final awakening remained at 7h00. His parents reported positive effects on daytime behavior， such as being calmer， imitating and vocalizing more and crying less.**\n\n【36】**As treatment goals were not achieved， C2 was switched to 2mg PedPRM， given 30 min-1 h before bedtime. After 2 weeks of**\n\n【37】**treatment， parents reported improvements of all parameters： SOL further reduced to 10 min to 35 min， only up to two short awakening during the night (5 min duration)， LSE improved to more than 6 h on some of the nights， final awakening in the morning was delayed by 1hour to 8h00， and TST improved to 9.75 h at night. Moreover， significant positive effects on daytime behavior were noted-C2 was calmer during the day， his speech progressed and he cried much less. His parents were very satisfied with his sleep. C2 remained on the 2 mg PedPRM treatment for 6 months， and then switched to 5 mg PedPRM， due to a period of more nocturnal awakenings， probably related to his allergies and not the treatment itself. On 5mg the benefits described above were maintained and sleep is now considered normal for his age.**\n\n【38】**Case 3**\n\n【39】**C3 is a 8 years and 3 months old high functioning male diagnosed with ASD (at age 7 years) with comorbid dyspraxia and dysgraphia. His main clinical manifestations include deficits in reciprocal social interaction and restrictive interests. He attends a mainstream school with a support teacher. His sleep problems were present since birth but worsened at age 4 years. He would go to bed at 20h00， following a regular bedtime routine， and fall asleep around 22h30. During his attempts to fall asleep， he would be very anxious， leaving his room frequently， and needing parents to calm him down. During the night， parents suspected that he woke up frequently， although he didn’t disturb them. On school days， he woke up at 7h30， so the TST was approximately 8.5 h and LSE most probably less than 6 h. During the day C3 was tired， suffering from irritability and attention difficulties at school. Additionally， he was reported to have emotional difficulties， unstable mood，and anxiety. His baseline objective sleep assessments by overnight polysomnography indicated slight upper airway resistance， TST of 9.2 h and a long nocturnal awakening for about one hour. An actigraphy recording over 2-weeks indicated delayed sleep onset (at 1h00) and agitated sleep， with wake bouts of 30 min to90 min each at least three times a week.**\n\n【40】**C3 started treatment with 2 mg IR-melatonin， given at bedtime， for three months. Although with IR-melatonin SOL decreased to approximately 15 min to 30 min， the duration and frequency of the**\n\n【41】**nocturnal awakenings increased， LSE decreased and there were no significant effects on daytime behavior. He was then switched to 2 mg Circadin treatment，1 hour before bedtime for a year. SOL remained stable (15 min to 30 min)， and nocturnal awakenings decreased but still present irregularly. Additionally， he had more stable mood， and was less emotional. He then started 2 mg PedPRM and within1 month the nocturnal awakenings disappeared， resulting in a significant improvement in LSE from less than 6 h a night to 10.75 h(equal to TST)，SOL was 15 min to 20 min，and TST was 10.75h，2h longer than at baseline. Sleep was now considered within the normal range for his age \\[3\\]. In addition， waking up for school became much easier and pleasant， during the day his mood was more stable and he cried less. His parents were highly satisfied having their evenings for themselves and the easier handling of C3's emotional difficulties during the day.**\n\n【42】**Case 4**\n\n【43】**C4 is a 17 vear old male with normal intellectual abilities， diagnosed with ASD (atage 11 years). His main clinical manifestations include deficits in reciprocal social interaction， pragmatic language disturbances， and anxiety if rituals and routines are not respected. He attends a mainstream secondary school with a support teacher and has weekly speech therapy and group therapy to improve social skills.**\n\n【44】**At C4's first consultation regarding his sleep (at age 12 years and2 months) he was having daily difficulties falling asleep， nocturnal awakenings， agitated sleep， early morning awakenings， associated with daytime fatigue but no excessive daytime sleepiness (Table 1). Bedtime during the week was at 20h45 he would fall asleep at 21h30and wake up at 6h38 in the morning. TST was 8.75 h to 9 h during the week (and 8.5 h during weekends). C4 snores regularly during the night， does not have naps during the day， and suffers from mild irritability， and fluctuating anxiety and emotional sensitivity， more frequently following poor sleep. Polysomnography recording indicated periodic limb movement disorder during sleep (PLMS18.9 per hour of sleep) in the context of iron deficiency and no sleep apnea but frequent arousals or micro-arousals from sleep (14.5 per hour of sleep) were observed. Initial treatment included iron (to reach serum ferritin levels of >80 ng/ml) and vitamin D supplementation， sleep hygiene， and sophrology for relaxation. Additionally， he began treatment with IR-melatonin， 1 mg increased to 2 mg at bedtime upon which SOL was reduced to ~25 min. During the week， bedtime was at 21h30， he fell asleep at 21h55，and final awakening was at 6h00which provided a TST of 7.5 h to 8h (and9 h during weekends). He still experienced nocturnal awakenings 3 times per night， was emotionally disturbed， anxious， had mild attention difficulties and cried easily and was more irritable when tired. Due to his high anxiety levels he constantly needed reassurance and support from his mother， putting her under significant continuous stress. Following 3 years of IR melatonin treatment was switched to 2 mg PedPRM at 20h30，1h before bedtime， in attempt to improve night-time awakenings and daytime internalizing behavior. At a follow-up call two weeks after treatment initiation， parents reported that the SOL was 20 min to30 min (same as under IR melatonin)， but nocturnal awakenings decreased to once every two weeks. At a follow-up visit one month after treatment initiation， parents reported almost no nocturnal awakenings， and improvement in continous sleep， achieving LSE>6 h most nights. Moreover， according to parents， C4 seemed less anxious during the day. At six month follow up he experienced stable benefits to sleep， with SOL of less than 30 min， LSE of more than 6 h most nights and sleep duration of 8 h， considered within the**\n\n【45】**normal range for his age. Significant improvements in anxiety levels and attention difficulties during the day were also seen. Parents are satisfied with this improvement.**\n\n【46】**Case 5**\n\n【47】**C5 is an 11-year-old male diagnosed with ASD and moderate intellectual impairment. His main clinical manifestations include deficits in reciprocal social interaction and severe delay in expressive language skills， currently functioning at the level of a 2-year-old. He has long-standing PICA， is obsessed with food and his body mass index exceeds the 915 percentile. He has co-morbid ADHD that is unmedicated， as a prior trial of stimulants resulted in the emergence of tics and worsening in his self-harming behaviors. C5 attends a special educational provision for children with learning disabilities.**\n\n【48】**C5 had long-standing sleep difficulties from the 2nd year of life. At his first consultation regarding his sleep (at age 6 years) he had already been treated with 4 mg of IR melatonin but had intermittent difficulties falling asleep， daily problems with prolonged nocturnal awakenings and short TST. A typical bedtime routine would include IR melatonin at 18h30， bedtime at 19h30. On 2/3 of nights he would settle to sleep independentlyby 20h00(Table1) but on 1/3 of nights he would refuse to settle， kicking the bedroom door and screaming and fell asleep onlyat 23h00 with his parents at his bed. He would wake up every night between midnight and 3h00 and alert his parents by lying on the floor and kicking his door and would only resettle to sleep with a parent present (this could take up to 2 h) on 2/3 of nights and on the other nights he would not resettle and become increasingly agitated. If he was able to resettle to sleep， typical morning waking was 6h00and he was described as alert and active. Total sleep time was highly variable from 4h to7hand LSE from 1 h to 4 h with no excessive daytime sleepiness. C5 was noticeably more active， inattentive and aggressive after a restless night. His parents rated the sleep problem as severe. Mother noted that chronic sleep deprivation affected her mood and there was concern for father’s safety as he is a lorry driver. Noise at night had caused complaints from neighbors， increasing the family's stress.**\n\n【49】**As behavioral approaches had limited effect， and the whole family was suffering， pharmacotherapy with an antihistamine was initiated. Without medication， following a bedtime of 20h00， mean SOL was3.25 h and TST 6.8 h as assessed by actigraphy (Camntech). The antihistamine (alimemazine tartrate liquid 30 mg at bedtime) had no impact on SOL but successfully reduced night awakenings so that TST increased to 7.25 h. Add-on of IR melatonin 6 mg at bedtime resulted in noticeable improvement of SOL to 48 min and TST to 8.8h and significant improvement in C5 daytime behavior and quality of life for the family. This was further supported by the use of a safe space sleep tent. After 4 years， at routine review， it was found that C5's sleep had deteriorated despite the combination of 6 mg of IR melatonin and an increased dose (40 mg) of alimemazine tartrate. He would take up to 90 min to fall asleep， wake up most nights around03h00 and remain awake for the day (TST approximately 5.5 h) and was increasingly anxious during the day. PedPRM 5 mg taken an hour before bedtime was the prescribed as a direct substitute for his6 mg IR melatonin， with a weaning schedule for the anti-histamine. Two weeks later， with PedPRM 5 mg as monotherapy at 19h30 he was falling asleep without any behavioral disturbance by 20h30 with SOL of 15 min after lights out. He would wake once in the night to take himself to the toilet but resettling himself to sleep within 5 min and was able to then sleep continuously until 5h00 giving him a TST**\n\n【50】**of approximately 8.5 h， within age-appropriate limits. The reduction in challenging behaviors at settling time and during night-time was reported as of significant benefit to the whole family. Similarly， improvements were noted in C5’s daytime challenging behaviors， in his mother's words： this has changed our lives. At six months follow up there is stable maintenance oftreatment effect with lack ofadverse events.**\n\n【51】**Case 6**\n\n【52】**C6 is a 6-year-oldnon-verbal female diagnosed (at age 2 years) with ASD/SMS with de novo mutation SYNGAPland severe symptomatology including intellectual impairment and epilepsy. She presented with long-standing bedtime resistance， with SOL of 90 min to 120 min and early awakenings from sleep at 4h00 with behavioral outbursts and TST of 7 h. During the daytime she presented with agitation， psychomotor instability， irritability， emotional hyperactivity and tantrums. Parents were exhausted (dad-irritability， mom-depressive symptomatology and difficult relationship with the younger brother). Following consultation treatment included sleep hygiene in combination with IR-melatonin (1 mg during 8 weeks then 2 mg). IR-Melatonin reduced the SOL to approximately 15min and extended TST to 8 h， but the early awakenings at 4h00 with behavioral outbursts (correct compliance) continued. She was then given Circadin (adult prolonged release melatonin 2 mg formulation) that was very difficult for her to swallow whole and she probably chewed the tablet. After 8 weeks with no additional benefit she was given add-on antihistamine for 5 weeks (hydroxyzine dichlorhydrate increased gradually up to 20 mg) that was ineffective and resulted in drowsiness and the drug combination was discontinued. PedPRM2 mg was then initiated and， after 10 days treatment， the early awakening problem was resolved and it was not necessary to increase the treatment dose. With PedPRM SOL was approximately 15 min， TST was 9.5 h， sleep continuity improved and she no longer had early awakening. Child behavior improved with reduced agitation and temper. Treatment compliance is very good with no side effects after7 months oftreatment. Her family is very satisfied with this treatment and improvements of the relationship with her brother are noted. At the day care center the child's behavior is reportedly quieter and more attentive.**\n\n【53】**Discussion**\n\n【54】**Practice guidelines on treatment of insomnia and disrupted sleep behavior in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder\\[19\\]recommendcounselingparentsregarding sleephabitsand offering behavioral strategies as first line， with pharmacologic approaches if these strategies have not been helpful. The case reports presented here are typical examples of children and adolescents with ASD and insomnia， as well as various other comorbidities that were seen by three expert clinics for treating children with neurodevelopmental disabilities. The children in this report had typical sleep disturbances for this population， namely sleep maintenance problems reflected by 6 h or less of uninterrupted sleep (LSE<6 h) and/or difficulties initiating sleep with sleep onset latency (SOL) >30 min. In line with published studies \\[4\\]， most had less than recommended TST for their age before treatment initiation and there was no association between age and the sleep disturbances \\[3\\].**\n\n【55】**Initialtreatmentiincludedbehavioralinterventions； iron supplementation (C1， C2， C4)， vitamin D supplementation (C1， C4) and antihistamines (alimemazine (C2， C5) and hydroxyzine (C2， C6)) failed to provide adequate treatment response. Melatonin in IR**\n\n【56】**formulation was then prescribed in all cases (1 mg escalated to 2 mg or 1x3 times per night) with partial or complete improvements in SOL in 5 of 6 cases and emergence of paradoxical insomnia in one(C1). As LSE was not resolved in any of the cases with IR melatonin， the adult PRM formulations was applied in 2 cases (C3 and C6) but because of compliance issues was probably chewed or crushed and had limited added value to IR melatonin. Following its approval as the first treatment for insomnia in children with ASD， PedPRM 2 mg was prescribed in 5 of 6 cases. In one case the starting dose was 5 mg and 2 of 5 escalated to 5 mg due to partial response.**\n\n【57】**Usefulpoints for consideration for change in pharmacotherapy or dose optimization are therefore to attain treatment goals pertaining to (A) TST within the recommended range for the subject age (i.e.10 h to 13 h for age 3 to 5 years， 9 h to 11 h for 6 to 13 years and 8 h to 10 h for teenagers 14 to 17 years and no less than 8 h at age 3 to 5and 7 h at age 5 to 17 years) \\[3\\]； (B) SOL<30 min； (C) LSE>6h \\[5\\].In addition， important aspects of child behavior and parent satisfaction of child's sleep improved. In all cases PedPRM treatment provided the sought relief.**\n\n【58】**To our knowledge， this case series is the first description of PedPRM use in the clinic for insomnia in children and adolescents with ASD. It demonstrates the decision points and considerations for treatment modification in real life examples and provides supportive evidence to data from controlled clinical trials with this drug in this population \\[22-25\\].**\n\n【59】**Conclusion**\n\n【60】**Insomnia in a child with ASD tends to be persistent and is highly challenging to the child and the parents. Following initial sleep hygiene measures and behavioral interventions， many children with ASD and sleep disturbances will require additional pharmacotherapy to normalize their sleep patterns. Both IR and prolonged release melatonin formulations seem to adequately address Sleep Onset Problems (SOL)， however， the pediatric appropriate prolonged release formulation (PedPRM) that can be swallowed whole without any difficulty， effectively resolves sleep maintenance (LSE) and duration (TST) problems as well as early morning awakenings to achieve sleep within the norms for their age. No safety issues were observed and subsequent improvements in child behavior (mainly due to longer uninterrupted sleep) and parent satisfaction and quality of life (mainly affected by the child behavior) were reported.**\n\n【61】**Clinical Significance**\n\n【62】**Sleep problems are common in children and adolescents with ASD. PedPRM represents a novel treatment option for insomnia in these subjects with a benign safety profile and excellent acceptance. These cases suggest that PedPRM may help achieve sleep onset latency of <30 min， uninterrupted sleep duration of at least 6 h and sleep duration considered within the norm for their age. PedPRM is an effective strategy for managing insomnia in clinical practice in pediatric patients with ASD.**\n\n【63】**Funding**\n\n【64】**The journalpublication fees willbeepaidbyyNeurim Pharmaceuticals Ltd.**\n\n【65】**References**\n\n【66】**1\\.

Mainly， it is associated with nervous system involvement and cardiovascular compromise，especially myocardic， is rare. We present the case of a 21 year old patient that was bitten by a Latrodectus mactans spider， who developed neurologic compromise and later presenting severe acute heart failure. After 10 days oftreatment， the patient recovered without sequelae.**\n\n【16】**Keywords： Latrodectus； Myocarditis； Acute heart failure**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Lactrodectism is a clinical entity with characteristic symptoms and signs caused by the bite from arachnids of the genus Latrodectus with compromise of several organs， specially nervous and cardiovascular systems. Among cardiovascular symptoms， arterial hypertension and brady-tachycardia are common in the first hours. Secondary acute myocardial compromise is rare and the mechanisms of myocardial damage as well as the prognosis ofthis complication have not been well defined \\[1，2\\].**\n\n【19】**Electrocardiographic alterations could be explained by the effect of alpha-latroxin， which is the most active component of this venom. This toxin causes neurotransmitter， specially acetylcholine and noradrenaline，liberation and depletion form synaptic terminals and inhibiting their posterior uptake \\[3\\].**\n\n【20】**Actual therapy is based mainly in supportive measures and symptoms relief. Antivenom is the only available therapy which has been proved effective but with a brief therapeutic window and secondary and a wide range of described allergic reactions in diverse series \\[4\\].**\n\n【21】**We present the uncommon case of myocarditis caused by Latrodectus mactans bite， with an updated literature review of this clinical entity.**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**A male 21 year old patient， with no previous medical history or cardiovascular symptoms. He refers to be bitten in his right scapular region by a black spider with red abdomen， while he was performing his job spraying plaguicide with adequate protection of hands and arms. After 20min he describes intense pain and pruritus over the bite zone. On the skin， an intense erythematic lesion with a diameter of 10 cm appeared which， after two hours， presented marked edema. He presented concomitant malaise and diffuse myalgia. He was admitted in the emergency department after 4 h of the event， febrile， tachycardic， polypneic， diaphoretic and with diffuse erythema. The electrocardiogram showed only sinus tachycardia (Figure 1). He was transferred to the intermediate care unit were supportive care was initiated and intravenous corticoids， antiallergics， calcium gluconate and opiods were administered.**\n\n【24】**Following advice of the local Toxicology Center， therapy with antivenom was not administered because a high risk of anaphylactic reaction. After 24 h， the patient developed progressive dyspnea and oxygen desaturation. He was severely hypertense(220/110 mmHg)， with a hear rate of 140 bpm， febrile and with intense myalgias and shivering. Physical exam revealed rales on both lung fields which were corroborated by chest X-ray were the appearance of bilateral interstitial infiltrates was observed (Figure 2) compatible with acute pulmonary edema. Severe hypoxemia was documented with a PaO，/FiO， of 156 and levels ofultra sensitive Troponin T (usTnT) were 4.74 ng/mL (normal value<0.16 ng/mL).**\n\n【25】**Figure 1： Emergency Department Electrocardiogram： Sinus Tachycardia with a heart rate of 100 bpm.**\n\n【26】**Figure 2： Chest X-ray： A) At admission， described as normal.

Transthoracic echocardiogram evidenced mild LV dilatation with globalhypokinesia that determined a LVEF of29% and a suspicious image of apical ballooning. Mild regurgitation of mitral and aortic valves was observed (Figure 3). Dobutamine infusion was**\n\n【29】**Figure 4： Electrocardiogram at coronary unit admission.

The patient developed a new episode of intense desaturation and atrial tachycardia with need or orotracheal intubation and connection to invasive mechanical ventilation. The patient was then derived to our center after 48 h of therapy.**\n\n【32】**On physical exam a decreased peripheral perfusion was noted， with a third heart sound and pulmonary rales. Laboratory showed leukocytosis (15，000 x mm’， 70% polymorphonuclear)， usTnT of128 pg/mL， CK 123 U/L， CKmb 26 U/L， Lactate 1.3 mmol/L (normal value<1.7) and creatinine of 0.87 mg/dL. On electrocardiogram， atrial tachycardia was seen， with a diffuse PR depression， rS from V1 to V3and diffuse ST elevation and T wave inversion in I， aVL， V5 and V6(Figure 4). A new echocardiogram corroborated a LVEF of 35% with a LV of normal diameters， diffuse hypokinesia more pronounced in anterior and anteroseptal basal and medial segments. RV presented a preserved systolic function without pulmonary hypertension. QUE TERAPIA SE DEJO??**\n\n【33】**The patient evolved with progressive improvement in oxygen requirements and resolution of lung infiltrates (Figure 5). After four days of treatment， inotropes were suspended and a new echocardiogram showed a LVEF of 45%. usTnT 98 pg/mL. The patient was successfully extubated.**\n\n【34】**Figures 6： Control Electrocardiograms. Alternate atrial and sinus rhythm with normalization of ST segment and posterior deep T wave inversion.**\n\n【35】**and carvedilol was adjusted. Subsequent electrocardiograms showed intermittent ectopic atrial rhythm and ST elevation resolution with a profound T wave inversion in I， II， aVL and V1 to V6 (Figure 6) with posterior normalization (Figure 7).**\n\n【36】**Echocardiogram after eleven days of therapy denoted a complete recovery of LV systolic function. Patient was discharged after twelve day with the following therapy： Enalapril 5 mg bid and Carvedilol12.5 mg bid. After XXXX months， the subject remains asymptomatic with a normal echocardiogram.**\n\n【37】**Discussion**\n\n【38】**Bite from arachnids from the genus Latrodectus is one of the _most common worldwide \\[5\\] and L. mactans， L. tredecimguttatus_ and L. hasseelti are the principal species of this genus. In Chile， the bite from L. mactans is described since 1852， generating seasonal epidemics depending on temperatures and agricultural activities \\[6\\]. Commonly named “black widow”or “wheat spider\"， it has a black color with characteristic red stains in the ventral side of its globular abdomen. Female spiders are bigger and have a more potent venom. It has daily habits and it is found more commonly in rural areas. The higher rate of bites is registered during agriculture task hours(between 10 h and 19 h).**\n\n【39】**The most important component of the venom is a-Latrotoxin(a-LTX)， a protein that consists in two polypeptides of 8 and 130kD， the last of them with biologic activity \\[7\\]. This toxin produces massive exocytosis of neurotransmitters from neurosecretory cells， predominantly acetylcholine and noradrenalin， into motor**\n\n【40】**synapses.This secretion produces synaptic terminal depletion with neurotransmission blockade deriving into paralysis. Three physiopathologic mechanisms have been described to explain this effect：**\n\n【41】**1 Massive influx of calcium through de novo formed transcellular pores and preexistent channel opening；**\n\n【42】**_2\\._ The action Neurexins： Transmembrane proteins that bind to a-LTX in presence of extracellular calcium， triggering exocytosis directly through Synaptotagmin；**\n\n【43】**3\\. G-Protein binded receptor， calcium independent， called Latrophilin. The mechanisms of toxicity that predominate are different in every organ， with no available evidence about the direct effects of this toxin over cardiac tissue.**\n\n【44】**In the typical clinical scenario， local reaction to the bite predominates， with pain and edema on the site of inoculation \\[6，8\\]. In 25% to 60% of patients remote symptoms develop， characterized by generalized pain， diaphoresis， muscular spasms， nausea， vomits， tremor， photophobia and dyspnea \\[4-6，8\\]. Cases of renal failure， rhabdomyolysis， compartment syndrome， ileus and seizures \\[9\\]. Laboratory findings are nonspecific， with elevation of AST， ALT， LDH， CK and leukocytes. Reported mortality of Latrodectism varies from 0% to 10%\\[4-6\\]，with higher levels in undeveloped regions.**\n\n【45】**Cardiovascular manifestations are frequent， with 30% of patients presenting systemic arterial hypertension and tachycardia \\[1，9\\]. Literature describes secondary myocarditis as a rare phenomenon\\[9，10\\]. Typically， myocardial involvement is suspected through elevated Troponin levels and electrocardiographic abnormalities such as： ectopic rhythm \\[1\\]， atrial fibrillation and ST deviation \\[11，12\\]. QRS alterations， QT prolongation and evolutive T wave changes are also described \\[1\\]. Contractile alterations are described such as diffuse hypokinesia and occasional segmental abnormalities， mainly in the anterior wall \\[1，9，11\\]. These changes are characteristically reversible within approximately 7 days. In this case， the patient presented with severe transient systolic dysfunction associated with marked electrocardiographic changes in PR and ST segments andT wave inversion.**\n\n【46】**Therapy is based mainly on supportive measures. Due to the physiopathological evidence of intracellular calcium abnormalities， calcium gluconate infusion has been described as an additional treatment in the first hours； nevertheless， different series have not demonstrated benefits in terms of duration or severity of the disease\\[4\\]. Neostigmine in doses of 0.5 mg to 1.0 mg tid has been proven effective in small series and reviews， specially related to neurologic symptoms \\[6，13\\]. Administration of Benzodiazepines and opioids were proven effective in symptom control but not in the duration of the disease \\[4，14\\].**\n\n【47】**The onlytherapythathas demonstrated to reduce the symptomatic period is the Antivenom \\[4，8，14\\]. This substance is obtained though derivates of Immunoglobulin G synthesized from different Latrodectus species. In animal models， extracts from one species are useful in counteracting venom from other types of Latrodectus \\[15\\]. Main concern about this substance are allergic reactions， reporting variable degrees of intensity \\[5，16\\] with cases of anaphylactic shock and even death. In review of the cases from Australia and United States， there is a marked difference in the reported adverse effects which vary from 0.5 to 0.8 in the Australian versus 9% to 80% in**\n\n【48】**the North American series \\[5\\]. These differences are thought to be explained by the administration route： Intramuscular in the Australian and intravenous in the North American cohort. Besides， in the latter， allergies obtained in cutaneous tests were described as adverse reactions， which could increase the number of reported complications. Studies have compared the administration of the Antivenom through intravenous versus intramuscular route， with faster onset of action using intravenous route without increasing adverse effects \\[17\\]. The administration of Antivenom remains underutilized because of concerns of adverse reactions \\[4，5\\] reserving it only for severe cases， but in recent experiences the rate of severe adverse effects is low \\[16\\]. Newer therapies are being developed， a fragment of purified F(ab)2 has been described to produce the same benefits with fewer adverse reactions that could increase the use of the antidote 14.**\n\n【49】**References**\n\n【50】**1\\.

These factors pose negative impact on glycemic management in people with diabetes. This study aimed to determine the relationship between glycemic changes， physical activities， and eating behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.**\n\n【17】**Methods： Study involved both retrospective and cross-sectional data analyses. The glycated Hemoglobin (HbAlc) values in patients with type 2 diabetes before the pandemic in 2019 and during pandemic in 2020 were evaluated. A self-administered questionnaire survey was used to measure physical activity and eating behaviors. Patients with type 2 diabetes who had HbAlc values ≥ 7%at any month during 2020 were included. Data collection was performed at the medical outpatient clinic of Kagawa University Hospital.**\n\n【18】**Results： Two hundred participants completed the survey. During the COVID-19 pandemic， the average HbA1c values significantly deteriorated (7.72%) than those pre-pandemics (7.57%)， with an increase of 1.98 percent (p=0.002，r=-0.157). Additionally，the scores for All Physical Activities (all PA) decreased and total eating behaviors improved. There was no significant relationship was found between the HbA1 values， physical activities， and eating behaviors during the pandemic.**\n\n【19】**Conclusion： HbAlc levels deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic， but this change was unrelated to physical activity or eating habits. The stress factors may contribute to these changes.**\n\n【20】**Keywords：COVID-19； Type 2 diabetes； Glycemic control； Physical activities； Eating behaviors**\n\n【21】**Introduction**\n\n【22】**The COVID-19 caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first detected in Wuhan in December 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide. In Japan， the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported on January 16h， 2020. By the end of August 2021， the total number of domestic infections and deaths increased to 1，469，327 and 15，994， respectively \\[1\\]. The mortality cases due to COVID-19 is considerably higher accounting for 1.1%of the infected people， and more than half of the cases recorded involved elderly and people with comorbidities. The Japanese government declared the first state of emergency on April 07h，2020，for Tokyo and the other six prefectures for one month； on April 16h，2020， the emergency was exten ded to the rest of the country， which ended in May 2020 \\[2\\]. Compared to scenario in other countries worldwide， Japanese government did not impose a total strict lockdown. However， the emergency declaration disrupted daily routine lives \\[3\\] and psychosocial well-being of the people \\[4，5\\].**\n\n【23】**In people with diabetes， maintaining healthy daily life， especially physical activities/exercises and diet are crucial components for improving their glycemic control \\[6\\]. There is no conclusive evidence that patients with diabetes are at a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection， but a few studies suggest that diabetes in patients with COVID-19 is associated with a two-fold increased risk of disease severity and mortality \\[7-9\\] even in the absence of other comorbidities \\[10\\]. A retrospective， multi-centered study of 7，337 cases with COVID-19 in Hubei Province， China， found that patients with poorly controlled diabetes or stress hyperglycemia (blood glucose>180 mg/dl)**\n\n【24】**have a significantly higher risk of severe COVID-19 and increased mortality than the patients with well-controlled blood glucose (blood glucose <180 mg/dl)\\[8\\].**\n\n【25】**In the present study， during routine outpatient assessment of patients with diabetes at Kagawa University Hospital， located in Kagawa Prefecture， we observed an increasing trend of glycated hemoglobin (HbAlc) values in 2020 than those in 2019. To the best of our knowledge， there are limited studies in Japan investigating glycemic changes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A retrospective study conducted at the Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University Hospital， Sendai， reported that HbA1c values significantly increased after the emergency was declared \\[11\\]. However， the factors of physical activity and diet were not included in this study. Therefore， in the present study， we aimed to evaluate whether there were any significant changes in HbAlc values before(2019) and during (2020) the pandemic. Additionally， we also examined that whether Physical Activities (PA) and eating behaviors relate to higher HbAlc values during the pandemic in 2020.**\n\n【26】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【27】**Study design and participants**\n\n【28】**This was a retrospective， observational， cross-sectional study. Data were collected in two stages： Stage 1 involved retrieving and analyzing data from the hospital's patient information system， and stage 2 involved the patients'survey. Patients analyzed at stage 1 were then followed up for a survey at stage 2 during their hospital visits between November 2020 and January 2021. This was a single-center study conducted at the medical outpatient clinic of the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism at Kagawa University Hospital in Kagawa Prefecture.**\n\n【29】**We included all patients who meet the following inclusion criteria； patients with type 2 diabetes， aged ≥ 18 years， on regular consultations (in every 1 to 2 months) in 2020 with HbAlc values 之7% in any month in 2020. In a month， the average number of type 2diabetes patients with HbAlc values 2 7% is approximately 81， thus230 of patients were randomly selected for this study. We excluded patients with a history of hospitalization during the study period， and those who refused to complete the questionnaire.**\n\n【30】**Ethical approval**\n\n【31】**The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Kagawa University (approval number： 2020-155； approval dates： November20h，2020). Written informed consent was obtained from the participants， and all procedure adhered to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 and later versions.**\n\n【32】**Data collection**\n\n【33】**During stage 1， the data extracted from the hospital patient's information system included HbAlc values； age and gender The HbAlc values in 2019 and 2020 were extracted and evaluated.**\n\n【34】**A self-administered questionnaire was used during stage 2 to measure physical activities and eating behaviors of the participants before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Short Diet Behaviors Questionnaire for Lockdown (SDBQ-L) was adapted from a previous study \\[12\\] to evaluate the eating behaviors， and the questionnaire was translated into Japanese. The questionnaire enquired five types of eating-related behaviors： 1) Unhealthy food， 2) uncontrolled eating，3) snacking between meals， 4) binge drinking， and 5) the number of main meals per day. There were four choices as responses and**\n\n【35】**the designated scores for questions 1 to 4 were as follows：“Never”=0；“Sometimes\\*=1；“Most of the time\"=2； and “Always=3. The responses for question 5 were as follows； “1-2 times/day=1；“3 times/day'=0；“4 times/day=1；“5 times/day\"=2； and “>5 times/day”=3. The total score of the questionnaire corresponded to the sum of the scores of the five questions. The total score ranged 0 to 15， where“0”indicated no unhealthy dietary behavior and “15”indicated severely unhealthy behavior.**\n\n【36】**The Japanese version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ) was used to measure the extent of PA. It is a self-reported questionnaire that assesses the average frequency and duration of three domains of PA performed over a one-week period， as follows： 1) Vigorous Physical Activity (VPA)，2) Moderate Physical Activity (MPA)， and 3) Brisk walking. The Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) was computed from the data collected by multiplying the MET value of each PA domain. MET is a unit of measurement for energy expenditure that represents the ratio of the working metabolic rate to the resting metabolic rate. One MET equals one kcal/kg/h of energy expenditure while sitting quietly.**\n\n【37】**The MET value in each domain was based on the guideline：VPA=8.0 METs， MPA=4.0 METs and Brisk walking =3.3 METs\\[13\\]. Total PA was calculated by summing the METs of weekly PA(MET-hours/week) as follows： Total PA (MET-hours/week)=(VPA minutes/week×8.0 METs) + (MPA minutes/week x 4.0 METs) +(Brisk walking minutes/weekx3.3 METs)/60. This measure has been used worldwide and has been accepted for its reliability and validity in Japanese adults 14.**\n\n【38】**Statistical analyses**\n\n【39】**Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Data Analysis version 25 (SPSS Inc.， Chicago， IL， USA) and figures were generated using Microsoft Excel 2019. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test for normality. Descriptive analyses were performed on the demographic variables， HbAlc values， PA， and eating behaviors. Data are reported as frequency， percentage， and mean ±Standard Deviation (SD).**\n\n【40】**The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to examine the significant differences in HbAlc levels， PA， and eating behaviors before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Effect size (Cohen's d) was calculated to determine the magnitude of change in score and was interpreted using the following criteria： 0.2 (small)， 0.3 (moderate)， and 0.5 (large). Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient tests were used to assess the possible relationships between HbAlc values， PA， and eating behaviors. The strength of a relationship was interpreted using the following criteria： r=0.10-29 (small)， r=0.30-49 (moderate)， and r=0.50-1.0(large). Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.**\n\n【41】**Results**\n\n【42】**Demographic characteristics of participants**\n\n【43】**We successfully reviewed and surveyed 200 patients with type 2diabetes at our medical outpatient clinic.

We also evaluated whether HbA1c values associated with PA and eating behaviors. The findings suggest relatively deteriorated HbAlc values during the pandemic than those before pandemic. Additionally， the variables of all PA were significantly decreased and the total eating behavior scores was significantly improved during the pandemic. However， we failed to find any variables in the questionnaire that were clearly related to the increasing values of HbAlc. A Japanese study by Tanji et al.， \\[11\\] involving 1，009 patients with type 2 diabetes， also had a similar outcome， where the HbAlc values worsened after declaration ofemergency. Furthermore， women aged 2 65 years， those with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m，and those on oral hypoglycemic agents were significantly associated with higher HbAlc**\n\n【65】**values during the pandemic. Compared to values in the present study， the HbAlc values in the study by Tanji et al.\\[11\\] werelower by 7.45%and 7.53% before and after emergency， respectively. Moreover， PA and eating behaviors were not investigated in their study.**\n\n【66】**Recent studies from Japan reported contrasting findings \\[3，15，16\\]. Study by Tanaka et al.， showed that the HbAlc values after state of emergency (June 2020) were significantly lower than those before， with 7.5% and 7.7%， respectively， and the changed in HbA1cafterthe emergency was related to the changed in body weight \\[3\\]. The physical activities descriptively showed a reduction after the state of emergency， however， no association with HbA1c was investigated. Takahara et al. \\[15\\]， analyzed HbA1c values of 1，402 diabetes patients during the state of emergency (March to May 2020)， revealed that34.9% of patients had increased HbA1c by ≥ 0.3% and only 13.4%decreased by ≤ 0.3% with the mean HbAlc was 7.2%. They found that the changed in HbAlc was related with bodyweight， eating behaviors，**\n\n【67】**leisure-time physical activities， but the other physical activities were not significantly related. Another study by Kishimoto et al. \\[16\\]， in168 patients found the change in HbAlc was associated with both changes in physical activities and eating behaviors. Weight gain was observed in patients with increased HbAlc during the emergency period； however the relationship was not statistically evaluated. Compared to outcome of the present study， these studies， only evaluated a single value of HbAlc before and after state of emergency which involved for several months， wherein seasonal variations may have strongly influenced HbAlc fluctuations in Japanese patients with diabetes \\[17\\]. Furthermore， the definitions of physical activities might differ between the studies， which contributed to the different findings.**\n\n【68】**We believe that other factors， such as the stress environment， which was not included in the study， may add complexity to the outcome. When a person physiologically experiences stress and/or anxiety， cortisol and epinephrine are released by the adrenal glands in response to stress. These hormones then trigger the release of glucose stored in various organs that frequently leads to elevated levels of glucose in the bloodstream. This condition causes glycemic deterioration in patients with diabetes \\[18，19\\]. Furthermore， people with diabetes mellitus are at risk for developing depression and diabetes mellitus-related distress that are associated with poor glycemic control and cardiovascular complications \\[19\\]. In the current COVID-19 pandemic， there is growing evidence of people experiencing stress \\[5，20，21\\]. Furthermore， olderrpeople with diabetes are more vulnerable to the severity of COVID-19 infection and mortality \\[22，23\\]. Thus， fear and anxiety ofacquiring COVID-19and the impact of the situation contribute to stress. People who fail to manage their stress effectively， develop chronic physiological stress， depression， health-related problems， and lack of motivation \\[5，22\\]. We could not directly measure stress and cortisol levels， but we believe that studies should be conducted to investigate these aspects in the future.**\n\n【69】**Japan had not imposed a strict lockdown like many other countries worldwide， but enforcement of COVID-19 management， such as restrictions for out door or unnecessary activities， less meeting with peers， social distancing policies， and business restrictions drastically changed the social and daily lives of people， which contributed to factors of stress. In the present study， the frequency and duration of total all PA decreased significantly during the pandemic and demonstrated a significant relationship with a longer duration of sitting. This is not a surprising finding， as staying at home was one of the primary containment measures used to limit the spread of COVID-19. Moreover， many studies worldwide have reported substantial reductions in PA during the pandemic \\[12，24\\]. Regular PA is important for improving glycemic control and maintaining individual mental health \\[6\\]. However， the restrictions on outdoor activities during the pandemic may have also influenced the emergence of stress in the patients. A previous study conducted with 519 older people in Japan revealed that depression and apathy scores significantly deteriorated in July 2020 than those in December2019， and that these conditions were more prevalent in people aged<75 years who were constantly active \\[21\\].**\n\n【70】**In the present study， there was a significance changed in eating behaviors during pandemic where the total eating behaviors scores were improved slightly and the changed was related to the reduction of weight in our study population. The score on snacking between meals**\n\n【71】**showed a significant reduction during pandemic. The association between changes in snacking and changes in weight was reported in previous studies \\[16，25\\]. A larger online survey among 6，000participants across Japan revealed that the dietary behaviors in 2020mostly unchanged (71.6%)，healthier(20.3%)， and unhealthier (8.2%) compared to 2019， and changed in weight was significantly related to dietary behaviors. In this survey， only 3.5% of the participants had diabetes， and no data on HbAlc can be compared \\[26\\]. This finding was different from countries that imposed a complete lockdown. Analysis of a systematic review revealed that the frequency of food intake， meals， and consumption of unhealthy foods/snacks increased during home confinement. Furthermore， psychological changes， such as boredom， stress， distress， and anxiety were associated with people who consumed more food \\[27\\].**\n\n【72】**There are some limitations to the present study. First，the findings of stage 2 were based on participants’ self-reported PA and eating behaviors. As these questions required the participants to recall their experiences， misreporting was possible. Second， this study was conducted at a single medical institution with a small sample size and specific characteristics； thus， the findings cannot be generalized to other patients at other medical institutions. Therefore， further studies are necessary to clarify whether PA， eating behaviors， and/or stress affect the changes in HbA1c levels during the COVID-19 pandemic.**\n\n【73】**Conclusion**\n\n【74】**The present study showed that there are worse glycemic changes during the pandemic in 2020； however， they are unrelated to PA or eating behaviors. We propose that stress factors may contribute to these changes. Furthermore， as older people with uncontrolled diabetes are more vulnerable to the severity and mortality of COVID-19， crucial interventions to improve the glycemic changes should be implemented， even in the challenging pandemic situation.**\n\n【75】**Acknowledgment**\n\n【76】**We would like to express our thanks and acknowledgement to all patients participating in the survey.

Coronary Artery Angiography (CAG) revealed spasm of the left coronary artery and Right Coronary Artery(RCA)， which was relieved by intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin. Our findings suggested multi vessel spasm would be associated with a significant increase of the risk of clinical complications.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Coronary spasm； Acute myocardial infarction； Ventricular fibrillation； Coronary artery angiography**\n\n【19】**Introduction**\n\n【20】**Coronary spasm is defined as a condition associated with main large epicardial coronary artery transiently abnormal contraction. While the coronary artery is completely or nearly completely occluded by spasm， the transmural ischemia would occur in the region perfused by the artery. Angina attacks with ST elevation on the standard ECG would observe at rest without any apparent trigger. This pathological condition is known as variant angina， which is less often used. However， vasospastic angina， which is a clinical entity characterized by episodes of rest angina that promptly respond to short-acting nitrates and are attributable to coronary artery vasospasm.**\n\n【21】**Coronary spasm usually appears at the same coronary artery in the same patient. However， it is not rare that ST segment elevation occurs in the anterior leads during one attack and in the inferiorleads in another in the same patients. There are also patients in whom ST segment elevation occurs simultaneously both in the anterior and inferior leads. These are patients with simultaneous multivessel coronary spasm and the attacks often result in sudden death. However， spontaneous and alternate Coronary Artery Spasm (CAS) leading to Myocardial Infarction (MI) and malignant arrhythmias has been uncommon reported \\[1-3\\]. We reported a patient with multivessel CAS in setting of acute multisite MI who was treated with defibrillation 46 times.**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**A 63-year-old man with history of hypertension and smoking was admitted as an emergency with severe chest pain for 2 h accompanied syncope in the heavy snow morning. On admission to the emergency room， he was no discomfort at heart rate of 69 beats/min and blood pressure of 81mmHg/50 mmHg. Surface Electrocardiography (ECG) on admission showed sinus rhythmia， II， III， avF， V5-6 ST depression (Figure 1). Blood tests obtained immediately at arrival showed cTnT normal (<0.1 ng/ml). Blood gas analysis revealed normal serum electrolytes were within normal limits. At 39 min after arrival， he developed VF (Figure 2). Immediately after defibrillation， he was successfully resuscitated， surface ECG revealed ST-segment elevation in I， avL， V1 through V6(Figure 3).**\n\n【24】**He was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation after VF 3 min，he had no conscious again. ECG showed a line (Figure 4)， cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started， and adrenaline and atropine were administered， with restoration of cardiac output， ECG revealed sinus bradycardia， ST elevation in the inferior leads II， III， avF leads (Figure 5). Defibrillation was successfully fulfilled 40times before CAG. Meanwhile， amlodipine， lidocaine， eslonal were used to control VF， Dopamine(at the most dosage 20 ug/kg min)， norepinephrine 60 ug/min were used to increase BP to 90 to 133**\n\n【25】**Figure 1： ECG on admission to ED no chest pain onset revealed the ST depression less than 1 mm (0.1 mv) in leads ll， m， avF， V5 through V6.**\n\n【26】**Figure 3： Immediately after DC shock， the surface ECG showed the ST elevated greater than 5 mm (0.5 mv) in l， avL， V1 through V6 and ST depression inferior leacs.**\n\n【27】**mmHg/63 to 112 mmHg.**\n\n【28】**After admission to ED 370 min， emergent coronary angiography wasperformed via the right femoralartery.CAGshowed simultaneous CAS of Left coronary artery system and right coronary artery (Figure6A， 6C and 7A)， after intracoronary administration of nitroglycerin， there was normalization of coronary artery diameters (Figure 6B， 6D and 7B). VF did not recur. He died 6h after admission to intensive care unit because of cardiac shock， pulmonary edema.**\n\n【29】**Discussion**\n\n【30】**In the present case report showed that the spontaneous and alternate coronary artery spasm in the entire coronary artery system**\n\n【31】**caused acute anterior and inferior MI，cardiac shock， VF and cardiac arrest. To the best our knowledge， this case has never previously been reported. In the present case the patient in the ED room treated defibrillation 40 times (6 times defibrillation during CAG)， mechanical ventilation， and inotropic support.**\n\n【32】**Our patient had anterior ST elevation during an episode of chest pain implying spasm in LAD. ST elevation in the inferior leads suggesting spasm ofthe RCA. The anterior ST elevation was associated with VF， electronic storm， and the inferior leads ST elevation with cardiac arrest. At the time angiography，spasm of the triple coronary artery was relieved by intracoronay NTG. Therefore， we infer that the left and right coronary spasm in this patient is alternately occurring.**\n\n【33】**Figure 5： Electrocardiogram taken after cardiopulmonary resuscitation demonstrating sinus bradycardia， ST elevation in the inferior leads.**\n\n【34】**Figure 7： A) Left oblique projection angiograms of right coronary artery showed spasm of proximal of RCA B). normal after intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin.**\n\n【35】**There are a few reports of severe arrhythmias by simultaneous spasm of left and right coronary artery \\[3\\]. One coronary spasm induced by another one is relatively rare.**\n\n【36】**CAS is not rare in clinical， mostly occur in signal coronary artery， single site. Multivessel spasm is relatively rare. It was reported that Japanese patients with multivessel coronary spasm accounted for 8%of the 2，251 study population \\[4\\] and 5.9% of 202 patients \\[5\\]. Our patient had some typical manifestation， such as： 1) the attack occurs at rest， particularly from midnight to early morning；2) the attack is associated with STsegmentelevationtheECG. This case was diagnosed consistent with diagnostic criteria \\[6\\]. The risk of sudden death for patients with coronary vasospastic angina is approximately2% and is most common in patients with multivessel CVS. Arrhythmia caused by coronary spasm， in addition to the treated of coronary spasm， also targeted measure for different life threatening arrhythmias should be taken. This patient did not take active coronary angiograph and IABP implantation at the early stage of this case.**\n\n【37】**In conclusion， alternate multivessel CAS may lead to threatening arrhythmias： VF and cardiac arrest in patient without significant coronary stenosis. Such patients need to be aggressively treated with vasodilators. Our case stress the fact that although rare， when occurring， multivessel spasm is associated with a significant increase of the risk of clinical complications and showed therefore require careful attention.**\n\n【38】2018 Sinopec CLinical Medicine Special Scientific Research Project (ZX18001).\n\n【39】**References**\n\n【40】**1\\.

The hernia sac contents are at risk of incarceration， which maylead to more serious sequelae such as bowel obstruction，and or a circulatory strangulation of the hernia contents， leading to necrosis and possible perforation of the intestine \\[1\\]. The chance of incarceration is relativelylow， between 0.3-3% per year \\[2-4\\].**\n\n【18】**Giant inguinal hernias are defined as those extending below the midpoint of the inner thigh in the standing position. These hernias are rare，accounting for approximately 0.5% of inguinal hernias in one study \\[5\\]. The aim ofthis paper is to report on a case of massive strangulated inguinal hernia with duodenal perforation**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**A 62-year-old Hispanic male with a reported history of“testicular elephantiasis”since he was a teenager presented to a small free-standing emergency department with a complaint of groin pain. He stated that he was lifting something heavy two days prior and began having right-sided groin and testicular pain. Furthermore， he was complaining of nausea and vomiting and added that he had not passed gas or had a bowel movement for last two days. Prior to today’s visit， he had not seen a doctor in decades.**\n\n【21】**On arrival to the emergency department he appeared to be in moderate pain. His initial vital signs were as follows： temperature of 36.6°C， heart rate of 126 bpm， blood pressure of 191/119mmHg， respiratory rate of 21，and SaO， of 100 % on room air. His cardiac exam was remarkable for tachycardia. His abdominal exam was remarkable for right lower quadrant and suprapubic tenderness as well as decreased bowel sounds. His genitourinary exam demonstrated a massively distended scrotum extending to his knees with diffuse tenderness worse on right side. His lower extremity exam was unremarkable.**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： X-ray image of the Giant inguinal hernia.**\n\n【23】**He was given Morphine， Zofran， and a 1L IV fluid bolus. Significant labs were as follows： creatinine 3.4 mg/dL， BUN 36 mg/dL， glucose 135 mg/dL， lipase 2， 141 unit/L， WBC 6.5， Hgb 13.4， lactate9.9 mMol/L.A CT abdomen/pelvis with oral contrast demonstrated a massive right inguinal hernia containing parts of the stomach， all of the small bowel， part of the colon， as well as free air and fluid suggestive of perforation most likely originating from the duodenum； the appendix was not visualized with certainty (Figure 1 and 2).**\n\n【24】**He was given Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole intravenously. General surgery was then consulted and transfer was initiated to a higher acuity facility.**\n\n【25】**After transfer he was immediately taken to the operating room. During surgery he was found to have a large perforation in the second and third portion of the duodenum. He also required resection of the distal small bowel， right colon， and part of the mid transverse colon. Postoperatively he was transferred to the ICU in stable condition.**\n\n【26】**However the patient began to deteriorate throughout the night. He went into multiorgan failure requiring aggressive IV fluids， dialysis， and multiple vasopressors. Despite these efforts， lactate increased to 29.3 mMol/L and the patient went into asystolic cardiac arrest and passed away.**\n\n【27】**Discussion**\n\n【28】**Inguinal hernias account for 75% of abdominal wall hernias； with a lifetime risk of 27% in men and 3% in women \\[6\\]. They are often classified as direct or indirect， depending on whether the hernia sac bulges directly through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal(direct) or passes through the internal inguinal ring alongside the spermatic cord following the course of the inguinal canal (indirect)\\[6\\]. Inguinal hernias are reducible if they occur with straining and can be pushed back into the abdominal cavity. They are at risk of**\n\n【29】**Figure 2： CT scan showing sagittal view of the duodenal herniation.**\n\n【30】**incarceration， which occurs when the herniated bowel loops remain outside the abdominal cavity. Incarcerated hernia may lead to bowel strangulation and bowel obstruction.**\n\n【31】**Giant inguinoscrotal hernias are defined as those extending below the midpoint of the inner thigh， in the standing position \\[5\\]. The contents of giant inguinal hernias are usualy bowel loops， but there are case reports of giant hernias containing stomach， ovaries and the bladder \\[7-9\\]. They are usually recurrent hernias and reach large dimensions either because of patients'reluctance to undergo surgical treatment， or because the surgeon's advice against it due to technical difficulties such as cardiorespiratory compromise \\[5\\]. Compared to inguinal hernias， the recurrence is much higher in giant inguinoscrotal hernias. These hernias pose a significant amount of morbidity， as patients have voiding difficulty and develop urinary retention \\[10\\]， as well as scrotal skin thickening and testicular atrophy.**\n\n【32】**Traditionally giant inguinal hernias are treated with progressive pneumoperitoneum. The recommended method is by injecting 100to 500mL of air daily over 15 days through an intraperitoneal catheter\\[10\\]. Pneumoperitoneum is however not very effective because the air insufflation causes enlargement of the hernia sac， rather than the abdominal cavity. Progressive pneumoperitoneum is however contraindicated in patients with strangulated hernias and infection\\[11\\]. As these giant inguinoscrotal hernias are usually chronic， the abdominal cavity adapts to being empty and reduces its size， which is referred to as loss of domain. Sudden replacement of the large bowel contents into the abdominal cavity causes an abrupt increase in intra abdominal and intra thoracic pressure. The increased pressure can lead to an impaired diaphragmatic motion and reduced venous return. Furthermore， the distention of abdominal skin exerts tension on the postoperative wound， which significantly impairs healing \\[4\\]**\n\n【33】**Several case reports have described hemicolectomy， omenectomy， splenectomy， small bowel resection， and even phrenectomyas treatment modalities for giant inguinoscaral hernias \\[12，13\\]. The scrotal skin may be left intact because it can be used for decompression if the patient develops respiratory compromise post operatively. The post operative recovery for these patients is characterized by a prolonged duration of elective mechanical ventilation. Ventilation for a minimum period of 10 days in the intensive care unit has been suggested \\[5\\].**\n\n【34】**Given the gravity and acuity of our patient’s presentation， he underwent both a small bowel resection and partial colectomy. It is unknown if loss of domain contributed to our patient's decline given he had perforation with spillage of bowel contents at the time of surgery. To our knowledge this is the first case of perforated duodenum into the scrotum. Unfortunately， we could not save this patient despite early surgery and aggressive sepsis treatment. It is likely the patient had lived with a large inguinal hernia for a long period of time， and given the initial labs and vitals， it is very possible he presented soon after perforation. This present case suggests that a strangulated hernia with duodenal perforation into the scrotum has a very high mortality rate despite early and aggressive treatment.**\n\n【35】**Conclusion**\n\n【36】**Giant inguinoscrotal hernias are rare but they carry a high mortality and morbidity. The mainstay oftreatment remains surgical after proper stabilization of the patient. Several organs can herniate through the sac and it is important to note that small bowel can perforate into the hernia sac and further worsen the mortality**\n\n【37】**References**\n\n【38】**1\\.

While the accurate mechanism of allergy to this vaccine has not been identified， novel lipid nanoparticles containing Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) 2，000 have been suggested as the causative agent \\[3，4\\]. We herein report a case of anaphylaxis to the COVID-19mRNA vaccine.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**A 32-year-old woman was applied for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in our hospital in March 2021. She was a nurse with atopic dermatitis and with a history of anaphylaxis due to allergy to crabs and cats and an immediate hypersensitivity reaction to pesticides. She had a history of severe allergic reactions to cosmetics on her face. Five minutes after intramuscular injection of 0.3 ml vaccine， the patient complained of pharyngeal discomfort and respiratory symptoms(continuous coughing， wheezing， and dyspnea). We diagnosed her with anaphylaxis (Brighton level2) \\[5\\]. To detect a causative agent， we administered Skin Prick Tests (SPTs). Referred to the report of Banerji et al.\\[3\\]， we used PEG 4000 (Movicol) at three concentrations (2.19， 21.9， and 219 mg/ml) to diagnose allergy to PEG. We used PEG 4000 instead of PEG 3350(Miralax) because we could not get PEG 3350 in Japan. We also used the pneumococcus vaccine (Prevnar 13) in a 10x dilution (0.02 mg/ml) of polysorbate 80， an allergenic substance contained in various vaccines \\[3\\]. Subsequently， we performed SPTs for these dilutions. In addition， histamine hydrochloride (10 mg/ml) and normal saline were used as positive and negative controls， respectively \\[6\\]. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Kizawa Memorial Hospital(2021-018). The SPT for PEG 4000showed a 5 mm x4 mm erythema and a 2 mm ×1 mm wheal for the 2.19 ml/ml solution， a 7 mm x 5 mm erythema and a 3 mmx3 mm wheal in the 21.9 mg/ml solution， and a 10 mmx9 mm erythema and a 5 mmx5 mm wheal for the 219 mg/ml solution， in a dose-dependent manner(Figure 1). Histamine dihydrochloride solution showed a 25 mmx23 mm erythema and a7 mmx6 mm wheal， while normal saline showed a 5 mm×3 mm erythema and a 1 mm x1 mm wheal. The**\n\n【18】**SPT for response to 219 mg/ml of PEG4000 was positive， revealing the sensitization of the patient to PEG. The SPT for Prevnar 13° was negative， which suggests that there was no allergy to polysorbate. She denied other tests such as challenge tests to administer PEG. Thus， we finally diagnosed anaphylaxis to PEG.**\n\n【19】**Discussion**\n\n【20】**In our case， sensitization to PEG was demonstrated in a patient who developed anaphylaxis with an initial vaccination of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine， and PEG was considered as the causative substance. In previous reports， 90% of patients who developed anaphylaxis associated with the initial vaccination were also women \\[6\\]. Although the mechanism of allergy to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has not been clarified thus far， PEG is a likely causative agent \\[3，4\\]. PEG is generally recognized as a safe substance， and it is used in various applications in a wide range of products \\[7\\]. However， various case reports of immediate-type allergy to PEGs have been reported recently. Although the mechanisms underlying PEG allergy are not well understood， percutaneous sensitization likely plays a role in some cases \\[8，9\\]. In our case， due to the patient's immediate hypersensitivity reaction to cosmetics， history of atopic dermatitis， and fragile skin barrier， percutaneous sensitization to PEG via cosmetics was speculated. In addition， cross-sensitization between macrogols with various molecular weights has been reported \\[10\\]. Our patient had atopic dermatitis， and we speculated that she was to be exposed percutaneously to PEG through cosmetics daily and sensitized. Further investigations are required to fully elucidate the pathogenesis.**\n\n【21】**References**\n\n【22】1\\. Meo SA， Bukhari IA， Akram J， Meo AS， Klonoff DC.

Our patient is a 33 years old man， former smoker， with a history of multiple episodes of TLOC and elevated high-sensitive Troponin I (hs-TnI) values.**\n\n【16】**Case Report： The patient reached medical assessment after the first episode of TLOC， in 2013， when he was diagnosed with clinically suspected myocarditis due to persistently elevated hs-TnI and elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP)， and based on Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) findings. The second episode was in 2017 when clinical and additional examinations concluded for syncope. The third episode was in August 2020. All these episodes were associated with persistently elevated plasma hs-TnI concentrations.**\n\n【17】**Conclusion： in this case neuromediated syncope was responsible for the recurrent TLOCs， while persistently elevated hs-TnI levels were associated with macro-troponin complexes formation， with no evidence of pathological implication.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Macro-troponin complexes； Neuro-mediated syncope； Heterophile antibodies**\n\n【19】**Introduction**\n\n【20】**Transient Loss of Consciousness (TLOC) is defined as a state of real or apparent LOC with loss of awareness and responsiveness， often past amnesia， of short duration. Non-traumatic TLOC is classified into one of four groups： Syncope， epileptic seizures， psychogenic transient loss of consciousness， and a miscellaneous group of rare causes. Specific signs or symptoms can guide in the diagnosis of the etiology of TLOC， especially when syncope is suspected. Cardiactroponin is the most sensitive and specific available marker of ischemic and inflammatory cardiomyocyte injury， playing a central role in a wide spectrum of clinical conditions， although false positive results are described in the scientific literature. According to the Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction， detection of an elevated Tn value above the 99h percentile URL is defined as myocardial injury.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**Our patient is a 33 years old man， former smoker， with a history of multiple episodes of TLOC at rest. The first episode took place in 2013， while he was having dinner and was preceded by general discomfort. It was of short duration with rapid return to consciousness and symptoms regression. Based on blood tests， showing elevated hs-TnI and elevated CRP， and on CMR， which showed focal mid-apical anterolateral epicardial and pericardial late gadolinium enhancement， he was diagnosed with clinically suspected myocarditis. Electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiogram did not show relevant pathological findings. The second episode was in 2017， with the same characteristics as the previous one and no other associated signs or symptoms. Blood sampling confirmed persistently elevated hs-TnI values， ranging with minimum and maximum between 73.6 ng/L to 103.0 ng/L(reference values 0.0 ng/L to 34.0 ng/L)， negative inflammatory markers and weakly positive Anti-Intercalated Disk Autoantibodies (AIDA). CMR， echocardiogram， ambulatory EKG monitoring were normal. A neurological evaluation supported by electroencephalogram and brain magnetic**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Cardiac MRI 2020，ECG 2020.**\n\n【24】**resonance imaging was inconclusive， corroborating the hypothesis of syncope. In August 2020 another episode of TLOC occurred， similar to the others. He was admitted to our ward， with no noteworthy signs or symptoms. First line tests， as EKG and echocardiogram， were unremarkable，but persistently elevated plasma TnI levels were found again (hs-TnI minimum and maximum 124.9 ng/L to 150.5 ng/L， reference values 0.0 ng/L to 34.0 ng/L). To exclude structural cardiac cause of TLOC， a new CMR was performed and resulted normal. A coronary computed tomography angiography was performed to rule out coronary artery disease， and only showed an intracoronary myocardial bridge of the left anterior descending artery. In-hospital continuous rhythm monitoring was inconclusive； no brady-or tachy-arrhythmias were detected.Regarding TLOC episodes，after a negative neurological evaluation， a tilt-test examination was performed which resulted positive for symptoms and fall in blood pressure， confirming the diagnosis of neuro-mediated syncope. Regarding the persistence of elevated plasma hs-TnI levels， other causes of myocardial injury were investigated： Neither professional exposure to cardio-toxic substances nor drug abuses were found. Moreover， heterophilic antibodies interference in hs-TnI assay was excluded using HBT(“Heterophilic Blocking Tube\"， Scantibodies Laboratory， Inc.， Santee， CA， USA). Finally， further laboratory investigations revealed the presence of macro-troponin complexes leading to an increased half-life of circulating hs-TnI as well as its plasma concentrations (Figure1).**\n\n【25】**Discussion**\n\n【26】According to thiee20133European Society of Cardiology consensus， diagnostic criteria for clinically suspected myocarditis\n\n【27】**include clinical presentation (such as acute chest pain， dyspnea at rest or on exercise， unexplained arrhythmia， syncope or unexplained cardiogenic shock) and diagnostic criteria， including newly abnormal12 lead EKG， myocardiocytolysis markers elevation， functional and structural abnormalities on cardiac imaging and presence of edema and/or late gadolinium enhancement of classical myocarditic pattern at tissue characterization by CMR \\[1\\]. TnI and TnT are the preferred biomarkers for the evaluation of myocardial injury and high-sensitivity (hs-TnI) assays are recommended for routine clinical use \\[2\\]. However， these biomarkers are not specific for the etiology of injury and a wide range of conditions are known to be associated with increased troponin values. These include： myocardial injury related to acute myocardial ischemia with atherosclerotic plaque disruption with thrombosis； myocardial injury related to acute myocardial ischemia due to oxygen supply/demand imbalance(caused by reduced myocardial perfusion， e.g. in coronary artery spasm， microvascular dysfunction， coronary embolism， coronary artery dissection， sustainedbradyarrhythmia， hypotension01shock， respiratory failure， severe anemia， or caused by increased myocardial oxygen demand， e.g. in sustained tachyarrhythmia or severe hypertension with or without left ventricular hypertrophy)； other causes of myocardial injury include cardiac conditions， e.g. heart failure， myocarditis， cardiomyopathy， Takotsubo syndrome， coronary revascularizationprocedure， cardiac procedure other thanrevascularization， catheterablation， defibrillator shocks， cardiac contusion， and systemic conditions， e.g. sepsis， infectious disease， chronic kidney disease， stroke， subarachnoid hemorrhage， pulmonary embolism， pulmonary hypertension， infiltrative diseases， chemotherapeutic agents critically ill patients and strenuous exercise**\n\n【28】**\\[3\\]. Troponin kinetics in clinical context of suspected myocarditis can be similar to that observed in acute coronarysyndromes (rise and fall) or can be flat， with remittent kinetics. Sometimes troponin can be persistently negative. Different kinetics and values of troponin could provide somehints abouttheetiology，butthe clear identification of the cause usually requires a comprehensive approach including clinical， laboratory and instrumental findings. If instrumental findings don’t corroborate the diagnosis of myocarditis， despite persistently elevated troponin values， further investigations are warranted \\[4\\]. In our case both in 2017 and in 2020 CMR， echocardiogram， ambulatory EKG monitoring were normal， therefore we looked for other explanations for symptoms and troponin elevation. With regards to troponin I elevation， false positive results are described， more often associated with fibrin clots and heterophilic Ab， Human Anti-Mouse Antibodies(HAMAs) or rheumatoid factor. Autoantibodies to cTnI or cTnT have been identified in roughly 10% of the healthy population and form complexes with troponin \\[5\\]. In this case， we demonstrated that macro-troponin complexes， formed by Ab， more of ten IgG， binding to troponin， mostly TnI， may be a cause of persistent elevation of troponin levels， due to its slow plasma clearance. One of the first cases of a false-positive TnI attributed to a macro-complex was reported in 2002， with authors suggesting the possibility that a modified molecule of cTnI induced the immunocomplex formation with a molecular mass similar to that of apolipoprotein B-100， leading to interference in TnI measurement. Therefore after the exclusion of the most common and harmful clinical causes， it may be advisable to consider the possibility of false positive troponin levels， especially when values are persistently and only mildly elevated and do not match with the clinical presentation \\[6\\]. To conclude， in this specific case， the association between nonspecific signs and symptoms， like TLOC and troponin elevation， resulted as independent elements in the final clinical diagnosis.**\n\n【29】**References**\n\n【30】**1\\.

We present the case of a patient with somatic dMMR (loss of MLH1 and PMS2)， MSI-H and BRAF V-600E mutated metastatic right-sided colon cancer treated with an Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI)， who had radiological signs of Hyperprogressive Disease (HPD) with also an increase in tumour marker levels， followed by a Complete Remission (CR).**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Colorectal cancer； Hyperprogression； Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy； Microsatellite instability； Pseudoprogression**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**In patients with MSI-H CRC， Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) therapy can be an effective treatment option \\[1，2\\]. New patterns of tumour response have been seen on ICI treatment. The concept of HPD is based on a faster than expected tumour growth on ICI compared to the rate of progression on standard chemotherapy. HPD was reported in 4% to 29% of patients treated with immunotherapy \\[3\\]. It can be hard to distinguish HPD from pseudoprogression， which is a rare condition also occurring in patients treated with ICI. After an initial radiologic evaluable progressive disease， a late tumour response occurs \\[3，4\\]. The rate of pseudoprogression is ≤ 10% of patients， independent of tumour type \\[3\\].**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**The patient was initially diagnosed with stage IIIC (pT3， pN2b (8/22)， cM0) disease， treated with a right hemicolectomy and received adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin(XELOX).Due to sensory neuropathy， oxaliplatin was stopped after 4 cycles. Adjuvanttreatment was completed for total duration of 6 months with capecitabine monotherapy until September 2018. At the end ofadjuvant chemotherapy， a PET-CT showed new development ofperitoneal carcinomatosis and hepatic metastases (Figure 1). A first line PD-1-inhibitor therapy with pembrolizumab was initiated in the light of MSI-H metastatic CRC. After three doses of pembrolizumab， an early PET-CT scan was initiated due to clinical signs of disease progression with beginning bowel obstruction. At this time the tumour marker Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) had increased from 8.42 ug/l (at start of pembrolizumab) to 52.9 ug/l. The PET-CT showed metabolic and morphologic progression of peritoneal carcinomatosis， in contrast to metabolic regression but morphologic progression of hepatic metastases. At the time， we interpreted the combination of clinical findings， imaging and increasing tumour marker levels， as signs of rapid tumour progression and started a second line palliative therapy with 5-Fluoruracil， Leucovorin and Irinotecan (FOLFIRI). Treatment was stopped after two courses due to patient wish. The PET-CT after treatment stop showed minor metabolic and morphologic residuals ofthe peritoneal carcinomatosis and no evidence ofhepatic metastases， corresponding to a near Complete Remission (nCR). Tumour marker CEA had decreased to 3.25ug/l and subsequently normalized. The latest PET-CT in April 2021 showed continued CR (Figure1).**\n\n【18】**Discussion**\n\n【19】**A possible explanation for the rapid disease progression on the first restaging PET-CT after3 pembrolizumab doses is HPD on ICI therapy. It has been shown that patients with HPD had a lower frequency of new lesions compared to patients with disease progression without HPD \\[5\\].**\n\n【20】**Figure 1： PET-CT demonstrating hyper- or pseudoprogression. The PET-CT at the end of adjuvant chemotherapy (Panel A) demonstrated hypermetabolic hepatic metastases (orange arrow on maximum intensity projection -top image) and one of several hypermetabolic peritoneal masses measuring 1.9 cm， SUVmax 7.1(white arrow on PET-CT fusion- middle image and CT at same level - bottom image). After three doses of pembrolizumab and clinical signs of progression the PET-CT (Panel B) revealed metabolic and morphologic progression of peritoneal carcinomatosis with the reference mass measuring 3.9 cm， SUVmax 11.3 (white arrow on middle and bottom image) in contrast to metabolic regression of hepatic metastases (orange arrow on maximum intensity projection -top image). After two courses of a second line palliative therapy with FOLFIRI there was near complete remission with minor morphologic residuals in February 2019. The patient remained without hypermetabolic activity as demonstrated on the PET-CT in April 2021 (Panel C).**\n\n【21】**In our case， the patient had progression of peritoneal carcinomatosis on PET-CT. However， there was no clear evidence of new lesions. Another explanation for the rapid disease progression is an initial response to pembrolizumab in terms of pseudoprogression. The hypothesis is that pseudoprogression is associated with immune cells infiltrating in tumour tissue \\[3，4\\]. It remains unclear whether pseudoprogression is a result of natural tumour growth before response to ICI \\[3\\]. As our patient continues to be in CR， it seems plausible that pseudoprogression led to a durable response， which resolved in CR. The role of FOLFIRI remains unclear： Whether the chemotherapy induced a tumour response by itself or in combination with the previous immunotherapy. First line chemotherapy with FOLFIRI has a CR rate of about 5%\\[6\\]. Recently， the second interim analysis of the KEYNOTE-177 study was published. The open-label phase III trial enrolled 307 previously untreated patients with MSI-H/dMMR metastatic CRC. The patients were randomized 1：1 to first-line pembrolizumab for up to 2 years or investigator’s choice of FOLFIRI or modified FOLFOX6 (5-Fluorouracil， Leucovorin and Oxaliplatin) with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab. The median PFS was 16.5 months for the pembrolizumab group vs. 8.2months for the chemotherapy group (Hazard Ratio \\[HR\\]， 0.60； 95%**\n\n【22】**CI， 0.45 to 0.80； P=0.0002)， OS data are not available yet. Overall response rate was 43.8% for the pembrolizumab group vs. 33.1% in the chemotherapy group， with CR as best response in 11.1% vs. 3.9%of patients， respectively \\[7\\]. In an update of the CheckMate 142 trial， comparing the combination of nivolumab and low-dose ipilimumab with nivolumab monotherapy as first line treatment in patients with MSI-H/dMMR metastatic CRC， the combination treatment achieved an objective response rate of 64% by investigator assessment and a disease control rate of 84%. OS and PFS is not reached yet \\[8，9\\]. Final results from CheckMate 142 and KEYNOTE-177 are still pending， suggesting possibly durable responses in a subgroup of patients\\[7，8，10\\]. In our case， CEA levels increased during treatment with pembrolizumab， CEA levels dropped from 52.9 ug/l to 23.2 ug/l two weeks after starting FOLFIRI， and continued to decrease until normalization in March 2019 and continue to be in the normal range as of April 2021. The rising tumour marker CEA remains unclear. It has been demonstrated in a small group of patients with dMMR/MSI-H CRC that the degree of CEA decline after one dose of pembrolizumab was predictive of PFS and OS， the CEA response occurred prior to radiographic confirmation of disease control(range， 10 to 35 weeks)\\[2\\].**\n\n【23】**Conclusion**\n\n【24】**We think that the clinical course and ongoing response in our patient is more likely the result of PD1-inhibitor therapy with pembrolizumab and not of chemotherapy with FOLFIRI. This hypothesis is supported byhigher CR rates in patients with metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC treated with PD1-inhibitor therapy and the unique patterns of response resulting from immunotherapy. We believe that the scenario described in our case is relevant and that physicians should be aware of the possibility of misleading early signs for disease progression. Importantly， ICI treatment should only be continued in case the patient is clinically well， because pseudoprogression generally is not very common. Distinction between pseudoprogression and HPD remains a challenge and we envision that data from large trials will help to further characterize these events.**\n\n【25】**References**\n\n【26】**1\\.

Currently， high fat and high protein are used as nutritional therapy for COPD， but there is often no improvement trend. Therefore， this time， we suggested that COPD was improved by ingesting platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks in addition to conventional nutritional therapy. Since COPD may cause lung cancer in the future， it is necessary to control the exacerbation of COPD. In general， cancer is caused by a large amount of active oxygen produced from lifestyle-related habits， especially bad eating habits. Therefore， in addition to improving nutrition， it is necessary to actively ingest antioxidant nutrients in order to appropriately remove active oxygen， which is said to increase the risk of cancer. Platinum-palladium containing soft drinks was invented by Japanese doctor Hideyo Noguchi. There are four types of active oxygen. Our research group at Tokai University has found that platinum-palladium has the ability to remove all four types of active oxygen. Platinum-palladium was found to be the only substance， as no other substance in the world has been identified that removes this entire reactive oxygen species. The improvement in COPD by taking platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks in addition to general nutritional therapy may reduce the risk of lung cancer.**\n\n【20】**Keywords： COPD； Lung cancer； Platinum-paladium-containing soft drinks； Functional nutrient water； Active oxygen； Antioxidant； AMPK**\n\n【21】**Introduction**\n\n【22】**COPD is an abbreviation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and is a type of chronic respiratory disease. COPD is a disease characterized by shortness of breath by causing destruction and inflammation of the alveoli， as well as coughing and sputum， and irreversible progression. Many COPDs are often derived from smoking， but some can also be caused by environmental impacts \\[1，2\\]. Currently， no effective treatment method has been established for COPD， and it is said that there is no choice but to inhale oxygen and maintain/improve QOL in conservative therapy\\[3\\]. Epidemiologically， it is said to be the third leading cause of death in the world as predicted by World Health Organization (WHO) by 2030 \\[4\\]. Epidemiological studies have also suggested that COPD has a high risk of developing lung cancer \\[5\\]. Various treatments such as administration of steroids have been tried for COPD， but this time we report a case in which the symptoms of COPD improved in a patient who took platinum-palladium. In addition， prior to this case， Dr. Taro Shirakawa of Japan reported that when platinum palladium was administered to patients with COPD，improvement tended to occur in approximately 40% to 50% of patients.**\n\n【23】**What is platinum and palladium?**\n\n【24】**Platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks are sold as PAPLAL as soft drinks (functional nutrient water) in Japan. This is a colloidal form of platinum and palladium (A solution ofplatinum and palladium mixed at a ratio of 1：3)， which was invented by Hideyo Noguchi， a Japanese doctor. It is expected to have various effects such as induction of apoptosis of gastric cancer and colorectal**\n\n【25】**cancer and activation of NK cells (Both of no submission). Platinum-palladium is completely new functional nutrient water that has never been seen before. Platinum is a chemically extremely stable element and is used for various purposes. In the medical field，the complex is used as an anticancer agent \\[6\\]. Other utilization methods focusing on the antioxidant effect of platinum have been reported \\[7\\]. Palladium is one of the platinum group elements and is widely used as a material for industrial products \\[8\\] and dental treatments \\[9\\]. In addition， it has been reported that palladium has the effect of imparting reducing power to platinum involved in the reduction reaction again \\[10\\]，and attempts have been made to utilize a substance in which platinum and palladium are mixed \\[11\\]. Due to the chemical reaction and specificity of both elements， a mixture of platinum and palladium is expected to be useful as a substance having a long-lasting antioxidant capacity as compared with the case of platinum alone \\[11\\]. It is also known that platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks moderately remove all four types of active oxygen \\[12\\]. As far as the literature is concerned， there is no other substance that re-moves all four types of active oxygen (generally four types of superoxide anion radical， hydroxyl radical， H2O2， and singlet oxygen \\[13\\]). Therefore， this time， we investigated how much AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase)， which is said to be related to the improvement of COPD， is activated by platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks. We also examined whether this would actually improve COPD.**\n\n【26】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【27】**Examination of AMPK activity with platinum-palladium containing drinks water**\n\n【28】**In this experiment， the CycLex AMPK Kinase Assay Kit(MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL Laboratories Co.， ltd. Tokyo， Japan) was used as per the standard method， and the PBS-added group was used for the AMPK activity in the platinum-palladium--containing drinks added group (final concentration 1%). As a control， a purchased human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) was used for comparative evaluation. In this kit， in order to measure the current amount of AMPK activity， the activity of AMPK was confirmed 1h， 12 h， and 24 h after the addition. In addition， the evaluation was performed statistically by the Mann-Whitney U test using statistical processing software (IBM SPSS Statistics Ver.26).**\n\n【29】**Results**\n\n【30】**Examination of AMPK activity by platinum-palladium**\n\n【31】**When AMPK activity was measured， Mann-Whitney U test was performed in all groups 1 h， 12 h， and 24 h after the addition and an increase in activity was observed at a significance level of 1% (Table1 and Figure 1).**\n\n【32】**Examples of COPD improvement in platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks**\n\n【33】**Men in their 80 years' old**\n\n【34】**Height 162 cm， weight 52 kg**\n\n【35】**Smoking history： 15 cigarettes a day， 40 years.**\n\n【36】**COPD onset age： 70 years.**\n\n【37】**Underlying disease： Emphysema， hypertension**\n\n【38】**Current disease： COPD**\n\n【39】Platinum & Palladium intake： 18 ml/day (6 ml/1 vial× 3\n\n【40】**vial)**\n\n【41】**Duration： 18 months**\n\n【42】**Oxygen saturation： Sp02<90% (mean， 88%) before the start of treatment SpO2>98%， decrease of sputum， and better going up and down the stairs after using platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks.**\n\n【43】**Course**\n\n【44】**Before the start of treatment， oxygen was inhaled with almost no movement due to respiratory distress， but after the treatment， rehabilitation， andwalking became possible without oxygen inhalation. It is still in good condition. Therefore， it is considered that COPD has been improved.**\n\n【45】**Discussion**\n\n【46】**It was suggested that platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks(functional nutrient water) are an effective treatment method for COPD in this case. COPD is said to have a high risk of developing lung cancer \\[14\\]. Therefore， it was suggested that the improvement of COPD in platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks this time may lead to the prevention of lung cancer. Currently， COPD is being treated with a focus on conservative therapy， with the intention of not exacerbating it， but it is difficult to improve it. However， since improvement of SpO2 was observed in this case， it is possible that lung function may be improved. The mechanism is still unknown， but we considered the possibility. Although COPD is often induced by smoking \\[2\\]， a large amount of active oxygen may be produced as an effect of smoking \\[15\\]. While active oxygen releases inflammatory cytokines and has a good side as a system to protect the body \\[16\\]， excess active oxygen adversely affects normal cells and causes lifestyle-related diseases， aging， COPD， etc. It is known \\[17\\]. Platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks were used in this case， but since platinum-palladium causes moderate antioxidants as described above， it is possible that only unnecessary active oxygen was removed without removing even the necessary active oxygen. It is possible that this led to the improvement of COPD. Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is**\n\n【47】**Table 1：Absorbance of hourly control group and Platinum-Palladium-containing soft drinks added group.**\n\n【48】**1)Absorbance.**\n\n| **1hr**  |  | **12 hr**  |  | **24 hr**  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Cnt**  | **Pt：Pe**  | **Cnt**  | **Pt：Pd**  | **Cnt**  | **Pt：Pe**  |\n| **0.285±0.013**  | **2.308±0.223**  | **0.352±0.019**  | **2.689±0.447**  | **0.264±0.034**  | **2.341±0.082**  |\n| **2) AMPK activity increase rate when Cnt is 100%.**  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| **1hr**  |  | **12 hr**  |  | **24 hr**  |  |\n| **Cnt**  | **Pt：Pd**  | **Cnt**  | **Pt：Pd**  | **Cnt**  | **Pt：Pe**  |\n| **100%**  | **809.80%**  | **100%**  | **763.92%**  | **100%**  | **886.74%**  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【50】**Figure 1： Rate of increase in AMPK activity in the control group and Platinum-Palladium-containing soft drinks added group at each time (Mann-Whitney U test，P<0.01).**\n\n【51】**an enzyme that metabolizes heme to biliverdin/bilirubin (antioxidant effect)， carbon monoxide (CO， anti-inflammatory effect/anti-cell death effect)， and Fe2+/ferritin. It has physiological activities such as protective action and is considered to be related to the maintenance of homeostasis of the living body \\[18\\]. HO-1 expression is reduced in patients with COPD \\[19\\]. It is possible that a large amount of active oxygen is produced by inflammation of various factors in the lungs， and as a result， the expression of this HO-1 is reduced. It is possible that the removal of active oxygen with platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks normalized the expression of HO-1， that is， the maintenance of homeostasis led to the improvement of COPD. It is considered necessary to study the expression of HO-1 in the future. When the activities of AMPK by platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks were con-firmed at the in vitro level， AMPK activity was confirmed at a significance level of 1% in all groups. AMPK(AMP-activated protein kinase) is an energy sensor in the body and is a serine/threonine kinase that works to maintain homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism \\[20\\]. It is said that activation of AMPK regulates energy metabolism and maintains energy homeostasis and is attracting attention as a potential therapeutic effect for metabolic diseases including type 2 Diabetes and cancer \\[21\\]. The presence of energy is indispensable for humans to live， and the energy source is ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)， and when ATP is hydrolyzed and converted to ADP (Adenosine Di-Phosphate)， Energy is generated\\[22\\]. By adjusting this ATP level， AMPK is expected to maintain homeostasis and be effective against metabolic diseases such as cancer， type II diabetes， and obesity \\[23-25\\]. In other words， it is considered that the prevention of lifestyle-related diseases including cancer can be expected by increasing the activity of AMPK. It is thought that AMPK regulates metabolism by inhibiting the ATP consumption pathway. It has been reported that AMPK activity reduces abnormal inflammatory response and cell aging， leading to COPD treatment\\[26\\]， suggesting that platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks may play a part in improving COPD.**\n\n【52】**Conclusion**\n\n【53】**Although the actions of platinum-palladium-containing soft drinks (functional nutrient water) are largely unknown， there are many reports that COPD was actually improved. In the future， by pursuing the test values related to COPD and the action at the in vitro level and elucidating the mechanism， it is possible that it will become a COPD therapeutic drug in the future.**\n\n【54】**Institutional Review Board Statement**\n\n【55】**This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Hinokosei clinic**\n\n【56】**Ethics Committee (HKC\\_N10012020)**\n\n【57】**Acknowledgment**\n\n【58】**Part of this research was conducted by the Tokai University Life Science Integration Support Center.

Her UC symptoms were alleviated after administration of mesalazine， however， she was repeatedly found to have abnormal liver function. The diagnosis of Cholangiocellular Carcinoma (CCC) was made via ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical data of the patient was retrospectively analyzed and relevant literature was reviewed to investigate the possibility for Ulcerative Colitis (UC) to progress to Cholangiocellular Carcinoma (CCC). A review of the literature suggested that UC is commonly associated with concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis， which progresses to CCC in 11% of cases. Clinicians should be aware that UC may progress to CCC.UC patients with recurrent abnormalliver function， especially in those with serum alkaline phosphatase elevation， should undergo relevant examinations to clarify diagnosis.**\n\n【11】**Keywords： Ulcerative colitis； Primary sclerosing cholangitis； Cholangiocellular carcinoma**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is the most common hepatobiliarycomplication related to ulcerative colitis (UC). The majority of PSC cases ultimately progress to end-stage liver disease， and~11% are associated with concomitant Cholangiocellular Carcinoma (CCC). This study provides a clinical analysis of a UC patient with concomitant CCC and a review of relevant literature was conducted to raise awareness regarding possible progression of UC to CCC.**\n\n【14】**Case Presentation**\n\n【15】**General data**\n\n【16】**A 24-year-old female patient was admitted to Zhongshan hospital due to recurrent abnormal liver function over a period of 14 years and upper abdominal pain for over 1 month. She was treated with mesalazine after the diagnosis of UC in 1999. Several follow-up examinations revealed elevated Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)， Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)， Alkaline Phosphatase(ALP)， and y-Glutamyl Transpeptidase (GGT). Specifically， ALP and GGT were elevated to2-3-fold of the Upper Limit of Normal (ULN). During regular follow-ups， the patient did not report any symptoms of discomfort such as bloating or abdominal pain； no nausea， vomiting or anorexia； no fever， rash or xanthochromia ofthe skin and sclera. No further diagnosis or treatment was commenced. In 2009， her UC was well controlled and the dose of mesalazine was gradually reduced to withdrawal. Six months after withdrawal of mesalazine， repeat liver function tests showed elevated liver enzymes， especially ALP and GGT， which were 1-2-fold of ULN. The patient sought medical attention， but the subsequent liver biopsy did not reveal any obvious abnormalities. She was given intermittent， symptomatic treatment for liver dysfunction. In February 2015， the patient experienced postprandial upper abdominal pain. The patient denied acid reflux， belching， nausea， vomiting， diarrhea， fever， rash， jaundice， joint pain and other discomforts. She visited a local hospital and liver function tests showed： total bilirubin 21 umol/L， conjugated bilirubin 14umol/l， albumin 42 g/l， ALT 117 IU/l， AST 131 IU/l and ALP 962 IU/l. She tested negative for hepatitis A， B， C and E viral markers. Gastroscopy showed superficial gastritis， polypoid bulge，and erosion in the gastric antrum， and cardiac polyp (most likely inflammatory). Gastric antral mucosal biopsy showed severe active chronic superficial inflammation with mucosal erosion. Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly， diffuse liver lesion， hypoechoic mass in the left hepatic lobe，and gallbladder wall edema. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT showed focal liver lesions， suspicious for neoplastic lesions， likely atypical hemangioma or bile-duct-derived tumors. To clarify the nature**\n\n【17】**Figure 1： (A) Large liver lesion onthe left hepatic lobe with in distinct boundary， measured approximately 7.1 x 5.1 cm in size； heterogeneous high signal on T2-weighted imaging and (B) high signal on diffusion-weighted imagingi (C) MRCP revealed irregular intrahepatic bile duct stricture； (D) contrast-enhanced arterial phase lesions presented with peripheral irregular enhancement；(E，F) CTA of the hepatic artery and CTV of the portal vein， hepatic vein and hepatic artery indicated invasion of the left hepatic artery， left and middle hepatic veins， and left hepatic portal vein， with blurred boundaries.**\n\n【18】**of focal liver lesions， the patient was admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology of Zhongshan hospital. Since the onset of disease， she maintained a clear state of consciousness with normal mental health and appetite， sufficient sleep， normal urination and defecation， and denies significant weight fluctuation.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound for liver imaging showed multiple solid lesions in the left lobe， highly suspicious for MT (cholangiocyte-derived)； embolization of the left portal vein； and porta hepatis lymphadenopathy. Computed Tomographic Angiography(CTA) of thehepatic artery and Computed Tomography Venography (CTV) of the portal vein， hepatic vein and inferior vena cava revealed invasion ofthe left hepatic artery，left and middle hepatic veins， and left portal vein. Nuclear medicine imaging of systemic cancer by Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT indicated high suspicion for MT in the left lobe with intrahepatic metastasis， and porta hepatis， retroperitoneal and thoracic lymph node metastases， as well as abdominal and pelvic implantation metastases， with a small amount of peritoneal fluid.**\n\n【26】**Diagnosis and Treatment**\n\n【27】**The patient presented with progressive jaundice after admission. A Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangial Drainage (PTCD) was performed on March 17， 2015. Intra-operative cholangiography revealed a slight right intrahepatic bile duct dilatation and irregular right hepatic duct stricture. Jaundice was alleviated following PTCD.**\n\n【28】**Discussion**\n\n【29】**Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is an immune-mediated and non-specific inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by repeated recurrence and chronicity， including UC and Crohn's disease. It is reported that 21-47% of IBD cases are associated with extra intestinal manifestations \\[1，2\\]. Extra intestinal manifestations involving the skin， eyes， and joints are often presented in parallel with disease activity of IBD， while hepatobiliary system diseases such as PSC， small-duct PSC， primary biliary cirrhosis， non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases， and cholelithiasis are inconsistent with IBD progression but generally occur independent of intestinal inflammation. PSC is an unexplained chronic cholestaticliver disease characterized by progressive inflammation， fibrosis and multiple stenosis of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct systems. PSC is currently well recognized as the most common hepatobiliary complication ofIBD. The relationship between PSCand IBD has been reported mainly in Western countries. Up to 80% of PSC cases are associated with IBD in Northern Europe and the United States. The incidence of IBD-PSC is 50% in Southern Europe and 35% in Asia， reported mainly in Japan and Korea. Few studies have been reported in China， of which， recent reports on the incidence of IBD-PSC were single-center studies with small sample size. Despite large differences in the results， the incidence of IBD-PSC is significantly lower in China compared to that of Europe and the United States \\[3，4\\]. In other countries， 1.4-7.5% of IBD patients develop concomitant PSC**\n\n【30】**during disease progression， with a UC incidence of 2.0-7.5% and a CD incidence of 1.4-3.4% \\[5\\]. Similar results have been obtained by recent studies in China \\[6\\].**\n\n【31】**The pathogenesis of PSC-IBD remainsunclear. From a microbiology viewpoint，IBD is diagnosed when permeability of the intestinal-mucosal barrier increases， allowing bacterial endotoxins and toxic cholic acids concentration to increase in the blood， then transported to the liver to activate Kupffer cells， triggering inflammatory mediators (eg. tumor necrosis factor)， facilitating bile duct damage and hyperplasia resembling the pathological changes in PSC. This point of view is supported by the finding of intestinal bacilli in the portal veins of an animal model， although the exact pathogenesis remains unclear \\[7\\].**\n\n【32】**Significantly diverse clinical manifestations can be found in PSC， which may range from asymptomatic to recurrent episodes of jaundice， fatigue， anorexia， weight loss， abdominal pain， pruritus， hepatosplenomegaly， ascites， fever and diarrhea. Most PSC patients are asymptomatic upon diagnosis， but merely presents with elevation of serum ALP or other biochemical indices of hepatic function. Thus， PSC is easily over looked， leading to clinical misdiagnosis. Clinical awareness should be stressed in IBD patients with persistent abnormalities of liver function， especially those with persistent ALP elevation， for possible diagnosis of concomitant PSC. Current diagnosis of PSC is based primarily on imaging studies. Although Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) remains the gold standard \\[8\\] for diagnosis， its invasive nature can lead to serious complications. Owing to its non-invasiveness and ease of operation， Magnetic Resonance Cholangiography (MRCP) is increasingly used for diagnosis of PSC， with a sensitivity of 80%and specificity of 90% \\[9\\]. The typical pathological feature of PSC is the “onion-skin\"type bile duct fibrosis. This pathological change can be used as the basis for diagnosis and determination of lesion severity. However， such pathological feature only applies to 10% of PSC patients， thus limits its diagnostic value. Research has shown that liver biopsy cannot provide additional diagnostic information for IBD patients after being examined by cholangiography \\[10\\]. Therefore， liver biopsy is not recommended for patients with typical lesions evident on cholangiography \\[11\\]. Liver biopsy needs to be further considered only when the diagnosis by ERCP is inconclusive. The patient reported in this study had a 14-years history of UC and previouslytreated with mesalazine for an extended period of time. During the course of disease， her liver function was repeatedly found to be abnormal， with prominent elevation of ALP and GGT， without obvious clinical manifestations. She was misdiagnosed with mesalazine-induced liver damage， without further relevant examinations. After admission to our hospital， MRCP showed irregular intrahepatic biliary stricture (Figure 1E and 1F). Cholangiography during PTCD showed right intrahepatic bile duct dilatation and irregular right hepatic duct stricture. No abnormalities was reported by the liver biopsy. However， as previously discussed， liver biopsy poses limitations and therefore， the patient was still considered to have UC with concomitant development of PSC.**\n\n【33】**PSC has a poor prognosis， with an average survival period of9.6-18 years. The risk ratio of PSC associated with various malignant tumors is 13-14%； most commonly CCC (11%) followed by colorectal carcinoma (9%). Other concomitant malignancies include hepatocellular carcinoma， gallbladder carcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma \\[9\\]. Progression of PSC into CCC occurs mainly in patients**\n\n【34】**with history of IBD of over 15 years， or patients who have pancolitis， regardless of disease severity \\[12\\]. CCC-PSC is present in adolescents as well as adults \\[13\\]. After admission to our hospital， MRCP， contrast-enhanced ultrasound and PET-CT all suggested bile-duct-derived malignancy in our patient. Hence， she was considered to have developed concomitant PSC during the course of UC， which further progressed to CCC. Since the patient evident distant metastases， she was diagnosed with end-stage CCC.**\n\n【35】**Currently， there are no available treatment that can alter disease progression or the natural course of PSC. Studies have shown thatlow-dose ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA； 13-15 mg/kg/day) has a positive role in improving liver function in patients with PSC， whilehigh-dose UDCA (28 mg/kg/day-30 mg/kg/day) does not provide additional benefits \\[14\\]. Recent clinical follow-up studies with large samples have indicated that although UDCA can improve biochemical indices for PSC patients， it has no effect on liver histology and no significant impact on mortality， need for liver transplantation， and prognosis of CCC \\[15\\]. Endoscopic intervention and surgical procedures can alleviate biliary obstruction and reduce liver damage to a certain extent， however， liver transplantation is still preferred for end-stage PSC or CCC-PSC. Liver transplantation is the only effective treatment， with 5-and 10-year survival rates of 85% and 70% post-transplantation， respectively. Unfortunately， our patient had distant metastases and liver transplantation was contraindicated，thus， only interventional therapy was applied to alleviate her symptoms.**\n\n【36】**AN Ananthakrishnan“et al.”\\[16\\] reported that patients with IBD-PSC had significantly increased overall risk of cancers including cholangiocarcinoma compared to patients without PSC. Tsuchiya“et al.”\\[17\\] reported a case of concomitant colitic cancer and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in a patient with history of UC recently. Clinicians should be aware of the disease and closely monitor UC patients who repeatedly have abnormal liver function test results. Specifically， in patients with persistent ALP elevation， MRCP or ERCP should be employed to clarify diagnosis and provide timely intervention when necessary.**\n\n【37】**Research Funding**\n\n【38】**National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81370549).**\n\n【39】**References**\n\n【40】1\\.

After six direct current shocks and 10 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation she had return of spontaneous circulation and regained consciousness. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal left ventricular eiection fraction and a mildly dilated left atrium. The mitral valve was thickened with myxomatous degeneration (Barlow’s disease) and moderate regurgitation secondarytobileaflet prolapse. Cardiac catheterization showed no coronary artery disease while left ventriculography revealed a mildly dilated left ventricle with preserved systolic function and high-end diastolic pressures. Cardiac MRI revealed an enlarged left ventricle with Mitral Valve (MV) prolapse and moderate to severe Mitral Regurgitation (MR). There were no features suggestive of a specific cardiomyopathy other than her valvular heart disease. The patient had an uneventful hospitalization， received an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD)， and eventually had MV repair surgery. In this article we also review the literature regarding similar cases and record important data for the epidemiology of the disease and the important research that has been carried out in the identification of prognostic imaging factors and the genetic background of these patients. We emphasize once again that it is especially important to be able to timely identify patients with mitral regurgitation who are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death so that immediate and effective treatment can be offered.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**Patient presentation**\n\n【19】**A 44-year-old patient was transferred to the Accident and Emergency Department of Nicosia General Hospital after suffering an out of hospital cardiorespiratory arrest during anaerobic exercise at the gym. The patient reported weakness and dizziness before she lost consciousness. A bystander nurse initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Ventricular fibrillation was recorded as the initial rhythm upon connecting to an external defibrillator by the paramedics. After six direct current shocks， 10 min of CPR， the administration of 2 mg adrenaline IV and 300 mg amiodarone IV， the patient had Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) and regained consciousness， upon arrival at the emergency department. She reported a past medical history of mitral valve prolapse and migraines with occasional use of analgesics. She is an active tobacco smoker. She denied any history of chest discomfort，palpitations， and shortness of breath， nausea or vomiting， either at stress or at rest. There was no recent febrile illness， gastroenteritis， or rashes. She is a mother of 5 children and has 1 previous miscarriage. There is no family history of heart disease or sudden cardiac death. On clinical examination she was a febrile； heart rate was 88 beats per minute， blood pressure 122/77mmHg and had an oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Her cardiac examination revealed normal Sl and S2 with a mid-systolic click and a late systolic murmur best heard at the apex of the heart. There were normal breathing sounds， no peripheral edema， and normal peripheral pulses. Her neurologic examination was normal with GCS 15/15 and normal cranial nerve exam.**\n\n【20】**Initial work up**\n\n【21】**_cited._**\n\n【22】**The Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm， normal axis with normal QRS and QTc intervals with infrequent ventricular ectopic beats. Shallow negative T waves were noted in lead III，**\n\n【23】**Figure 2： Echocardiographic parasternal long-axis view showing moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.**\n\n【24】**LV： Left Ventricle： LA： Left Atrium； Ao： Aortic Root**\n\n【25】**and biphasic T waves in lead aVF (Figure1). Blood tests were normal with normal arterial blood gasses while her chest X-ray showed an increased cardiothoracic index. Inpatient Holter monitoring revealed a 2% burden of ventricular ectopy (singlets and couplets) of primarily a single morphology. A transthoracic cardiac ultrasound revealed an Ejection Fraction (EF) of 55% to 60%， a mildly dilated Left Atrium(LA)， normal Right Atrium (RA) and a normal trileaflet Aortic Valve(AV). The mitral valve was thickened with myxomatous degeneration(Barlow’s disease) and a moderate Mitral Valve Regurgitation (MR) with a predominately anteriorly directed jet. Moderate bileaflet prolapse was also present. There were only traces of Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR) with normal Right Ventricular Systolic Pressure(RVSP). No pericardial effusion was noted (Figure 2). Due to her presentation with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest， she had an emergency coronary angiogram which showed normal coronary tree anatomy and no coronary lesions of concern. Left ventriculography showed a mildly dilated ventricle with preserved systolic function and high-end diastolic pressures. There was an angiographically severe mitral valve regurgitation and a large left atrium (Figure 3).**\n\n【26】**Diagnosis and managemeni**\n\n【27】**Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography confirmed that moderate MR was present. The Regurgitant volume (Rvol) was30 ml with a vena contract a of 0.3 cm and Effective Regurgitant Orifice (ERO) of 20 mm. The mitral valve was myxomatous with bileaflet prolapse (Figure 4， 5). For further evaluation of the MR， exercise treadmill testing was utilized using the standard Bruce protocol. The patient was exercised for 6 min achieving a maximum heart rate of 95 bpm， whist on b blocker therapy. There was normal**\n\n【28】**Figure 3： Cardiac Catheterization.

There were multiple PVCs and couplets at peak stress. The echo images showed moderate to severe mitral valve insufficiency at peak exercise and RVSP increased to 50mmHg from 30 mmHg at rest. The patient subsequently underwent a cardiac MRI which showed a severely enlarged left ventricle with normal wall thickness and a mildly affected systolic performance. Localized hypokinesia of the mid anterolateral wall segment ofthe left ventricle was present. Theleft atrium exhibited increased dimensions. There was leaflet mitral valve prolapse with moderate to severe MR(Barlows disease， Figure 6).**\n\n【33】**Follow up**\n\n【34】**The patient had an uneventful hospitalization， and following a multidisciplinary heart team discussion， an ICD was implanted. The decision for this was based on the circumstances of her presentation**\n\n【35】**Figure 6： Cardiac magnetic resonance image showing mitral regurgitation. A. CMR showing the four-chamber view in ventricular diastole.B. CMR showing the four chamber in ventricular systole with mitral regurgitation present.**\n\n【36】**with a malignant arrhythmia and the fact that she was a survivor of an arrhythmogenic cardiac arrest. The patient was discharged 12days after admission and referred for a surgical mitral valve repair. Metoprolol was also prescribed at discharge. The patient eventually had an MV repair surgery with exceptionally good results (Figure7). With regards to recurrence of significant cardiac arrhythmias， the patient developed recurrent and highly symptomatic episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation， which were successfully suppressed with a combination of bisoprolol and propafenone. There has been no documented recurrence of a notable ventricular arrhythmia following her surgery as seen on her scheduled and frequent ICD checks (Figure8). Furthermore， her burden of ventricular ectopy remains low.**\n\n【37】**Genetic studies**\n\n【38】**The patient was genetically investigated with Next Generation Sequencing of a panel of 72 genes， which are known to be implicated in inherited cardiac conditions (not shown). Two variants were of particular nterest， which were further validated by Sanger sequencing(Table 1， 2). In the MYPN gene， exon 19， variant c.3793G>A， p.Ala1265Thr was detected. In Silico analysis shows it is extremely rare and classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) in the ClinVar database and likely pathogenic in the VarSome database. Importantly， a known pathogenic variant reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) affected the same amino acid residue， but substituting alanine with proline， in an Asian female patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \\[1\\]. She was first diagnosed at age 28-yrs and was compound heterozygote for another variant in the second allele of the same gene， MYPN， thus suggesting recessive inheritance. A second variant in our patient was in the TMPO gene， exon 4， substituting aspartate with glycine，c.1970A>G， p.Asp657Gly. VarSome classifies it as of VUS， and mutation taster classifies it as a polymorphism. The mother of the patient carries only**\n\n【39】**mutation in the TMPO gene， and she is healthy at age 68-yrs. Three children of the patient， a son and daughter from a first marriage and a son from a second marriage， aged 22， 21 and 29-yrs respectively， have inherited both variants and are mainly healthy， with the 22-yo son manifesting mild mitral valve regurgitation. Two other sons， one from each marriage aged 23 and 27-yo，are healthy and have inherited neither of the variants. It is not easy to attribute causality to either of the two DNA variants， thus reiterating previous similar experience by many authors in this field. Reduced penetrance is certainly a likely explanation of the lack of obvious past family history. If only digenic inheritance is sufficient and necessary to produce a perceptible phenotype， might also explain this lack of past history， while the three children who by chance co-inherited both linked variants， may be at increased risk and require close clinical monitoring. Overall， the genetics findings， although not conclusive， might suggest that digenic inheritance is responsible for the phenotype， implicating genes previously linked to dilated cardiomyopathy， thus expanding the phenotypic spectrum of variants and mutations in these genes. An alternative to digenic inheritance might be that the variant in the MYPN gene is pathogenic and the variant in the TMPO gene acts more like a genetic modifier. A genetic modifier is a DNA variant with no effect on its own， but which could exacerbate or even precipitate the phenotype when co-inherited on the background of another condition \\[2\\].**\n\n【40】**Alimitation of this work is the absence of unequivocal segregation of the phenotype with the genetic findings， which may be resolved in the future if one or more of the younger members develop pathognomonic clinical features，hopefully not a fatal cardiac arrest. The literature is not particularly helpful in further resolving the genetic uncertainty， as many genes have been shown to be mutated in patients with MVP while incomplete penetrance， or age-dependent penetrance， is the norm. More genes that may play a role either following Mendelian inheritance or following digenic inheritance are to be discovered through contemporary parallel sequencing of panels of genes or through whole exome and whole genome sequencing.**\n\n【41】**Revie w of the Literature**\n\n【42】**Definition of m itral valve prolapse**\n\n【43】**Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) is a valvular heart disease in which one (asymmetrical) or both (symmetrical) leaflets of the mitral valve are displaced more than 2 mm above the mitral annulus into the left atrium during systole. Because of the bulging into the left atrium the valve does not close tightly， causing variable degree of valve regurgitation. According to the thickness of the leaflets， MVP is classified as classic (>5 mm) and non-classic (<5 mm) MVP. Mitral valve prolapse is also known as click-murmur syndrome， Barlows syndrome， or floppy valve syndrome \\[3，4\\]. During heart auscultation， a mid-systolic click， followed by a late systolic murmur is heard at the apex. The duration of the murmur is prolonged by standing and Valsalva maneuver and the systolic click is heard earlier.**\n\n【44】**Epidemiology of mitral valve prolapse and sudden cardiac death (SCD)**\n\n【45】**Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) affects 2% to 3% of the general population \\[5\\]. Patients maypresent with a variety of clinical scenarios ranging from mild， nonspecific symptoms to decompensated heart failure， endocarditis， malignant arrhythmias， and sudden cardiac death. The incidence of SCD in patients with MVP in the general population has been calculated up to 0.3% to 0.4% yearly \\[6-8\\]. MVP has been recognized in a recent study as the third most**\n\n【46】**Figure 8： Prognostic factors related to arrhythmogenic mitral valve prolapse.**\n\n【47】**Table 1： Variants detected.**\n\n| **Gene-Exon**  | **Mutation**  | **dbSNP**  | **MAF**  | **Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD)**  |  | **ClinVar**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **MYPN (Exon 19)**  | **c.3793G>A，** **p.Ala1265Thr**  | **rs199476416**  | **0.00000**  | **Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy， reported in female patient with c.3793G>** **C，p.Ala1265Pro**  |  | **Uncertain** **significance**  |\n| **TMPO (Exon 4)**  | **c.1970A>G.** **p.Asp657Gly**  | **No data**  | **No data**  | **Not founc**  |  | **No data**  |\n\n【49】**Table 2： Prediction.**\n\n| **Gene-Exon**  | **Mutation**  | **Varsome**  |  | **Mutation Taster**  | **SIFT**  | **Polyphen**  | **Grantham Score**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **MYPN (Exon 19)**  | **c.3793G>A， p.Ala1265Thr**  | **Likely pathogenic**  |  | **Disease causing**  | **Tolerated (0.51)**  | **Probably damaging(1.0)**  | **58.0**  |\n| **TMPO (Exon 4)**  | **c.1970A>G， p.Asp657GlyUncertain significance**  |  |  | **Polymorphism**  | **Tolerated (0.07)**  | **Benign (0.089)**  | **94.0**  |\n\n【51】**common cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults <35 years(12%) following arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy(24%)，and coronary heart disease (20%) as leading causes \\[9\\]. MVP is more frequent in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome， Marfan syndrome， Graves’ disease， and polycystic kidney disease \\[10，11\\]. Rheumatic heart disease， endocarditis and myocardial ischemia could also be causes of mitral valve prolapse. Barlow’s disease is the most prominent form of MVP characterized by myxomatous degeneration of the valve leaflets and increased calcification of the mitral annulus4.**\n\n【52】**Identifying patients with MVP at risk for SCD**\n\n【53】**Electrocardiographic findings： Patients with MVP often have a normal baseline ECG. However， in patients who had a cardiac arrest， the incidence of inverted or biphasic T waves in the inferolateralleads\\[6，12\\] was found to be increased.QT dispersion and QT prolongation have also been described. The presence of Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) originating from the Papillary Muscle (PM) or fascicular region has been well documented \\[13\\]. Arrhythmias arising from PMs in the left ventricle have right bundle branch morphology gY in lead V1. More specifically ventricular ectopic originating from the posteromedial PM has a superior axis， which is similar to left**\n\n【54】**posterior fascicular and or perimitral arrhythmias while ventricular ectopic arising from the anterolateral PM has an inferior axis similar to arrhythmias from the left anterior fascicle \\[14\\]. Notably a recent study showed how important it is to grade and categorize the burden of ventricular arrhythmia in these patients and presented that severe ventricular arrhythmia is associated with more adverse events. Patients with no VT and PVC frequency below median (<5%) were categorized in the“No/Trivial”group while patients with， PVCs above the median (5%) and/or with documented VT runs no faster than 120beats/min， with VT runs of 120 to 179 beats/min and with VT >180beats/min and/or proven history of VT/Ventricular Fibrillation (VF)， indicating a need for an ICD were categorized in \"Mild\"，“Moderate”and “Severe”groups respectively. In addition， in the same study the authors were able to gather the main prognostic factors that were directly correlated with the prognosis of these patients. The most important of these are Mitral Annular Disjunction (MAD)， leaflet redundancy and ST-T changes (T wave inversion and ST-depression)\\[15\\]. On the same line a recent study that describe the phenotype of forty-two patients with cardiac arrest has found that most patients had PVCs originated mainly from the posterior papillary muscles\\[16\\]. MVP may cause alterations in the mechanical function of the**\n\n【55】**papillary muscles and the left ventricle in extent. This abnormal mechanical function has been associated as a trigger of malignant arrhythmias even in the absence of histological changes \\[6，17，18\\].**\n\n【56】**Echocardiography： The iise ofbothhtransthoracic _and_ transesophageal examination is crucial to determine the disease severity. A detailed description of the mitral valve structure should include leaflet thickness or redundancy， annular dilatation， and chordal length. The presence of bileaflet prolapse has been associated with an increased rate of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest \\[12，19\\]. The severity of MR has not been associated with bad prognosis； however its quantification as well as any consequent structure anomalies such as LA dilatation，LV dysfunction，pulmonary flow reversal or pulmonary hypertension should be described. It is important to report that the presence of Mitral Annular Disjunction(MAD) found on echo examination in patients with MPV has been associated with increased prevalence of arrhythmic events. MAD is characterized by the abnormal positioning of the hinge point of the mitral valve away from the ventricular myocardium and has been appointed as an independent factor for the presence of ventricular arrhythmias \\[20-22\\]. Accordingly， a study， summarizing findings from subjects of sudden cardiac death and mitral valve prolapse， showed increased prevalence of bileaflet prolapse， sub endocardial fibrosis and mitral annulus dilatation \\[23\\].Importantly， a recent study has shown that mechanical dispersion identified by speckle tracking echocardiography was a strong predictor ofthe presence of malignant arrhythmias. Notably， this was independent of LV function， bileaflet valve prolapse and degree of MR \\[24\\].**\n\n【57】**Cardiac MRI**\n\n【58】**The most prominent finding in patients with cardiac arrest and MVP is the presence of fibrosis ofthe papillary muscles and inferobasal segments of the left ventricle that was consistent with histological findings \\[6\\]. Consistent with the above researchers have recently reported that by using T1 mapping and late gadolinium enhancement half of the patients with MVP had a degree of papillary muscle fibrosis \\[25\\]. It is important to clarify that the absence of fibrosis is not a positive predictive variable since patients without fibrosis still suffer a sudden cardiac death. Probably this is since the fibrosis is a late finding in the disease process and other triggers of malignant arrhythmias are to be blamed. Interestingly a new study has come to support the above theory by demonstrating an undetected until now level of myocardial inflammation in patients with degenerative mitral valve prolapse by using a hybrid method of PET/MRI \\[26\\].**\n\n【59】**Genetics**\n\n【60】**The genes contribution in the development of MVP has been associated with both the syndromic as well as the non-syndromic aspect of the genetic spectrum. Trisomies of chromosome 18 (Edwards syndrome)， chromosome 13 (Patau syndrome) and chromosome 15are associated with MVP \\[23\\]. In addition， patients with connective tissue diseases such as Marfan Syndrome (MFS)， Loeys-Dietz Syndrome (LDS)， Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS)， Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) Pseudoxanthoma elasticum， Osteogenesis imperfecta， Borrone dermato-cardio-skeletal syndrome， have been presented with variable degrees of MVP \\[27-31\\]. Moreover， isolated non-syndromic familial forms of MVP have also been characterized. These forms are age and sex dependent as well as with different levels of age dependent and age-independent penetrance and phenotypic expression. Also， these forms are present with X-linked recessive inheritance \\[32\\] as well as autosomal dominant inheritance \\[33\\].**\n\n【61】**MVP1，MMVP2 and MMVP3 loci in chromosomes 16， 11 and 13respectively are also associated with the presence of MVP \\[34-36\\].**\n\n【62】**A recent study in patients with Left Ventricular Non-Compaction(LVNC) and sinus node dysfunction who present with MVPhas found mutations in the FLNC gene that encodes for gamma flimin， a crucial protein interacting with act in filaments in the myocyte structure\\[37\\]. Genome-wide association studies have also been contacted. TNS1 gene (encodes tens in 1 which is an act in-binding protein) as well as LCMD1 gene (encodes a transcription factor repressor of GATA 6 which is an important regulator to atrioventricular valves development) are under study to identify their role in the expression ofMVP \\[38，39\\]. Further studies are needed to identifythrough genetic analysis those in dividuals that are in increased risk of malignant MVP and SCD.**\n\n【63】**Treatment options**\n\n【64】**Optimal medical treatment including beta or calcium channel blocker therapy or more complex anti arrhythmic drugs， should be first line treatment in patients with MVP and documented malignant arrhythmias. More importantly the use of ICD therapy as secondary prevention has been related with better prognosis \\[40\\]. Furthermore， catheter ablations of PVCs found in patients with MVP have been shown to reduce ICD shocks \\[13\\]. The ability of surgical correction to reduce ventricular arrhythmias has been controversial \\[41\\]. One study reported a significant reduction in arrhythmic burden after mitral valve surgery， even in the absence of substantial mitral regurgitation \\[42\\]. On the other hand， another study failed to show any reduction on the ventricular ectopic burden \\[43\\]. At the same time， both emphasize the importance of early surgical intervention for the timely and immediate treatment of possible mechanical and electrophysiological remodeling that the heart may undergo.**\n\n【65】**Conclusion**\n\n【66】**While various prognostic factors have been described， no one is sensitive enough to predict these arrhythmias. Overall， there is an increasing need for more studies that will address not only the causative factors leading to sudden cardiac death but also to establish an efficient risk stratification strategy to provide immediate solutions to our patients' problems. Perhaps the early identification of DNA variants that increase the genetic susceptibility to adverse outcomes might be an option， accompanied by closer clinical follow-up. The detection of such variants that demonstrate co-segregation in affected families is a strategy facilitated with contemporary Next Generation Sequencing Technologies.**\n\n【67】**References**\n\n【68】**1\\.

A patient with unilateral CPT for 4 months was included in the present report. The patient followed a supervised exercise five times per week for 6 weeks consisting of， isometric quadriceps exercise， and slow progressive eccentric - concentric training of quadriceps and simple lumbo-pelvic control exercises. The programmer was individualized on the basis of the patient’s description of pain experienced during the procedure. The patient was evaluated using the VISA -P questionnaire at baseline， at the end of treatment (week 6)， and 1 month (week 10) after the end of treatment. At the end of the treatment and at the follow - up there was a decline in pain and a rise in function. The results of the present trial suggest that the combination of isometric quadriceps exercise， slow progressive eccentric - concentric training of quadriceps and simple lumbo-pelvic control exercises can produce significant improvements in terms of pain and disability in CPT.**\n\n【5】**OPEN ACCESS**\n\n【6】**Introduction**\n\n【7】**_\\*Correspondence：Stasinopoulos Dimitrios， Physiotherapy_ _Program， Department of Health_ _Sciences， School of Sciences European_**\n\n【8】**_University of Cyprus， 6， Diogenes Str._ _Engomi， P.O.Box 22006， 1516， Nicosia，_ _Cyprus， Tel： 35722713044，_**\n\n【9】**_E-mail： D.Stassinopoulos@euc.ac.cy_ Received Date： 22 Aug 2016Accepted Date： 20 Sep 2016Published Date： 22 Sep 2016 _Citation：_**\n\n【10】**Chronic Patellar Tendinopathy (CPT) is a common clinical condition that is managed by physical therapists and is common among athletes and non-athletes alike. CPT is characterized by the absence of inflammatory cells and prostaglandins and an increased presence of fibroblasts and disorganized collagen \\[1\\]. Therefore， this condition is not inflammatory as originally thought but is a degenerative condition. The ideal term for clinical diagnosis is patellar tendinopathy because this term refers to the painful tendon without implying the pathology \\[2\\]. Jumper’s knee was the first diagnostic term used for this condition. However， this condition can occur in people who are not athletes and athletes who do not perform jumping in their sports. Thus， jumper's knee is not an appropriate term for clinical diagnosis \\[3\\]. Patellar tendonitis is also an incorrect term for clinical diagnosis because the condition is not inflammatory but is degenerative as mentioned. The best diagnostic term may be the term patellar tendinosis because this term refers to the pathology of the tendon \\[4\\].**\n\n【11】**_Dimitrios S.

It is most commonly characterized by pain at the inferior pole of the patella； although pain can also be at the tibial attachment， in the attachment of the tendon to the superior pole of the patella as well as midsubstance pain has been reported \\[3\\]. The pain can be caused by performing a functional activity such as squat or hop \\[5\\].**\n\n【16】**_an open access article distributed under_ _the Creative Commons Attribution_ _License， which permits unrestricted_ _use， distribution， and reproduction in_ _any medium， provided the original work_ _is properly cited._**\n\n【17】**However， no ideal treatment has emerged for the management of CPT. Many clinicians advocate a conservative approach \\[5\\] and physiotherapy is usually recommended \\[4\\]. A wide array of physiotherapy treatments has been recommended for the management of CPT such as electrotherapeutic/physical modalities， exercise programmes， soft tissue manipulation， and manual techniques \\[1\\]. These treatments have different theoretical mechanisms of action， but all have the same aim， to reduce pain and improve function. Such a variety of treatment options suggests that the optimal treatment strategy is not known， and more research is needed to discover the most effective treatment in patients with CPT.**\n\n【18】**Table 1： VISA-P score before each evaluation.**\n\n|  | **VISA-P**  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **WEEKO**  | **42**  |\n| **WEEK 6**  | **81**  |\n| **WEEK 10**  | **86**  |\n\n【20】**One of the most common physiotherapy treatments for CPT is exercise. Eccentric exercise has shown good clinical results in CPT\\[6\\] as well as in conditions similar to CPT in clinical behaviour and histopathological appearance， such as lateral elbow \\[7\\]， rotator cuff\\[8\\] and Achilles tendinopathy \\[6\\].**\n\n【21】**Eccentric training is not enough for all patients with CPT \\[9\\]. Malliaras and his colleagues \\[3\\] concluded that clinicians should considereccentric-concentricloading alongside or instead ofeccentric loading in lower limb tendinopathy. Recently， isometric exercises are indicated to reduce and manage tendon pain \\[10，11\\]. Moreover， a component lacking from evidence-based programs is adequate consideration of the kinetic chain and therefore poor lumbopelvic control has the potential to alter load distribution on the lower limb kinetic chain and increase the risk of lower limb tendinopathy \\[5\\]. Perhaps if the eccentric-concentric training combines to isometric contractions and simple lumbo-pelvic control exercises the success rate in the management of tendinopathy will be higher**\n\n【22】**To our knowledge， there have been no studies to investigate the effectiveness of these kinds of contractions (concentric， eccentric and isometric) and simple lumbo-pelvic control exercises for the management of CPT. Therefore， the aim of the present case report is to present the effect of eccentric- concentric training combined with isometric contraction and simple lumbo-pelvic control exercises on pain and disability in a patient experiencing CPT.**\n\n【23】**Case Presentation**\n\n【24】**History**\n\n【25】**The subject was a 20-year-old female volleyball player with a four- month history of anterior knee pain， in her right knee. She was diagnosed by a specialist (orthopaedic) as having CPT. She has played volleyball for about six years. The site of pain was over the inferior pole of the patella without spreading down and she complained of pain after her training only. The pain subsided within one or two hours after her training. She did not complain of pain after prolonged sitting or while walking downstairs. She did not have any problems with the other joints. She did not complain of other symptoms such as stiffness， swelling， locking， crepitus or giving away. She took no drugs at the time of assessment； she had no history of trauma in the knee before， only two ankle sprains in the same leg. She had followed a physiotherapy rehabilitation program following the ankle sprains. She had no prior physiotherapy treatment for the problem in her knee. She did not have a history of diabetes， epilepsy or cancer and none in her family did. She did not have any operation or illness in the past.**\n\n【26】**Examination findings**\n\n【27】**Although the condition was diagnosed by a specialist， the physiotherapist D. S. assessed her knee to rule out other conditions and confirm the diagnosis.**\n\n【28】**No pain was mentioned during gait and posture. Body deformity， colour changes， muscle wasting or swelling were not noted. In palpation， signs of inflammatory activity like heat， swelling and synovial thickening were not found.**\n\n【29】**On physical examination， the movements of the low back， hip and ankle were pain free， with full range of motion and full power. All ligamentous stress tests were normal， meniscal stress tests were normal， muscle strength tests were normal and no capsular pattern was found. Isotonic resisted extension reproduced mild pain on the inferior pole of the patella； what is more， after ten fast squats (decline test) \\[3\\]， she experienced a mild pain. The squats were carried out， because the researcher wanted to reproduce the pain. Knee extension by gliding the patella medially was negative， without reproducing the pain； furthermore the position of the patella was normal \\[12\\]. These two latter procedures ruled out the patellofemoral joint dysfunction. Tenderness with palpation over the inferior pole of the patella was found， confirming the diagnosis.**\n\n【30】**Procedure**\n\n【31】**The patient followed a supervised exercise programmerconsisting of， isometric _C_ quadriceps exercise， slow progressive eccentric-concentric training of quadriceps and simple lumbo-pelvic control exercises. Firstly， the patient performed the Spanish squat as an isometric quadriceps exercise. The Spanish squat is a double leg squat to be performed at an angle of approximately 70-90° of knee flexion with the assistance of a rigid strap fixating the lower legs. The patient performed 3 sets of five repetitions of Spanish squat with 1-min rest interval between each set. Each repetition was painless and lasted45 seconds. Later， the patient carried out the eccentric-concentric training. As eccentric - concentric training， the participant carried out three sets of 15 repetitions of unilateral squat on a 25° decline board with 1-min rest interval between each set. The squat was performed at a slow speed at every treatment session. The patient counted to 6during the squat. As the subject moved from the standing to the squat position， the quadriceps muscle and patellar tendon by inference were loaded eccentrically； followed by concentricloading， as the injured leg was used to get back to the start position. At the beginning the load consisted of the body weight and the participant was standing with all her body weight on the injured leg. The subject was told to go ahead with the exercise even if she experienced mild pain. However， she was told to stop the exercise if the pain became disabling. When the squat was pain-free the load was increased by holding hand weights. Finally， the patient performed two simple lumbo-pelvic control exercises such as single leg bridging in supine and four-point prone bridging exercises. The patient performed 3 sets of five repetitions of each of the above lumbo-pelvic control exercises with 1-min rest interval between each set. Each repetition was painless and lasted 45seconds. Static stretching exercises of quadriceps and hamstrings were performed as described by Stasinopoulos and his colleagues \\[2\\] before and after the eccentric training. Each stretch lasted 30 seconds and there was a one minute rest between each stretch.**\n\n【32】**Supervised exercise programme was given five times a week for 6weeks and was individualized on the basis ofthe patient’s description of pain experienced during the procedure. The patient was instructed to use her knee during the course of the study but to avoid activities that irritated pain such as jumping， hopping and running \\[2，9，11\\]. She was also told to refrain from taking anti-inflammatory drugs throughout the course ofthe study. Patient compliance was monitored using a treatment diary.**\n\n【33】**Communication and interaction (verbal and non-verbal) between the therapist and patient was kept to a minimum， and behaviours sometimes used bytherapists to facilitate positive treatmentoutcomes were purposefully avoided. For example， patients were given no**\n\n**indication of the potentially beneficial effects of the treatments or any feedback on their performance in the pre-application and post-application measurements 13|.**\n\n【35】**Pain and function were measured in the present study. The patient was evaluated at the baseline (week 0)， at the end of treatment(week 6) and at 1 month (week 10) after the end of treatment.**\n\n【36】**The VISA-P questionnaire was used to monitor the pain and function of patients. The instrument is a simple questionnaire， consisted of eight questions that takes less than five minutes to complete and once patients are familiar with it they will be able to complete most of it themselves. It is a valid and reliable outcome measure for patients with patellar tendinopathy \\[14\\].**\n\n【37】**Results**\n\n【38】**VISA-P score was 42 at the initial evaluation. At the end of the treatment (week 6)， there was a rise in VISA - P score of 39 units. At week 10， the VISA - P score was 86 (Table 1).**\n\n【39】**Discussion**\n\n【40】**The present study examined the effect of isometric quadriceps exercise， slowprogressiveeccentric-concentrictrainingof quadriceps and simple lumbo-pelvic control exercises in a patient experiencing CPT and its findings have demonstrated significant improvements in terms of pain and disability. The results obtained from this case report are novel； as to date， similar studies have not been conducted.**\n\n【41】**Alfredson et al. \\[1\\] first proposed the eccentric training of the injured tendon. It is the most commonly used conservative approach in the treatment of tendinopathy. Malliaras and his colleagues \\[3\\] concluded that clinicians should consider eccentric-concentric loading alongside or instead of eccentric loading in Achilles and patellar tendinopathy. A Heavy Slow Resistance (HSR) program is recommended in the management of lower limb tendinopathy16，17\\]. The HSR program was produced equivalent pain and function improvement(VISA) than the Alfredson eccentric program， but significantly better patient satisfaction at six month follow-up.In the Achilles tendon， eccentric and HSR have recently been shown to yield similar clinical outcomes (VISA and patient satisfaction) at 1year follow up. Based on the above findings， the HSR program can be recommended as an alternative to the Alfredson eccentric program lower limb tendinopathy rehabilitation.**\n\n【42】**Recently， isometric exercises have been recommended to reduce and manage tendon pain increasing the strength at the angle of contraction without producing inflammatory signs \\[3，10\\]. Five repetitions of 45-second isometric mid-range quadriceps exercise at 70% of maximal voluntary contraction have been shown to reduce patellar tendon pain for 45 minutes post exercise and this was also associated with a reduction in motor cortex inhibition of the quadriceps that was associated with patellar tendinopathy \\[10\\]. The dosage of isometric contractions in the present was based on clinical experience \\[3，10，11\\] and their effect on pain in patients with CPT requires further study. The ‘Spanish squat was used as isometric contraction in the present study and is useful when there is limited or no access to gym equipment as in the present situation. Therefore， it was hypothesized that the simultaneous use of these two kinds of contractions (isotonic and isometric) will further enhance the analgesic effect of contractions in the treatment of CPT，increasing the lower limb function.**\n\n【43】**A component lacking from evidence-based programs is adequate consideration of the kinetic chain. Poor lumbopelvic control has the potential to alter load distribution on the lower limb kinetic chain and increase the risk of lower limb tendinopathy \\[5，18\\]. It is our belief that the improvement of lumbo-pelvic control can be achieved by performing simple exercises such as single leg bridging in supine and four point prone bridging exercises. Future research is needed to confirm this suggestion.**\n\n【44】**In addition， hip extensors weakness has been associated with patellar tendinopathy \\[19\\]. Exercises to strengthen these muscle groups should be considered in exercise protocols and patellar tendinopathy. However， hip extensors were not strengthened in the present case trial because the strength of hip muscles in the assessment was normal. Functional activities such as jumping， cutting and sprinting should also be included in lower limb tendinopoathy rehabilitation programs among athletes， but have so far not been included in popular programs in the literature \\[19\\]. These activities were included in the present study. The athlete carried out these activities in the court under the supervision of the gymnast.**\n\n【45】**The load of exercises was increased according to the patients symptoms otherwise the results are poor \\[20\\]. Furthermore，eccentric exercises were performed at a low speed in every treatment session because this allows tissue healing \\[21\\]. Ice was not recommended at the end of the treatment because research has shown that ice as a supplement to an eccentric exercise programme offers no benefit to patients with tendinopathy \\[22\\]. Finally， the avoidance of painful activities is crucial for tendon healing， because training during the treatment period increases patients' symptoms and delays tendon healing\\[23\\].**\n\n【46】**Eccentric exercises appear to reduce the pain and improve function. The mechanism by which eccentric training achieves these outcomes remains uncertain， as there is a lack of good quality evidence relating to physiological effects. The clinical improvement of the HSR group was accompanied by increased collagen turnover. It is unknown if the isometric contractions can reverse the pathology of the tendinopathy and in this case the pathology of CPT.**\n\n【47】**Although a home exercise programme can be performed any time during the day without requiring supervision from a therapist， our clinical experience has shown that patients fail to comply with the regimen of home exercise programmes \\[22\\]. Although many ways can be recommended to improve the compliance of patients with the home exercise programme such as phone calls， exercise monitors and better self-management education， it is believed that this problem can be solved by the supervised exercise programmes performed in a clinical setting under the supervision of a therapist. It is believed because our experience has shown that many patients stopped the home exercise programme without giving an explanation， whereas patients completed the supervised programme. One possible reason why they continue the supervised exercise programme could be the cost. In the supervised exercise programme， the patients visit the therapist more times than the home exercise programme， and this is more expensive. A future study will combine the both types of exercise programmes in order to maximize the compliance of the patients.**\n\n【48】**Even though the positive effects of such an exercise programme in CPT have been reported in the present report， its study design limits the generalization of these findings. Future well-designed**\n\n【49】**clinical trials are needed to confirm the positive results of this case study establishing the effectiveness of such an exerciseprogram in the management of CPT. In addition， structural changes in the tendons related to the treatment interventions and the long-term effects (6months or more after the end of treatment) of these treatments are needed to investigate. Further research is needed to establish the possible mechanism of action of this treatment approach，and the cost effectiveness of such treatment， because reduced cost is an important issue for the recommendation of any given treatment.**\n\n【50】**Conclusions**\n\n【51】**The exercise programme， consisting of isometric quadriceps exercise， slow progressive eccentric - concentric training of quadriceps and simple lumbo-pelvic control exercises， had reduced the pain and improved the function in a patient with CPT at the end of the treatment and at one month follow-up. Further well-designed trials are needed to confirm the results of the present case report.**\n\n【52】**References**\n\n【53】1\\. Stasinopoulos D.

The patient has no history and other signs of Von Hippel-Lindau disease. This is the 3rd reported case of hepatic hemangioblastoma and probably the largest hemangioblastoma ever reported.**\n\n【20】**Introduction**\n\n【21】**Hemangioblastoma is a benign tumor of mesenchymal origin which occurs predominantly in the cerebellum. About 1/5 of all the cases is associated with VHL gene mutation， the so called Von Hippel-Lindau disease. Occasional cases have been reported in other parts of the central nervous system and organs such as kidney and soft tissue \\[1-5\\]. However， so far only two cases of hepatic hemangioblastoma have been reported and were both associated with Von Hippel-Lindau disease\\[6，7\\]. We here report a case of giant liver tumor of hemangioblastoma. The patient showed no signs of Von Hippel-Lindau disease.**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**Clinical data**\n\n【24】**A male patient aged 43 was admitted to the hospital with main complain of discovery of liver space-occupying lesion. In December of 2021， the patient visited the clinic for “hydronephrosis with renal and ureteral stone\". Abdominal computer tomography (Figure 1) revealed a giant space-occupying lesion in the right lobe of liver with a dimension of 20.7 cm×18.7 cm × 11.9 cm. The liver was enlarged and the left margin pushed to the left end of abdomen. The patient was with no complaining of fatigue， poor appetite， abdominal distention or pain. Laboratory investigation after admission revealed no abnormality of blood routine， urine routine， stool routine， coagulation function， CRP， renal function， electrolytes， and the triple liver cancer biomarkers AFP， AFP-L3， and PIVAKII. Digital radiography showed no special findings of heart， lungs and diaphragm. Head and brain MRI revealed no abnormality of brain. The radiologists considered a diagnosis and differentials of mesenchymal originated tumor， angiomyolipoma， solitary fibrous tumor， or hepatic hemangioma. Three days after admission， the right lobe of liver and gallbladder of the patient were dissected out under total anesthesia. The patient recovered smoothly and was discharged 10 days later.**\n\n【25】**Pathological findings**\n\n【26】**A giant tumor with very thin margin of liver tissue was seen measuring 20 cmx19cm×12cm. The tumor was solid， dark red， not encapsulated but well circumscribed. Microscopically， the tumor was composed of large amounts of compact capillaries and oval or fusiform eosinophilic or vacuolated stromal cells. The nuclei of stromal cells were small and compact， mitotic figures rarely found. Distended venules and hemorrhages were frequently seen. Hematopoietic foci (Figure 2) were also occasionally spotted. Immunohistochemical (Figure 3) investigation demonstrated that tumor cells were positively stained for vimentin， CD56， and TFE3. GFAP were spottily stained. CD163 and CD68 stain revealed abundant existence of histocytes distributed among the tumor cells. Endothelial cell markers CD34 and CD31 positively labeled large blood vessels but not capillaries and stromal cells. Negatively stained markers included CK， S100， HMB45， Melan A， stat6， NSE， RCC，Pax 8，and a-inhibin. Cell proliferation index Ki67 was about 10%.**\n\n【27】Figure 1： A. Computer aided tomography of the liver reveals a huge space occupying lesion measuring around 20.7 cm x18.7 cm x 11.9 cm with a well-defined margin. The left labe of the liver was pushed to the left end of the abdominal cavity. B. The right labe of the liver was dissected out.\n\n【28】**Figure 2： Histological images show the tumor was with many hemorrhagic regions (A and B)， occasional extramedullary hematopoietic focus (B). dilated blood vessels (C). capillaries and stromal cells (D).**\n\n【29】**Based on the morphological features and Immunohistochemical findings， a diagnosis of hemangioblastomaWasmadeafter excluding the differentials of hemangioma， solitary fibrous tumor， angiomyolipoma and metastasis of renal clear cell carcinoma.**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n【31】**hemangioblastoma is a rare benign tumor that mostly occurs in the cerebellum，and about one fifth of the cases were in Von Hippel-Lindau patients， with mutations of the VHL gene. It also occurs in other parts of the central nervous system， but in much lower frequency. Outside the central nervous system， there were cases reported in the soft tissues and kidneys. We found only 2 cases of hepatic hemangioblastoma in the literature and both of them were associated with Von Hippel-Lindau diseases， and were much smaller.**\n\n【32】**Hemangioblastoma generally were very small due to the restriction of cerebellarlocation. But even outside the central neryous system， such as inside the kidney， the tumors were generally not large either. Our case is probably so far the largest one ever reported. Interestingly， with such a large tumor， the patient did not manifest any symptoms. The tumor did not destruct the normal liver tissue but rather enlarged it and pushed the left margin of the liver all the way to left end of the abdomen， indicating the benign nature of the tumor.**\n\n【33】**CD68.**\n\n【34】**But in other parts of the body， it could pose a serious challenge because the rarity of incidence. In the present case， the initial differentials were hemangioma， angiomyolipoma， solitary fibrous tumor， and metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The final diagnosis of hemangioblastoma was in fact the last one came to mind after excluding all the others. Although Immunohistochemistry is helpful in the diagnosis， there are no signature markers for the diagnosis of hemangioblastoma. It has been reported in most of the cases that S100， NSE and a-inhibin was positive， but not in the present case. On the other side， the positive staining of vimentin， CD56， TFE3， and spotty positivity of GFAP seen in this case has been reported in some studies and lays support for the diagnosis \\[8\\]. But the fundamental basis for the diagnosis is the histological feature and the exclusion of other differentials rather than Immunohistochemistry.**\n\n【35】**Funding**\n\n【36】**The publication of the paper was supported by Hospital Subject Promotion Plan ZDXKKYTS014.**\n\n【37】**References**\n\n【38】1\\.

Myocarditis induced by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines is an indisputable complication observed particularly in young males as demonstrated by multiple studies in different populations. Two studies reported that COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-induced myocarditis disproportionately affected adolescents(Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR)： 22.3； 95% Confidence Interval (CI)：19.2-25.9)，18 to 29-year-olds (ROR： 6.6；95%CI： 5.9-7.5)，and males(ROR： 9.4； 95% CI：8.3-10.6).**\n\n【86】**These findings were supported by other great registry study that identified increased myocarditis risk MR following SARS-CoV-2mRNA vaccination， with the highest risk detected in people aged18 to 24 years， particularly after 2nd dose， where 8.1-fold increased risk after the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2mRNA vaccine (95% CI： 6.7-9.9) and 30-fold increased risk after the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2vaccine (95% CI： 21-43)were reported. An Israeli government data set demonstrated 13.6-fold increased myocarditis risk (95% CI： 9.3-19.2) among males aged between 16 to 19 years compared to the expected following historical data， while a nine-fold increased myocarditis risk(95% CI： 4.5-17.8) was recorded when compared to unvaccinated of similar age and sex during the same period. In a 23 million-resident area， the myocarditis risk MR after SARS-CoV-2mRNA vaccination was increased across all populations， particularly high among males aged 16 to 24 years after the 2nd dose of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273， where 5.3-fold (95% CI： 3.7-7.7) and 13.8-fold (95% CI： 8.1-23.7) increased myocarditis risk MR was recorded. Independent autopsies**\n\n【87】**or biopsies of patients who presented post-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine myocarditis in different geographical regions enabled the conclusion that a primary hyper catecholaminergic state was the key trigger of these events； SARS-CoV-2 mRNA was densely present，and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was progressively produced in adrenal medulla chromaffin cells， which are responsible for catecholamine production； the dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase enzyme that converts dopamine into noradrenaline was overexpressed in the presence of SARS-CoV-2mRNA，leading to enhanced noradrenaline activity； catecholamine responses were physiologically higher in young adults and males than in other populations； catecholamine responses and the resting catecholamine production were higher in male athletes than in non-athletes； catecholamine responses to stress and its sensitivity were enhanced in the presence of androgens； and catecholamine expressions in young male athletes were already high at baseline， were higher following vaccination， and were higher than those in non-vaccinated athletes. The epidemiological， autopsy， molecular， and physiological findings unanimously and strongly suggest that a hyper catecholaminergic state is the critical trigger of the rare cases of mvocarditis due to components from SARS-CoV-2， potentially increasing sudden deaths SD among elite male athletes.“\\[1\\].**\n\n【88】**“The demographic and clinical characteristics of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination in previous reports are summarized in Table reported.

In this study， we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs national healthcare databases to build a cohort of 33，940 individuals with BTI and several controls of people without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection， including contemporary(n=4，983，491)，historical(n=5，785，273)and vaccinated (n=2，566，369) controls. At 6 months after infection， we show that， beyond the first30 days of illness， compared to contemporary controls， people with BTI exhibited a higher risk of death (Hazard Ratio (HR)=1.75，95% Confidence Interval (CI)： 1.59-1.93) and incident post-acute sequelae (HR=1.50， 95% CI： 1.46-1.54)， including cardiovascular CV， coagulation and hematologic， GI， kidney， mental health， metabolic， musculoskeletal and neurologic disorders. The results were consistent in comparisons versus the historical and vaccinated controls. Compared to people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not previously vaccinated (n=113，474)， people with BTI exhibited a lower risk of death (HR=0.66，95% CI： 0.58-0.74) and incident post-acute sequelae (HR=0.85， 95% CI： 0.82-0.89).

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and imaging data of 3 pathologically confirmed gossypiboma patients at varied time after cesarean resection. At four months after cesarean resection， gossypiboma near the small intestine caused fistula and intestinal obstruction. Soft tissue density alongthe intestinal canal， made the “segmentalhoneycombsign\"and\"truncation\"， with metal markings on the edge on CT. Long T1 and short T2 signals and DWI metal artifacts were revealed on MRI. Eighteen months after cesarean resection， gossypiboma located in the peritoneal and intestinal space. MRI demonstrates cystic and solid features， with \"vortex like sign\"and obvious ring enhancement on contrast-enhanced scan. Five years after cesarean resection， gossypiboma was palpated in the right middle and lower abdomen. MRI revealed a round mass oflong T1 signal with mixed T2 signal， as well as swirling lower signal in T2WI，T2WI-FS and DWI were observed. In CT and MRI examinations for suspected gossypiboma after cesarean resection， honeycomb sign\"and\"vortex like sign\" are the characteristic appearances； gauze transplanted into the intestine may show“truncation sign\". DWI metal artifacts and surgical history can aid the diagnosis.**\n\n【23】**Keywords： Gossypiboma； Abdominal； Computed tomography； Magnetic resonance imaging； Diagnosis**\n\n【24】**Introduction**\n\n【25】**A gossypiboma or textiloma is an infrequent complication of any surgical procedure associated with potentially dangerous health problems for the patient \\[1-3\\] and legal implications for the surgeon \\[4\\]. The medico legal implications and widespread negative press coverage explain why manycases are not reported， with theliterature consisting only of case reports \\[5-7\\]. The incidence of gossypiboma is generally low， but is considerably higher in surgeries performed with open cavities， among which cesarean section ranks number one \\[8\\]. Early and accurate diagnosis of gossypiboma plays very important role for delivering proper treatment. However， the diagnosis of gossypibomas is challenging as the symptoms are usually nonspecific， may appear years after surgery， and may be misdiagnosed as a tumor \\[9\\] or abscess \\[10\\] in the abdomen and pelvis.**\n\n【26】**Depending on the retained time of foreign bodies or sponge， exudative and aseptic fibrous alterations may occur，leading to early abscess or late fistulas \\[11\\] as well as clinically silent for many years \\[12，13\\]. Thus， medical imaging is important in giving accurate diagnosis. Ultrasonography is a cheap and easy imaging modality for gossypiboma diagnosis； however， it may not be sufficient to evaluate the abdominal or pelvic organs in the cases of suspected gossypibomas in women after cesarean resection \\[14\\]. Thus recognizing computed tomography and MR features of gossypibomas after varied foreign body retain time in this population is very important.**\n\n【27】**In this study， we retrospectively enrolled 3 women who developed gossypibomas at varied time after cesarean resection and correlated their imaging features with the pathological findings.**\n\n【28】**Case 1. Gossypiboma in a woman at 4 months after cesarean resection**\n\n【29】**A 29-year oldfemale was admitted to the hospital due to intermittent abdominalpain， abdominal**\n\n【30】**Figure 1： A 29-year-old woman who presented with intestinal obstruction 4 months after caesarean section.

More than 1 month before admission， intermittent abdominal pain occurred without obvious reason， mainly in the upper abdomen. The pain became worse after eating， with occasional nausea and vomiting. Recently， she has lost about 15 Kg of body weight. She underwent a cesarean section 4months ago. A 10-cm transverse surgical scar was observedat the lower abdomen， together with the whole abdomen tenderness， especially the middle and lower abdomen. Abdomen plain radiograph revealed high density fold line of the lower abdomen (Figure 1A). Plain CT scan revealed tortuous and coiled soft tissue density shadows in the right middle and lower abdominal small intestine， and circular high-density shadows at the edge. Multiple gas shadows were observed with \"segmental honeycomb\" changes. Edema and thickening of the intestinal wall and mesentery， dilation， fluid accumulation and gas accumulation in the upper intestinal layer were also observed(Figure 1B). MRI showed that the right middle and lower abdominal small intestine was dilated， with short T2 signal shadows along the intestinal canal lumen， and low DWI signal of metal artifacts on the edge， corresponding to the thickened intestinal wall. Besides， high T2WI-FS and DWI signal， and multiple enlarged lymph nodes were observed around the intestine and at the mesenteric roots (Figure 1C-1F). During the laparotomy operation， the small intestine was found to have clumps ofadhesives at 150 cm from the ileocecal part， and the adhesive bowel was about 40 cm long. An enveloped internal fistula was formed locally. Pathological examination revealed intestinal wall tissue， mucosal tissue degeneration and necrosis， submucosal vascular dilation， congestion， inflammatory cell infiltration (Figure1G). Based on the patient history and examinations， the diagnosis of intestinal ulcer and perforation with foreign body (gauze) was made.**\n\n【32】**Figure 2： A 38-year-old woman with a mass in her left middle and lower abdomen18 months after caesarean section.

Gossypiboma in a woman at 18 months after cesarean resection**\n\n【34】**A 38 years old female was admitted in our hospital due to the intermittent abdominal pain and discomfort for 6 months. Physical examination showed an old surgical scar in the middle of the lower**\n\n【35】**abdomen， and a soft mass about 8 cm×5 cm in size was palpable in the left abdomen， with low mobility. She had a caesarean section18 months ago and had a history of massive bleeding and blood transfusion. MRI examination showed a round long T1 mass with mixed T2 signal (\"swirl-like\" sign) about 5.5 cm x 4.4 cm on the left middle-lower abdomen， uneven high signal on DWI， complete capsule at the edge of the mass. Furthermore， obvious ring enhancement in the capsule and no enhancement in the center were observed on enhanced MR scan (Figure 2A-2D). Laparotomy revealed that the mass in the left middle-lower abdomen was closely**\n\n【36】**Figure 3： A 30-year-old woman with a mass in her abdomen 5 years after caesarean section.

A cystic cavity was visible on the cut surface， and there were pale yellow turbidity fluid and gauze masses in the cavity. Pathological examination revealed subserosal foreign body (gauze mass)， surrounding mesangial and omental tissue， and foreign body granuloma formation in the small intestine (Figure 2E).**\n\n【38】**Case 3. Gossypiboma in awoman at 5 years after cesarean resection**\n\n【39】**A 30-year old female with intermittent abdominal pain for2 months and abdominal mass for 1 week was admitted. She underwent cesarean section 5 years ago， tubal ligation 4 years ago and myomectomy 1 year ago. MRI examination showed a round long T1 mass (about 13.1 cm ×9.7 cm) with mixed T2 signal (Figure 3A，3B) in the right middle and lower abdominal cavity. Slightly lower“swirling”sign was observed in T2WI and T2WI-FS images， and isoT1-short T2 signal envelope at the edge of the mass (Figure 3C). Slightlylower vortex signal shadow andlower strip band signal can be seen within high signal background (Figure 3D). On the other layer of DWI， magnetic sensitivity artifacts can be seen around the low-signal shadow (Figure 3E). Laparotomy revealed a cystic mass at 50 cm away from the ileocecal part， which encapsulated the ileum and adhered to the adjacent small intestine. The section was cystic， containing yellow fluid and gauze mass， and granulation tissue formation was observed V on the cyst wall. Pathological examination confirmed the gauze retention and fibrous tissue wrap， with foreign body granuloma**\n\n【40】**Discussion**\n\n【41】**Gossypiboma developed after cesarean section is the most common one among all gossypibomas \\[1，2\\]， however， its diagnosis remains challenging and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a mass or neoplasm， abscess， lymphocele， or nonspecific**\n\n【42】**imaging findings in a postoperative patient \\[3-6\\].**\n\n【43】**lmagingis the mostefficientdiagnosticapproachfor gossypiboma after cesarean section. Plain radiography is the most common technique but with a relatively high false-negative rate \\[7\\]. Because of its higher sensitivity， computed tomography is the first-choice diagnostic imaging technique for excluding gossypibomas \\[8\\]. Depending on the clinical situation， magnetic resonance imaging and other relevant radiological techniques such as barium contrast studies may also be used \\[9\\].**\n\n【44】**In the current study， we presented typical \"honeycomb sign\"and\"vortex like sign\" for all 3 gossypibomas after cesarean section， which is consistent with previous studies showing a spongiform pattern with a radiodense linear structure \\[10-16\\]. Besides， based on the temporal development and location of gossypiboma， varied imaging features such as cyst， solid soft tissue， or well circumscribed capsulated mass， can be observed. However， these features were not closely related with the disease duration， making the diagnosis of gossypiboma after cesarean section still a clinical challenge. Combining patient histories as well as symptoms with imaging features are important to make the accurate diagnosis.**\n\n【45】**References**\n\n【46】**1\\. Alis H.

In this article， we described a 58-year-old woman with a solitary tumor of serous adenocarcinoma located in the right side of the Douglas Pouch arising from the retroperitoneum. Although several theories have been proposed， the exact origin of PRSA remains unclear. The most widely accepted theory is caelomic metaplasia. According to the histopathological results of the present case， the concept of caelomic metaplasia has been proved to a certain extent. As far as we know， this may be the first case which provides a direct and potent evidence for this theory and is conductive to explain the histogenesis of PRSA. The patient underwent a treatment modality combining complete surgical resection with platinum-based chemotherapy， which is extremely likely to contribute to an excellent clinical outcome， and we consider that such therapeutic strategy may be the preferred method for the treatment of PRSA.**\n\n【11】**Introduction**\n\n【12】**Primary retroperitoneal serous adenocarcinoma (PRSA) is an extremely rare malignancy， about which only seven cases previously reported as a result of a careful search in PubMed database from1991 to December 2016 \\[1-7\\]. All of the reported patients were women ranging in age from 11 to75 years. Because of the rarity， the histogenesis of PRSA remains unknown， the biological behavior， clinical manifestation and imaging finding of the tumors are various and the diagnostic criteria and therapeutic strategy of this entity are still not unified \\[2，5-7\\]. A solitary solid tumor in the Douglas pouch from the retroperitoneum has not been described in previous reports. Here we report a rare case of PRSA and review the relevant literatures.**\n\n【13】**Case Presentation**\n\n【14】**A 58-year-old postmenopausal woman， gravida2， parityl， first visited our Department in July 2014 with a three-week history of alternate stool abnormality. She had no medical history of abdominal surgery or lesion. A tumor 43\\*33\\*26 mm in size located behind the cervix was detected by ultrasound transvaginal examination. A pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan showed a low-density solid neoformation with an irregular and enhanced margin which was adjacent to the rectum in cul-de-sac and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in celiac and pelvic cavity (Figure1). Gastrointestinal investigations， including gastrointestinal scopy and colonoscopy were normal. Laboratory studies demonstrated elevated serum levels of CA-125，3942.00U/ml.**\n\n【15】**For further work-up， a laparoscopy was performed. We detected a solitary solid-appearing mass measuring 4 cm in diameter approximately in the right side of the Douglas Pouch， which was located in the retroperitoneum and squeezed the rectum to the left (Figure 2). The size and appearance of uterus， bilateral fallopian tubes， ovaries， peritoneum， omentum majus and mesentery were normal. Considering that the tumor was closely attached to the rectum wall(Figure 3)， a surgeon was invited to consult to exclude rectal neoplasm. A complete resection of the retroperitoneal tumor was conducted， and the histopathologic examination of a frozen section showed low-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Subsequently， a total hysterectomy， bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy， omentectomy， pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy and biopsy of the peritoneum were performed.**\n\n【16】**Cytological analysis of peritoneal washing liquid showed no abnormalities. Postoperative histopathology examination of the specimen showed a poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the tumor. There were no microscopic invasion of the uterus， ovaries and tubes， omentum and lymph nodes. Immunohistochemistry of the mass pathology revealed positive findings for CK，**\n\n【17】Figure 1： Pelvic computed tomography scan showing a solid tumor in cul-de-sac and enlarged lymph nodes in pelvic cavity (arrows).\n\n【18】Figure 2： A solitary solid-appearing tumor in the right side of the Douglas Pouch from the retroperitoneum.\n\n【19】**CA124，and70%positive for Ki-67，partlypositive for MCand negative findings for CEA， Vim， Calret and CDX2. The pathology consultation results in Peking University Third Hospital demonstrated a peritoneum original high-grade serous adenocarcinoma； meanwhile， a small amount of benign mucosal epithelium was seen beside the tumor tissue， which showing morphological differentiation towards to the epithelium of the fallopian tube (Figure 4A and B). Consequently， a histological diagnosis of PRSA was made， and defined at stage II according to the 2006 FIGO classification.**\n\n【20】**The patient was subsequently treated with platinum-based chemotherapy， a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin (TC therapy， 3-week intervals). After a total of seven courses of TC therapy， there was a significant reduction on the level of serum CA125from 2558.00 U/ml to 12.82 U/ml (Figure 5) and CT scan showed no evaluable disease. 21 months after the surgery， positron emission tomographic (PET) scan revealed a retroperitoneal nodule in pelvic cavity and a suspicious bone metastasis in sternum. The patient was once again treated with chemotherapy， which was effective as before. When last seen on January 2017， the patient has been alive with stable disease for 30 months since her surgery and the follow-up is still**\n\n【21】**Figure 3： The relationship between the tumor and the rectum.**\n\n【22】_A_ B\n\n【23】**Figure 4： (A) Histalogical findings of the retroperitoneal tumor， showing salid growth of atypical epithelial cells with pleomorphic nuclei and frequent mitotic figures， (B) a small number of benign mucosal epithelium demonstrating tubal differentiation in morphology beside the tumor tissue (HE stainingx100).**\n\n【24】**Note：PREOP： Pre-operation 1： first course of chemotherapy**\n\n【25】**continuing.**\n\n【26】**Discussion**\n\n【27】**PRSA is an extremely rare malignancy disorder with only seven cases previously reported \\[1-7\\]. To explain the exact histogenesis of the PRSA， several theories have been postulated including coelomic metaplasia， extraovarian endometriosis， ectopic ovarian tissue， supernumerary ovaries， teratoma and enterogenic cyst， currently the most widely accepted one is caelomic metaplasia. The peritoneum has been defined as the secondary Miillerian system for similar potential to differentiate into various types of epithelium derived from the Miillerian tube： endometrium， endocervix， and fallopian tube \\[8，9\\]. It is believed that the epithelial metaplasia of peritoneal mesothelium is one of the originations of the extragenital Miillerian neoplasms. The metaplastic epithelium has a tumorigenic potential， resulting in the formation of a variety of tumors including serous， mucinous， endometrioid and clear cell tumors. Singh et al. \\[10\\] point out that there is sufficient and clear evidence to prove that fallopian tube is**\n\n【28】**the origination of non-uterine high grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). Gruessner et al. \\[11\\] have reported a case in which a potential link between endosalpingiosis (ES) and the development of pelvic serous carcinoma in woman has been observed. Therefore， it is conceivable that epithelial retroperitoneal tumors may have initially been metaplastic peritoneal mesothelium.**\n\n【29】**However， currently there is no case directly confirms that PRSA originates in the metaplasia of peritoneal mesothelium. The pathological consultation result of the present case clearly mentioned that a small number of the benign mucosal epithelium demonstrating tubal differentiation in morphology can be detected beside the tumor tissue， suggesting that the primary retroperitoneal tumor may come from metaplasia of peritoneal mesothelial cells. It confirms that the peritoneum is the matrix where benign and malignant tumors of secondary Miillerian epithelium occur \\[12\\]. To our best knowledge， this may be the first case which provides a direct and potent evidence for the theory of caelomic metaplasia and contributes to clarify the histogenesis of PRSA.**\n\n【30】**It is believed that the biological behavior of PRSA is similar to epithelial ovarian cancer. According to the reported cases， the main clinical symptoms of PRSA are asymptomatic abdominal and pelvic mass， abdominal pain， vomiting， anorexia， abdominal distension and weight loss， resembling those of ovarian serous adenocarcinoma. Despite there is no basic standard of treatment for the disease at present， patients were treated in accordance with the treatment fashion of epithelial ovarian cancer. Among the seven reported cases， four patients underwent complete tumor resection and partial resection of ambient involved tissue. Two of the four patients received chemotherapy， one was alive with disease for 32 months \\[6\\] and the other survived 6 months with no clinical evidence of tumor recurrence \\[7\\]； the rest two patients did not receive further therapy following surgery， and survived for 24 months \\[3\\] and 7 months\\[5\\] without recurrence， respectively. Ulbright et al. \\[1\\] reported a case of a retroperitoneal neoplasm in an 11-year-old girl. The girl underwent a partial resection of tumor and chemotherapy and was alive with no evidence of disease for 10 months. Fujiwara et al. \\[4\\] described a female with a retroperitoneal tumor who was only treated with chemotherapy. She died of disease 24 months after initial presentation. In addition， the case reported by Caruncho et al. \\[2\\] did not inform patient's final outcome.**\n\n【31】**In the present case， patient underwent a radical operation followed by adequate platinum-based chemotherapy， and obtained an excellent clinical outcome. The patient was alive with no evidence of disease for 21 months. Given chemotherapy after recurrence， she survived up to now. The outcome of the patient demonstrated the potential effectiveness and feasibility of this treatment pattern. In the literature， it has been emphasized that patients with positive surgical margins， tumor infiltration of adjacent organs or loco-regional lymph node involvement should be treated with chemotherapy \\[3，5\\]. Although more cases are needed， we believe that the therapy modality combining a radical operation with platinum-based chemotherapy may be the top candidate for treatment of PRSA. Meanwhile， we must pay attention to the adverse reactions of chemotherapy.

Mediastinal chondrosarcoma is exceedingly rare and a cystic variant is an exception. Diagnostic imaging is from utmost importance for early detection， preoperative planning and for local recurrences screening.

Mediastinal chondrosarcoma is exceedingly rare. The aim of the current study is to report a rare case of mediastinal cystic chondrosarcoma， originating from the xiphoid process of the sternum， which was successfully operated.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**We present a case of 45-year-old woman with complaints of pain， localized in the distal part of the sternal body and xiphoid process， dating from one week. Paraclinical studies were all within the normal range. A chest CT scan revealed a low attenuated anterior mediastinal formation(Figures la-1c). The lesion was with axial dimension of 40/38 mm and was localized outside the bone and inferior to the diaphragm. The conclusion of the CT scan was for a cystic formation in the anterior inferior mediastinum， that engaged xiphoid process of sternum. Vertical incision was performed above the distal part of the sternum and the proximal upper abdomen (Figures 2a，2b). A cystic thick-walled lesion， that destructed the xiphoid process was found. A partial distal resection of the sternum together with about 2 cm of adjacent visibly intact part of the diaphragm and the surrounding adipose tissue was performed. The tumor was cystic with peripheral zones of densely-elastic cartilaginous tissue (Figures 3a， 3b). The histology revealed high-differentiated chondrosarcoma. The resection lines of the adiacent tissues were free of the tumor. Radiotherapy was proposed for local recurrence prevention control.**\n\n【20】**Figure 1(a，b，c)： Preoperative CT scan in axial， coronal and sagittal projection.**\n\n【21】**Figure 2(a，b)： Intraoperative view.**\n\n【22】**Figure 3(a，b)： Macroscopic view of the removed chondrosarcoma.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**Chondrosarcoma is the most common malignant tumor of the bony thorax and the single most common malignancy of the sternum \\[2\\]. It is a rare lesion with an incidence of 0.5 chest 4 wall chondrosarcomas per million people per year \\[3\\]. It usually arises primarily within bones formed through endochondral ossification. Secondary chondrosarcoma arises from benign chondroma or osteochondroma. Usually a history of previous trauma， radiation therapy or presence of chromosomal mutations is available. Typical characteristics of chondrosarcoma include slow tumor growth， low-grade disease， extremely low rates of metastasis， and slightly male predominance \\[4\\]. Immunohistochemically the tumor shows positivity for SOX4，SOX9 and S100 protein. CT scan demonstrates a low-attenuating rounded mass with \"ring andarc\"calcification pattern， that is typical for chondroid matrix. Some of the tumors show cortical destruction， periosteal reaction or surrounding soft tissue invasion. Chondrosarcomas are of low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted MR images and hyperintense on T2- weighted MR images. The “pepper surface sign\" can be seen in T2WI， which is one of the most important imaging modalities that indicates chondrosarcoma\\[5\\]. It is interesting to note that not all malignant chondrosarcomas are PET positive and low-grade tumors are low or marginally PET avid， as it is described in a case by Ostergaard et al. \\[1\\]. Our study shows that we should be aware that some anterior mediastinal cystic formations could be malignant， like in our case， and consequently an operative treatment needs to be proposed. Chondrosarcoma is chemo- and radioresistant tumor. This is most probably related to the abundance of chondroid matrix， low cellular grade， and relative hypovascularity \\[6\\]. RO surgical resection is considered the gold standard and there is no consensus for the desired surgical margin. However， performance of radical resection is often combined with chest wall instability and therefore reconstructive operation is followed \\[2，7，8\\]. We decided to proceed with open approach surgery，**\n\n【25】**because the formation was located on the border of two body cavities. The resultant defects in chest wall and diaphragm were 5 minimal and there was no need for reconstruction. After multi-board discussion radiotherapy was proposed despite radical resection for treating eventual residual tumor cells and for prevention of local recurrence. Surveillance consists of physical examination and thoracic imaging with either PA/lateral radiograph or CT scan every 3 to 6 months for the first 5 years and annually thereafter for a minimum of 10 years \\[6\\].**\n\n【26】**Conclusion**\n\n【27】**Mediastinal chondrosarcoma with subphrenic distribution is exceedingly rare malignant mesenchymal tumor. Diagnostic imaging is from utmost importance for early detection，preoperative planning and for local recurrence screening.

Recent data suggest that the number of hospital acquisition has decreased significantly with universal masking and respect for physical distancing. At the beginning of the second wave， we wanted to prospectively assess the prevalence of COVID-19 infection among health care workers and the situations of intra-hospital transmission. Our results suggest that we need to focus on physical distancing during mealtimes and breaks.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： COVID-19；Health care workers； Transmission control**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**During the first wave of COVID-19， several reports suggested that hospitals were an important setting for viral transmission \\[1，2\\]. Also， authors stressed the importance of screening Health Care Workers (HCWs)， for minimal or no symptoms， as unknown clusters were incidentally discovered\\[3\\]，claiming foraprotectingapproach for patients and hospital staff. Nevertheless，evidencesupports effectiveness of simple interventions in reducing hospital transmission as universal masking，hand hygiene and physical distancing. Implementation of these recommendations was associated with a reduce rate of hospital acquisition \\[4\\] suggesting that overall hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of universal masking is likely rare even during periods of high community prevalence \\[5\\]. Furthermore， despite that asymptomatic are source of infection a recent meta-analysis suggested a low secondary attack rate in health care settings estimated at 0.7%\\[6\\]. Since the end of July 2020， a large screening and isolation policy has been implemented in France where HCWs， if symptomatic and their contacts were systematically tested. Also， tests were performed for those returning from holidays and family or social gatherings， regardless their symptoms. This policy led to increasing screenings， and therefore， overwhelming laboratories capacities and thus increasing test delays which can be problematic， not only for symptomatic HCW but above all for us to control the epidemic situation.**\n\n【20】**Case Presentation**\n\n【21】**In this context， our goal was to compare the prevalence rate between respectively symptomatic and asymptomatic HCWs and clinical (CS) and Non-Clinical Staff (NCS). Also， we wanted to identify situations were transmission occurred. Therefore we investigated all HCW tested for COVID-19 infection by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR between August 1% and October 1 ，2020. Symptoms， if present， and test context were noted. In order to look for secondary cases， each positive RT-PCR case was the source of a detailed investigation， leaded by the same investigator (JRZ) to define the origin of the contamination， to evaluate the compliance with preventive measures and to identify contact cases requiring a follow-up. The source of the infection was defined as community acquired in case of： The absence of HCW cases confirmed in the previous 14 days and the absence of infected non isolated patients in the same ward or if index cases came back from holidays， family meeting in a closed space or had a contact with a confirmed community-acquired case in the previous 14 days. Otherwise， situations were considered as likely nosocomial. Also， all contact HCW were screened by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR between the 5h and 7th day of the last contact with**\n\n|  | **All population** **(% Positive RT-PCR)**  | **Symptomatic** **(% Positive RT-PCR)**  | **Asymptomatic** **(% Positive RT-PCR)**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Screened population**  | **449(10.02%)**  | **195(16.41%)**  | **254(5.12%)**  |\n| **Index cases**  | **211(14.69%)**  | **180(16.67%)**  | **31 (3.22%)**  |\n| **Contact cases**  | **238(5.88%)**  | **15(13.33%)**  | **223(5.38%)**  |\n| **Clinical staff**  | **289(10.38%)**  | **119(18.48%)**  | **170(4.7%)**  |\n| **Index cases**  | **128(16.41%)**  | **107(19.62%)**  | **21(0.00%)**  |\n| **Contact cases**  | **161(5.59%)**  | **12(8.33%)**  | **149(5.37%)**  |\n| **Non clinical staff**  | **160(9.37%)**  | **76(13.16%)**  | **84 (5.95%)**  |\n| **Index cases**  | **83(12.05%)**  | **73(12.33%)**  | **10(10.00%)**  |\n| **Contact cases**  | **77 (6.49%)**  | **3(33.33%)**  | **74(5.41%)**  |\n\n【23】**Table 2： Description of the 45 conducted investigations.**\n\n| **Variables**  | **All population** **(45 HCW)**  | **Clinical staff** **(33 HCW)**  | **Non clinical staff** **(12HCW)**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Clinical symptoms**  | **38**  | **30**  | **8**  |\n| **Cough or sneezing**  | **21**  | **16**  | **5**  |\n| **Median C.(min-max)**  | **19(8-37)**  | **20(8-37)**  | **18(8-35)**  |\n| **Community acquired/Hospital acquired**  | **35/10**  | **24/9**  | **1-Nov**  |\n| **Non compliance with mask-wearing**  | **26**  | **19**  | **7**  |\n| **At the bedside**  | **0**  | **0**  | **NR**  |\n| **During staff or break**  | **26**  | **19**  | **7**  |\n| **Situation that generated contact cases**  | **24**  | **17**  | **7**  |\n| **Mean contact cases generated (min-max)**  | **3.4(1-11)**  | **3.2(1-7)**  | **3.7(1-11)**  |\n\n【25】**HCW： Health Care Workers； NR： Non Relevant**\n\n【26】**the index case and were followed up for 14 days. During the study period， 449 HCW were tested and 45 (10%) were positive. In 195(43%) situations， HCW were symptomatic and 16.67% among them were infected compared to 5.1% among the asymptomatic (p<0.001). No difference was noted between CS and NCS irrespective of their symptomatic status (Table 1). Results of investigations are shown in Table 2. Among the 45 HCWs with a positive RT-PCR result 32(71%) were symptomatic and 21 (47%) had at least a respiratory symptom (cough or sneezing). Thirty-five (78%) cases were classified as community-acquired infections. The interview highlighted that in contrary to the bedside situation， most breaks and bureaucratic activities were associated with a non-compliance with masking and social distancing. Finally， among the 45 investigations， 24 (53%) generated contact cases (Table 2). Four clusters were identified and breakdowns have occurred in small workrooms and during mealtime and breaks. Our work data suggest a significant difference regarding positive RT-PCR prevalence for symptomatic versus asymptomatic HCW and this， whatever was their index or contact case status. Also， rate prevalence in asymptomatic HCWs was similar in NCS and CS.**\n\n【27】**Discussion**\n\n【28】**Authorities highly advise carrying out systematic screenings for HCW， o better control the spread of COVID-19 into the hospital， irrespective of their symptoms but also when coming back from holidays or following family meetings. However， since wearing a surgical mask at the patient bedside is mandatory for all HCW， and regarding its efficacy and the risk for an asymptomatic HCW to transmit in various situations \\[7，8\\]， one should ask if this control policy is efficient in the hospital. Our data suggest that this policy is responsible for a huge number of non-relevant tests. Indeed， recent publications highlighted the efficiency of the surgical mask \\[9\\] and the**\n\n【29】**low risk of transmission resulting from asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2patients. Moreover， recent studies suggested a low viral transmission from HCW to patient or from patient to HCW， including in case of symptoms， with conditions that one of the 2 partners is masked \\[101. Our work underlines the persistent HCW non-compliance regarding barrier measures and physical distancing during breaks， staff and lunchtime. Indeed， most of the situations that generated contact cases were linked to the non-bedside activities， and we didn’t note any acquisition in our patient's population during the study. Our work presents several limits. In addition to a low number of events， the absence of RT-PCR and serology follow-up in the population of contact HCW can produce an under-evaluation ofpeople secondarily infected， although a clinical follow-up was systematically set up till D+14.**\n\n【30】**Conclusion**\n\n【31】**We should focus our screening on symptomatic HCWs and strongly insist on universall masking and respecting physical distancing during other activities.**\n\n【32】**References**\n\n【33】**1\\.

She didn’t smoke. After therapy， the patient became hyperthyroid and presented ophthalmopathy with positive TRAb. She underwent to corticosteroid and anti-thyroid treatment. After eighteen months of treatment， she maintained asymptomatic and TRAb were negatives. The radioiodine therapy for toxic adenoma may induce GD and thyroid ophthalmopathy even in absence of classical risks factors.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Thyroid-associateddorbitopathy；；Graves's disease；Radioiodine therapy； Thyroperoxidase antibody； Thyrotropin receptor antibodies； Thyroid toxic adenoma**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**The most common causes of primary hyperthyroidism are Graves' Disease (GD)， Toxic Multi-Nodular Goiter (TMNG)，and Toxic Adenoma (TA). GD is an autoimmune disease due to elevation of TSH-receptor antibodies (TRAbs) and/or Antithyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb)， whereas TMNG and TA are caused by autonomous function of thyroid nodules that can be evidenced on scintigraphy \\[1\\]. Actual guidelines suggest treating with Radioiodine Therapy (RAI) or surgery hyperthyroidism caused by Toxic Adenoma (TA). Overall， the success rate of RAI (definitive hypothyroidism or euthyroidism) is 93.7%. However， following RAI therapy there have been reports of new-onset GD (up to 4% prevalence) as well as concern for thyroid malignancy and a very minimal increase in late non-thyroid malignancy \\[1\\].**\n\n【18】**Clinical Case**\n\n【19】**_cited._**\n\n【20】**We presented a 64 year old woman with primary hyperthyroidism. She was referred by digestologist who treated her for cholelithiasis and positive Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA). She didn’t have symptoms of thyroid hyperfunction or local compression. TSH， Free T4， TRAbs and TPOAbs values are summarized on Table 1. Two solid hypoechoic nodules on right lobe of 14 mm x 12 mm x20 mm and 23 mmx 17 mm x 23mm， well-defined， with peripheral and intranodular vascularity were described on ultrasound. Therefore we performed a scintigraphy99mTc pertechnetate that showed focal enhancement on right lobe and suppression of extra nodular tissues. After discussion of treatment possibilities， the patient underwent to RAI therapy without immediately adverse effects. However， forty five days after RAI she complained about palpitations， insomnia， excessive tearing and ocular pain. On physical examination we found elevated cardiac rate， swelling of eyelids， redness of conjunctiva and chemosis. We assessed activity by the Clinical Activity Score (CAS) as 4/7. Exophthalmos plus thickening of both inferior rectus were described by orbital MRI (Figure 1). At that moment， she had clinical hyperthyroidism with positive-TRAbs on laboratory tests (Table 1). We started tiamazol 2.5 mg per day， selenium supplementation and propanolol. After no-improvement， she needed i.v. methylprednisolone bolus (protocol 0.5 g i.v. methylprednisolone once weekly for 6 weeks， followed by 0.25 g once weekly for 6 weeks). However due to adverse effects she only received 2.5 g of methylprednisolone， with clinical complete ocular response (CAS 0). She completed eighteen months oftionamides achieving euthyroidism (Table 1).**\n\n【21】**Table 1： Laboratory test.**\n\n|  | **Reference range**  | **Before RAl therapy**  | **2 months after RAI**  | **6 months after RAI**  | **18 months after RAI**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **TSHmU/L**  | **0.38-4.84**  | **<0.2**  | **0.15**  | **2.27**  | **4.63**  |\n| **FT3 pg/mL**  | **1.6-4.6**  | **6.3**  | **5**  | **2.8**  | **3.6**  |\n| **Ft4 pg/mL**  | **0.8-2.0**  | **1**  | **1.6**  | **1.3**  | **1.1**  |\n| **TRAb UI/mL**  | **0.0-1.5**  | **0.5**  | **102.1**  | **4.3**  | **0.8**  |\n| **TPOAb U/mL**  | **0.0-16.0**  | **5.0**  | **3.0**  | **na**  | **na**  |\n\n【23】**RAI： Radioiodine Therapy； TRAbs： TSH-Receptor Antibodies； TPOAb： Antithyroid Peroxidase Antibodies； na： non-available**\n\n【24】**Figure 1： Orbital MRl showing hyperintensity in the inferior rectus and contrast enhancement along with bilateral exophthalmos.**\n\n【25】**Discussion**\n\n【26】**Our patient developed Graves’ Ophthalmopathy (GO) and GD after RAI therapy for subclinical hyperthyroidism due to toxic adenoma. New-onset GD following RAI therapy is infrequent (less than 4%) and its risks factors are the presence of TPOAbs (incidence up to 22%)\\[1-10\\]. The presence of circulating TRAbs in patients with TMNG or TA points to a diagnosis of Marine-Lenhart's syndrome \\[3\\] and it should be excluded before RAI therapy. Other rare causes of new-onset GD are percutaneous ethanol injection， parathyroidectomy or thyroid surgery \\[11-13\\]. It has been proposed that these situations would release TSH receptor of follicular cells， which would cause an immune reaction and TRAbs activation \\[8，12\\]. Furthermore radiation would deteriorate balance between T-helper and suppressor lymphocytes \\[4\\]. Although the patient had negative TPOAbs or TRAbs prior to RAI therapy， she had autoimmune background as ANA were positive. New-onset GD was treated with anti-thyroid drugs along 18-months due to the presence of GO and patient'preferences. On the other hand， it is well- known that RAI-treated GD patients are at risk of progression or de novo development of GO. To date， risks factors are smoking， severe/unstable hyperthyroidism and high serum TRAbs \\[1，14，15\\]. In these cases， guidelines recommended concomitant short-term course of oral prednisone in order to prevent RAI-associated \\[15\\].Nevertheless the patient described did not have any risk factors but she developed of moderate-to-severe GO after RAI therapy for non-GD disease. In the literature， there has been described one case of OG after RAI therapy for TMNG \\[2\\]. However， that patient turned positive-TRAbs after first dose of I-131 and developed OG after second dose of I-131.**\n\n【27】**As conclusion， clinicians must be aware of risk of GD and GO development after RAI therapyofthyroid dysfunction even in subjects with negative TPOAbs and TRAbs. The role of other autoimmune factors， as ANA， should be confirmed.**\n\n【28】**References**\n\n【29】**1\\.

However， it is uncommon the association of the infiltrate with specific renal histopathological alterations， such as a Granulomatous Interstitial Nephritis (GIN)， with severe kidney function impairment. We describe a patient with progressive TP53 mutated CLL who developed acute renal failure due to leukemic infiltration associated with GIN during treatment with ibrutinib， the new inhibitor of the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase. After stopping ibrutinib， the patient obtained a complete remission with high doses of prednisone plus chemoimmunotherapy， but recently he underwent relapse treated now with venetoclax plus prednisone.**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Chronic LymphocyticLeukemia (CLL)，，alow grade malignancycconsistingof CD5+CD23+CD200+ small Blymphocytes， is the most frequent leukemia in the western world. The treatment landscape for CLL is rapidly evolving. Combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens like FCR (Fludarabine， Cyclophosphamide， Rituximab) and BR (Bendamustine， Rituximab) have been the frontline therapies for CLL， whereas Chlorambucil remained the standard frontline therapy for older patients (65 years or older) with CLL until recently \\[1，2\\]. Targeted therapy with small molecule inhibitors against Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) such as ibrutinib and acalabrutinib are playing a major role for treatment of patients with either treatment-naive or refractory/relapsed CLL \\[3-5\\].**\n\n【19】**The Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib showed an impressive and sustained Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) benefit both in first line and in relapsed or refractory CLL. Nevertheless， patients with specific high risk features like TP53 mutations showed a trend toward shorter PFS， and altogether， only half of the enrolled patients were still receiving ibrutinib at the end of the observation period \\[6\\]. Here， we report a peculiar case of acute renal failure associated with leukemic infiltration and Granulomatous Interstitial Nephritis (GIN) occurring in a CLL patient with TP53 gene mutations， refractory to ibrutinib in first line， but subsequently responding to chemoimmunotherapy.**\n\n【20】**In February 2014， a 59-year-old male patient presented with asymptomatic widespread lymphadenopathy (cervical， axillary， supraclavicular， mediastinal and inguinal) and splenomegaly(18cm onimaging). His white cell count was higher than normal with differential count showing 16.0x10/L lymphocytes. The immunophenotypic study carried out on peripheral blood lymphocytes by flow cytometry showed a CD19+/CD20+/CD5+/CD23-/CD200+ homogeneous phenotype with a IGL-Lambda clonal restriction， confirming the diagnosis of atypical (CD23-) CLL. The prognostic biomarker CD38 was negative (10% of positive CLL cells). FISH analysis revealed the deletion of the long arm ofchromosome 13 (del13q-) and the deletion ofthe short arm of chromosome 17 (del17p-). Clonal mutations of the TP53 gene were also found (variant allele frequency， VAF， 78%， mutation on exon 8 c.916C>T，p.R306X). This pathogenic variant is denoted TP53 c.916C>T at the cDNA level and p.Arg306Ter (R306X) at the protein level. The substitution creates a nonsense variant， which changes an Arginine to a premature stop codon (CGA>TGA)， and is predicted to cause**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： A and B) Immunophenotype of the B lymphocytes shows CD5 C) and CD20 D) positivity.

Variable heavy chain genes of Immunoglobulins (IGHV) status resulted as unmutated， i.e. below the established cut-off of 2% of IGHV mutations (1.7%IGHV3-482). In April 2016， the patient presented a rapid increase in peripheral lymphocytosis (100.0×10/L)， massive increase in mediastinal， abdominal lymph nodes， splenomegaly (24 cm on imaging) and B symptoms. A total Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) scan， showing low Standardized Uptake Values (SUV) ruled out Richter’s syndrome transformation. Therefore， the patient started first-line treatment with oral ibrutinib in monotherapy at the dosage of 420 mg/d， according to the ESMO2016 guidelines \\[8\\]. During the first month of treatment the patient showed discrete increase in total lymphocyte count and then a rapid decrease in the following three months. The values of hemoglobin and platelet remained stable as well as the hepatorenal function. A clinical and imaging re-evaluation of the disease carried out in July showed stable disease. In August 2016， the patient suddenlypresented fever above 38°C together with lumbago and widespread bone pain. Creatinine (3.57 mg/dl)， Azotemia (112 mg/dl)， Proteinuria (0.22 gr/dl) were abnormally increased and the patient was hospitalized for the onset of an acute renal failure. Ultrasonography showed a volumetric increase of both kidneys associated with parenchymal alterations. An immunoassay screening (IgA levels， C3 and C4 complement components) was negative for autoimmune disorders. Therefore， a renal biopsy was performed showing moderate peritubular and intratubular interstitial infiltrates by a clonal subpopulation of small CD20 and CD5 positive B-lymphocytes lacking CD23， Cyclin D1and CD10 expression (Figure 1A，1B). The histopathology was also characterized by a population of CD3+T lymphocytes and by a large， non-necrotizing chronic granulomatous phlogosis (Figure 1C，1D). No glomerular or tubulointerstitial immune complex deposits were detected by immunofluorescence (not shown). The peripheral blood immunophenotype performed by flow cytometry showed a CD20+/CD5+/CD23- and CD200+homogeneous B-lymphocyte population， The FISH analysis and the TP53 mutations confirmed the same**\n\n【23】**picture of the onset. After exclusion of a tuberculous or sarcoidotic nature of renal granulomas \\[9\\]， the patient stopped ibrutinib and started therapy with methylprednisolone at the dose of 1 mg/Kg body weight obtaining a partial resolution of the renal failure. Afterwards， the patient was discharged from the hospital with prednisone therapy. In September 2016， he resumed oral therapy with ibrutinib at the standard dose of 420 mg per day. However， a certain degree of chronic renal failure (Creatinine 2.4 mg/dL， Azotemia 141 mg/dL)， Anemia (Hemoglobin 11 g/dL)， peripheral B clonal lymphocytosis(45.0×10/L)， superficial and inner adenopathies persisted. For this reason， in October 2016， the patient discontinued therapy with ibrutinib and started chemoimmunotherapy according to the R-CHOP scheme (Rituximab 375 mg/m’， Cyclophosphamide750 mg/m， Vincristine 1.4 mg/m， Doxorubicin 50 mg/m’ and Prednisone 40 mg/m²) for a total of six cycles， which was successfully completed in February 2017. During this second-line therapy， the renal function showed a remarkable improvement and creatinine levels were only slightly higher than normal (about 1.5 to 1.7 mg/dL). The imaging re-evaluation， performed with TC total body， did not show either lymphadenopathies or splenomegaly. Therefore， the patient achieved a complete remission of the disease. In June 2019， the patient showed disease recurrence with increasing lymphocytosis(35.0×10/L)，numerous superficial and inner lymph node swellings， splenomegaly， fair kidney failure (Creatinine 2.0 mg/dL) and bone marrow lymphocytic infiltrate. For this reason， in July 2019， the patient started treatment with venetoclax， an oral Bcl-2 inhibitor \\[10\\]， and prednisone， which is ongoing.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**Cases of GIN associated with kidney leukemia infiltrate are uncommon. Sometimes they may occur with acute kidney failure pictures that improve under corticosteroid treatment \\[11-14\\]. Our patient developed GIN framework associated with leukemic infiltrates leading to an acute renal failure during treatment with ibrutinib. According to the current literature， granulomatous reactions may be caused by concomitant mycobacterial infections and rare tumors including malignant lymphomas \\[15，16\\]. The participation of T cells， as in our case， in granulomatous reactions is well established， but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been yet elucidated. Noteworthy， Interleukin (IL) 17， a cytokine secreted by T-lymphocytes has been established as an important factor in T-cell-mediated IFN-gamma production and granuloma formation \\[17\\]. Moreover， the pathogenesis of GIN in patients with CLL/SLL is unknown. There is great evidence that CLL patients have T-cell dysfunction which contributes to infectious and auto-immune complications \\[18\\]. The fact that our case of GIN was accompanied by CLL interstitial infiltration suggest that GIN may be a local hypersensitivity reaction to tumor-derived antigens， which may stimulate antigen-presenting cells to produce cytokines involved in granulomatous inflammation， such as IL-12， IL-18 and/or IL-27 \\[19\\]. Moreover， our patient had not evidence by immunofluorescence of monoclonal protein or immune-complex-type deposits， providing evidence against paraprotein-mediated or immune-complex-mediated interstitial nephritis. In our patient， both the kidney function and the hematological disease improved on high dose steroids and on CLL-directed Chemoimmunotherapy(R-CHOP). It may be hypothesized that the refractoriness to ibrutinib with the subsequent GIN may be partly due to the above mentioned pathogenic variant of the TP53 mutation. B-lymphocyte clone had an immunophenotypic pattern (CD23-/CD200+/Cyclin D1-/CD10-)**\n\n【26】**that excluded mantle cell lymphoma (Cyclin D1 negative)， follicular lymphoma (CD10 negative) and marginal lymphoma (CD200+). It is possible to suppose that it is an atypical CLL refractory to ibrutinib. The vast majority of CLL patients respond to ibrutinib， as reflected by the aggregate observation of PR， CR or prolonged stable disease with nodal response despite peripheral lymphocytosis. However， there are currently no upfront clinical biomarkers to predict sensitivity or resistance to ibrutinib therapy in CLL \\[20\\]. Finally， it may be hypothesized that this clone of expanded B lymphocytes CD23-CD200+ infiltrating the kidney may have caused the histopathology of the GIN as well as the clinical picture of the next renal failure. Noteworthy， ibrutinib， by depressing some populations of B lymphocytes in CLL， may allow the expansion of other non-sensitive clones which are responsible for kidney damage as in this case. This assumption may be indirectly supported by the fact that the subsequent R-CHOP chemotherapy， eliminating the clone both in the peripheral blood and in the kidney， brilliantly resolved renal failure and allowed to obtain complete remission of the disease. This is the first CLL case reported in literature in which the appearance of GIN is described during therapy with ibrutinib. However， larger clinicopathologic studies are needed to determine the incidence and risk factors of GIN in patients with CLL.**\n\n【27】**References**\n\n【28】**1\\.

Online platforms， especially YouTube， have been a very rich source of information for patients. We aimed to evaluate the videos in YouTube related with breast cancer and COVID-19 released during the first 6 months of the pandemic and to determine their reliability and quality for patients and healthcare providers in circumstances of the pandemic.**\n\n【19】**Methods： A YouTube search was performed by using search terms “breast cancer， COVID-19， breast cancer， Corona and breast cancer， pandemic. Videos in English language were evaluated for inclusion. Duplicated videos were not included. A playlist containing 142 videos was created. Videos were categorized according to their content (informative， patient experience， news)， source of upload and their target audience. Video characteristics (number of views， duration， likes， dislikes， comments) were noted. Reliability and quality of videos were assessed by validated tools (DISCERN， VIQI scores， respectively).**\n\n【20】**Results： Informative videos had significantly higher DISCERN scores when compared with patient experience and news videos.

Even though there are useful videos for patients， many unreliable videos are uploaded by non-professional individuals， as well.**\n\n【22】**Keywords： Breast cancer； COVID-19；Health services**\n\n【23】**Introduction**\n\n【24】**In December 2019， a Coronavirus subtype， later named as COVID-19， emerged in Wuhan， China and affected almost every country in the world with more than 5 million people infected and more than 350，000 people deceased \\[1\\]. During these pandemic， daily routines of people， especially patients have changed drastically and reaching the hospitals has become limited. Many surgeries， radiotherapy and chemotherapy sessions are postponed and cancer patients are particularly concerned by these changes that cause delay in their planned treatments.**\n\n【25】**As known； breast cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality and is the most commonly encountered malignancy among the female population \\[2\\]. During this era of pandemic， breast cancer patients inevitably seek information about the course of their disease， while they have limited access to hospitals. Online video platforms， including YouTube which was launched in2005， is the most commonly used among all video sharing platforms， have been a major source of informative and also misleading medical information \\[3\\]. The quality of content in YouTube gains even more importance during these times where patients cannot attend their regular appointments with their healthcare providers. Even though there are many informative and reliable contents uploaded by professionals healthcare providers， misleading and unreliable information are also present and these videos may harm breast cancer patients both clinically and psychologically.**\n\n【26】**In this study， we aimed to evaluate the videos in YouTube related to breast cancerand COVID-19which was released during the first 6 months of the pandemic， and to determine their reliability and**\n\n【27】**quality for patients and healthcare providers.**\n\n【28】**Methods**\n\n【29】**A YouTube search was conducted on May 22nd， 2020 and performed by using search terms “breast cancer，COVID-19， breast cancer， Corona' and breast cancer， pandemic. Videos in English language were evaluated for inclusion. Duplicated videos were not included. A playlist containing 142 videos was created.**\n\n【30】**Classification of videos**\n\n【31】**Videos were categorized into three categories according to their contents. The categories were determined as ‘informative， patient experience'and news. The target audience of the videos was also classified as healthcare providers’and patients’. The up loaders of the videos were classified as professional individuals’， non-professional individuals'， ‘news agencies’ and “hospitals and academic centers'. Video characteristics were noted in terms of video duration， number of views， number of likes’ and ‘dislikes' and ‘days passed since upload.**\n\n【32】**Evaluation of reliability and quality**\n\n【33】**Reliability of videos was evaluated by modified five point DISCERN tool \\[4\\].

The VIQI scale was created to evaluate the quality of videos， specifically. Each criteria of VIQI scale was given a point from1 (poor quality) to 5 (high quality).**\n\n【41】**Video information and quality index (VIQI)**\n\n【42】**Flow of information**\n\n【43】**Information accurac**\n\n【44】**Quality (one point each for use of still images， use of animation， interview with individuals in the community， video captions， and use of a report summary)，**\n\n【45】**_厂_ Precision (level of coherence between video title and content).**\n\n【46】**Two independent physicians (BAU， CS) graded the videos for reliability and quality assessment and final scores were achieved by consensus. Since YouTube is a public website， and the study does not include any patient data， Institutional Review Board approval was not obtained.**\n\n【47】**Statistical analysis**\n\n【48】**Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 25). Normality of distribution of the variables was checked by Shapiro-Wilk test and Q-Qplots. ANOVA test was used for comparison of the normally distributed variable**\n\n【49】**between the 3 groups， and Kruskal-wallis test was used for none normally distributed data. Post-hoc analysis was used for comparison between groups. The Tukey test was used in the groups with normal distribution， and the Games Howell test was used in the groups without normal distribution. P values represent two-sided statistical tests with statistical significance at p<0.05.**\n\n【50】**Results**\n\n【51】**Among 142 videos included in the study， 96 (67%) videos were‘informative， 26 (18%) videos were patient experience' and 20(14%) videos were ‘news'videos. Number of views were significantly different between groups (p=0.001) and news videos had remarkably higher numbers ofviews. Groups had significantly different DISCERN scores (p=0.001) and the mean DISCERN score of informative videos were higher when compared with other groups. Characteristics of the videos in different content categories were compared and results are listed in Table 1.**\n\n【52】**Pairwise comparison of groups was performed for parameters which were identified to be significant. Informative videos were significantly longer and news videos were significantly shorter in duration， when compared to other groups. Informative videos had significantly higher DISCERN scores when compared with patient experience and news videos. Pairwise comparison of different parameters is listed in Table 2.**\n\n【53】**The quality assessment of videos was performed by VIQI scoring system and results are listed in Table 3. Being the lowest possible score in the scoring system as 5 and the highest possible score as 25， the mean total VIQI score was identified as 16.0± 2.5. Comparison of video qualities in different content categories was performed and results are listed in Table 4. Total VIQI score of each group and the scores of flow of information， information accuracy'and ‘quality criteria were significantly different among groups. The precision score(level of coherence between video title and content) was comparable among groups.**\n\n【54】**Pairwise comparison of VIQI parameters， which were identified to be significantly different among groups， was performed. News videos had significantly higher scores in flow of information'parameter， when compared with other subgroups. Informative videos had significantly higher and patient experience videos had significantly lower information accuracy scores when compared with other groups. Results of these pairwise comparisons are listed in Table 4.**\n\n【55】**Discussion**\n\n【56】**Breast cancer is a very common health problem being the leading type of cancer in women with high morbidity and mortality rates， with 245，000 new cases diagnosed each year， according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data visualizations \\[2\\]. Early diagnosis and treatment remains a very important aspect of breast cancer management and restricted access to hospitals during pandemic is a major concern for patients and their relatives. Patients tend to seek information online and YouTube remains to be a very important source of both useful and misleading information. In this perspective； we aimed to evaluate the videos regarding breast cancer and COVID-19， in terms of their characteristics and quality， to gain insight about their usefulness during the pandemic era.**\n\n【57】**There are studies in the literature which have evaluated the importance of social media andYouTube for breast cancer**\n\n【58】**Table 1： Analysis of video characteristics by content category.**\n\n| **Characteristics**  | **Informative**  | **Patient experience**  | **News**  | **p**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Number of videos**  | **96**  | **26**  | **20**  |  |\n| **Audience interaction parameters\\***  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Number of views**  | **145.4±208.2**  | **329.2±289.7**  | **2820.6±6123.1**  | **0.001**  |\n| **Video length (min)**  | **22.1±21.5**  | **7.7±8.9**  | **3.1±2.0**  | **0.001**  |\n| **Duration on YouTube (days)**  | **39.0±18.8**  | **31.1±17.4**  | **41.4±17.7**  | **0.101**  |\n| **Views per day**  | **3.7±4.6**  | **13.3±15.1**  | **89.4±228.2**  | **0.001**  |\n| **Likes**  | **2.6±4.7**  | **10.5±12.6**  | **37.1±76.9**  | **0.001**  |\n| **Dislikes**  | **0.1±0.3**  | **0.3±0.7**  | **3.0±6.5**  | **0.001**  |\n| **Comments**  | **0.5±2.6**  | **3.0±4.4**  | **19.3±47.7**  | **0.001**  |\n| **DISCERN score\\***  | **3.4±0.9**  | **1.1±0.4**  | **1.8±1.1**  | **0.001**  |\n| **Source of upload**  |  |  |  | **0.001**  |\n| **Professional individuals**  | **19**  | **一**  | **一**  |  |\n| **Non-professional individuals**  | **69**  | **20**  |  |  |\n| **News agencies**  | **2**  | **5**  | **20**  |  |\n| **Hospitals， Academic centers**  | **6**  | **1**  |  |  |\n| **Target audience**  |  |  |  | **0.010**  |\n| **For doctors and healthcare providers**  | **17**  |  | **一**  |  |\n| **For patients**  | **79**  | **26**  | **20**  |  |\n\n【60】**\\*mean ± standard deviation**\n\n【61】**Table 2： Pairwise comparisons of video groups according to content.**\n\n| **Characteristics**  | **p value**  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Characteristics**  | **Informative vs. Patient experience**  | **Informative vs. News**  | **Patient experience vs. News**  |\n| **Number of views**  | **0.013**  | **0.151**  | **0.19**  |\n| **Video length (min)**  | **0.001**  | **0.001**  | **0.048**  |\n| **Views per day**  | **0.01**  | **0.239**  | **0.318**  |\n| **Likes**  | **0.01**  | **0.138**  | **0.299**  |\n| **Dislikes**  | **0.313**  | **0.128**  | **0.168**  |\n| **Comments**  | **0.021**  | **0.209**  | **0.304**  |\n| **Source of upload**  | **0.001**  | **0.001**  | **0.001**  |\n| **Target audience**  | **0.022**  | **0.041**  | **NA**  |\n| **DISCERN**  | **0.001**  | **0.001**  |  |\n\n【63】**Values of p<0.05 were accepted as significant and marked bold**\n\n【64】**Table 3： Detailed content analysis of videos based on VIQI scores and pairwise comparison of groups.**\n\n|  | **Mean VIQI score**  | **Informative**  | **Patient experience**  | **News**  | **p**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Flow of information**  | **4.2±0.9**  | **4.1±0.9**  | **3.9±0.9**  | **4.8±0.6**  | **0.002**  |\n| **Information accuracy**  | **4.4±1.0**  | **4.8±0.7**  | **3.2±1.1**  | **4.0±0.9**  | **0.001**  |\n| **Quality**  | **2.7±0.9**  | **2.5±0.8**  | **2.6±1.2**  | **3.5±0.6**  | **0.001**  |\n| **Precision**  | **4.8±0.6**  | **4.8±0.6**  | **4.8±0.5**  | **4.9±0.5**  | **0.418**  |\n| **Total VIQl score**  | **16.0±2.5**  | **16.3±2.2**  | **14.5±3.1**  | **17.2±1.9**  | **0.001**  |\n\n【66】**\\*mean ± standard deviation**\n\n【67】**Brachtenbach et al. \\[7\\] investigated the quality of YouTube videos relating to breast cancer and developed their own scoring system for quality assessment. They have individually attended scores for different components of videos including screening， risk factors， symptoms， diagnosis， classification and management. After evaluating133 videos， they have concluded that many of the videos contain misleading and false statements and high quality videos with reliable information are needed. A different study conducted by Basch et al.\\[8\\] assessed the YouTube videos regarding mammography for breast**\n\n【68】**cancer screening. They have evaluated 173 videos by their numerical characteristics and also presence or absence of information regarding different components of mammography， including preparing for the test， pain， emotional component， last mammography visit， test results， age and medical/family history. They have concluded that misleading information is present in many videos and new ways should be developed in the future for patients to identify the reliable video from the videos with misleading and false information.**\n\n【69】**The DISCERN tool was initially developed in 1999 by Charnock，**\n\n【70】**Table 4： Pairwise comparisons of video groups according to VIQl scores.**\n\n|  | **p value**  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Informative vs. Patient experience**  | **Informative vs.News**  | **Patient experience vs. News**  |\n| **Flow of information**  | **0.621**  | **0.001**  | **0.002**  |\n| **Intormation accuracy**  | **0.001**  | **0.006**  | **0.018**  |\n| **Quality**  | **0.989**  | **0.001**  | **0.007**  |\n| **Total VIQl score**  | **0.022**  | **0.13**  | **0.002**  |\n\n【72】**in order to evaluate the quality of written medical information \\[9\\]. Many studies in the literature adopted this reliability score to assess the medical content in certain resources. In our study， we have detected a very high number of informative videos in YouTube with high reliability scores. However， informative videos had remarkably lower number of views when compared with patient experience and news videos. This was partly due to higher subscribers to the channels of news agencies and individuals with breast cancer， in contrast to lower subscribers of health care professionals and academic centers. So， highly useful and reliable information should reach a higher number of viewers， by promoting these channels with new solutions. Additionally， even though news videos had a remarkably higher mean number of views when individually compared with informative and patient experience videos， because of the presence of extreme values in regards to number of views； the p value was not statistically significant due to the non-normal distribution pattern among news videos.**\n\n【73】**Quality assessment of online contents was performed by several authors in the literature. As an example， Nagpal et al. \\[5\\] analyzed the reliability and quality of YouTube videos as a source of medical information during the Ebola hemorrhagic fever epidemic. They have created new scales (VIQI and MICI) to assess the quality of videos by their overall video quality and medical content. These scales are revised versions of GQS， which was originally developed to evaluate the quality of websites \\[6\\]. Our quality assessments revealed a clear superiority of informative videos over news videos in information accuracy score. However， news videos scored significantly higher in flow of information and quality scores， when compared with informative videos. We emphasize that these results are due to the structured，high quality content and professional production of news agencies， with regards to healthcare providers， which are commonly the main presenters in informative videos. These informative videos can reach more number of views by integrating more images， video captions and animations， which will attract more attention by the viewers and facilitate the spread of reliable and useful information.**\n\n【74】**The source of upload is another important variable， regarding the reliability of the uploaders and the gaining the confidence of the viewer. Vast majority of the videos were uploaded by non-professional individuals and news agencies (62% non-professional individuals， 19% news agencies). Even though the uploaders were non-professionals， the majority of the speakers in those videos were either doctors or healthcare providers. This improves their reliability and the quality of information contained in the video. We emphasize that the most reliable source of upload is the academic centers and hospitals， which represent the most agreed-upon medical information that can be presented to the public. However， the least**\n\n【75】**number of videos were uploaded by these professional centers (0.4%) and increasing these informative and truly useful videos would benefit most for the breast cancer patient population.**\n\n【76】**Our study has several limitations. The reliability and quality S es were determined by two independent physicians and final scores were reached by consensus meeting by the same interpreters. Instead， assessment of intra-observer and inter-observer variability would be a more reliable interpretation of data. Due to the limited number of videos uploaded during a short period of time， further studies with higher number of content， wouldreveal more trustworthy results. However， we intently chose the first 6 months period of the COVID-19 pandemic since there was no general consensus about the treatment and surgical planning ofbreast cancer patients.**\n\n【77】**In conclusion， YouTube is a very rich source of medical information for breast cancer patients. Even though there are useful videos for patients， many unreliable videos are uploaded by non-professional individuals， as well. Increasing the videos uploaded by professional individuals and academic centers would be very useful for patients， especially in times like pandemic， where hospital access is limited.**\n\n【78】**References**\n\n【79】**1\\.

Three groups of libraries were set up， including negative group， trisomy positive group， and simulated SARS-CoV-2 group to detect SARS-CoV-2 and NIPT， and three different SARS-CoV-2 concentration gradients were set up in the simulated SARS-CoV-2 group.**\n\n【21】**Results： For NIPT analysis， negative NIPT result was confirmed in all cases in the negative group and simulated SARS-CoV-2 group， while positive NIPT result was confirmed in all cases in the trisomy positive group. For SARS-CoV-2 analysis， SARS-CoV-2 reads were detected in all cases in simulated SARS-CoV-2 group， and none SARS-CoV-2 reads were detected in the negative group and trisomypositive group. All the results were consistent with the actual situation. In addition， the detected viral reads had significant positive correlation with the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 reads in 1 million total reads.**\n\n【22】**Conclusion： The new technology reported in this study can achieve the purpose of NIPT detection and SARS-CoV-2 detection for pregnant women by drawing only one tube of peripheral blood. In this way， SARS-CoV-2 screening can be performed for pregnant women in the progress of routine prenatal testing， which can find asymptomatic infections and supply optimal management and treatment.**\n\n【23】**Keywords： Asymptomatic infections； COVID-19； Non-invasive prenatal testing； Pregnant women；SARS-CoV-2**\n\n【24】**Introduction**\n\n【25】**Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan， China in December 2019 has becomeaserious globalpublic health problem. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus with envelope belongs to the genus of B-coronavirus. It is the seventh kind of human coronavirus infections， closely related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)，characterized by lower respiratory infection. In the past 20 years， more than 10，000 cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection have been reported in the world \\[1，2\\]. Compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV，SARS-CoV-2 has stronger infectivity. As of September2021， more than 200 million confirmed cases and more than 4 million deaths have been reported in the world \\[3\\]. Considering there are many infections of COVID-19 are asymptomatic， the total number of infections may larger \\[4\\]. As we known， pregnant women are a vulnerable population who were more susceptible to viral infections.SARS-CoV orMERS-CoV infection during pregnancy could lead severe complications such as maternal death， stillbirth， spontaneous miscarriage， and so on. It has been reported that the mortality rate of SARS-CoV infection in pregnant women was**\n\n【26】**25% (10% of the general population)， while the mortality rate of pregnant women infected with MERS-CoV was as high as 37%\\[1，2，5-7\\]. Therefore， a SARS-CoV-2 screening method for pregnant women is required， especially to differentiate the asymptomatic from health pregnant women. The main mode of SARS-CoV-2 spread from person-to-person is through respiratory droplets， close contact and high concentration aerosol transmission. Vertical transmission is also reported occasionally. Some studies showed that a low proportion of newborns delivered from pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were infected with SARS-CoV-2， but most of them had no evidence of placental infection \\[8\\]. A Sweden team reported a confirmed intrauterine vertical SARS-CoV-2 case with high viral load in placenta \\[9\\]. Therefore， the possibility of intrauterine transmission in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ignored. Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) based on cell-free DNA(cfDNA) which is present in maternal plasma has been introduced in routine pregnant examination \\[10\\]. Pregnant women in Changsha， Hunan could get free NIPT， benefitting from the financial support provided by the government's preferential policies. In this study， we present an approach of noninvasive prenatal testing of SARS-CoV-2(NIPT-SARS-CoV-2) to achieve the screening of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women during routine prenatal examination.**\n\n【27】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【28】**Study design**\n\n【29】**This study was approvedbythe Ethics Committee ofthe Changsha Hospital for Maternal and Child Health Care， Hunan， China. A total of 50 pregnant women were recruited from Changsha Hospital for Maternal and Child Health Care between July and September 2020for this study， in which 40 were NIPT negative and 10 were NIPT positive. The SARS-CoV-2RNA sample used in this study was from COVID-19 patients visited in the First Hospital of Changsha，Hunan， China. Written consent was obtained from all participants. An optimized NIPT was designed to detect fetal aneuploidy and SARS-CoV-2 at the same time.**\n\n【30】**Plasma separating and processing**\n\n【31】**First， peripheral blood of pregnant women was centrifuged at1，600 g for 10 min at 4-C. Second， the supernatant was transferred to 2.0 ml EP tubes， centrifuged again at 16，000 g for 10 min at 4C. Finally， the plasma was transferred to fresh tubes and immediately stored in -80-C， with 0.6 ml each tube. The separated plasma was divided equally into two parts， one was for extracting cfDNA， and the other was for extracting SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The plasma cfDNA was extracted by QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen， Germany). The plasma RNA was extracted by QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen， Germany)， and then was reverse transcripted to cDNA immediately by Fapon RNA-sep cDNA Synthesis Kit (Feipeng， China).**\n\n【32】**Library constructing and sequencing**\n\n【33】**The cfDNA and SARS-CoV-2 cDNA were mixed in equal proportion and were used as the input DNA to make the NIPT library. Three groups of libraries were set up， including negative group， trisomy positive group， and simulated SARS-CoV-2 group. The negative group library was prepared by cfDNA and SARS-CoV-2cDNA from NIPT negative pregnant women. The trisomy positive group library was prepared by cfDNA and SARS-CoV-2cDNA from NIPT positive pregnant women. The simulated SARS-CoV-2 group library was prepared by cfDNA from NIPT negative pregnant women**\n\n【34】**and SARS-CoV-2 cDNA from COVID-19 patients. Three different SARS-CoV-2 concentration gradients were set up in the simulated SARS-CoV-2 group， including 1，400 copies/ml， 14，000 copies/ml， and 140，000 copies/ml. Through end repairing， adding adapter， and PCR amplification to prepare the NIPT library， after quality control， the products were sequenced on the Ion Proton platform (Life Technologies，USA).**\n\n【35】**Data analysis**\n\n【36】**The Quality Control (QC) analysis was used to filtered the low-quality reads from raw sequencing data. The clean data were mapped to human genome 19 (hg19). The BAM files obtained were sorted and the PCR repeat reads were filtered. NIPT analysis software (Darui Biotechnology Co.， Ltd.， Guangzhou， China) was used to preform GC-bias correcting and Z-score calculating to determine the risk of fetal chromosome aneuploidy. When the Z-score >3 or <-3 of any chromosome showed that the fetal with high risk of fetal chromosome aneuploidy. At the same time， the clean data were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC\\_045512.2)， and the low-quality reads (mapped length less than 60) were filtered. Then through calculating the number of mapped SARS-CoV-2 reads to determine whether there was SARS-CoV-2 infection.**\n\n【37】**Statistical analysis**\n\n【38】**Paired t-test was used to compare the amount of data that generated by different methods， and Pearson correlation coefficient was used for data correlation analysis. All statistical analysis were performed using R3.5.1.**\n\n【39】**Result**\n\n【40】**Detection of fetal chromosome aneuploidy**\n\n【41】**NIPT analysis and SARS-CoV-2 analysis were performed for all samples. Negative NIPT result was confirmed in all cases in the negative group and simulated SARS-CoV-2 group， while positive NIPT result was confirmed in all cases in the trisomy positive group， including 4 cases for trisomy 21， 4 cases for trisomy 18， 1 case for trisomy 13， and 1 case for trisomy 21 combined with trisomy 13.20 clinical routine NIPT samples from Changsha Hospital for Maternal and Child Health Care were selected randomly to evaluate the sequencing data of the new technology of NIPT-SARS-CoV-2. The results demonstrated that there was no significant difference of total sequencing data in the two technologies， which indicated the new NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 could accurately analyze fetal chromosome aneuploidy without increasing the sequencing data.**\n\n【42】**Detection of SARS-CoV-2**\n\n【43】**SARS-CoV-2reads were detected in all cases in simulated SARS-CoV-2 group， with average 35 reads in 1400 copies group (range4-64)， average 337 reads in 14，000 copies group (range 252-464)， and average 2，759 reads in 140，000 copies group (range 2392-3220). None SARS-CoV-2 reads were detected in the negative group and trisomy positive group. Combined the NIPT result indicated that the new NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 could detect SARS-CoV-2 in the three concentration gradients without affecting the fetal chromosome aneuploidy analysis. The fewest number of SARS-CoV-2 reads only 4 in 1，400 copies group， suggesting that this method could accurately detect SARS-CoV-2 with a viral load of 1，400 copies/ml. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 reads in 1 million total reads was calculated to analysis the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 reads proportion and detected viral reads.. The correlation coefficient**\n\n【44】**between the two up to 0.977， suggesting that the new NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 has potential for quantitative or semi-quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2.**\n\n【45】**Discussion**\n\n【46】**Since the outbreak of COVID-19， asymptomatic infections have beenreported in manystudies \\[11-13\\].Asymptomatic infections mean who have no clinical symptoms and abnormalities in images but with positive detection of SARS-CoV-2. A study focuses on asymptomatic ratio showed that the incidence of asymptomatic was estimated to be 30.8% among 565 Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan \\[13\\]. Asymptomatic infection is also existed in pregnant women. Another study investigated 675 pregnant women for delivery in three New York City hospitals found that 10.4% were positive for SARS-CoV-2and up to 78.6% of them were asymptomatic \\[14\\]. Some studies indicated that the viral load in asymptomatic infections is similar to COVID-19 patients， and the infectivity between the two has no significant difference， which signified asymptomatic infections may accelerate the spread of COVID-19\\[15-18\\]. But it has great challenge to identify and control asymptomatic infections due to no obvious clinical manifestations with them. Screening high-risk populations is a possible effective measure to find asymptomatic. The new method NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 reported in this study can accurately analyze fetal chromosome aneuploidy and SARS-CoV-2 without increasing the sequencing data， and the virus load could low to 1，400 copies/ml.So that through this method SARS-CoV-2 can be detected for all pregnant women when they carry out the routine prenatal testing. In addition， detecting viral nucleic acid by peripheral blood can avoid the drawbacks of collecting nasopharyngeal swabs collection， such as the discomfort and psychological pressure to pregnant women， the exposure of healthcare staff. In this way， pregnant women with asymptomatic infection can be early recognized and controlled， which will be conducive to get the optimal management and treatment for them. The collection of upper respiratory specimens， especially nasopharyngeal swabs， has been widely used to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19. However， in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs， some researches show that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid can also be detected in other sites including sputum， feces， blood and other types of samples \\[19，20\\]. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid can be detected in the blood of COVID-19 patients 2~3 days after onset， and there is even report shown that the same one COVID-19 patient with positive SARS-CoV-2 detection in blood samples， but no SARS-CoV-2 is detected in throat swabs， which suggesting that it is feasible and necessary to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by blood samples. Once virus infection occurs， although it takes a period of time to form toxemia or show obvious clinical symptoms， the nucleic acid fragments of virus degraded in the process of metabolism will enter the peripheral blood at an early stage. Therefore， the new technology NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 has the advantage of screening pregnant women carrying the virus in the early stage of infection. The diagnosis of COVID-19 mainly depends on clinical manifestations， epidemic history， CT imaging screening and etiology detection， among which etiology detection is the most accurate diagnosis scheme \\[21\\]. Etiology detection includes viral nucleic acid detection， antibody and antigen detection， and the viral gene detection by quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) is a priority test recommended by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China \\[22\\]. RT-qPCR can detect viral nucleic acids efficiently and rapidly， with high sensitivity and high specificity. But this method only can detect some specific viral gene regions， such**\n\n【47】**as Open reading frame 1 ab (ORFlab)， Nucleocapsid protein (N) and Envelope (E)， which may cause false negative due to the virus variant. Unlike RT-qPCR， the NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 can detect whole genome of the virus with low-depth sequencing， which can identify virus variants and trace the cryptic origins of the virus in theory. A recently study reported an intrauterine infection case of COVID-19， the puerperal and the newborn were infected with the same virus，but a variant of the virus occurred in the newborn a few days later \\[9\\]. The researchers thought it might be caused by the contact with the external environment after birth， and the virus mutated surprisingly fast， which also suggested the importance of virus gene sequencing. In conclusion， the technology of NIPT-SARS-CoV-2 reported in this study can achieve the purpose of NIPT detection and SARS-CoV-2detection for pregnant women in the progress of routine prenatal testing by drawing only one tube of peripheral blood. In this way， SARS-CoV-2 screening can be performed for pregnant women， so that asymptomatic infections can be early recognized and controlled， which ensure the optimal management and treatment for pregnant women and newborns. In addition， it has the potential for monitoring virus variant and tracking virus transmission， which will be helpful for control the spread of this serious epidemic.**\n\n【48】**Acknowledgment**\n\n【49】**This work is supported by the Innovative Construction Project of Hunan Province， Special Topic on Fighting against Coronavirus Disease 19 \\[Grant Number： 2020SK30441.**\n\n【50】**References**\n\n【51】**1\\.

The most common causes include upper airway cough syndrome， cough allergic asthma， eosinophilic bronchitis， allergic cough， and gastroesophageal reflux cough， which accounts for 70% to 95% of the cause of chronic cough in Department of Respiratory \\[1，2\\]. Cough induced by bronchial foreign body is uncommon. We report an unusual case of chronic cough due to fish bone incarceration in the left lung， suggesting the importance of medical history and bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of chronic cough**\n\n【25】**Case Presentation**\n\n【26】**A 45-years-old male presented to Department of Respiratory with chief complaint of cough for six month. He initially presented to a clinic， where he was diagnosed as bronchitis， for which treatment was begun. Ten days before presenting to our hospital， the patient began to have cough with shortness ofbreath， and the wheezing could be heard. There was a medical history ofa transient cough with blood stasis after eating fish porridge six month ago. Physical examination revealed that nasal sound could be heard in the neck and left lung， and patients were advised to undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy. However， the patient did not accept the advision. The symptoms ofcough relived reduced at first return visit after seven days， but no improvement in shortness of breath. Nasal sound could still be founded in the neck and left lung， but the patient agreed to undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy. During the process of bronchoscopy examination， a foreign body which wrapped around by granulation tissue was found in the upper left lobe of the patient. Under the ECG monitoring， the foreign body was taken out smoothly， which was a fish bone with a length of about 1 cm x0.3 cm (Figure 1). The symptoms of cough and shortness of breath disappeared after treatments for two weeks.**\n\n【27】**Discussion**\n\n【28】**Cough is the most common symptom of patients presenting to respiratory specialist clinics and community outpatient departments. Patients with chronic cough account for more than one-third in respiratory specialist clinics in China \\[3\\]. However， the cause is complicated especially for those whose radiograph was not abnormal obviously. Because the diagnosis is not clear， a number of patients often take ineffective various tests， or long-term antibiotics and antitussives， with side-effect profile unacceptable.Cough is a defensive nerve reflex， which is good for clearing respiratory secretions and harmful factors， however， frequent and severe cough will affect the work， life， social activities and cause high economic burden \\[4\\]. Chronic cough could result in manycomplications in cardiovascular， digestive， neurological， urinary， musculoskeletal and other systems， such as urinary incontinence， syncope， insomnia， and anxiety \\[5\\]. Chronic cough is associated with air pollution closely \\[6，7\\]. The most common causes include upper airway cough syndrome， cough allergic asthma， eosinophilic bronchitis， allergic cough， and gastroesophageal reflux cough commonly \\[8，9\\]， which accounts for 70% to 95%. Imaging examination， induced sputum cytology，pulmonary function test， airway hyperresponsiveness test， FeNO test，24-hour esophageal pH-multiple-channel impedance monitoring were auxiliary test for chronic cough， which is important for the definitive diagnosis of chronic cough \\[3\\]. If symptoms， signs， and examinations could not establish definitive diagnosis， unusual diseases should be considered and pay attention to the role of medical history and bronchoscopy\\[10-12\\]. In this case， the patient had a transient cough with blood stasis after eating fish porridge six months ago and then he was diagnosed as bronchitis for a long time， for which the ineffective treatment was begun. The medical history suggests that there may be bronchial foreign body， and the fish bone wrapped around by granulation tissue in the upper left lobe was found.**\n\n【29】**Conclusion**\n\n【30】**In the diagnosis of chronic cough， we should pay attention to the importance of medical history and bronchoscopy.**\n\n【31】**References**\n\n【32】1\\.

Studies confirm numerous phenotypic features and anomalies of various body systems and organs. Developmentally， a wide range of function has been reported. This study documents the phenotypic presentation of a female with T9M， describes her progress toward developmental motor milestones， and offers insight for the medical community and caregivers of those affected by this condition.**\n\n【18】**Case Description： The patient was born premature with low birth weight， had a complicated medical background and presented with global hypotonia and low function. This study follows the patient from 16 to 36 months of age. The patient received physical therapy for 60 min， twice per week until age 24-months when it was increased to three-60 min sessions per week**\n\n【19】**Outcomes： The Battelle Developmental Inventory， 2nd Edition (BDI-2) was used to assess gross motor function. BDI-2 scores at 16-months old placed the patient at a newborn level. Throughout the study， the patient contended with medical issues-reflux，hearing impairment， vision impairment. She lived with a very supportive family who wanted her to develop to her potential and understood there would be delays in her achieving motor milestones. After 36-months of age， BDI-2 scores for gross motor skills were at a 9-month level.**\n\n【20】**Discussion： Although there are many medical factors potentially affecting development in children with T9M， physical therapy with goals to increase postural control， strength， motor control and function may improve social interactions and ultimately quality of life for these patients. Caregivers and clinicians should strive to aid these children in reaching their potential.**\n\n【21】**Introduction**\n\n【22】**Trisomy 9 Mosaicism (T9M) is a rare chromosomal disorder in which the entire 9lh chromosome appears three times in some cells of the body \\[1\\]. Since the disorder was initially described in1973， over 60 cases have been reported in the medical literature \\[1\\]. Presentation of individuals with T9M varies greatly depending on the percentage of cells with the extra chromosome \\[1，2\\]. Common features include anomalies of the musculoskeletal， cardiopulmonary， urogenital， and central nervous systems， and developmental delays. Musculoskeletal abnormalities reported include congenital hip dislocation/dysplasia； punctuate cartilage mineralization， calcaneovalgus deformity， joint hypermobility， hypotonia， scoliosis and kyphosis \\[2-4\\]. Typically， delays in cognition， motor milestone achievement， speech and self-care are seen \\[2\\]. Developmental status data reveal a wide range of function in motor skills. Average age for sitting without support for at least three minutes was 17 months and for walking with bilateral support was 31 months. Some children used a combination of wiggling， scooting or rolling on their back as a means of mobility \\[2，5\\]. The purpose of this study is to document the phenotypic presentation of a female with T9M and her progress toward developmental motor milestones from 16 to 36 months of age， while receiving physical therapy.**\n\n【23】**Patient History**\n\n【24】**Birth to six months**\n\n【25】**The patient was born at 36 weeks via caesarean section and weighed 4 lbs. 12 oz. She spent 5 days in the NICU， primarily to treat mild jaundice. Due to her small size and some other irregularities， genetic testing was conducted and revealed the patient's diagnosis of T9M， with 7.5% of her cells affected. She presented with craniosynostosis， mild sensorineural hearing loss， and a narrow， high**\n\n【26】**Table 1： Gross Motor Developmental Status.**\n\n| **Gross Motor** **Skills**  | **Status**  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Gross Motor** **Skills**  | **Age (mos.)**  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Gross Motor** **Skills**  | **16**  | **22**  | **28**  | **34**  | **36**  |\n| **Hands to** **midline**  | **Achieved**  | **Maintainec**  | **Maintainec**  | **Maintainec**  | **Maintainec**  |\n| **Turns head toleft and right**  | **Supine**  | **Supine Achieved**  | **Maintained**  | **Maintained**  | **Maintainec** **Maintained**  |\n| **Turns head toleft and right**  | **Supine**  | **Supine Achieved**  | **Achievec**  | **Maintainec**  | **Maintainec** **Maintained**  |\n| **Turns head toleft and right**  | **Turns to left or right about25° from midline**  | **Supported sitting-Turns toleft and right about 60°**  | **Achievec**  | **Maintainec**  | **Maintainec** **Maintained**  |\n| **Hands to feet in** **supine**  | **Emerging-Brings handsto knees**  | **Emerging-Brings right handto right foot**  | **Achievec**  | **Maintainec**  | **Maintained (Removesboth socks)**  |\n| **Pulls to sit**  | **With slight headlag**  | **Achievec**  | **Maintainec**  | **Maintained**  | **Maintainec**  |\n| **Lifts head andchest in prone**  | **Emerging-Lifts head** **1-2 secs about 20° withassist to maintain prone** **positioning**  | **Achievec**  | **Maintainec**  | **Maintained -Pushes up2-3 secs on extendedarms with assist**  | **Maintained-Pushes up 2-3secs on extendec arms**  |\n| **Roll prone to/from supineover either side**  | **Emerging-Rolls supine toleft side**  | **Emerging-Rolls supine to** **left side； rolling prone tosupine over right side is** **emerging**  | **Emerging-Rolls prone to spineover right side**  | **Emerging-Rolls prone tosupine over right side**  | **Emerging-Rolls prone** **to supine over eitherside； supine to prone isemerging**  |\n| **Play with toy inside-lying oneither side**  | **Emerging-Plays using lefthand in left side-lying**  | **Emerging-Plays usingeither hand in left side-lying**  | **Achievec**  | **Maintained (Rolls ballreciprocally to anotherperson)**  | **Maintained**  |\n| **Pivot**  | **No**  | **No**  | **Emerging to right in supine**  | **Achieved to right insupine**  | **Maintained-With legsadvanced， can bridge and** **pivot to left**  |\n| **Sitting**  | **Emerging- Ring sittingwith support at uppertrunk.**  | **Emerging- Ring sitting withsupport at mid trunk，**  | **Emerging-Short sitting with** **support at**  | **Emerging-Short sittingwith support at sides of**  | **Emerging-Tailor sitsbriefly with prapping**  |\n| **Tolerate sitting** **in adapted chair**  | **Awaiting device**  | **30 mins/day**  | **1 h/day**  | **1.5-2 h/day**  | **\\>2 h/day**  |\n| **Tolerates** **standing in** **prone stander**  | **Awaiting device**  | **Awaiting device**  | **20 mins/day**  | **25 mins/day**  | **30 mins/day**  |\n| **Maintains** **quadruped**  | **No**  | **No**  | **No**  | **Emerging**  | **Briefly with support**  |\n| **Bear weight** **through legsin supported** **standing**  | **No**  | **Emerging**  | **Achieved- Bears wt briefly at** **a surface with support throughposterior of body and assistance** **at upper trunk**  | **Maintained-Bears wt for** **30 secs at a surface withsupport at lower trunk/** **pelvis**  | **Maintained-Bears wt forone min at a surface withsupport at lower trunk/** **pelvis**  |\n\n| **Developmental Domain**  | **Age at Testing (in months)**  | **Domain Score (100 is average)**  | **Z Score\\* (0.0 is average)**  | **Raw Score**  | **Age Equivalent (in months)**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Gross Motor**  | **16**  | **55**  | **\\-3**  | **0**  |  |\n| **Gross Motor**  | **36**  | **55**  | **\\-3**  | **24**  | **9**  |\n\n【29】**arched palate but was able to feed by mouth. Her cardiopulmonary system appeared to be normal. She presented with bilateral hip dysplasia which was corrected with bracing. At two months old， she was diagnosed with laryngomalacia. When she was six months old， the patient was diagnosed with seizure activity. She was given Levetiracetam (Keppra) and remained on this drug throughout the study. Multiple EEG tests revealed no subsequent seizure activity.**\n\n【30】**Ten to sixteen months**\n\n【31】**At 10 months old， the patient underwent craniofacial surgery to correct the craniosynostosis. Due to a possible tear in the dura during surgery， fluid began to accumulate necessitating shunt placement(subgaleal-peritoneal)； the next day， the shunt required revision to subdural-peritoneal. At 12 months old， slow weight gain led to a diagnosis of intestinal malrotation and she was also diagnosed with sleep apnea. From that time through the remainder of the study， she was on BiPAP during nights. At 14 months old， the intestinal malrotation was surgically corrected via a Ladd procedure with appendectomy and a G-tube/feeding button was placed. The patient proceeded to vomit often when fed and began to take Ranitidine**\n\n【32】(Zantac) and then Omeprazole (which she was taking through the end of this study)， to treat the reflux. Simultaneously with the Ladd procedure， she underwent a successful supraglottoplasty to correct the laryngomalacia. The patient developed an infection in her abdomen after the procedures， necessitating a month-long hospital stay，during which the subdural-peritoneal shunt was litigated.\n\n【33】**Twenty-four to thirty six months**\n\n【34】**The patient continued to vomit daily until about 24 months old when her parents discovered that by increasing the frequency and decreasing the amount of her feedings， the vomiting decreased， resulting in improved caloric intake， weight gain and endurance. At 30 months old， the patient received new hearing aids and wore them through the remainder of this study. (She had previously worn hearing aids briefly until ten months old when she underwent craniofacial surgery). She received her first pair of glasses to correct for astigmatism and far sightedness at 35 months of age. Throughout the duration of the study， she wore the hip abduction brace sporadically during the nighttime.**\n\n【35】**Table 3： Initial Goals for Six months.**\n\n| **Initial Pt Goals for Six Months (Patient 16-22 Mos. of Age}**  |\n| --- |\n| **Roll prone to-from supine over either side**  |\n| **Play with a toy in side-lying with both hands， on either side**  |\n| **Hold head upright 5 minutes in supported sitting**  |\n| **Reach for a toy； using hands equally**  |\n| **Tolerate upright seating in an adapted chair for one hour per day**  |\n| **Begin standing program using a prone stander**  |\n\n【37】**Family**\n\n【38】**The patient lived in a single family home with her mother， father， older sister and older brother. Her parents initially wanted to see her overall health improve as she was experiencing many medical issues. Motorically， they wanted to see her begin to lift her head when held upright and to develop to her potential， even if hitting milestones according to her own schedule. (Health Insurance， Portability， and Accountability Act-HIPAA- requirements were met throughout the course of physical therapy for this patient and during the preparation of this study. A signed patient consent form was obtained prior to publication ofthis report).**\n\n【39】**Clinical impression**\n\n【40】**Little is known about T9M and its impact on development. The small body of existing research literature reveals a wide range of abilities in children with T9M. This patient presented with global hypotonia andverylimited function. Theaim ofphysicaltherapywasto improve strength and motor control and the patient's abilities toward reaching developmental gross motor milestones. Documentation of the patient's initial presentation and progress throughout the study provides further information to be added to the literature which may aid family members， medical practitioners and other caregivers of children with T9M by increasing their knowledge of the challenges and potential inherent in children with this diagnosis.**\n\n【41】**Examination**\n\n【42】**At 16 months old， the patient presented with global hypotonia. She presented with passive range of motion within normal limits， except at her ankles which presented with dorsiflexion on left at 0°to 10° and on right at 0° to 15°and bilateral pronation. In supine， she preferred to hold her hips and knees slightly flexed about 20 degrees at each joint，knee together and rotated to her left. In supine， she could actively rotate her head to left or right about twenty five degrees from midline， could bring her hands to her knees and she could lift her legs slightly off the floor as a pair. Prone positioning was difficult due to the posture ofher legs and she could only tolerate it for about 30 seconds. When positioned in prone， with assistance to maintain propping**\n\n【43】**on forearms， she could lift her head for 1 sec to 2 sec at a time. She preferred left side-lying and would feel for nearby toys and grab them with her left hand. The patient presented with decreased awareness of her right arm. When pulled to sit， her head did not maintain alignment with her body. In ring sitting with support at upper trunk， she could lift her head and hold it upright for up to a minute when she would hyperextend her neck and spine， requiring manual correction to resume sitting position. She could tolerate left side-sitting with assistance to maintain the position but showed irritation when positioned in right side-sitting. At this time， the patient could not bear weight through her legs in supported standing or kneeling. She had no means of communication. Her gross motor skills were much delayed (Table 1). The Battelle Developmental Inventory， Second Edition (BDI-2)， a norm-referenced tool for assessing developmental milestones， was used to quantify the patient’s skills in the gross motor domain (Table 2)\\[6\\].**\n\n【44】**Clinical Impression**\n\n【45】**The patient was very low functioning， able to lift her head for only 1 sec to 2 sec in prone and for about one minute in sitting with support at her upper trunk. In supported sitting， the patient would hyperextend her spinal and cervical muscles. It was not clear if this was due to a delayed primitive hypertonic extensor pattern or possibly voluntary movement in an effort to return to a supine position of vestibular comfort. Although she was generally hypotonic， there was some muscle shortening of bilateral dorsiflexors and her leg posture was flexed and drifted to her left. She could roll to her left and grab for toys in left side-lying. She had no means of exploring her environment and no means of communication. Goals were written to be achieved within six-month time frames and included tolerance for upright positioning， head control， floor mobility and functional use ofhands while incorporating symmetry of body alignment (Table 3).**\n\n【46】**Intervention**\n\n【47】**Although there are no studies citing the effects of physical therapy specifically on infants with T9M， research has shown early intervention may improve motor development for the short term， especially for pre-term infants \\[7-10\\]. The patient received PT for 60min， twice per week from 16 months of age (after recovering from the abdominal infection) until 24 months old， at which time the patient's improved general health and endurance made it possible to increase PT to 60 min， three times per week. The focus of therapy sessions was to improve head control and core strength， muscle tone， body awareness， tolerance for positioning， motor planning and ultimately motor function. Strategies employed were positioning， stretching of arms and legs， infant massage， Neurodevelopmental Treatment(NDT)， Kinesiotaping (KinesioTex Gold， Molenstraat 15， 2513BH The Hague， The Netherlands)， wearing of a Stabilizing Pressure Input Orthosis (SPIO)+ (SPIO， 127 SW 156h St， Burien， WA 98166) vest and AFOs， use of adapted seating and a prone stander， and parent education and training \\[7-20\\]. During the time of this study， the patient also received speech and occupational therapies.**\n\n【48】**Positioning**\n\n【49】**Tolerance to prone positioning over various surfaces (therapy ball， pillow， foam wedge， PT's legs， the floor) was encouraged with hopes that once the patient could tolerate prone more easily she would begin to push up on her forearms and lift her head，improving head control， trunk strength and upper body strength. The patient preferred to lay on her left side， so right side-lying was promoted. Improved head and trunk control were also addressed using a variety**\n\n【50】**Table 4： 1Reassessment of PT Goals for Six Months.**\n\n| **1\\* Reassessment of PT Goals for Six Months (Patient 22-28 Mos. of Age**  |\n| --- |\n| **Roll prone ta/from supine over either side-emerging**  |\n| **Play with a toy in side-lying with both hands， on either side-emerging**  |\n| **Hold head upright 5 minutes in supported sitting-achieved**  |\n| **Reach for a toy； using hand equally-emerging**  |\n| **Tolerate upright seating in an adapted chair for one hour per day-Emerging**  |\n| **Begin standing program using a prone stander-equipment on order**  |\n| **Short sit with support at mid-trunk with head control for 10 minutes-new**  |\n\n【52】**of positions， including supported ring sitting on floor， supported sitting on a therapy ball with gentle weight shifts， and supported side-leaning， which she could do more easilyto her left， so right side-leaning was emphasized. At 22 months old， the patient received a Rifton\\*(Rifton Equpment PO Box 260， Rifton， NY 12471-0260) Hi/Lo Chair and was initially tolerating sitting for 30 min per day. She received bilateral AFO's and at 26 months old began a standing program， using a prone stander. Use of the chair and stander was to benefit her skeletal development and the processes of her cardiopulmonary and gastrointestinal systems. Her parents were taught various ways to position her and were creative in developing their own. For instance， they discovered their daughter enjoyed sitting propped in the corner of the couch where she could better watch and laugh at her siblings antics.**\n\n【53】**Stretching and massage**\n\n【54】**Gentle stretching of all extremities was employed with a goal to maintain passive range of motion， increase range of bilateral ankles and reduce the risk of muscle tightening due to lack of active motion. Areas of focus were bilateral hip flexors， hip rotators，hamstrings and dorsiflexors.**\n\n【55】**The patient's parents received instruction in stretching and full body massage and the recommendation to provide both daily， to maintain muscle length and to improve proprioception and tone \\[11-14\\]. It was also recommended to stretch and massage herlegs at every diaper change as a way to incorporate the technique into a frequently recurring routine.**\n\n【56】**NDT**\n\n【57】**Facilitation techniques and manual cueing were employed with goals to improve head， neck and trunk control and to facilitate her posture in various positions (i.e. prone， side-leaning). Manual cueing was also used in an attempt to facilitate volitional movements， such as reaching and rolling. Each therapy session was conducted with functional outcomes as the focus \\[15\\]. Parents were taught hand placements and muscle cueing reflecting the patient’s gross motor status and goals at that time.**\n\n【58】**Kinesiotaping**\n\n【59】**Kinestiotape was applied to the patient’s abdominal area in an“x”pattern with tape running from origin to insertion of the abdominal with a goal to help elicit a contraction to assist the patient with lifting her lower trunk in supine and with core control for sitting posture\\[16-19\\]. The tape was worn for three days at a time with breaks of a few days in between wearing.**\n\n【60】**SPIO vest**\n\n【61】**The patient wore a SPIO vest in an attempt to improve core muscle activation and stabilization.

At 24 months of age， she wore the vest during all therapy sessions and by 27 months she was wearing it during the day except for feedings \\[20\\].**\n\n【66】**Parent education**\n\n【67】**Therapy sessions were conducted following a parent teaching model with techniques and strategies explained and taught and parents providing return demonstration.Documentation and written instructions were given to parents describing strategies/techniques to emplov for carryover until the following session.**\n\n【68】**Outcome**\n\n【69】**The patient made slow but steady progress throughout her time in physical therapy. Goals were reassessed at six-month intervals (Table4 and 5) and gross motor skills throughout the study time frame were documented (Table 1). The patient’s BDI-2 scores at 36 months of age， in comparison to those at 16 months， reveal the patient gross motor skills progressed from a newborn level to that of a nine month old (Table 2). The patient showed an increase for tolerance of various positions. She initially could only tolerate prone for about 30 sec， could not tolerate right side-lean， had very little head control in supported sitting and could not bear weight through her legs. By the end of the case study，she could more easily tolerate prone， could side-lean with assistance to either side and could bear weight through her legs in supported standing. Her head control and postural strength had improved so that she was able to tolerate kneeling on her mom's lap and push up on extended arms on her mother's chest to look out of the living room window for several minutes. She had improved her tolerance to upright positioning and could sit in the adapted chair for more than two hours daily and tolerate the prone stander for 30min daily. Episodes of pushing back into extension were no longer present. She achieved some motor milestones-rolling to side-lying and using hands for play， turning head fully to the either side in a variety of positions， removing socks，and rollingprone to supine. Most importantly， she discovered a way to maneuver on the floor toward items of interest and simple methods of non-verbal communication. She could wave “bye bye，\" shake her head， “No，\" and would tap the back of her hand to her chin indicating，“Yes， or，“More.\" All of these new skills enabled her to explore her environment， to communicate withher family and others and to gain some control over her situation and surroundings.**\n\n【70】**Discussion**\n\n【71】**There are relatively few documented cases of T9M. Existing literature reveals a range of ages for achieving motor milestones， i.e.**\n\n【72】**rolling prone to supine from 19 to 66 mos； sitting without support from 10 to 22 mos (Figure 1) \\[2，5\\]. This patient achieved the former at 32 mos. but had yet to achieve the latter milestone. It should be noted that this patient had extensive medical complications and feeding issues that affected her overall health， endurance and ability to have therapy. Also， her BDI-2 Domain scores and Z scores did not change from 17 mos. to 36 mos. ofage； however，the BDI-2 is a norm-referenced assessment tool and although relative to other typically developing three year old this patient's scores represented severe delay， she made noteworthy gains and her progress was consistent. Age equivalents revealed she made progress from the gross motor level of a newborn to that of a 9-month old. Perhaps a more sensitive assessment tool， with a breakdown of components of early motor milestones (i.e. reaching across midline while flexing lower trunk， or flexing and rotating lower trunk in supine to initiate rolling) might have better underscored her progress and achievements. This patient tended to push back into extension when positioned upright until she was about 32 months. Through a combination of increasing weight bearing in prone positioning and the subsequent possible neuroplasticity， increasing the strength of flexor musculature and conditioning her vestibular system to the upright position， she overcame this tendency. Further research might investigate if a preference for cervical and spinal hyperextension is common among children with T9M. Also significant is that the patient's parents discovered that by decreasing the quantity and increasing the frequency of her feedings， she vomited less， improving her health， endurance， and tolerance for prone positioning. Future research might further investigate the effect of reflux on progress toward motor milestones in patients with T9M.**\n\n【73】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【74】Thank you to the patient and her family for participation in this study.\n\n【75】**References**\n\n【76】**l.

A total of 34 intramuscular myxomas have been described in the head and neck area including this one. After words， a literature review was performed regarding aspects and other conditions linked to intramuscular myxoma in this particular area.**\n\n【27】**The case presented was a 78-year-old male with prior history of auricular fibrillation and hypertension and a long term slow-growing deeply adhered soft mass in the right temporal region that grew partially during the last year with no other lesions. He described having the same bulge for at least 20 years without pain， facial palsy， sensory disturbances or other associated symptoms.

The patient described is found close to the age group described in previous articles although the exact beginning remains unknown. It has also been described in the pediatric population， in at least three cases， within the posterior neck region \\[11\\] and one unique case of bilateral intramuscular myxomas affecting the anterior belly of digastric muscles \\[3\\].**\n\n【43】**confirming its cystic nature.**\n\n【44】**Distinctively， these tumors have a perilesional fat rind and adjacent muscular edema \\[181.On PET/CT intramuscular myxomas show mildly F-18 FDG uptake \\[19\\].**\n\n【45】**The usual evolution is a slow-growing and painless tumor. Its size has been described between 2and 8 cm \\[12，13\\] in its largest diameter in the head and neck. One case， found within the hyoglossus muscle measuring ~8 cm x 8 cm， made speech and swallowing difficult\\[13\\]. Another case reported presented with an intense gag reflex on palpation， was to be found within the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. Local compression of the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves was thought to be the cause of her nausea. It was solved after the excision 14\\].**\n\n【46】**The diagnostic process needs to rule out malignancies such as liposarcoma as the main differential diagnosis (with myxoid degeneration)，angiomyxoma，extrasskeletallchondrosarcoma. lymphoma， fibrosarcoma， rhabdomyosarcoma， malignant histiocytoma， myxoid neurofibroma \\[2\\]， low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma or metastatic disease \\[8\\]. It is an important first step in order to discard more preferential management.**\n\n【47】**Previous articles describing temporalis muscle affectation refer the leading symptoms to be a palpable enlarging mass without other symptoms \\[8-10\\]. In our case the patient didn’t show any pain or limitation other than a visible bulge.**\n\n【48】**Other etiologies to be found are related to infection such as subcutaneous abscess or tuberculoma， or benign tumors. _The_ differential diagnosis include2sSlipoma，dermoid cyst， lymphadenopathy，branchial cyst，lateral cervical cyst， rhabdomyoma， leiomyoma， nodular fasciitis and oral focal mucinosis \\[10\\]， nerve sheath tumors or hemangioma 8，14.**\n\n【49】**On more rare occasions it has been associated with tissue infiltration and bone lysis， the latter being described up to seven times in the literature \\[15\\]， and even subcutaneous infiltration， although this manifestation is explained by its formation within any of the facial mimic muscles \\[16\\].**\n\n【50】**The vast majority of these tumors do not show recurrence after surgical excision except a few cases of recurrence that have been reported， mainly after incomplete resection and enucleation. Although the macroscopic aspect is such as of encapsulated， it's been described previously \\[8\\] as an incomplete fibrous capsule with the ability of infiltrating surrounding muscle tissue. Sporadic recurrence is very rare and no metastases have been described \\[4，20\\].**\n\n【51】**In case of a soft tissue mass like the intramuscular myxoma CT， MRI or ultrasonographyare advised， although the definitive diagnosis is by biopsy \\[17\\].**\n\n【52】**On CT and MRI intramuscular myxomas are most commonly seen as ovoid lesions with well-defined margins. Due to the high-water content of myxoid matrix， they show a cystic appearance on unenhanced imaging examinations，this is low attenuation on CT and high signal intensity on T2 weighted MR images. Nevertheless， they demonstrate variable internal enhancement after the administration of contrast material， consistently with solid masses. Focal areas of heterogeneous internal enhancement can be found， favoring confusion with other malignant tumors \\[11\\]. The content within its smooth walls was homogeneous close to 20 Hounsfield Units， which is lighter than muscle and more dense than cerebrospinal fluid，**\n\n【53】**After a positive imaging test， a fine-needle aspiration cytology is usually advised in order to confirm diagnosis. It is characterized by a rich myxoid stroma filled with mucopolysaccharides and fibrous structural proteins with few fibroblasts \\[21\\]. They are furtherly characterized by the presence of spindle cells without atypia or mitosis\\[22\\]. Paucicellularity and minimal vascularity are most commonly encountered in accordance to its nature as a benign tumor. In some cases，hypercellularity and a higher rate of vascularization have been found， becoming necessary to rule out sarcoma lineage \\[2\\]. The main differences in its behavior are that the latter have a rapid growth tendency， ill-defined limits， capacity of infiltration to surrounding tissues， rich blood supply and heterogeneous components within the tumor. The variety of areas within the tumor account for specific tissues，suchas fattytissue，chondroid matrixand focalareas of necrosis**\n\n【54】**\\[11\\]. An important difference to account for is myxoid degeneration changes within some other types of tumors such as liposarcoma， rhabdomyosarcoma orchondrosarcoma \\[10\\]. Histopathological analysis (FNAA and biopsy) showed myxoid content， low cellularity， a focal cyst and capsule continuity without signs of infiltration to the surrounding tissues which adheres to its described general behavior. The findings and clinical follow-up point to the fact that surgery was curative. This case describes an archetypical appearance and treatment of this pathology but it is wise to consider other syndromes in particular scenarios.**\n\n【55】**If multiple IM were to be found， discarding systemic syndromes is advised. Mazabraud Syndrome (MS) is a rare syndrome that is characterized by a higher recurrence and multiple IM with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia \\[23\\] with a higher incidence in females (x2.3)\\[24\\]. Fibrous dysplasia is more prevalent and usually precedes the onset of IM， which is a single tumor in half the cases \\[23\\]. Polyostotic dysplasia is the most common type over monostotic affection \\[23，25\\].**\n\n【56】**In the largest cohort found in the bibliography， out of 1，446patients with intramuscular myxoma the prevalence of MS was found to be 2.2%. The disparity of onset timing postpones the diagnosis of MS to an average of 10.1 years. In this specific population， almost a third of the cases have had recurrence within the first 8.5 years after surgery despite free margins on average. The results of said multicenter study have found association between higher cellularity of myxomas and recurrence \\[251. Even though this is not the situation in the case reported， we feel like it is advisable to consider this diagnosis in the forementioned situations.**\n\n【57】**Summary**\n\n【58】**凸 Intramuscular myxoma is a rare， slow-growing andpainless tumor to be found within head and neck area. The main referred symptoms are bulge and compression by mass effect.**\n\n【59】**号 CT，MRI， ultrasound and FNA or biopsy is the basis for diagnosis.**\n\n【60】**Surgery has been described to be curative in the vast majority of cases， with a very low recurrence rate.

A small percentage of those children go on to develop more severe complications， including pneumonia， empyema， myositis， and sepsis. We present the case of a previously healthy 6-year-old female who developed an extra-pulmonary， extra-muscular right anterior chest wall abscess following infection with influenza. To our knowledge，this sort of abscess has never been described in a pediatric patient in the literature.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Influenza； Abscess； Pyomyositis**\n\n【13】**Case Presentation**\n\n【14】**A six-year-old female presented to the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) with complaint of a right-sided chest\"lump.\"Nine days earlier， she began having cough and fever， with a maximum temperature of 104°F. She went to an urgent care center， where a rapid flu test was positive， and was sent home with a prescription for oseltamivir. Despite treatment， the patient continued to have non-productive cough and fever and began to develop right shoulder pain. Four days later， she went to her pediatrician， who ordered an X-ray of her shoulder and clavicle to evaluate the pain， as well as a chest X-ray for the cough. X-ray of the shoulder and clavicle was reportedly normal， but the chest X-ray showed “fuzziness.”**\n\n【15】**The next day， the patient visited the PED on her pediatrician’s recommendations. Her fever， cough， and right chest wall and shoulder pain had persisted， and she had also developed diarrhea， occasional vomiting， and anorexia. At that time， the patient was febrile with a temperature of 100.7°F with a pulse of 110， respiratory rate of 50， blood pressure of 80/52， and oxygen saturation of 100%on room air. On exam， the patient was tender to palpation along the right pectoralis major with decreased range of motion in the right shoulder secondary to pain. The remainder of her physical exam was normal. CBC and CMP were normal. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was elevated at 12.6. Chest X-ray in the PED showed right middle lobe pneumonia and the patient was discharged home with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.**\n\n【16】**Four days later， at our initial interaction with the patient， she returned complaining of a right-sided chest “lump\". While her fever was persistent， the fever curve and her cough had improved. The primary concern at this visit was that the diffuse chest wall swelling that was noted on her first PED visit had become much more consolidated， forming a “lump\"on the right side of her chest. Additionally， she experienced pain in this “lump”that radiated to her right shoulder， causing decreased range of motion. The patient's mother reported compliance with medications previously prescribed. The patient's vital signs on presentation were within normal limits. On physical exam， the patient was holding the right shoulder higher than the left and fullness was visible in the right supraclavicular area. A 3 cm ×3 cm area of edema was palpable in the right parasternal region， covering the third and fourth intercostal spaces (Figure 1). While the swelling was tender to palpation， there was neither discrete mass palpable nor erythema to the area. CBC was normal except for a mild thrombocytosis of 512. CMP was entirely within normal limits. CRP was improved from prior visit but still elevated at 6.5 and ESR was increased at 68. LDH， uric acid， and creatine kinase were all normal**\n\n【17】**Given the patient’s physical exam findings with worsening swelling and pain， a bedside ultrasound was obtained to evaluate the area， which revealed an abscess in the right anterior chest，WI wall (Figure 2). Subsequently， a CT of the chest was obtained， which showed a 6 cm x2 cm x4.3cm lobulated abscess in the right upper chest wall， extending from the tissue posterior to the clavicle to the level of the anterior second rib (Figure 3).**\n\n【18】**Figure 2： Bedside Ultrasound with Visualized Fluid Collection.**\n\n【19】**The patient was admitted to the pediatric surgical service. The day after admission， the abscess was drained in the operating room； wound cultures subsequently grew Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). After a two-day hospitalization， the patient was discharged home on oral clindamycin. She recovered without any complications. On surgery follow up， she had returned to her baseline state of health.**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**While our patient ultimately developed a serious complication， her initial illness was infection with the influenza virus. The influenza virus is an orthomyxovirus that is primarily spread by droplet transmission， although contaminated surfaces can also cause contact transmission. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 4 days once a host is infection \\[1\\]. Once infected， viral shedding begins 24 h prior to fever onset and then correlates with fever severity \\[1\\]. However， young children and immunocompromised children can have a prolonged shedding period. In temperate parts of the world， peak influenza season is typically in January or February； however， in equatorial locations， there is no clear influenza season as the virus tends to persist year-round1.**\n\n【22】**Influenza is， in addition to the name of the virus， also the syndrome caused by the virus. Classically， infection results in sudden fever， chills， and myalgia. The initial symptoms are followed by the development of severe cough， pharyngitis， and rhinorrhea. It is important to remember， however， that young children and particularly infants may not develop this typical presentation \\[1\\]. Infants may only present with irritability and fever， while young children may present with pneumonia，croup，bronchiolitis， or a non-specific viral upper respiratory tract infection \\[1\\]. While adults rarely have gastrointestinal symptoms， these may be a prominent feature of children's disease \\[1\\].**\n\n【23】**Diagnosis ofinfluenza is most commonly done with rapid antigen testing， which measures reaction between the patient's influenza antigens in their secretions and influenza antibodies in the testing material \\[1\\]. Of note， nasopharyngeal samples are preferable to those**\n\n【24】**obtained from the patient’s throat. Main advantages of rapid antigen testing including swift results， being able to distinguish between types of influenza (A vs. B)， ease of bedside testing， and high specificity \\[1\\]. Despite these advantages， though， shortcomings of the test must also be considered-a sensitivity that varies between 20% and 90% and accuracy that depends on disease prevalence within the community\\[11.**\n\n【25】**While most cases of influenzaare relatively mild andself-resolving， some patients do go on to develop more serious complications. One study of nearly 7000 pediatric patients that were hospitalized due to influenza in 10 states between 2003 and 2010 evaluated the frequency of various complications. They found that the most common complication was sinorespiratory disease， which occurred in 40% of children \\[2\\]. Within this broad category， secondary pneumonia was the most common complication， occurring in 28% of all children， followed closely by asthma exacerbations， which developed in 18% of all children \\[2\\]. S. aureus and S. pneumonia were the most common bacterial pathogens identified in patients with pneumonia， which is consistent with previous reports \\[2\\]. Of the two， infection with S. aureus is less common， but more serious， especially if caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Other， less common sinorespiratory complications included otitis media， croup， and acute bronchitis \\[2\\]. The second most common complication was dehydration and volume depletion， occurring in 22% of all children hospitalized with the flu\\[21.Other notable complications occurring in >1% of patients include seizures (both febrile and non-febrile)， bacteremia， and sepsis \\[2\\].**\n\n【26】**While lung abscess and empyema are widely considered to be common complications of influenza， this multi-center study found them to be present in <2% of children hospitalized with the flu \\[2\\]. Similarly， myositis-a reportedly common complication-was found to be present in only 1% of hospitalized patients \\[2\\]. However， this report may be falsely decreased as myositis is likely diagnosed in the outpatient or emergency room setting in patients that do not require hospitalization. There is no mention of extra-pulmonary abscesses in this study， suggesting that this is an extremely rare complication.**\n\n【27】**Three case reports do exist that describe similar cases of pustular accumulation outside the lung. In the adult literature， there is a report of a previously healthy 31-year-old male who developed multiple intramuscular abscesses in all four extremities following H1N1 infection \\[3\\]. Another report exists that describes _an_ immunocompromised 81-year-olddfemaleeonlong-term steroid therapy with development of intraperitoneal free air and a retroperitoneal abscess after Influenza B infection； the authors theorized that the insult of viral infection weakened her already damaged intestinal mucosa， leading to micro-perforations \\[4\\]. To our knowledge， the only report of a pediatric patient with abscess formation following influenza describes a 5-year-old female with**\n\n【28】**acute osteomyelitis and subperiosteal abscess during an infection with Influenza A \\[5\\].**\n\n【29】**In the patient we present here， the exact etiology of her symptoms is unclear. The relatively high prevalence of post-influenza MRSA pneumonia and location of this patient’s abscess raises the possibility of direct translocation of bacteria across already damaged pleura. A second possibility would be hematogenous spread in a patient whose immune system was already taxed by the influenza virus. Lastly， a completely unrelated process is possible； however，there was no history of trauma to the skin or superficial skin findings such as pustule or cellulitis to suggest a simple cutaneous abscess. Purulent collection was deep to muscle， suggesting a non-dermatologic source of bacteria.**\n\n【30】**Conclusion**\n\n【31】**Influenza is a common virus that infects thousands of children annually. The majority of these children recover without any significant sequelae. Of those that do have further complications， pneumonia， asthma exacerbation， and dehydration are among the most common. Purulent infection in the form of empyema occurs in less than 2% of patients. To our knowledge， this is the first**\n\n【32】**intramuscular abscess following influenza infection that is described in the literature. Increased awareness of rare complications， like this case， may prompt providers to consider patients with recent influenza in a different light.**\n\n【33】**References**\n\n【34】**1\\.

Mutation in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene is one of the principal mechanisms leading to tumorigenesis of NSCLC and was found in up to 50% of Asian， female patients who never smoked \\[2\\]. EGFR mutation occurs mainly in exons 18 to 21， especially exon 19 deletion and exon21 L858R covering about 85% of all EGFR mutations and resulting in a generally favorable response to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) therapy \\[3\\]. The remaining 10% to 15% of EGFR mutations are regarded as \"non-classical”or “uncommon”mutations and composed of a heterogeneous group of single or compound gene alterations within exons 18 to 21 \\[4\\]. However， the clinical significance and implications of uncommon mutations in EGFR are still unclear. Approximately 5% to 10% of TKI-treated patients exhibit primary resistance \\[5\\]. Here， we report a case of lung adenocarcinoma in which primary resistance to gefitinib treatment was caused by a novel G735R point mutation of EGFR exon 19.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 74-year-old man was admitted to our hospital in January 2019 due to a chronic cough. Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed a mass in the left upper lobe and enlarged multiple lymph nodes in the ipsilateral mediastinum and hilum (Figure 1A). An Endobronchial Ultrasound Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) biopsy from the left principal bronchus was performed. The results of Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining showed adenocarcinoma infiltration in the lung tissue， and poorly differentiated carcinoma was the dominant type. The**\n\n【23】**Table 1： Gene mutation lists for the NGS analysis.**\n\n| **Gene name**  | **Mutation**  | **Mutation** **abundance (%)**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **EGFR**  | **NM\\_005228 exon19 c.2203G> Cp.G735R**  | **17.62**  |\n| **TP53**  | **NM\\_000546 exon5 c.537T>Ap.H179Q**  | **81.16**  |\n| **ERBB2**  | **Copy number gain**  | **4.78**  |\n\n【25】**immunohistochemical markers were as follows： ALK-Lung(-)，CD56(-)， CK (pan) (+)， CK7 (+)， TTF-1 (-)， Napsin A (+)， P63 (-)， CK5/6(-)， Syn (-). Thus， the patient was diagnosed of stage IV (T4N3M1b) central lung adenocarcinoma with metastasis to mediastinal lymph node and right adrenal gland. The patients received one cycle of chemotherapy and subsequent standard follow-up. In February 2019， a follow-up thoracic CT performed after one month of chemotherapy， revealed the increase of lung lesions. A biopsy sample was subjected to 13-gene Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. Genomic sequencing showed novel mutation of EGFR p.G735R in exon 19， ERBB2 copy number gain and TP53 p.H179Q mutation (Table1). According to the result of EGFR G735R mutation， the oral administration of gefitinib was initiated on February 25h， 2019. Follow-up clinical and imaging examinations at 6 weeks of treatment showed rapid disease progression with enlargement of lung tumor(Figure 1B). Then the patient died in one month later， indicating a pattern of primary resistance.**\n\n【26】**Discussion**\n\n【27】**Resistance to EGFR-TKIs can be divided into primary or acquired resistance \\[6\\].Primary resistance refers to the immediate inefficacy of EGFR-TKI in three months， while acquired resistance is progression of the disease after duration of clinical benefit \\[7\\]. Acquired resistance to TKI in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring sensitive EGFR mutations has been well documented， such as somatic T790M mutation and germline T790M polymorphism， or germline EGFR V843I mutation \\[8，9\\]. However，knowledge of primary TKI resistance is limited. In our case， the patient showed rapid resistance to gefitinib. None of the existing mechanisms for primary resistance was found. Instead， NGS revealed a rareprimary EGFR mutation，G735R in exon19 within the pretreatment tumor， implying close correlation with the rapid resistance to gefitinib. EGFR G735R point mutation in exon 19in lung cancer has not been reported in the literature or databases and clinical significance is unknown \\[10\\]. However， a transition exon 19c.2203G>A，p.G735 Smutation at the same position has been observed\\[11，12\\]. This mutation has been described seven times in lung cancer**\n\n【28】**(COSMIC databank accessed 31.10.2019) with no data on response to EGFR-TKI therapy given in the literature. One research on prostate cancer in vitro revealed that \\[13\\]， EGFRG735S may be a pathogenic mutation and is related to the occurrence and development of tumors. Western blot analysis showed that the EGFRG735S mutation enhanced cell growth and invasion via constitutive and hyperactive tyrosine phosphorylation and led to the activation of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK)， Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) and Akt pathways. In addition， a recent study has reported a case carrying G735S mutation \\[14\\]. The patient with adenocarcinoma stage IV showed progressive disease on 2nd line EGFR-TKI therapy with gefitinib， suggesting that this G735S mutation is associated with resistance toEGFRTKI. The same finding in our case is that the EGFR G735R mutation was primary resistant to gefitinib treatment. To our knowledge， this is the first case to report the efficacy of the first generation TKI in an NSCLC patient harboring this rare mutation. The second-generation irreversible EGFR-TKI， afatinib， exhibits more convincing efficacy against non-classical EGFR mutations \\[15，16\\]. In addition to EGFR mutation， the patient in our case also harbored EBRR2 copy number variants and TP53mutation. Genomic data suggest that afatinib combined with ERBB2monoclonal antibody may be effective. Upon a comprehensive literature review， a recent case report from China presented a patient with advanced NSCLC harboring a rare EGFR L747P mutations in exon 19， who failed fist-line gefitinib and the third generation TKI osimertinib but achieved sustained disease control to bevacizumab and erlotinib \\[17\\]. The possible reason is that the upregulation of the EGFR signaling pathway enhances the production of angiogenic factors， including VEGF， and dual blockade of VEGF and EGFR， resulting in additive anti-tumor activity， and may prove to be an alternative treatment in advanced NSCLC with resistance \\[18，19\\].In our case， the patient died before being treated for gefitinib resistance and the efficacy of subsequent second generation TKI cannot be evaluated. Based on in vitro testing， we wondered whether afatinib or bevacizumab were a clinically beneficial regimen for NSCLC patients with the EGFR G735R mutation， but to date， no case reports have been verified.**\n\n【29】**Conclusion**\n\n【30】**In conclusion， the results of this case suggest that the rare EGFR G735R mutation in exon 19 confers primary resistance to the first generation TKI gefitinib. Because of the rarity of this mutation， the relationship between G735R mutation and gefitinib resistance**\n\n【31】**requires further study. Moreover， it is necessary to seek strategies to overcome G735R associated TKI resistance.**\n\n【32】**References**\n\n【33】1\\. Shi YK， Au JS， Thongprasert S.

It is thought to be polymicrobial with Klebsiella being one of the most common organisms usually seeding the liver/biliary tract secondary to transplacement from the gut to the portal vein \\[2\\].**\n\n【9】**Klebsiella pneumoniae， a gram-negative and opportunistic pathogen， has emerged as a major threat in recent years due to its multidrug-resistant strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and/or carbapenemases causing disseminated community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections which are challenging to treat. HvKp-induced liver abscess is an emerging cause of PLA worldwide requiring immediate attention \\[3\\]. Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) affects immunocompetent hosts which were previously common in the Asian pacific rim is now claiming its global dominance \\[4\\]. Despite being a gram-negative organism， it has an increased propensity to spread metastatically. It can cause multi-organ infection and is associated with high morbidity and mortality even among immunocompetent hosts， though diabetes has been shown to be a significant risk factor.**\n\n【10】**We present a unique presentation of HvKp PLA initially presenting as Diabetic Ketoacidosis(DKA) unmasking itself with septic emboli to the lungs and the brain.**\n\n【11】**Case Presentation**\n\n【12】**A 41-year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history of non-insulin-dependent type 2diabetes mellitus presented with 3 days of malaise， generalized fatigue， lethargy， abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting， and rapid shallow breaths after running out of her medications4 days prior to presentation. Physical exam was significant for Kussmaul's breathing and mild abdominal tenderness otherwise was unremarkable. The patient remained hemodynamically stable， afebrile， and on room air. Labs revealed white count of 17.88 K/mm， hemoglobin 11.1 G/dL， platelets 434 K/mm， bicarbonate 5 mmol/L， anion gap 28， ketones 5.2 mmol/L， serum osmolality322， glucose 429 mg/dL， alkaline phosphatase 575 U/L， AST 20IU/L， ALT 32 U/L， hemoglobin Alc>14%， procalcitonin 2.45 NG/mL， lactic acid 4.97 mmol/L. Chest X-ray on admission revealed no focal airspace consolidation.**\n\n【13】**The patient was subsequently upgraded to ICU level of care for diabetic ketoacidosis and sepsis. Treatment was started with 200 mL/h of intravenous fluids and regular insulin infusion. Given the patient's septic picture and abdominal pain， CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast only was obtained which revealed a large pyogenic liver abscess with extension beyond the inferior liver capsule with an abscess in the right perinephric space involving the lower pole of the right kidney along with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules in the lung bases with a peripheral distribution in a few with early cavitary changes suggestive of septic emboli. Blood cultures showed growth of Gram negative bacilli prompting initiation of cefepime. On day 2 of hospitalization the patient's anion gap closed with the initiation of basal/bolus insulin and transfer from ICU to the intermediate medical care unit.**\n\n【14】**On day 3 of hospitalization， her blood cultures speciated to Klebsiella preumoniae with IR drainage and JP drain placement for pyogenic liver and perinephric abscess. Patient was evaluated by an infectious disease specialist. A quick string test was done in the microbiology lab which was positive hence her sepsis and metastatic infection was deemed secondary to hypermucoviscous _Klebsiella bacteremia._**\n\n【15】**Antibiotics were de-escalated to ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily. Echocardiogram was ordered for the**\n\n【16】**Figure 1： CT abdomen and pelvis with lV contrast Showing largely regular fluid density lesions within the right labe of the liver with a rim enhancement and multiple smaller peripheral lesions which appeared to call less measuring approximately 10.0 cm x 9.4 cm x 10.2 cm.**\n\n【17】pulmonary nodules in lung bases with peripheral distribution.\n\n【18】**assessment of valvular disease along with a CT chest for pulmonary nodules.

On subsequent follow-up appointments the patient remained symptom-free with benign abdominal examination and normal inflammatory markers hence no further imaging was obtained.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**Liver abscesses are subcategorized into pyogenic， amoebic， parasitic， and fungal which are all associated with high mortality in untreated patients emphasizing the importance ofearly diagnosis \\[2\\]. Majority of the liver abscesses are noticed in the right lobe of the liver secondary to its increased blood supply however less commonly they can be seen in the left liver lobe or caudate lobe \\[2\\]. Before the advent of percutaneous drainage， surgical intervention was the mainstay of treatment with gastrointestinal sources like diverticulitis and peritonitis most common causes however in recent years biliary tract pathology has been known to be the most common trigger causing pyogenic liver abscesses affecting 55- to 65-year-old age group unlike our patient in this study case \\[1\\]. PLA treatment nowadays includes antibiotics， percutaneous drainage when abscess size is larger than 5cm， or rarely surgical intervention \\[5\\].**\n\n【26】**PLA is polymicrobial with the most common bacteria being E. _Coli， Klebsiella， Streptococcus， Staphylococcus， and anaerobes \\[2\\]._ PLA secondary to Klebsiella has recently become a cause of concern given new emerging Hypervirulent strains (HvKP) and Carbapenem-**\n\n【27】**Resistant (CR-HvKP). Despite being a well-recognized organism， invasive syndromes affecting immunocompetent hosts causing life threatening infections were not reported previously with HvKp in the first world countries； first recognized in Asia \\[6，7\\]. Their capability of producing hypermucoviscous capsules helps them distinguish from the classic Klebsiella variant on the string test. String test， an initial screening test for these phenotypes assessing the ability of the bacterial colonies to form a hypermucoviscous string >5 mm after an overnight growth on agar plate has now become insufficient for diagnosis \\[6\\].**\n\n【28】**HvKP's virulenceilsS attributed to its hyperCcapsule， fimbriae， porins， excessivesiderophores， andmacromolecular exopolysaccharides， among others \\[6\\]. These pathogens can cause invasive infections including endophthalmitis， meningitis， brain abscesses， osteomyelitis， muscle abscesses， and pyogenic liver abscess among others \\[8\\]. Literature suggests a possible relationship between high BMI， alcohol use， and poor glycemic control as in our patient with the development of PLA with risk reduction by modifications of these risk factors \\[9\\]. In such patients with risk factors and appropriate clinical presentation， multiple sites for metastatic infection should be evaluated for early source control which remains the mainstay of treatment along with long-term antibiotics depending on sensitivities\\[10\\].**\n\n【29】**Treatment includes prolonged antibiotics along with source control. HvKP strains unlike the extended-spectrum-producing beta-lactamases-producing strains and carbapenem-resistant strains are susceptible to common antibiotics as evident in our patient since her HvKP strain was susceptible to ceftriaxone \\[6\\]. The rise of these strains is alarming， requiring an emphasis on preventative measures to curb the spread of these deadly infections. Exposure prevention， contact tracing， and hand hygiene have been paramount in limiting the spread of these pathogens.**\n\n【30】**Conclusion**\n\n【31】**In conclusion， various strains of klebsiella with increased resistance affecting immunocompetent hosts causing invasive syndromes which are increasingly difficult to treat have not been extensively reported in the literature previously. Given its varied presentations， it is of paramount importance to raise awareness of**\n\n【32】**its different clinical presentations for early and prompt recognition preventing invasive infections by source control. Source control is the mainstay of treatment in these infections along with the requirement for prolonged antibiotics given extension hypermucoviscosity and biofilm production making them difficult to eliminate. Increased knowledge about preventative measures is warranted including hand hygiene to prevent and curb the spread of these worrisome strains.**\n\n【33】**References**\n\n【34】**1\\.

This coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs is generally considered to be the result of immune-associated escape mutations which include deletion and point mutations within the preS/S region of the genome. This case report reveals another mechanism.**\n\n【15】**Case Report： This study was designed to analyze the reasons for concurrent HBsAg and anti-HBs in a patient with chronic HBV infection. Serological markers of HBV infection were determined by ELISA. The preS/S gene were analyzed by gene amplification and sequencing. The tests revealed that HBsAg and anti-HBs coexisted in this patient with mixed infections of full-length preS/S virus strain and preS1 183 bp deletion mutant， and the mutant disappeared along with the anti-HBs after one year， which means that the mutant strain was cleared by the detected antibodies.**\n\n【16】**Conclusion： It is speculated that the production of anti-HBs targeted specifically to the preS1deletion mutant strain instead of the strain with full-length large S protein. This is quite different from the other immunopathogenetic mechanism for concurrent HBsAg and anti-HBs.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Hepatitis B virus； Chronic Hepatitis B； HBsAg； anti-HBs； preS deletion mutant**\n\n【18】**Background**\n\n【19】**Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection is a serious global health problem. It can result in a self-limiting acute infection or Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) depending on the interaction between the host's immune system and the virus \\[1\\]. HBV codes for three Hepatitis B surface Antigen(HBsAg) proteins (large， middle， and small). The large multifunctional HBsAg protein surrounding the hepatitis B virion is coded by the preS1/preS2/S region of the genome. The Myristoylated N-terminal portion of the preS1 domain contains a ligand that binds to the Sodium Taurocholate Cotransporting Polypeptide (NTCP) receptor found on human hepatocytes that is necessary for infection. Specific antibody responses targeting HBsAgplay an important role in neutralizing HBV infectivity and clearing noninfectious HBsAg particles from peripheral blood. Thus， the presence of antibodies to HBsAg(anti-HBs) indicates viral clearance and is often a sign of recovery from HBV infection. In contrast， once the disease progresses to Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB)，anti-HBs generally does not coexist with HBsAg.**\n\n【20】**In those cases where concurrent HBsAg and anti-HBs occurs in patients with CHB， atypical serological characteristics are observed. This coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs is generally considered to be the result of immune-associated escape mutations which include deletion and point mutations within the preS/S region of the genome \\[2\\]. However， no significant or identical differences have been reported in the incidence of amino acid substitutions in the small S gene region of the HBV genome from CHB patients with and without anti-HBs \\[3\\] which appears to contradict the hypothesis that HBV escape mutants are selected by concurrent anti-HBs.**\n\n【21】**In this paper that evaluates the full-length large HBsAg， a deletion mutant large HBsAg and anti-HBs coexisted in the serum of a patient with chronic HBV infection. After a year， both anti-HBs and mutant HBsAg disappeared. The correlation between immunity and mutation in this case warrants further investigation**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**Peripheral blood samples originated from a 43-year-old Chinese male patient with genotype C CHB， who had never been vaccinated and was admitted to the 960h Hospital of the PLA Joint Logistics Support Force for regular physical examination. Routine screening discovered that he had concurrent HBsAg and anti-HBs. Peripheral blood samples (5 mL)， identified as Sample 1 and Sample 2， were collected on two separate occasions at an interval of one year. This study was approved by the hospital ethics committee.**\n\n【24】**Serological markers of HBV infection were determined by commercially availableEnzyme-LinkedImmunosorbent Assay(ELISA) kits (Xiamen Xinchuang， Shanghai Kehua， China). Positive and negative controls were included in eachtest. The tests were carried out according to the instructions of each kit. The virological tests of Sample 1 were reactive for HBsAg， anti-HBs， Hepatitis B e Antigen(HBeAg)， and Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc). HBV DNA viral load was 2.16×10 IU/mL. The results for Sample 2 revealed reactivity against HBsAg， HBeAg， and anti-HBc， with an HBV DNA viral load of 1.29×10IU/mL， but no anti-HBs was detected.**\n\n【25】**QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kits (Qiagen， Hilden， Germany) were used to extract DNA from the serum samples. DNA was aliquoted and stored at -8°C until use. Commercially available HBV real-time PCR kits (Piji Biotec， Shenzhen， China) in a Light Cycler2.0 Real-Time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics， Basel， Switzerland) were utilized to quantify the viral load of HBV DNA. The preS/S gene regions were amplified using primers P1 and R1 (Table 1) on a thermal cycler (BIO-RAD MyCycler，BIO-RAD，CA) using PrimeStar HS high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Takara， Dalian， China). The PCR products from Sample 1 and Sample 2 were recovered from agarose gel and purified using Agarose Gel DNA Purification kits (Takara， Dalian， China) prior to being sequenced directly. The products of Sample 2 were further cloned into the pMD18-T Vector system(Takara， Dalian， China) and ten clones were selected for sequencing and analysis.**\n\n【26】**The PCR product is about 1，410 bp spanning nucleotide positions2825-1019.Electrophoresis after preS/S PCR amplification of Sample1 showed two distinguishable bands located at about 1，200 bp， and1，400 bp， respectively. Sequencing results of the products recovered from the two bands in Sample 1 revealed that one of the bands featured a large deletion mutation in preS1 (Figure 1)， compared to a full-length preS/S segment in the other band implying that there were two HBV variants present in the same sample. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence ofthis mutant with the amino acid (aa) sequence of the wild-type virus showed that the 183 bp deletion in the preS1region was located at aa 57-117 of the large HBsAg polypeptide.**\n\n【27】**In contrast to this finding， Sample 2 showed only one band located at about 1，400 bp by electrophoresis. The PCR product and clones were sequenced， and the results showed that only full-length large surface protein was present. No preS1 deletion mutant was found by sequencing.**\n\n【28】**Discussion and Conclusions**\n\n【29】**Although concurrent HBsAg and anti-HBs have been reported in patients with chronic HBV infection， the clinical and virological characteristics of these patients are not well described.Two immunopathogenetic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the circumstances leading to the coexistence of HBsAgand anti-HBs.**\n\n|  | **2848 pre-51**  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **ABD14381**  | **ATCCEAGGTTOCTCTTCCALAHOCTOGACAAGECATGDOGACAAATCTTTCTGTTCCCAAT**  |\n| **Sample 1-1**  | **ATLEPPGAGTTDGTCTTCCA-OCTCGACLEPCRTGCCGACAAATCTTI TCTTCCCAT**  |\n| **Sample 1-2**  | **ATGCSIPGTTOCTCTTNLANDCTCCACAAGECATGPOGACAAATETTTCTGTICCCAAT**  |\n| **Sample 2**  | **ATPHUEHTTGOTCTTOTAECLICGACLAPPIRTEETHACAAATOTTTCTOTTOCCAAT**  |\n|  | **290年**  |\n| **ABQ14331**  | **CCTCGEHTTCTTTCCEEATCACCACTTCETCCTOOGTTCCGACOCLACTCALACAAT**  |\n| **Sample 1-1**  | **CCTCIGOGATICTTIOCOGATCACCAGTIGCACCCTOCGITOCGACOCAACTCALICAAT**  |\n| **Sample 1-2**  | **CLTCICOCATICTTICCOLATCAOCACTTCCATCTOOCTTCCCACOCAACTCAAACAAT**  |\n| **Sasple 2**  | **CCTCTCPHATTCTTTCCCCATCACCACTTCCCCTOOCTTOCAPOCAACTCAAACHAT**  |\n|  | **2号88**  |\n| **ABNI书331**  | **CCACATTEOGACTICAACOCCANCAAGCATCAGTEGOCAGACCCLLATCAPGTACCACCS**  |\n| **Sumole 1-1**  | **CCICATTOCGACTTCAACOCCANCAAGCATCATTOCOCAGACCECLLATCACG**  |\n| **Sample 1-2**  | **CCACATTGGGACTTCAACCCCANCAAGCATCATTGGOCAGAPCCLATCAGGTACGACCG**  |\n| **Sample 2**  | **CCACLTTOPGACTTCAACCOCANCAACCATCATTOCOCAGACCCLLATCACGTAGCACCC**  |\n|  | **308**  |\n| **AB0143S1**  | **CGACCATTOEGGOCAFEGTTCAODOCACCACAOFECOGTCTTTTCCOCTGGACOCCTCAG**  |\n| **Sasple 1-1**  |  |\n| **Saole 1-2**  | **CCIFCATTOFOGCTAPCGTTCAOOCCACCICIOCCCOGTCTTTTEECSTOGAGOCCTCAG**  |\n| **Sample 2**  | **GEUPCATTCETOCTAGCGITCAOCOCACCACAORECOGTCII1TE23512GAGoCCICAG**  |\n|  | **30%3**  |\n| **AB014331**  | **GCTCAGGGCACATTGACAUCAGTGCCAGTAGCACCTOCTCCTGCCTOCNOCAATOGGCAG**  |\n| **Sasple 1-1**  |  |\n| **Sasple 1-2**  | **CCTCAGCECATATTGACAACASTECCAGTAACAOCTCCTCCTCCCTCOHOCAATCECCAG**  |\n| **Sample 2**  | **COICHEPPCATATIGADLUCAGLECCAGTLACAOLTOCTOCTCOOOPOCAATCEPCAG**  |\n|  | **3148 叮e32**  |\n| **AB14381**  | **TCAPEUGACADOCTACTCCCATCICICCACCTCTAAGAGACAGTCATOCTCAGECCATG**  |\n| **Saple 1-1**  | **\\-CCATG**  |\n| **Sasple 1一2**  | **TCMPAWACADOCTACTCCOPTCTCTCCACCTCTAAGAGACAGTCATOCTCADGOCATC**  |\n| **Sample 2**  | **TCAGCAAGACACOCTACTOCOGTCTCTCCACCTCTAAGAGACAGTCATOCTCACGCCATG**  |\n\n【31】**Figure 1： The nucleotide sequences of the pre-S1 regions obtained from Sample 1 and Sample 2.

PreS deletions and“a”determinant mutation can lead to antigenic changes in HBsAg which result in the concurrence of HBsAg and anti-HBs in the blood since preS/S mutations may alter HBsAg binding properties， thereby masking antibody recognition of HBsAg \\[5\\]. A second hypothesis is that HBV escape mutants are not selected by anti-HBs that is coexisting with HBsAg in CHB patients. Rather， the coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs in this situation may be explained as anti-HBs that has unmatched specificities for the HBsAg rendering it unable to bind to the antigen \\[6\\].**\n\n【33】**In this paper， detection of Sample 2 showed that the mutant disappeared along with the anti-HBs， which we propose means that the mutant strain was cleared by the detected antibodies. Thus， we speculate that the state of concurrent HBsAgand anti-HBs in Sample1 results from the production of anti-HBs targeted specifically to the preS1 deletion mutant strain in deference to the strain with full-length large HBsAg and did not lead to a selection of escape mutants. Correspondingly， this is quite different from the other immunopathogenetic mechanism mentioned above. The virological findings of this case remain interesting. It is possible that the preS1**\n\n【34】**Table 1： Primers used in this study.**\n\n| **Primer**  | **Sequence (5-3)**  | **Polarity**  | **Domain**  | **Positions**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **P1**  | **TTCTTGGGAACAAGAGCTAC**  | **Sense**  | **pre-S1/Pol**  | **2825-2844**  |\n| **R1**  | **GCAAAGCCCAAAAGACCCACAAT**  | **Antisense**  | **HBsAg/Pol**  | **997-1019**  |\n\n【36】**deletion strain induced by immune pressure generated anti-HBs of high affinity and specificity for the mutant. Moreover， host-related factors such as immunocompetence， may have contributed to the abnormal response pattern observed in this patient.**\n\n【37】**In a similar study that did not include HBV DNA sequencing \\[7\\]， concurrent HBsAg and anti-HBs were detected in 18 of 1462 CHB patients (1.2%) of which 15 (83.3%) were born in Asia/Australia. During a median follow-up of 4 years in 12 subjects，anti-HBs became undetectable in half after approximately 1.9 years. Independently， we have presented HBV DNA sequencing data from the preS region of the S gene in a genotype C CHB patient in which anti-HBs and apreS1deletion variant strain became undetectable after one year suggesting that the patient was able to generate an HBV mutant-specific immune response. It will be interesting to follow the patient to elucidate whether the ability to generate an HBV-specific immune response positively affects the clinical course， which may have implications for HBV outcome. It also may stimulate additional studies as to the relevance ofpreS1 deletions in this process since most of the previous investigations have focused on the small polypeptide of the S gene instead of the preS region with its many immune epitopes and functional domains \\[8\\].**\n\n【38】**Acknowledgment**\n\n【39】**The assistance of clinical laboratory department in the 960h hospital in collecting blood samples is hereby acknowledged**\n\n【40】**Funding**\n\n【41】**This work was mainly supported by Shandong Province Natural Sciences Fund (Contract No.ZR2020MH325).**\n\n【42】**References**\n\n【43】1\\.

Images of the Right Coronary Artery (RCA) and its Right Posterior Descending (RPD) and Right Posterior Ventricular (RPV) branches indicated intraluminal filling defects， suggesting a thrombus. The Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) suggested a subacute， homogeneous， echolucent thrombus in a large extension of the RCA， RPD， and RPV and an acute thrombus with a bright aspect， clear outline， and no signal attenuation in the RVP and mild to moderate atherosclerosis in the middle third of the RCA. We opted for dual antiplatelet therapy and complete anticoagulation therapy. After 7 days， a repeat coronary angiography revealed complete disappearance of the thrombi in the RCA and its branches. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) was performed for confirmation， showing the disappearance of the thrombi， except for a small residual thrombus in the RVP branch. It also identified mild to moderate atherosclerosis plaque in the middle third of the RCA. The invasive physiology of RCA was measured using the resting full-cycle ratio， indicating the absence of coronary physiology impairment. The patient recovered without further events and was discharged on the eleventh day of hospitalization.**\n\n【18】**Abbre viations**\n\n【19】**ACS： Acute Coronary Syndrome； AMI： Acute Myocardial Infarction； COVID-19： Coronavirus Disease 2019； IVUS： Intravascular Ultrasound； OCT： Optical Coherence Tomography； RCA： Right Coronary Artery；RPD： Right Posterior Descending； RPV： Right Posterior Ventricular**\n\n【20】**Introduction**\n\n【21】**Cardiovascular complications that occur during the course of COVID-19 are causes of morbidity and mortality， occurring in approximately 30% of hospitalized patients \\[1-3\\]. A possible explanation for the damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 to the myocardium includes hypoxia after respiratory failure， excessive inflammation， excess cytokines， angiotensin-converting enzyme 2receptor expression downregulation， platelet activation， coagulation cascade， endothelial cell injury， the rupture of previously existing plaques (type 1 Acute Myocardial Infarction \\[AMid)， and dliire myocyte infiltration by the virus \\[4-6\\].**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**A 62-year-old woman presented with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The patient's medical history included： Dyslipidemia and incipient atherosclerosis in the carotid and aortic territories， continuous use of nortriptyline for migraines， and 9 years of tiboline as menopausal hormone therapy. The patient initially presented with flu-like symptoms， and was diagnosed with COVID-19 following a positive reading on a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test. The patient had received three vaccine doses for SARS-CoV-2. The first two doses were chimpanzee adenovirus vector vaccines (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 AZD1222； Oxford/AstraZeneca/Fiocruz， Rio de Janeiro， Brazil)， and the third dose was BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (BioNTech/Pfizer， New York City， NY， USA). Ten days after testing positive/the symptoms began\\]， the patient presented with chest pain， dyspnea， nausea， and vomiting. In addition， electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm， inferior ST-segment elevations， and reciprocal changes in the anterolateral leads (Figure 1). The patient was referred for an emergency angiography. Coronary angiography revealed that the anterior descending coronary artery and its diagonal branches， and the circumflex artery and its marginal**\n\n【24】**Figure 1：Electrocardiogram on admission. The results showed sinus rhythm with ST-segment elevation in the inferior wall and reciprocal changes in the anterolateralleads.**\n\n【25】**Figure 2： Emergency coronary angiogram： Left coronary artery. Angiography revealed no significant stenases (A-D).**\n\n【26】**branches were free of obstructive atherosclerotic lesions (Figure 2). However， images of the Right Coronary Artery (RCA) and its Right Posterior Descending (RPD) and Right Posterior Ventricular (RPV) branches indicated intraluminal filling defects， suggesting a thrombus(Figure 3). Therefore， we evaluated the RCA by intracoronary ultrasound. The Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) pullbacks were performed using a 40 MHz IVUS OPTICROSS catheter (Boston Scientific， Natick， MA， USA) at 0.5 mm/s. The images suggested a subacute，homogeneous， echolucent thrombus in a large extension of the RCA，RPD，and RPV and an acute thrombus with a bright aspect， clear outline， and no signal attenuation in the RVP (Figure 4). We also identified mild to moderate atherosclerosis in the middle third of**\n\n【27】Figure 3： Emergency coronary angiogram： right coronary artery and left ventriculography. The images show intraluminal filling defects (red arrows) starting in the middle third of the Right Coranary Artery (RCA) and extending to the distal third， affecting the posterior descending and posterolateral RCA branches (a， b).

Therefore， we opted for dual antiplatelet therapy with 180 mg of ticagrelor and aspirin and complete anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin. The patient developed Killip grade I heart failure with elevated blood cardiac biomarkers (creatine kinase： 6105 IU/L； creatine kinase myocardial band fraction： 300 IU/L； and cardiac troponin I： 25 000pg/mL). In addition， transthoracic Doppler echocardiography revealed a kinesis in the inferior mid-basal and apical infero-basal portions of the left ventricle. After 7 days， we repeated the coronary angiography， finding that the thrombi in the RCA and its branches completely disappeared (Figure 5). Therefore， we performed Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) for confirmation. Intravascular OCT was performed using the ILUMIENTM OPISTM， OPTIS Integrated， and**\n\n【30】**Figure 5： Reexamination of the Right Caronary Artery (RCA) after 7 days.

The OCT exam confirmed that the thrombi disappeared， except for a small residual thrombus in the RVP branch (Figure 6). It also identified plaque in the middle third of the RCA. Severity of coronary stenosis was measured using the resting full-cycle ratio， which is a non-hyperemic index based on the unbiased detection of the lowest existing relationship between distal coronary pressure and aortic pressure (Pd/Pa)， independent of the electrocardiogram， landmark identifications， and time within the heart cycle. We evaluated this plaque as 40% in mild RCA， causing 40% arteriallumen obstruction. We used Pressure Wire X (Abbott Vascular， Santa Clara， CA，USA)， which reported a value of 0.99 (Figure 7)， indicating the absence of coronary physiology impairment. The patient recovered without further events and was discharged on the eleventh day of hospitalization with ticagrelor， aspirin， statins， beta-blockers， and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

This may be associated with the increased incidence of stent thrombosis， and severe inflammation with consequent hypercoagulation is another primary pathology associated with this phenomenon \\[7\\]. While differentiating between type I and type II AMI and myocarditis in patients with COVID-19 presenting with Acute Coronary Syndrome(ACS) is important， there is no consensus on the ideal management approach for ACS. Percutaneous coronary intervention， aspiration， and antiplatelet thrombectomy are possible options， with the latter being the most generally agreed upon for treating these patients \\[8\\].**\n\n【37】**Conclusion**\n\n【38】**This case is the first report of extensive RCA thrombosis in a patient with COVID-19 evaluated by intracoronary imaging and intracoronary invasive physiology.**\n\n【39】**Funding**\n\n【40】**This work was supported by the Department of Hemodynamic and Interventional Cardiology of Advanced Hemodynamic Therapy Center， Brazilian Society of Health Support Hospital.**\n\n【41】**References**\n\n【42】**1\\.

Patients with FH have elevated Low-Density Lipid Cholesterol (LDL-C) levels which lead to cardiovascular complications at an early age and a reduced life expectancy. Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR) gene mutation is the most common genetic cause of FH. In this study， a 56-year-old female with definite FH was reported based on clinical algorithms. Whole exome sequencing identified a heterozygous LDLR mutation (c.1599G>A)， which is pathogenic according to ACMG guidelines. Sanger sequencing was performed in family members， and the mutation site was co-segregated with the disease in the family.**\n\n【18】**Keywords： Familial hypercholesterolemia； Cascade screening； Whole exome sequencing**\n\n【19】**Introduction**\n\n【20】**Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) has been identified as an autosomal dominant disorder and is a major contributor to premature Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD). Mutations in four genes have been reported to be responsible for an estimated 70% to 95% of FH：LDLR，Apo B， PCSK9， and LDLRAP. Additionally，LDLR mutation has been the most common cause \\[1-4\\]. This case reported a 56-year-old female with unstable angina and elevated plasma LDL-C level， carried a heterozygous pathogenic LDLR mutation (c.1599G>A)， the patient was a definite FH according to DLCN criteria. The Sanger sequencing on the family members confirmed 3 members carried a heterozygous mutation in the previous site， and the clinical investigations were consistent with these quenching.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 56-year-old female with unstable angina was performed Percutaneous Coronary Intervention(PCI). The Right Coronary Artery (RCA) was diffuse from the proximal segment to the distal segment， the proportion of three parts of the right coronary artery were 75%， 99% and 60%， respectively.1 stent was placed in the RCA (Figure 1，2). Aspirin (100 mg/day)， clopidogrel (75 mg/day)， rosuvastatin (20 mg/day)， metoprolol (47.5 mg/day)， and isosorbide mononitrate (40 mg/day) were used after the intervention. After one year， the medications were adjusted to aspirin (100 mg/day)， rosuvastatin (20 mg/day)， ezetimibe (10 mg/day)， and bisoprolol fumarate (10 mg/day).**\n\n【23】**The patient had been found a high level of blood lipid at the age of 35 (Table 1)， but received treatment irregularly and the particular method was unknown. Without other conditions that could lead to secondary hypercholesterolemia or phytosterolemia. Whole exome sequencing was performed， and one candidate mutation was identified： LDLR (NM\\_000527.4)： c. 1599G>A (p. Trp533\\*) (Figure 3). This mutation was pathogenic according to ACMG guidelines. Based on the patient's medical history， early on-set ASCVD family history and information of sequencing， a definite FH could be evaluated according to DLCN criteria.**\n\n【24】**Clinical investigation indicated that family members II1 had a high lipid level and ASCVD at the age of 56， II2 and III2 were found to have elevated LDL-C at the age of 51 and 41， respectively， but have no ASCVD yet (Table 1). The Sanger sequencing for 3 family members (II1，II2， III2) certified the heterozygous mutation. While III3 and IV1 were wild type.**\n\n【25】**Expect for family member III2， the other family members were treated with statins regularly and adjusted to statins and Ezetimibe combined lipid-lowering therapy after the effect was poor.

More than 3000 LDLR mutations have been reported in ClinVar \\[4-6\\]. There are many clinical criteria for FH， but genetic testing is still the gold standard for diagnosis \\[7\\]. In this case， a heterozygous LDLR mutation (c. 1599G>A) was identified by whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing for family members.**\n\n【35】**In this case， family members with heterozygous LDLR mutation have LDL-C level fluctuated between 5 mmol/L to 7.9 mmol/L which can be simply judged as heterozygous FH from the LDL-C level ≥**\n\n【36】**190 mg/dL (5 mmol/L) in an adult \\[7\\]. However， family members DLCN score classified as probable FH (score 7 to 8) before genetic sequencing. Positive sequencing results clarified their diagnoses were definite FH， and improved the efficiency of this cascade screening to some extent.**\n\n【37】**Early and appropriate lipid-lowering therapy is essential for patients with FHand ASCVD \\[8-10\\]. The index patient was irregularly used statin at age 35， and the reduction was unknown. After PCI and genetic sequencing， reduction inpatient who used statins and ezetimibe in combination with lipid-lowering during a year was55.2% to 62.7%. Therefore， FH with heterozygous LDLR mutation (c.1599G>A) may be suitable for combination lipid-lowering therapy with statins and ezetimibe. In addition， the family members (II1，**\n\n【38】Figure 3： Sanger sequencing for the candidate mutation of the family members. Whole exame sequencing for the index patient identified a mutation： LDLR(NM\\_000527.4)： c. 1599G>A (p. Trp533\\*).

However， the reduction was 20.5% (II1)， 15.1%(II2) and 13.3% (III2)， the treatment adjusted to the combined lipid-lowering therapy of statins (20 mg/day) and ezetimibe (10 mg/day) after cascade screening. For family member III2， it is strongly suggested to strengthen lipid-lowering therapy， improve bad living habits， and further coronary CTA or coronary angiography can be carried out. After sequencing， family member III2 did reexamination that the LDL-C level is 4.12 mmol/L， the reduction is 47.8%. It was found that positive genetic confirmation of FH recognizes the importance， increases confidence in the role of lipid-lowering medicines， motivates initiation and adherence to lipid-lowering treatments.**\n\n【41】**In conclusion， comparing with traditional screening， cascade screening is more cost-effective. Genetic testing and cascade screening improve cognition and treatment adherence in FH patients. Besides， genetic testing to somewhat enhances the efficiency of cascade screening.**\n\n【42】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【43】**We thank the patient and her family members for their interest and cooperation.**\n\n【44】**Funding**\n\n【45】The study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81400846).\n\n【46】**Ethical Statement**\n\n【47】**The authors are accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.

Assessment of this phenomenon is largely echocardiographic， since both TTE and TEE provide information on size， shape， and hemodynamic consequences of the tumor. In this publication， we bring forward the similarities between morphological assessment through transillumination echocardiography and pathologic anatomy， highlighting a possible study field for the future.**\n\n【22】**Keywords： Myxoma； Tumor； Echocardiography； Electrocardiography； Transillumination； Pathologic Anatomy**\n\n【23】**Introduction**\n\n【24】**The lack of ongoing cellular proliferation in the adult human heart makes myocardial tissue notably resistant to tumor formation， which is why cardiac tumors are very rare \\[1\\]， with an overall incidence of about 0.5/million \\[2\\]. A myxoma is a benign growth in the heart that may develop in the right or left atria， or， more rarely， in the ventricles \\[1，3，4\\]. This rare condition's etiology remains unclear， yet its origin has been associated with a proliferation of primitive stroma/connective tissue cells \\[1\\] and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells \\[3\\].**\n\n【25】**Usually， clinical manifestations are non-specific and are defined by the location， size， and mobility of the tumor. Myxomas may present in several ways， the most frequent manifestations being hemodynamic consequences like dyspnea， arrhythmia， palpitations， syncope， congestive heart failure and sudden death； systemic embolism such as Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)， Cerebrovascular Accidents (CVA)； and constitutional or systemic manifestations such as fever， weight loss， arthralgia， and fatigue \\[2\\]. Here， we present a typical and very illustrative case and literature review of a patient with a Left Atrium (LA) myxoma， in order to orient clinicians in the assessment of this rare condition.**\n\n【26】**Case Presentation**\n\n【27】**A 67-year-old female with a history of diabetes and hypertension was admitted to the coronary care unit due to dyspnea associated with dizziness， intermittent holocranial headache (Verbal Pain Intensity Scale 3/10)， cough， and stabbing chest pain that had begun three years prior. Dyspnea had evolved from grade I to IV on the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Scale in a one-month period， after which she consulted her physician， who referred her to the cardiologist after ordering an anteroposterior chest-X ray that showed left cardiomegaly. An apex beat was found on the 5hh left intercostal space with a split-second sound secondary to a tumor plop. Follow-up Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) was performed， showing a mobile， regular edged 59 mm x49 mm LA mass with a thin peduncle attachment to the atrial septum， that protruded towards the left ventricle during diastole. An electrocardiogram was performed， showing sinus rhythm with a slight left axis deviation (Figure 1). Subsequent Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) was**\n\n【28】**Figure 1： Electrocardiogram showing sinus rhythm with no significant anomalies.**\n\n【29】**Figure 2： A) TEE showing severe dilation of the LA (LAVI 58.7 mL/m²) with a 59 x 49 mm mass (\\*) adhered to the interarticular septum. B) TEE at139° showing the prolapse of the mass (\\*) towards the left ventricle during diastole. C) TEE at 0° showing protrusion of the mass (\\*) towards the LV during diastole.

Surgical removal of the mass was performed successfully， and the patient recovered fully after a few days. Histopathologic analysis showed characteristic mucoid degeneration with stellate cells (Figure 3)， thus confirming the diagnosis of a left atrial myxoma that correlated in shape and size to the mass observed through transillumination echocardiography(Figure 4). Follow-up TTE showed the absence of the mass with an adequately functioning mitral valve and left ventricle.**\n\n【32】**Discussion**\n\n【33】**Myxomas are benign growths in the heart. When in the LA， they are usually attached to the fossa ovalis region (83%). They may also be found in the right atrium (12.7%)， both atriums (1.3%) or more rarely in the left or right ventricles (1.7% and 0.6%，respectively) \\[1，3，4\\].**\n\n【34】**Figure 3： A) Macroscopic architecture of the resected left atrial myxoma.

Atrial myxomas occur predominantly in females between the ages of 40 and 60， with a women-to-men ratio of 2.05：1\\[6\\].**\n\n【37】**Typical cardiac myxomas are the most common. They usually grow in the LA and attach to the interatrial septum， typically forming sessile or pedunculated masses with smooth or papillary surfaces\\[7\\]. Myxomas may also be inherited in the Carney complex due to mutations of the PRKAR1A gene \\[5，8\\].**\n\n【38】**Myxomas present with a classic triad： Obstructive symptoms， embolic signs and symptoms and constitutional or systemic manifestations \\[4，9\\]. A study from the National Heart Center of Singapore (NHCS) observed no significant differences in gender， body size， tumor size， hemoglobin counts， blood cell or platelet counts between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. They also found that the most common symptoms are dyspnea， ischemic stroke and palpitations \\[9\\].**\n\n【39】**Diagnosis is difficult1in atypicalpresentations due to echocardiographic limitations such as lack of tissue characterization and a restricted field of view \\[3\\]， therefore， definitive diagnosis of a myxoma should be made following surgical removal of the tumor and subsequent histopathological assessment， where characteristic stellate or globular cells may be observed \\[9\\].**\n\n【40】**Cardiac myxomas are most commonly diagnosed through TTE orTransesophageal Echocardiography (TEE). Additional diagnostic tools are useful， like electrocardiography， chest Computed Tomography (CT) and chest or heart Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI). There are no specific blood tests for this condition \\[5\\].**\n\n【41】**TTE is useful for determining a myxoma’s location， size， shape， attachment， mobility and hemodynamic impact. Characteristically， cardiac myxomas are found as a mobile pedunculated mass attached to the endocardial surface， usually in the interatrial septum， ranging in size from 3 cm to 4 cm in diameter. They are attached by a broad or narrow based stalk， frequently without involvement of adjacent structures. A homogenous or heterogenous aspect may be found depending on the presence of hemorrhage， calcification and surface thrombi. Distinctively， these heart tumors are mobile， which makes them prone to prolapsing into the left ventricle through the atrioventricular valves during diastole. TEE is also useful in these instances， improving spatial resolution and allowing for a better visualization of implantation and extension to adjacent veins\\[3，5，10\\]. Our patient’s case provides an excellent example of typical echocardiographic findings in patients with this clinical entity.**\n\n【42】**Typical LA myxomas may cause obstructive complications， such as mitral valve obstruction or regurgitation， left-sided heart failure and secondary pulmonary hypertension. The most common symptom referred by patients is exertion dyspnea， followed closely by orthopnea.Furthermore，myxomaspresent with ahigh riskofsystemic**\n\n【43】**embolization， resulting in TIA， CVA， hemiplegia， loss ofvision， chest pain and dyspnea. A wide number of patients (approximately 3.2% to46.4%) with cardiac myxomas are asymptomatic， which toughens the clinical diagnosis， thus highlighting the need for imaging techniques like TTE， TEE， CT or MRI. These studies are also important for the characterization of the mass and subsequent surgical removal， which is the only definitive treatment for this condition \\[5\\].**\n\n【44】**LA myxomas are the most common cardiac tumors， and as such， they should be the first clinical suspicion when a heart mass is observed through an imaging study. Moreover， the first step towards diagnosis should always be TTE. Our study suggests the usefulness of transillumination echocardiography for the assessment of tumor morphology， for it resembles macroscopic pathologic findings post-surgically and may be useful for surgical planning. However， more evidence is needed on the significance of this matter.**\n\n【45】**References**\n\n【46】**1\\. Sussman M. Atrial myxoma： The cardiac chameleon.

An MRI database was created that contained the data from 15 Hi-AVHs subjects with chronic or severe AVHs symptoms. The recruited patients were administered the atypical antipsychotic (Risperidone) for 24 weeks and monitored for treatment response. The patients underwent an fMRI pre and post-treatment. There were gFCD alterations in the regions of auditory-memory-language and visual circuits' pre and post-treatment in the Hi-AVHs subjects. The gFCD alterations were different between those patients who responded better to treatment and those who did not respond better to treatment. Atypical antipsychotics can improve AVHs in Hi-AVHs subjects to a certain extent， and the treatment effects were found to be associated with gFCD alterations in the auditory-memory-language circuit. This is the first report describing the effect of treatment-induced auditory-memory-language circuit gFCD alterations in Hi-AVHs subjects who were treated with atypical antipsychotics. Although with manylimitations， these findings may provide a clue for further study which focuses on exploring the treatment target or strategies for Hi-AVHs subjects.**\n\n【22】**References**\n\n【23】1\\.

Pericardial effusion in the setting of rheumatic heart disease is rarely associated with cardiac tamponade. We hereby present a case of rheumatic heart disease with severe mitral stenosis and severe aortic regurgitation who had cardiac tamponade and required emergency pericardiocentesis. But thereafter， he developed acute pulmonary oedema and refractory hypotension due to pericardial decompression. Pericardial decompression can be prevented by the removal of fluid in aliquots.**\n\n【10】**Abbreviations**\n\n【11】**ADHF： Acute Decompensation of Heart Failure； AR： Aortic Regurgitation； LV： Left Ventricle； MS： Mitral Stenosis； NYHA： New York Heart Association Functional Class； PDS： Pericardial Decompression Syndrome； RA： Right Atrium； RV： Right Ventricle**\n\n【12】**Case Presentation**\n\n【13】**Introduction： Rheumatic heart disease is still prevalent in developing countries \\[1\\]. Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade are rare in rheumatic heart disease and infective endocarditis \\[2-4\\]. Pericardiocentesis is required in cardiac tamponade and pericardial decompression syndrome is one of its complications. Pericardiocentesis in presence of pulmonary artery hypertension and valvular heart diseases needs to be done with utmost care and hemodynamic monitoring. Sudden withdrawal of a large amount of pericardial fluid can result in hemodynamic instability.**\n\n【14】**History of present illness： A 20-year-old workman initially presented to a peripheral health center with a fever for the last 3 weeks， worsening dyspnea (NYHA Class I> III)， fatigue and retrosternal chest heaviness. He had a poor response to initial medical care received at the peripheral center and was referred to a higher center for further management. But he had progressive symptoms and presented to us in poor general condition with NYHA Class IV dyspnea with orthopnea.On admission， his pulse rate was 130/min， low volume， regular， blood pressure was 90/40 mmHg and respiratory rate of 38/min. His O， saturation was 99% on room air. His JVP was distended up to the angle of the jaw while sitting， with prominent x descent. The heart sounds were muffled with a gallop rhythm.**\n\n【15】**Past medical history： At around 9 to 10 years， he had migratory arthritis involving the right knee，left knee and right elbow. He was diagnosed with rheumatic fever and was advised oftreatment and secondary rheumatic prophylaxis. Medical advice was not followed because of illiteracy and affordability. The patient remained in good functional capacity till the present episode of illness.**\n\n【16】**Investigations： Recent chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly with straightening of the left heart border with wide carina and double atrial shadow suggestive of LA enlargement with prominent vascular markings in the upper lobes of both lungs (Figure 1a). His WBC count was 30.8×10%L with neutrophilia. ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with low voltage complexes.**\n\n【17】**Echocardiography： RHD was evident by the presence of thickened AML and restricted movement of PML with severe mitral stenosis (mitral valve area- 0.7 cm’， mean gradients of 18mmHg @ heart rate of 130 per minute. His aortic valve was thickened and there was vegetation on the non-coronary cusp leading to severe aortic regurgitation. There was moderate pulmonary hypertension with an estimated RV systolic pressure of 50 mmHg. Large circumferential pericardial effusion with maximum dimensions measuring 38 mm anterior to RV in RV diastole was noted with intra-pericardial strands. There was diastolic inversion of the right atrium. IVC was disten ded with <50% respiratory variability (Figure 2).**\n\n【18】Figure 1： a) Chest X-ray (of the previous admission) showing straightening of the left heart border； b) Chest X-ray shows a pigtail catheter in the pericardial cavity and there is evidence of pulmonary oedema.\n\n【19】Figure 2： Echocardiographic findings. a) Large pericardial effusion， thickening of both mitral valve leaflets and aortic valve in PLAX view (Left upper)； b) A4C view showing large pericardial effusion and inversian of RA (mid-upper)， c) The PSAX view shawing the fish mauth-like opening of the mitral valve with commissural fusion and valve area by planimetry was 0.7 cm² (right upper)； d) Severe aortic regurgitation evident on PLAX view (left lower)； e) The mean pressure gradient across the aortic valve is 24 mmHg (mid-lower)； f) The mean pressure gradient across the mitral valve is 18 mmHg (right lower).\n\n【20】**Management： The patient was admitted to the cardiac critical care unit. Emergency pericardiocentesis was planned for diagnostic as well as therapeutic intent. About 1200 ml of serosanguinous pericardial fluid was drained slowly under hemodynamic monitoring. There was a dramatic initial improvement in his symptoms. But the condition of the patient deteriorated suddenly after the procedure as soon as he was shifted back to CCU. He suddenly developed respiratory distress. An immediate echocardiographic evaluation didn't reveal re-accumulation of pericardial effusion. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation after acute refractory respiratory distress. His chest X-ray was suggestive of pulmonary oedema (Figure 1b) and there was no residual pericardial fluid on repeat echocardiographic assessments. He had a rapid downhill course and also developed refractory hypotension； he collapsed despite intensive resuscitative measures.**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**Rheumatic heart disease is endemic in India， with the highest estimated number of cases and deaths \\[1\\].**\n\n【23】**Rheumatic heart disease remains a leading cause of infective endocarditis in the adult population. Pericarditis is seen in ~10% of acute rheumatic carditis but cardiac tamponade is very rare. There are**\n\n【24】**only isolated case reports of cardiac tamponade in acute rheumatic carditis \\[2，3\\]. Pericardial effusion in infective endocarditis is known to occur and cardiac tamponade is very rare in such settings and also results in poor prognosis \\[4，5\\].**\n\n【25】**The definite cause of pericardial effusion could not be established in this case and the possibilities include acute rheumatic pan carditis， tuberculosis， and bacterial infective endocarditis with rupture of aortic root leading to acute severe aortic regurgitation.**\n\n【26】**A possible explanation for acute hemodynamic collapse， after pericardiocentesis， is existing severe mitral stenosis and severe acute aortic regurgitation may have led to acute pulmonary oedema following an increase in RV preload after pericardiocentesis.**\n\n【27】**Pericardial decompression syndrome was considered as thepatient had hypotension and pulmonary edema after pericardiocentesis.**\n\n【28】**The hemodynamic features of such a combination- severe MS with severe AR with cardiac tamponade have not been described. Our patient also had pulmonary hypertension and the safety of pericardiocentesis in presence of PAH is not established \\[6，71.**\n\n【29】**Pericardiocentesis is a lifesaving procedure in cardiac tamponade. Complications are known to occur. Pericardial Decompression**\n\n【30】**Syndrome (PDS) is rare and has poor outcomes.**\n\n【31】**The exact mechanism of PDS is still not clear. Various possible mechanisms have been proposed for PDS， such as preload-afterload mismatch， sudden1 sympathetic withdrawal following pericardiocentesis andcardiac tamponade related1Imyocardial stunning.**\n\n【32】**In this case， sympathetic overdrive resulted in relatively high systemic vascular resistance. Removal of pericardial fluid resulted in a sudden increase in venous return. The presence of severe mitral stenosis and severe aortic regurgitation and increased SVR resulted in preload-afterload mismatch and thus worsened heart failure.**\n\n【33】**Removal of pericardial fluid under invasive monitoring with the right heart and pericardial pressure monitoring could have added to the management of our patient. Removal of pericardial fluid in aliquots has also been proposed to prevent PDS \\[8，9\\].**\n\n【34】**Conclusion**\n\n【35】**Pericardial decompression syndrome is a rare complication of pericardiocentesis in cases of cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis should be done with intensive hemodynamic monitoring， especially in coexisting valvular heart disease.**\n\n【36】**References**\n\n【37】1\\. Watkins DA， Johnson CO， Colquhoun SM.

Histopathologically， it consisted of spindle cells， arranged arbitrarily within hypocellular and hypercellular areas(Figure 3). Vascularization was abundant with hemangiopericytoma features. Cells showed poor mitotic activity. Resection margins were free of disease. The post-operative course was uneventful and the patient is asymptomatic after one year of follow-up.**\n\n【27】**Discussion**\n\n【28】**SFTs were first described in the thoracic pleura in 1931 \\[4\\]； however many other sites have been reported in the literature. SFTs are rare， with an incidence of 0.2/100000/year \\[9\\]. Pelvic SFTs are even rarer， with only about 34 cases available on PubMed database(using the search terms \"solitary fibrous tumour\"， \"pelvis\")\\[2，3，7-25\\]. The 1 reported case of pelvic SFT occurred in the bladder and was published in 1997 \\[7\\]. Other pelvic structures included： Seminal vesicles \\[1\\]， mesorectum \\[19\\]， perianal space \\[2，3，8\\] and other non-well specified pelvic areas \\[13-18\\]. Radiologic findings are non specific for GIST \\[18\\]， and they are often misdiagnosed with GIST.**\n\n【29】**Accurate preoperative diagnosis was evoked in 3 reported cases， where biopsy was performed in 2 cases \\[7，8\\]， and \\[7\\] F-FDG PET/CT with ultrasound guided biopsy were performed in one case \\[9\\]. Some authors have described obstructive symptoms， such as pollakiuria\\[22\\]， urinary retention \\[8\\] and constipation \\[19\\]. It's Noteworthy to mention that in 3 reported cases， hypoglycaemia was the alarming symptoms and was secondary to IGF-2 secreting cells. SFTs generally show benign behaviour. A recent large retrospective study， where 110SFT cases were reviewed， 10 year metastasis free rate was 55%\\[26\\]. Predictive signs of malignity include： necrosis， high mitotic activity， cellular atypia and large tumors. Even though， the absence of these features would not preclude metastasis or recurrence \\[24\\]. Surgery with curative intent is the best treatment option \\[26\\]. While Liver SFTs are treated with 1 cm negative margin resection \\[27\\]， surgery with curative intent would be also the best treatment option for pelvic SFTs \\[2，3，7-25，27\\].**\n\n【30】**In some cases， neoadjuvant chemoradioterapy preceded surgical resection. To the best of our Knowledge， none of the previously reported anorectal cases were treated laparoscopically. In one case， excision was carried out during laparotomy， and in another one trans-sacral resection was adopted. Yan et al. \\[11\\] described recently FDG PET/CT utility in determining the metabolic activity of such tumors， and subsequently what treatment regimen should be used\\[9\\]. Dxorubicin may also be proposed as adjuvant therapy \\[9，25\\]**\n\n【31】Figure 3： Spindle cells arranged haphazardly.\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**Only 3 cases of anorectal SFTs were previously reported， one in the pararectal area \\[19\\]， one in the ischioanal fossa \\[3\\] and one with perianal location \\[2\\].**\n\n【34】**Biopsy is not always diagnostic in SFTs， because spindle cells are arranged haphazardly within the tumor bulk \\[13\\]. Since recurrence and metastasis are of possibility with SFTs， even in the absence of aggressive signs， thus surgical excision should be mandatory in order to establish the diagnosis， and to assess the degree of cellular atypia and mitotic index.**\n\n【35】**References**\n\n【36】**l.

Placental and autopsy investigations confirmed in-utero transmission of disseminated congenital HSV-2 infection without any maternal history of HSV.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Congenital HSV； Extreme prematurity； Hydops-fetalis**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**An extremely premature male infant was born at 25 weeks gestation by an emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress. The mother was a 23-year-old primigravida. Her prenatal laboratory tests were negative for any sexually transmitted infection including syphilis， gonorrhea， chlamydia， human immunodeficiency virus， and group B Streptococcus. She was immune to rubella. She had no current or past history of genital or oral Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection.**\n\n【17】**At 17 weeks of pregnancy，the mother was admitted with vaginalleakage of dark amniotic fluid followed by fever (38.9 Co). She was treated with antibiotics including ampicillin，clindamycin， and azithromycin for chorioamnionitis and threatened loss of pregnancy. Expectant management was successful as pregnancy progressed without further leakage of amniotic fluid to 25-week gestation. Mother reported decreased fetal movements during her clinic visit at 25-week of gestation. She was admitted to the hospital for fetal monitoring. She was not in preterm labor and membranes of amniotic sac were intact. Fetal biophysical profile of 3 out of total 10 (1 for heart rate， 2 for amniotic fluid)， indicative of poor fetal well-being prompting delivery by an emergency cesarean section. Membranes were ruptured in operation room at delivery. Apgar scores were l and 3 at 1 and 5min， respectively. Infant required resuscitation at birth with endotracheal intubation， mechanical ventilation，external cardiac compressions and administration of epinephrine.**\n\n【18】**At birth， the infant appeared hydropic with generalized body-wall edema， protuberant， firm abdomen due to severe hepatosplenomegaly with liver margin reaching 2 cm above the pelvic brim and ascites. The infant was large for gestational age with a birth weight of 1，090 gm primarily because of diffuse edema. Soon after birth， diffuse bullae developed over extensive areas of the skin covering the face， arms， chest， and abdomen that progressed to diffuse sloughing of the skin (Figure1). These quickly became hemorrhagic. By four hours of life， the infant developed profuse bleeding from the endotracheal tube， orogastric tube and insertion sites of umbilical catheters. Laboratory tests showed disseminated coagulopathy that was treated promptly with infusions of fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate followed by platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia. Continuous infusion of dopamine and dobutamine were administered to treat hypotension. Broad spectrum antibiotics including ampicillin and gentamicin were administered for suspected sepsis. In view of infant's critical condition， empiric antiviral medication， acyclovir (15 mg/kg/dose divided every12 h) was added despite negative maternal history for HSV. Ancillary laboratory studies revealed thrombocytopenia (platelet count =30，000/mm’)， leukocytosis (white blood cell count =81，600/mm)，and high concentrations of serum transaminases (Aspartate Transaminase，AST>10，000U/L， Alanine Transaminase，ALT=972U/L). Bacterial cultures of blood and fluid specimen from dermal bullae were negative. However， HSV-2 was detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction test (PCR) in specimens obtained from blood， mouth，hemorrhagic skin bullae， rectum and placenta. Despite all supportive treatment， infant did not survive beyond the first day of life.**\n\n【19】**Figure1： Atypical diffuse hemorrhagic vesicobullous lesions in a critical hydropic prematureintantbborn at 25-week gestation with hepatosplenomegaly.**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**HSV infection in neonates has devastating consequences with high mortality and morbidity despite treatment with acyclovir \\[1\\]. Advances in medicine have reduced neonatal mortality rates in disseminated HSV infection from 85% to 29% and in isolated central nervous system disease， from 50% to 4% \\[1\\]. Primary infection during pregnancy is more severe than in the non-pregnant state with a greater risk of infecting fetus (50%) with primary infection than with recurrent infection (<3%).**\n\n【22】**Vertical transmission from mother to the neonate can occur in-utero (5%)， during perinatal (85%) or during postnatal period(10%)\\[1\\]. Ascending infection along the birth canal in the presence of rupture of membranes from active genital lesions is an important mode of transmission \\[1\\]. Mother in our case did not experience any genital lesions during the pregnancy or around the time of birth. The epidemiological data do support that 70% of congenital HSV infection cases present with no preceding maternal history of HSV. Furthermore，congenital HSV in extremepremature infants， as in our case， can present in non-classical manner with atypical presentation1-3.**\n\n【23】**It was unusual in our case that although there was vaginal leakage of two-day duration at 17 wk. of gestation， subsequent fetal ultrasounds indicated that ruptured membranes had sealed with re-accumulation of amniotic fluid. Amniotic membranes remained intact from 17 wk. onwards until theywere ruptured artificially during cesarean section. Amniotic fluid was light yellowish to dark brown in color reflecting in-utero infection. As is usual practice， in most of these cases， includingours，appropriate antibiotics were administered to mother following prolonged vaginal leakage of amniotic fluid at17 wk. of gestation but she was not screened for HSV at that time. Clearly antibiotics can only be beneficial if the intrauterine infection is of bacterial origin. As reported recently， microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity can occur due to microorganisms other than bacteria where viral infection can play a role in pregnancy loss or early neonatal death \\[4\\]. We believe that in our case， HSV was inoculated into feto-placental unit at 17-wk. of age when the mother experienced amniotic fluid leakage. Although pregnancy progressed subsequently in asymptomatic manner， congenital viral infection reactivated**\n\n【24】**when the mother began experiencing decreased fetal movements. As described in literature \\[5\\]， this assertion is further supported by the placental pathology in our case which showed areas of focal opacification with degradation ofamniotic membranes and chorionic villi and necrotizing inflammation with stromal cell necrosis of umbilical cord and fetal surface. The HSV DNA PCR was also positive for HSV-2 from placenta that was trans-abdominally delivered in sterile manner trans-abdominally during Cesarean section \\[5\\].**\n\n【25】**While congenital HSV infection presents most commonly as either Skin， Eyes and Mucosal disease (SEM) or CNS infection \\[1-3\\]， our case presented with the least common variant， as the disseminated disease with hepatosplenomegaly and hydrops. As in our case， HSV infections can have atypical presentation in premature infants attributable to an immature immunologic response to the virus\\[3\\]. Typically， cutaneous HSV is described as vesicular or pustular eruptions with erythematous base \\[2\\]. Our case rapidly developed diffuse，large hemorrhagic bullous lesions coalescing together within a matter of few hours of birth， progressing rapidly with sloughing of skin (Figure). This was highly unusual and unique presentation. The lesions appeared somewhat similar to infants presenting with scalded skin syndrome， aplasia cutis congenital or congenital bullous dermal disorders \\[2\\]. A somewhat similar case of vesiculobullous lesions in a 27-week-gestation preterm neonate with HSV has been reported before but unlike our case， active recurrent genital lesions of HSV were present in the mother prior to delivery in that case \\[2，3\\]. The findings of leukocytosis and hydrops with severe hepatosplenomegaly in our case were also consistent with previous rare reports of neonatal HSV disease and with in-utero transmission \\[1，3\\].**\n\n【26】**The presence of fever with premature prolonged rupture of membrane as in our case without any evidence of a bacterial infection highlights the need to investigate an alternative infectious etiology. It is prudent to have a high index of suspicion for HSV in such cases and to screen mothers for HSV-2 in addition to screening for bacterial infection. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics has provided guidelines for the management of neonatal HSV among those with maternal history of HSV and for those with primary and recurrent exposure， screening for HSV during pregnancy is not yet routine practice in the United States specifically in the absence of positive maternal history of HSV infection or in the absence of perinatal exposure. As most cases of neonatal HSV infection occur following cervical viral shedding without any clinically detectable genital lesion， universal maternal screening for HSV serology is warranted \\[1\\]. The epidemiologic data suggesting a rise in the prevalence of neonatal HSV infection because more HSV-1 sero-negative individuals are entering sexually active age group combined with the changing sexual practices， the need for universal maternal screening is even more important. In addition， continued adherence to measures preventing vertical transmission from mother to neonate in the presence of known maternal history， including maternal treatment and prophylaxis with acyclovir， may check potential future increase in neonatal herpes infections. Trans-placental passage of acyclovir has been shown to offer protection to the fetus against maternal viremia； however， justification of its use in preventing neonatal HSV in the absence of documented maternal HSV infection remains unclear \\[1-3\\]. Additionally， various prototypes for both therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines are being developed but none has yet been proven effective for mass use. Continued investigations to analyze cost-based efficacy of vaccines against genital herpes maybe justifiable \\[1\\].**\n\n【27】**Conclusion**\n\n【28】**In-utero transmission of HSV-2 with absence of maternal history of HSV and with absence of premature perinatal rupture of membrane as in our case is rare. Our case highlights the importance of considering HSV infection in pregnant women presenting with intra-partum fever without a clear bacterial etiology， and screening all mothers for HSV even in the absence of history or in the absence of active genitallesions. Congenital HSV infection continues to exert high mortality and morbidity in neonates. The outcome is even more severe among extremely premature infants often resulting in loss of pregnancy during first or second trimester. Our case also highlights the rare form of cutaneous， systemic presentation with hydrops in extreme premature infants. Empiric and early treatment with acyclovir should be considered particularly in a sick premature infant with unique vesicobullous lesions even in the absence of maternal history and in the absence of history of exposure to HSV because of very high mortality. There is a need for continuing research on identifying newer strategies for screening and treatment of HSV during pregnancy so that in-utero HSV transmission to the fetus can be prevented even in asymptomatic women with subclinical infection.**\n\n【29】**References**\n\n【30】**1\\.

Most cases of crossed renal ectopia are asymptomatic and the diagnosis is made when pathology (such as infections， urolithiasis， tumors or other less common) affects the ectopic kidney. Diagnosis can be performed by ultrasound， intravenous urography or anterograde pyelography， isotopic studies， computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.

A case series of such resorbed ridge cases treated by adding weight using cast metal with its precise placement without altering the esthetics is described in this article.**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Resorbed mandibular ridge cases always present a clinical problem for their stability and retention due to lack of bone height needed for stabilization from horizontal forces. With the continued resorption ofbone，the ridge is under the influence of functional musculature movements which can easily dislodge the denture \\[1\\].**\n\n【14】**Instability and discomfort in conventional denture is attributed to the degree of resorption of mandibular alveolar ridge. This condition can be managed by various surgical treatment options like implantation， augmentation or vestibuloplasty. Certain situations may not allow the clinician for surgical interventions， because of either patient's medical conditions， affordability or patient's personal preference. To deal with such scenario with patient's constrains and deficient foundation area， a stable， strong and functional mandibular denture can be fabricated by alterations in its fabrication， that may include modification in either impression making， jaw relation， teeth selection and setting or alteration in designing of the denture.**\n\n【15】**One alteration in designing of the denture is to increase its weight to aid in its stabilization and retention， by the effect of gravity. The idea of increased weight of mandibular denture to provide stability is not new. It was introduced by Grunewald \\[2\\]， where he used gold as a metal denture base to increase the weight and suggested that mandibular denture base weighing 32 gms is effective for achieving satisfactory retention.**\n\n【16】**Belfiglio et al. \\[3\\] and Wormley et al. \\[4\\]， have described various techniques to increase weight of the denture by fabricating a metal base dentures. But metal based dentures have problems of adjustment，relining and irritation to the tissues. Massad et al. \\[5\\] described a technique to fabricate a metal base denture for highly resorbed mandibular ridge with a resilient liner. Hurtado et al. \\[6\\] also mentioned a technique to fabricate internally weighted denture.**\n\n【17】**Kim et al. \\[7\\] have described a method for fabricating a mandibular denture with increased weight by precisely locating the position of the cast metal in the denture by making a permanent heat cure denture base and securing the teeth arrangement in a plaster index. This design didn’t affect the esthetics of the denture and also provided an acrylic base which could be relined in future if required.**\n\n【18】**This article here presents the case report of three cases by use ofinternally weighted mandibular denture as described by Kim et al， to achieve successful results.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**Case 1**\n\n【21】**A completely edentulous， 55 year old male reported to the Department of Prosthodontics of Himachal Dental College Sunder Nagar， Himachal Pradesh， India， presented with mandibular edentulism and asked for a new set of artificial teeth. A thorough medical and dental examination**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： A) Resorbed mandibular ridge. B) Prosthesis in place.**\n\n【23】**was done. Mandibular ridge was found to be of order 6 classified according to Atwood and maxillary anterior ridge was found to be flabby. Mandibular ridge was so severely resorbed that buccal and lingual vestibule and crest of the ridge， all were found a same level. Patient was also diabetic. Treatment planned was fabrication maxillary denture with relief for flabby ridge and internally weighted mandibular denture with closed mouth impression technique (Figure1A and 1B).**\n\n【24】**Case 2**\n\n【25】**A 65-year-old completely edentulous female reported to the Department of Prosthodontics of Himachal Dental College， Sunder Nagar， Himachal Pradesh， India who was using her 10 year old dentures but was not able to chew food efficiently and wanted to get a new set of denture. Mandibular ridge was found to be of order 6classified according to Atwood classification. Mandibular denture was planned to be designed with increase weight using cast metal with conventional maxillary denture (Figure 2A and 2B).**\n\n【26】**Case 3**\n\n【27】**A 70-year-old completely edentulous female reported to the Department of Prosthodontics of Himachal Dental College， Sunder Nagar， Himachal Pradesh， India with her old dentures to be repaired. However， the condition of the denture base was poor with attrited teeth. So a new denture was advised. Intro oral examination revealed severely resorbed mandibular ridge oforder 6. Mandibular impression was made by closed mouth technique and an internally weighted cast metal denture was fabricated with conventional maxillary denture(Figure 3A and 3B).**\n\n【28】**Discussion**\n\n【29】**An internally weighted mandibular denture in one of the non-invasive treatment option indicated for severely resorbed mandibular ridge cases， which provide stability retention and function to the mandibular denture without altering the esthetics of the dentures. It is possible only by the accurate and precise placement of the internal cast metal structure with a calculated weight. Various methods described in literature by authors gave an idea about the amount weight to be added to the denture for gravity to be effective and the techniques for inclusion of metal into the denture. But the technique of incorporating the cast metal is the most effective and accurate**\n\n【30】**Figure 4： A) Plaster index with secured teeth setting. B) Checking clearance with plaster index on master cast. C) Cast metal. D) Checking clearance for acrylic resin with processed denture base， cast metal and plaster index.**\n\n【31】**among all， and it also gives an option to for relining or rebasing if needed in future.**\n\n【32】**Checking for the sufficient clearance for cast metal is easy in this design by preparation of a plaster index that secures the teeth arrangement (Figure 4A，B，C and 4D). This design allows visualizing the placement of cast metal accurately in the denture by fabrication of permanent heat cure denture base with slot for its placement， which will prevent the dislodgment of or exposure of cast metal which is always a problem when using amalgam pellets for increased weight(Figure 5A and 5B).**\n\n【33】**The only disadvantage is the increase in laboratory steps and the cost， but this is negligible compared to its advantages and worth.**\n\n【34】**However， such increased weight dentures are not indicated for the patients with weak labial musculature or those who stoop. In bent position， the weight of denture will make it to fall out of the mouth.**\n\n【35】**Conclusion**\n\n【36】**Increased weight of mandibular denture is an easy and convenient**\n\n【37】**method of dealing with highly resorbed ridge case and should be considered before taking up the invasive surgical procedures that have unpredictable results.**\n\n【38】**References**\n\n【39】**1\\.

The ELF-EMF is Non-Ionizing Radiation (NIR) and does not carry enough energy per quantum to ionize atoms or molecules. The ELF-EMF are generated by electrical devices and power systems (1 Hz to 300 Hz). In recent decades， exposure to ELF-EMF has emerged potential concerns on public health. Exposure to ELF-EMF has an adverse biological effect depending on the current intensity， strength of the magnetic field， and duration of exposure. Accumulated epidemiologic evidence indicates a correlation between exposure to ELF-EMF and childhood cancer incidence， Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)， and miscarriage \\[1\\]. Data on the effects of Extremely Low Frequency Electromagnetic Fields (ELF-EMF) on pregnancy outcomes (Condition of the fetus or newborn after termination of pregnancy， including preterm birth， stillbirth， low birth weight， miscarriage， small for gestational age， etc.) are inconclusive \\[2\\]. For example， a report showed ELF-EMF has been studied as a potential risk factor for miscarriage (pregnancy loss at<20 weeks of gestation) and other adverse reproductive health outcomes. This research priority arose from reports of miscarriage and birth defect clusters among Video Display Terminal (VDT) operators in the U.S. and Canada. Although several studies have demonstrated that ELF-EMF is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes， other studies have shown no**\n\n【24】**evidence of associations \\[3\\]. A recent study by Wilson reports that personal magnetic fields exposures were not associated with fertility treatment outcomes or pregnancy outcomes \\[3\\]. Prematurity or small for gestational age is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity in developed countries， and also increase the risk of chronic diseases in adult life. Both are multifactorial phenomena associated with fetal， maternal， placental and environmental factors， and though several risk factors are now well known，the effect ofELF-EMF on it remains unidentified \\[2\\]. In this context， we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of ELF-EMF on pregnancy outcomes and provide evidence-based medicine evidence on the need for epidemiological research.**\n\n【25】**Methods**\n\n【26】**Search strategy**\n\n【27】**We searched PubMed， Embase， Cochrane Library and Web of Science from inception to March 10h， 2021 using the following searchterms： (\"Electromagnetic waves\" OR \"Electromagnetic Wave\" OR \"Wave， Electromagnetic\"OR \"Waves， Electromagnetic\"OR \"Electromagnetic Energy\" OR \"Electromagnetic Energies\" OR\"Energies， Electromagnetic\" OR \"Energy， Electromagnetic\" OR\"Radiation， Electromagnetic\"OR\"electromagnetic radiation\\[mesh\\]\") AND (“maternal\"， pregnancy\\[mesh\\]\"OR “pregnant\" OR\"pregnancies\"OR \"gestation\"OR \"pregnancy\") AND (\"Abnormality， Congenital\" OR \"Congenital Abnormality OR Deformities OR Deformity OR \"Congenital Defects\"OR \"Congenital Defect\" OR“Defect， Congenital\" OR \"Defects， Congenital\" OR\"Abnormalities， Congenital\"OR \"Birth Defects\" OR “Birth Defect\"OR“Defect， Birth\" OR \"Fetal Malformations\"OR \"Fetal Malformation\"OR“Malformation， Fetal\"OR\"Fetal Anomalies\"OR\"Anomaly， Fetal\"OR\"Fetal Anomaly\"OR\"abortion\"OR\"stillbirth\"OR \"chorioamnionitis\"OR \"congenital anomalies\" OR\"microcephaly\"OR \"neonatal death\"OR \"neonatal infection\" OR \"preterm birth\" OR \"low birth weight\"OR \"maternal death\" OR \"small for gestational age\" OR “outcome\"OR \"complication\"OR \"Congenital Abnormalities\\[mesh\\]\").

The results showed that there was no statistically significant between the two groups. There was no significant increase in bad pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women who lived near electromagnetic fields compared with those who lived far away from magnetic fields (Figure 2A).**\n\n【52】**Birth defect： A total of 4 studies were included. P<0.00001， I=99%， A random effects model was used. Total effect Z=0.85， P=0.39，\\[RR=1.29，95% CI (0.72，2.33)\\]. The results showed that there was no statistically significant between the two groups. There was no significant increase in newborn birth defect risk among pregnant women who lived near electromagnetic fields compared with those who lived far away from magnetic fields (Figure 2B).**\n\n【53】**Preterm birth**\n\n【54】**Atotal of2 studies were included.P=0.95，P=0%，Arandom effects**\n\n【55】**model was used.

There was no significant increase in preterm birth risk among pregnant women who lived near electromagnetic fields compared with those who lived far away from magnetic fields(Figure 2C).**\n\n【56】**Miscarriage and stillbirth**\n\n【57】**The outcomes of miscarriage and stillbirth were similar. So， analyze it as one situation， and a total of 2 studies were included. P=0.001， I=84%， A random effects model was used. Total effect Z=0.93， P=0.35， \\[RR=1.48， 95% CI (0.65， 3.33)\\]. The results showed that there was no statistically significant between the two groups. There was no significant increase in miscarriage and stillbirth risk among pregnant women who lived near electromagnetic fields compared with those who lived far away from magnetic fields (Figure2D).**\n\n【58】**Subgroup analysis**\n\n【59】**we conducted subgroup analyses by European region and non-European region (Asia and North America). The results showed pooled effect size for the European region Z=0.74， P=0.46， \\[RR=1.30，95% CI (0.65，2.63)\\]，non-European region Z=1.04，P=0.30，\\[RR=1.13，95% CI (0.90， 1.43)\\]， Between subgroups P=0.71，I2=0%，there was no statistically significant， but the heterogeneity is significantly reduced(Figure 2E).**\n\n【60】**Sensitivity analysis**\n\n【61】**Sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding each study in turn. After omitting the article KG Blaasaas 2004， Heterogeneity was significantly reduced， P=0.07， I=50%， however， there was no significant change in heterogeneity after omitting the other articles. This suggests that the source of heterogeneity in combined effect sizes for bad pregnancy outcomes is KG Blaasaas 2004 (Figure 2F).**\n\n【62】**Discussion**\n\n【63】**Epidemiologic studies have provided inconsistent results on the association between exposure to ELF-EMF and various health**\n\n| **Author**  | **Publishvear**  | **Location**  | **Primary outcomes**  | **Exposure conditions definitions**  |  | **Total samplesize (person)**  | **Year ofinclusion**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Elisabeth Robert\\[7\\]**  | **1993**  | **France**  | **chromosomal aberrations， central nervous** **system anomalies， skeletal malformations，cardiac defects， facial clefts， hypospadias** **anomalies of the digestive system， and** **anomalies of the urinary system**  | **maternal residence in a municipality inwhich at least one point of habitation waslocated within 500 meters (0.5 cm on the1/100，000 scale map) of 225 or 400 kVoverhead power lines**  | **5925**  |  | **1988-1989**  |\n| **ManoochehrMahram \\[8\\]**  | **2013**  | **Iran**  | **preterm labor，neonatal birth weight，length，head circumference and congenitalmaltormations**  | **the areas under the ELF-EM elds wereregistered on the maps.**  | **380**  |  | **2011**  |\n| **KG Blaasaas \\[9\\]**  | **2004**  | **Norway**  | **Birth defects： Central Nervous System(CNS) defects， cardiac defects， respiratorysystem defects， esophageal defects， and** **clubfoot**  | **the estimated magnetic field was 0.1 pTor above.**  | **744324**  |  | **1980-1997**  |\n| **Nathalie Auger\\[101**  | **2019**  | **Canada**  | **Nine major categories of birth defects wereincluded， covering the central nervoussystem， sense organs (eye， nose， ear)，orofacial clefts， heart， respiratory， digestive，abdominal wall or diaphragm (gastroschisis，** **omphalocele， diaphragmatic hernia)，** **genitourinary， and musculoskeletal systems.**  | **calculated the distance between thepostal code centroid and the nearesttransmission line and transformer stationin meters.(<200).**  | **2164246**  |  | **1989-2016**  |\n| **Frank de Vocht\\[111**  | **2014**  | **England**  | **Low Birthweight (LBW)， Small forGestational Age (SGA) and Preterm Birth(PTB) (included spontaneaus preterm birth)**  | **linear residential proximity of 200 m** **or less based on measurement dataindicating that magnetic field strengthsfrom overhead power lines would notexceed normal domestic backgroundlevels at cistances of more than 200m** **from high voltage lines.**  | **140356**  |  | **2004-2008**  |\n| **Nathalie Auger\\[12\\]** **Qiang Wang \\[13\\]**  | **2012** **2013**  | **Canada** **China**  | **stillbirth** **miscarriage**  | **The referent was defined as 2 100 m，The straight-line distance between pastalcode** **centroids and the nearest power line werecalculated with Maplnfo Professional 8.0.the estimated magnetic field was 0.1 pT** **or above.**  | **516685** **413**  |  | **1998-2007** **2010-2012**  |\n\n【65】**outcomes. It may be associated with neurodegenerative diseases， specifically Alzheimer’s disease； however， limited evidence was found to suggest that ELF EMFs are associated with several types of cancer， CVD， and reproductive outcomes \\[14\\]. Many research studies regarding the impact of low frequency electromagnetic fields on residents living close to very high voltage overhead power lines were carried out. A review study has shown that childhood leukemia is associated with exposure to magnetic field. Many other studies suggest the role of this exposure and the increased risk of birth defect. In addition， the results from some studies have indicated that exposure to magnetic field may be associated with the increased risk of adverse birth outcomes such as low birth weight and miscarriages. Some studies， however， did not find a statistically significant increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight in relation to exposure to electro-magnetic field during pregnancy reproductive outcomes \\[15\\]. Most residents living in close proximity to overhead power lines are more concerned about the outcome of their pregnancy. The scientific evidence for other outcomes of pregnancy such as preterm birth is quite weak. A total of 7 studies were included for meta-quantitative analysis. Miscarriage， stillbirth， birth defects， and preterm birth were included in the analysis as bad pregnancy outcomes. there was no statistically significant between the exposed group and the non-exposed group. Birth defects， preterm births， miscarriages and stillbirths were analyzed separately， and no statistically significant differences were found. The results showed that there was no statisticaly significant in pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women who lived near electromagnetic fields compared with those who lived far away from magnetic fields. We conducted subgroup analyses by European region and non-European region. The results suggest that different regions may be one of the sources of its heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the**\n\n【66】**source of heterogeneity in combined effect sizes for bad pregnancy outcomes is KG Blaasaas 2004. Sensitivity analysis showed that the KG Blaasaas 2004 \\[9\\] study had a greater impact on the heterogeneity of combined studies. However， after careful evaluation， there was no sufficient reason to exclude this literature study， so it was included. The limitations in this study are listed as follows. First， the definition of magnetic field exposure was not consistent across studies included in the meta-analysis. Second， the distance assessment method used is not completely consistent. Third， birth defects are also defined differently， for example， Elisabeth Robert 1993 \\[7\\] and Nathalie Auger 2019 \\[10\\] have a more comprehensive description of birth defects. While Manoochehr Mahram 2013 \\[8\\] only mentioned congenital malformations. The population of birth defects included in the original literature may vary， which may have some impact on the pooled results. Due to the small number of included studies， the publication bias ofthe studies could not be fully evaluated. In addition， most of the maternal and neonatal conditions are not clearly recorded in the literature， so it is impossible to explore confounding factors such as birth defects and preterm birth through multivariate analysis ofother influencing factors of pregnant women. Electromagnetic field exposure is flowing everywhere， and wherever there are wires， motors and electronic equipment， electromagnetic fields are generated. This is one of the reasons why it is difficult to assess the effects of electromagnetic fields on human health. For research consistency， this study pooled mainly electromagnetic exposures to residential high-voltage lines. Eventually， larger sample size and higher quality studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms ofthese magnetic fields. Although there is no direct evidence from the current study that ELF-EMF has an effect on pregnancy outcomes， studies， empirical observations， and patient reports clearly indicate interactions between EMF exposure and health problems. On the one hand， there**\n\n【67】**is strong evidence that long-term exposure to certain EMFs is a risk factor for diseases such as certain cancers， Alzheimer's disease， and male infertility. On the other hand， the Emerging Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EHS) is more and more recognized by health authorities， disability administrators and case workers， politicians， as well as courts of law. It is very important to take the individual susceptibility into account. The primary method of treatment should mainly focus on the prevention or reduction of EMF exposure， that is， reducing or eliminating all sources of high EMF exposure at home and at the workplace. The reduction of EMF exposure should also be extended to public spaces such as schools， hospitals，public transport， and libraries to enable persons with EHS an unhindered use (accessibility measure). At the same time， individuals should strengthen their physique and maintain homeostasis in order to increase their ability to resist disease and thus resist the bad effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields \\[16\\].**\n\n【68】**Conclusion**\n\n【69】**This meta-analysis shows that no correlation has been found between maternal ELF-EMF exposure and miscarriage， stillbirth， neonatal birth defects and preterm delivery， while the effects on small gestational age and low birth weight are still uncertain. Related research with high-quality large samples and different regions are still needed for further verification.**\n\n【70】**Funding**\n\n【71】**This work was funded by the Foundation of Nanchong Science and Technology Bureau City-School Science and Technology Strategic Cooperation Project (No.20SXQT0052).**\n\n【72】**References**\n\n【73】1\\.

Infection， stone disease， primary bowel mass， and recurrent urothelial cell cancer are among the causes to consider. Here， we report a case of a 61 year old male who developed hematuria secondary to neobladder varices which was managed with TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt) and variceal embolization.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Neobladder； Hematuria； TIPS； Cirrhosis； Bladder cancer； Varices**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**The standard of care for muscle invasive bladder cancer is a radical cystectomy. While different urinary diversion techniques are utilized， an orthotopicneobladder allows the patient to utilize the natural orifice for urine drainage \\[1\\]. By utilizing bowel， neobladders are uniquely susceptible to pathologies associated with the gastrointestinal system as well as the genitourinary system \\[2\\]. This creates a diagnostic problem in these patients when presenting with hematuria. This is a case report of a male with hepatic cirrhosis who developed hematuria from neobladder varices that was managed by TIPS and variceal embolization. To our knowledge， this is the first case of TIPS and variceal embolization being utilized to successfully stop hematuria in this setting.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 61 year old male with idiopathic hepatic cirrhosis who had undergone cystoprostatectomy for muscle invasive bladder cancer with ileal neobladder ten years prior presented with a one month history of hematuria. He maintained follow up after his original surgery as it was complicated by wound dehissence resulting in neobladder cutaneous fistula. It was eventually closed andhe was lost to follow up about 7 years ago. He reports that he was doing well in the interim until he developed hematuria but did not seek treatment until he developed clot retention and went to an outside hospital. There， he had cystoscopy which revealed diffuse mucosal hemorrhage. He continued to have hematuria requiring continuous bladder irrigation and blood transfusion so he was transferred to our academic institution. On presentation， he was actively hemorrhaging from his neobladder so he was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU). His liver function was compromised as he had Child Pugh class B cirrhosis with total bilirubin of1.5mg/dL， albumin at 2.4g/dL， prothrombin time of 16.7s， moderate ascites on CT scan， and no evidence of encephalopathy. After the patient received resuscitation， cystoscopy was performed to evacuate clots revealing hemorrhage emanating from multiple sites but no mucosal abnormalities indicative of neoplasm. CT angiogram did not show active extravasation but did show prominent varices surrounding the neobladder (Figure 1). During the diagnostic workup， he remained in the ICU as his hematuria persisted such that he received a total of 20 units of packed red blood cells， 6 units of platelets， and 8 units of fresh frozen plasma to maintain hemodynamic stability. The medical team's recommendation was to obtain hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement to assess the varices as a cause of the bleeding. His pressure gradient was found to be elevated at 19 mmHg (normal <5mmHg) so 10 mm TIPS endoprosthesis consisting of a nitinol stent with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft was placed lowering the gradient to 6 mmHg \\[3\\] (Figure 2 and 3). Unfortunately， variceal flow remained retrograde and his bleeding continued 2 days later so embolization of the neobladder varices was performed with vascular coils and Amplatzer plugs (Figure 4). Subsequently， his**\n\n【17】**Figure 1： (A) Axial and (B) coronal abdomen CT images showing prominent varicose veins around the neobladder.**\n\n【18】**Figure 2： Menseteric venogram during TIPS procedure showing varicose veins and systemic shunt to the iliac veins.**\n\n【19】**hematuria resolved. He remained free of signs ofTIPS complications without development of encephalopathy， fever， or worsening ascites. He was able to void spontaneously by Crede，external compression of the bladder， after foley catheter removal and had low urine residual before discharge.**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**Hematuria as a result of neobladder varices is a rare entity. Review of the literature only revealed one other case. That patient was unsuccessfully treated with diathermy of the mucosa at the sites of hemorrhage resulting in his death \\[4\\]. Additionally， there is a handful**\n\n【22】Figure 3： TIPS shunt between right hepatic vein and right portal vein.\n\n【23】Figure 4： Post varicose veins embolization with amplatzer vascular plug and multiple nitinol coils.\n\n【24】**of case reports of patients who developed hematuria from varices associated with an ileal conduit. Two of these were successfully treated by a TIPS procedure while another was managed by revision ofthe conduit and ligation of the varix \\[5-7\\].**\n\n【25】**Although very few cases have been reported， the etiology of the bleeding suggests this pathology carries a high risk of death. In the current case， the patient was improved a combination of TIPS and variceal embolization. Additionally， he benefitted from having relatively preserved liver function in the face of cirrhosis severe enough to induce varices and ascites.**\n\n【26】**Conclusion**\n\n【27】**varices. The difficulty associated with managing patients who develop hematuria from varices mandates that liver function and cirrhotic state are factored in when considering type of urinary diversion. Based off the limited number of case reports available， ileal conduit may be a safer option in these patients as management of hematuria from the varices appears to be more successful. Although many factors influence the overall survival of a patient with muscle invasive bladder cancer considering radical cystectomy， underlying hepatic disease must be included. We present a treatment option for patients who develop hematuria as a result of portal hypertension induced neobladder varices.**\n\n【28】**1\\.

It regularly presents as an active growth with facial asymmetry generally without pain. Statistically it af-fects more women in adolescence，although it does not discriminate by age or gender. Its best-known consequence is Asymmetric Facial Deformity (AFD)， combined with alteration of the dental occlusion with unilateral crossbite or open bite. It is not known when condylar hyperplasia begins and how long it lasts. We report a unilateral condylar hyperplasia in 35year old female managed successfully by surgical intervention.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Deviated mouth opening； Hyperplasia； Overgrowth of the mandible； Unilateral crossbite**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Overdevelopment of mandible was described by Robert Adams in 1836 who related it to condylar hyperplasia. Condylar hyperplasia of the mandible is an uncommon idiopathic disorder of non-neoplastic origin of the jaw characterised by increased volume of the condyle， unilaterally or bilaterally， leading to facial asymmetry， mandibular deviation， malocclusion and articular dysfunction generally without pain \\[1\\].**\n\n【16】**Hugo Obwegeser and Makek classified condylar hyperplasia as Type 1， 2， and 3. Wolford et al developed an updated classification of condylar hyperplasia in 2014 \\[2\\] (Table 1). Condylar hyperplasia has an unknown etiology. Several theories exist in the literature in which one states that an event of a trauma leading to increase in number of repair mechanism and hormones in that area may lead to increase in growth of mandible on that side \\[3\\]. Another theory states that an increase in loading of Temporomandibular joint can lead to increase in expression of bone forming molecules \\[4\\]. Condylar hyperplasia predominantly affects women 64% of patients being women\\[2\\]. We report a unilateral condylar hyperplasia in 35 year old female managed successfully by surgical intervention.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 35 year old female patient reported to us with a chief complaint of facial asymmetry. Her antenatal and obstetric history was not contributory. She had a history of trauma to the lower jaw during childhood for which she had not undergone any treatment. On extra-oral examination patient had facial asymmetry， flattening seen on the left side of the face with appearance of fullness on right side of the face (Figure 1). A bony swelling in the left pre-auricular region was evident measuring about 1.5 cms x1.5 cms. On opening ofthe mouth patient had deviation of the lower jaw towards the right side (Figure 2). On radiographic examination， OPG shows gross enlargement of the left condyle and Loss of antegonial notching with downward bowing of the inferior border on the mandible (Figure 3). CT scan revealed a hyperplastic left condyle with elongated neck (Figure4). An outward and downward growth of the body and ramus of the mandible on the affected side， deviation of mandible and chin to the opposite side， slanted occlusal plane for dental compensation， and deviation of dental midlines were evident. There was asymmetry of the left hemi mandible and outwardprotrusion ofthe anterior teeth. As the hyperplastic mass of condyle was evidently extended in the lateral preauricular region， it was easier to approach with preauricular incision (Figure 5a and b). Dissection was carried out till the mass was reached and continued to expose the condylar neck. Bony cut was made just below the hyperplastic mass which led to its separation from the neck of the condyle (Fig 6a and b). Entire mass was carefully removed in Toto (Figure 7a and b). The raw condyle neck portion was rounded off to mimic the condylar head (Figure 5b). Wounds were closed in layers.

Without a doubt， computerized tomography(CT) has contributed to establishing the pathology and condylar morphology but the nuclear medicine studies have helped in determining the active growth of the condyle. Technetium-99m is administered with methylene diphosphonate， which is absorbed by hydroxyapatite crystals and calcium from the bone tissue so that the fixation intensity is proportional to the degree of osteoblast activity； the examination that obtains the scanned bone is called“single photon emission computed tomography\"(SPECT)\\[6\\] (Figure 10).**\n\n【35】**As the degree of asymmetry increases， the subjects determine a greater need for surgery that repairs esthetics and function， indicating**\n\n【36】**that when the chin asymmetry deviates 10 mm from the midline， there is a high demand to correct it surgically； this demand decreases in proportion to increase in the patient's age and to decrease in the perception of facial esthetics \\[7\\]. Various authors suggested different treatment modalities depending on the age and SPECT findings， including condylectomy， compensatory orthodontics and surgical cosmetic camouflage either alone or in combination \\[6\\] (Table 2).**\n\n【37】**In our case the probable cause was trauma during childhood. CT and SPECT have contributed largely in determining the time of surgery. Surgical correction with proper planning and timing of treatment yields good functional and esthetic outcome.**\n\n【38】**References**\n\n【39】1\\. Raymond Fonseca.

Nasal sclerosis was first described by von Herbra in 1870. The criteria for diagnosis of nasal sclerosis are histopathologic examination， which may have characteristic pathological findings such as Mikulicz cells and Russel bodies， but it may be noncontributory in the early stages ofthe disease\\[2\\]. The disease can be divided into different stages according to different manifestations， including cataract stage， induration stage and scar stage \\[3\\]. A case of rhinosinusitis complicated with chronic sinusitis admitted to our department recently is reported.**\n\n【24】**Materials**\n\n【25】**A 43-year-old female patient reported that she accidentally found new organisms growing in the left nasal cavity about 2 years ago. However， she did not receive special treatment because she had no obvious symptoms， nasal obstruction， pus discharge， nasal pain and nasal bleeding.

Coronal MRI of paranasal sinuses (plain and enhanced).**\n\n【28】**coronal MRI of paranasal sinus (Figure 3， 4) showed that irregular soft tissue shadows were seen in the nasal passages around the left nasal cavity and inferior turbinate， with slightly longer T1 and T2signals， which were obviouslyuniformlyenhanced on enhanced scan. The mucosa of the left maxillary sinus， ethmoid sinus and sphenoid sinus was thickened to different degrees. In the sphenoid sinus cavity， there was liquid secretion and local encapsulation， which showed slightlylonger T1 and T2 signals.

Xenophobic sclerosis. Other relevant preoperative examinations were improved. On July 13h， 2022， plasma nasalendoscopic resection ofleft nasal mass under general anesthesia， left sphenoid sinus opening and left lower nail plasty were performed. During the operation， a large number of fish flesh-like neo-organisms were found in the left nasal cavity， with uneven surface and easy bleeding when touched. The base was at the bottom of the nose， and the mass accumulated in the left inferior turbinate. The left nasal cavity mass was taken and sent for disease examination. The left nasal cavity and left inferior turbinate masses were resected with disposable radiofrequency ablation needle(plasma)， local electric coagulation was performed to stop blood， no residual mass was checked， and the left inferior turbinate was formed thoroughly. The sphenoid sinus was penetrated above the left hind nostril， and little purulent secretions were found to flow out from the left sphenoid sinus. The sphenoid sinus orifice was fully aspirated and opened， and the sinus cavity was cleared. The left nasal cavity was**\n\n【30】**tampered with gelatin sponge for hemostasis. The operation process was smooth， with less intraoperative bleeding， and postoperative disease examination showed (Figure 6)： (left nasal mass) Nasal mucosa tissue was examined， with more lymphocytes， plasma cells and histiocytic infiltration in the lamina propria， and fibrous tissue hyperplasia， which was considered as sclerosis. During follow-up 14days after operation，the nasal appearance of the patient was normal， nasal obstruction symptoms disappeared obviously， bilateral nasal ventilation was good， nasal mucosal swelling was not obvious， a small amount of sticky secretions were found in the left nasal cavity， which was cleaned up， no bleeding and mucosal adhesions were observed， the mucosal recovery of the operative cavity was good， no purulent secretions were observed， and no obvious abnormalities were observed in the right nasal cavity. No special discomfort was reported during telephone follow-up 1 month after operation. Two months after the operation， the nasal mucosa of the patient recovered well，no postoperative complications， no recurrence.**\n\n【31】**Discussion**\n\n【32】**Nasal scleroma disease for chronic progressive lesions， all over the world have been reported， in Africa， the Middle East and our country is relatively rare， though it is regarded as a relatively rare disease， but it's in some environmental health is poor and backward country is endemic disease， this may be related to individual and immunity， nutritional status and related factors such as environmental health. The disease may also be associated with persistent rhinitis. Experts have reported a case of a hard-shell nodular lesion in the right alar of the nose， which was diagnosed as rhinoscleroma after 4 years of evolution \\[3\\]. It has been reported that naso-sclerosis can extensively involve many parts of the sinuses， nasopharynx and oropharynx \\[5\\]. The disease can also accumulate outside the respiratory system \\[6\\]. At present， the pathogenesis of rhinosclerosis is still unclear， mainly in the form of case reports， and the pathogenesis of rhinosclerosis is lack of research. In 1882， Frisch first isolated rhinosclerosis from the lesion， and serology is usually also helpful in the diagnosis of the disease \\[7\\]. Capsular Polysaccharide (CPS) is an important virulence factor of bacteria. All K (Klebsiella) and the serotype of naso-sclerosis are K3. CPS was thought to be an important driver of naso-sclerosis， but the results showed that the K3 capsular of naso-sclerosis was not involved in the formation of Mikulicz cells \\[8\\]. Some experts have reviewed the inconsistencies in the etiology， histology， and epidemiology of nasal sclerosis \\[9\\]. In light of the overall picture， they propose that intrinsic factors of genetic origin may contribute to the disease and suggest possible lines of research to distinguish between extrinsic and intrinsic factors as causative factors for rhinosclerosis. Imaging is to provide a reference for the surgical treatment of patients with sinonasal and sinonasal sclerosis. The diagnosis of this disease is based on histopathological examination.Treatment methods include anti-infective therapy， radiotherapy， surgery， and combination therapy. The effect of streptomycin on cephalosporins， streptomycin， sulfonamide and other drugs has been known since Miller in1946， but it has ototoxicity and should be routinely monitored for prevention \\[10，11\\]. Fluoroquinolones are taken orally and have higher tissue drug concentrations \\[12\\]. X-ray irradiation can promote fibrosis of the lesions， so that the lesions stop developing. When the lesions increase in value or scar formation， it can lead to nasal obstruction， laryngeal obstruction and pharyngeal stenosis， or it is not sensitive to anti-infective drugs. Surgical treatment is feasible. Preoperative medication is beneficial to intraoperative operation and reduce postoperative recurrence， and postoperative adherence to**\n\n【33】**antibiotic therapy is the key to prevent recurrence. In this case， the early onset of the patient was not paid attention to， no intervention， so the patient missed the early conservative treatment. Clinically， nasal sclerosis is difficult to diagnose in imaging. The disease should be differentiated from atrophic rhinitis， syphilis， tuberculosis， leprosy， malignant granuloma and nasal tumor. Early diagnosis and treatment can not only block the spread of the disease， but also avoid the progression of the disease. The patient recently developed nasal obstruction. Considering the patient s condition and the particularity of rhinosclerosis disease， we used plasma nasal endoscopic mass resection. Compared with the traditional application of nasal tissue forceps and dynamic suction cutter to remove the diseased tissue， plasma has less surgical bleeding， clear operative field and less trauma. Traditional methods cannot ensure the integrity of mucosal tissue， and nasal sclerosis is prone to recurrence and bleeding， while low-temperature plasma can disintegrate cells in molecular units by using the radiofrequency energy of low-temperature plasma， which can complete various functions such as cutting， hemostatic and ablation at the same time in a low-temperature environment to reduce the pain of patients \\[13\\]. The postoperative patients were followed up to observe the condition of the operation cavity. Under follow-up review， the operation cavity recovered well without complications and no recurrence was found. Due to the fear of recurrence，longer follow-up was needed \\[14\\]. This patient did not have accumulated paranasal sinuses， but was complicated with chronic sinusitis. The pathogenesis of sinusitis is complex. There is no relevant literature reporting that Klebsiella sinusitis is related to the pathogenesis of sinusitis.**\n\n【34】**Conclusion**\n\n【35】**In conclusion， plasma nasal endoscopic surgery for the treatment of nasal sclerosis： Less damage， less bleeding， less pain， rapid postoperative recovery， effective resection of diseased tissue， for the treatment of nasal obstruction symptoms caused by nasal sclerosis and prevent recurrence of the ideal surgical method.**\n\n【36】**References**\n\n【37】**1\\.

In particular current bleeding-sensitive SWI sequences(susceptibility weighted imaging)， with high sensitivity for the magnetic properties of blood， iron and calcifications， have led to a marked increase in sensitivity for the detection of cerebral microbleeds. Radiology is now confronted with the task of providing evidence for the aetiology of these microbleeds on the basis of specific patterns. A common cause of cerebral microbleeds is， for example， hypertension left untreated for many years or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Here， MRI reveals typical patterns of hemorrhaging， with the basal ganglia and the thalamus predominantly being affected in the case of hypertensive microbleeds. The following case report describes the case of a young patient with multiple cerebral microbleeds that are not of the origins mentioned above\\[1，2\\].**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**An 18-year-old male patient was admitted with severe respiratory insufficiency and evidence of pronounced bilateral infiltrates. An exogenous allergic alveolitis was surmised. Cortisone， high-intensity ventilation and repeated placement in the prone position ultimately led to stabilization of the condition. Weaning proved to be difficult. Oxygen denaturation down to 50% occurred， in reaction to which sedation and myorelaxation were induced and the patient had to be intubated. Over the further inpatient course， ventilation deteriorated repeatedly due to secretion obstruction and diffuses pulmonary hemorrhages. Permissive hypercapnia was tolerated. The patient was extubated after a total of 13 days (Figure la and 1b).**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Axial T2wTSE (a) 11 years previously， without pathological findings. No increased signal intensity in isoB1000 (b) as evidence of a diffusion disorder of the brain tissue.**\n\n【24】**Figure 2： Axial T2wTSE (a， d) with demonstration of signal enhancements in the corpus callosum (arrow)， hyperintense compared with the white matter.

The changes correspond to multiple hemosiderin deposits and are interpreted as critical illness-associated micrableeds.**\n\n【25】**Neurologically， flaccid tetraparesis and reduced algesia were seen after extubation， and suspicion of a mild critical illness polyneuropathy was confirmed. In addition， the patient was suffering from hyperreactive delirium. Three days after extubation，the patient’s mood was depressed and he was autonomically impaired， with a tendency to latent hypoventilation and a look of panic. Suspicion of a posttraumatic stress disorder was expressed， but cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cMRI) was performed to exclude a somatic cause. In SWI of the cMRI， multiple bihemispherical hemosiderin deposits were seen， with a predominance in the corpus callosum. The T2-weighted images (Figures 2a-2f) showed an accompanying vasogenic edema. In a subsequent neuropsychological examination， impairments in the areas of speech， linguistic divergent thinking， memory and briefly delayed recall were seen， so that a cognitive disorder resulting from a disease， injury or functional disorder of the brain according to ICD-10 \\[F07.8\\] was assumed.**\n\n【26】**Discussion**\n\n【27】**Chronic hypertension and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are the two most common pathologies responsible for cerebral microbleeds in elderly patients \\[1\\].**\n\n【28】**However， other causes should also be taken into consideration， particularly in younger patients. Cerebral microbleeds with a predominance for the corpus callosum have also been described in younger patients with diseases requiring intensive care， such as disseminated intravascular coagulopathy， respiratory failure and viral infections， and in this connection are classified as critical illness-**\n\n【29】**associated microbleeds \\[2，3\\].**\n\n【30】**The young age of the patient is also to be stressed in the case reported here. Patients aged between 27 and 63 years with similar findings can be found in the literature \\[2\\].**\n\n【31】**There are different theories regarding the aetiology of critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds \\[2\\]：**\n\n【32】**Since hemorrhages caused by high altitudes show a similar distribution pattern \\[4\\]， it stands to reason that hypoxia might be the point of origin. In most of the cases described， the patients were suffering from respiratory insufficiency \\[2-6\\]， which means that an intermediate hypoxia is probable. Also in the patient described here， denaturation repeatedly occurred over the inpatient course. The hypoxia may， through hydrostatic or chemical effects， lead to a disturbance of the blood-brain barrier and thus enable the escape of erythrocytes \\[1\\].**\n\n【33】**A further attempt to explain the bleeding is Disseminated Intravascular Coagulopathy (DIC). In previously described cases， it was not always possible to provide information about a possible presence， but there were certainly signs pointing in this direction， such as a thrombocytopenia. However， this is not the case in our patient.**\n\n【34】**A true causal connection has vet to be established.**\n\n【35】**The clinical consequences of cerebral microbleeds often remain unnoticed. In a case control study， however， it was indeed shown that they are associated with cognitive dysfunctions \\[7\\].**\n\n【36】**Conclusion**\n\n【37】**The present case presentation shows the diversity of cerebral microbleeds with regard to the distribution pattern and their underlying aetiology. The detection and classification of cerebral microbleeds is an integral part of radiological diagnostics， as therapeutic concepts regarding the aetiology， e.g. in the case of chronic hypertension， result for the patient. The case described， with its critical illness-associated microbleeds， illustrates a rarer cause of the presence of multiple cerebral microbleeds.**\n\n【38】**References**\n\n【39】**1\\.

The clinical findings can vary and are non-specific， making it a diagnostic challenge. Therefore， definitive diagnosis of primary cancer of the fallopian tube is mostlybased on postoperative histological examination. However， the consequences of not diagnosing this disease can be significant as the five-year survival is low in advanced stage of the disease. In this case report the difficulties that are encountered in the diagnosis ofprimary cancer of the fallopian tube are described.**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Primary Cancer of the Fallopian Tube (PFTC) is rare. In the United Kingdom， an average of 40cases is reported each year \\[1\\]. The United States has an annual incidence of approximately 3.6 per million women per year \\[2\\]. The exact incidence of tubal carcinoma in the Netherlands is unknown. PFTC is estimated to concern 0.14% to 0.18% of all genital cancers \\[3\\]， although the incidence of fallopian tube cancer could be significantly underestimated \\[4\\]. This is because clinically and histologically PFTC resembles ovarian cancer. It is difficult to differentiate from serous ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal serous carcinoma during or after operation. The peak incidence is between the age of 60 and 64 years \\[5\\]. In addition to the rarity of the disease， the variety in signs and symptoms and the lack of specific symptoms are factors that make detection of PFTC difficult. Therefore， definitive diagnosis of PFTC is mostly based on an intraoperative finding or a postoperative histological examination. The treatment of PFTC depends on the staging. Because it often occurs bilaterally and it prefers to metastasize to the uterus and ovaries， removal of the uterus and both adnexa are the primary treatment \\[6\\]. We report a case of primary tubal adenocarcinoma discovered in a 71-year-old woman， with vaginal discharge as initial symptom.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**A 71-year-old， post-menopausal woman came to us complaining of vaginal discharge that began 5 months previously. Her medical history revealed colon cancer 11 years ago. She underwent endoscopic surgery for local colon resection. No post-treatment was necessary， and she experienced complete remission. The general practitioner referred her to us， as he was suspecting the discharge to be urinary loss. We saw a woman in good general health. Physical examination of the abdominopelvic area revealed no palpable mass. Vaginal examination showed a pinpoint ostium of the cervix without abnormalities on the vaginal walls. There was no uterine prolapse. Vaginal discharge was yellowish and mucoid. Transvaginal ultrasonography showed a retroverted uterus with a thin endometrium. The posterior wall showed an intramural myoma， measuring 25mm×33 mm. The right ovary showed no abnormalities. The left side revealed an irregular elongated mass with blood flow， measuring 6 cm×4 cm (Figure 1). The mass consists of multiple cystic locules with a thick irregular wall. It was difficult to determine its origin. No fluid in the pouch of Douglas was seen. A Papanicolaou (i.e.， PAP) smear revealed PAP1. The aspect of the vaginal discharge did not suggest urine. A culture test of the discharge showed S. Aureus. The serum Cancer Antigen (CA)125 level was normal (8 U/ml \\[normal <35 U/ml\\]). Also， Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) was normal (1.7 ug/l \\[normal <5.0 u/l\\]). An abdominal-pelvic CT-scan showed an indistinct malignant or benign tumor originating in the left adnexa (Figure 2). There was no ascites， lymphadenopathy or peritonitis carcinomatosa noted. There was no evidence of ureter， bladder， colon or urethral involvement. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy. No abnormalities of the uterus and right ovary were found. The left ovary was small. The left tube was enlarged and adhesive to the pelvic sidewall. No ascites was present. A tumor biopsy was collected and sent for frozen section histology. An uncomplicated total hysterectomy with a bilateral adnexectomy was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. The histological examination showed a well-differentiated， stage IA， high-grade adenocarcinoma of the left tube. There was no tumorlocalization in the uterus， ovaries or the right tuba. She was referred to the oncology department for adjuvant chemotherapy of**\n\n【20】**Figure 1： An irregular density with color flow， measuring 6 mmx 4mm.**\n\n【21】6 cycles of Carboplatin monotherapy during 18 weeks. No recurrence was noted 6 months post-operative.\n\n【22】**Discussion**\n\n【23】**PFTC is the rarest tumor in female genital tract can IS. However， the true incidence of PFTC may be higher than reported. This could be due to the fact that tubal carcinoma often is seen as ovarian carcinoma during surgery and/or microscopic examination， as the histological appearances of these tumors are almost identical\\[7，8\\]. And even when the tumor is resected， it still can be reported as an ovarian cancer \\[9\\]. No significant correlation with age， ethnicity， weight，infertility， smoking or endometriosis has been demonstrated\\[7，10\\]. The clinical signs and symptoms of PFTC are unclear. Latzko describes a triad of symptoms， existing of serous vaginal discharge， colic pain and an abdominal mass \\[11\\]. This triad exists in about15% of patients with PFTC \\[12，13\\]. Fluid leaking forms the tube， presenting as vaginal discharge， similar to our patient， has been reported in 5% of patients \\[6\\]. A transvaginal and/or transabdominal ultrasound is essential for imaging in tubal pathology. However， the fallopian tubes are often difficult recognizable on ultrasound. Tubal abnormalities- may resemble other pelvic conditions such as a tubo-ovarian abscess， an ovarian tumor or an ectopic pregnancy\\[6\\]. Tubal carcinoma has no pathognomic hallmark on ultrasound and is therefore difficult to recognize. Although rare， PFTC must be considered in the differential diagnosis of adnexal masses， and particularly in the presence of incomplete septations and a highly vascular， solid component. Diagnosing PFTC preoperatively， could be helped by measuring serum levels of CA-125. CA-125 levels are elevated in more than 80% of PFTC cases， especially in cases of advanced disease \\[14\\]. Therefore， CA-125 can be used in the diagnosis of PFTC. Unfortunately， it is not specific as CA-125 levels also increase in ovarian cancer and other gynecologic diseases， such**\n\n【24】**as endometriosis. Primary adenocarcinoma of the fallopian tube with papillary features is the most common histological type of primary tubal cancer (>90%)\\[15\\]. Serous carcinoma appears to be the most common histologic type \\[11\\]. Because it is hard to differentiate PFTC from epithelial ovarian cancer， patients with at least one of the following criteria should have the diagnosis of PFTC. The main tumor is in the tube and arises from the endosalpinx；(b) histologically， the pattern reproduces the epithelium of the mucosa and often shows a papillary pattern； (c) if the wall is involved， the transition between benign and malignant epithelium should be demonstrable； and (d) the ovaries and endometrium are either normal or contain less tumor than the tube \\[6\\]. No relationship has been found between tubal malignancy and colon carcinoma. In this case， the two malignancies are therefore independent of each other. Similar to ovarian cancer， BRCA germline mutation and TP53 mutation are associated with PFTC \\[9，16\\]. Surgery is the treatment of choice for cancer of the fallopian tubes. Surgical principles are the same as those applied in ovarian cancer. The procedure consists of a total abdominal hysterectomy， bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy， selective pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy， peritoneal washing， and peritoneal biopsies \\[14，17\\]. Adjuvant chemotherapy is considered effective， in view of the mode of lymphatic and hematogenous metastasis for this cancer. A platinum compound combined with paclitaxel is the standard chemotherapy in the treatment of PFTC， identical to ovarian cancer patients \\[18\\]. Prognosis depends on the stage of the disease at diagnosis， the histological type of the cancer， and the degree of success of the surgery. In early-stage patients， the prognosis is good and the disease can be cured \\[19\\]. At an advanced stage of the disease， the five-year survival is low (34%) \\[20\\]. Due to the poor prognosis of PFTC in late stages， early diagnosis is even more important.**\n\n【25】**Conclusion**\n\n【26】**Primary cancer of the fallopian tube should be suspected in postmenopausal women with vaginal discharge and a suspicious adnexal mass seen on ultrasound. Diagnosis can be challenging due to the non-specific clinical manifestations and the lack of methods to diagnose this disease. Definitive diagnosis of PFTC is mostly based on an intraoperative finding or a postoperative histological examination. However， early clinical manifestation and prompt investigations lead to diagnosis in the early stage of disease accounting for a better prognosis.**\n\n【27】**References**\n\n【28】**1\\.

Aksaray University Education and Research Hospital， Turkey_**\n\n【10】**Abstract**\n\n【11】**Chlamydia psittaci is an obligate intracellular bacterium which causes psittacosis in psittacine birds and can be transmitted to humans by inhalation or direct contact. Birds are the primary reservoir， but transmission from other animals has also been reported. Virtually all pet birds can carry C. psittaci， but psittacine birds are the most likely to be infected. There are 10 known genotypes based on sequencing of the major outer protein gene and each genotype has host preferences and virulence characteristics. Psittacosis which was estimated to cause approximately 1 percent of cases of community-acquired pneumonia has been recognized throughout the world. The precise incidence and prevalence of psittacosis is difficult to establish， likely due to lack of reachable sensitive and specific diagnostic tests. Psittacosis has been described in all age groups but most commonly seen in young and middle-aged adults. A marked predilection for males is noted，presumably related to increased potential for exposure. Local outbreaks which related to pet shops， aviaries and veterinary facilities have been described. Patients usually present with respiratory symptoms likely dry cough due to pulmonary infection with varying severity. The most frequently reported clinical symptoms are high fever， chills， malaise， headache， myalgia， non-productive cough and respiratory distress. Infection can also be asymptomatic and other less common but important symptoms include pharyngitis， diarrhea， and altered mental status can be seen. Patients usually have a history of bird exposure. The incubation period is usually between 5 and 14 days but can be as long as 39days. Unusual presentations which complicate making the precise diagnosis may rarely be seen. Variable clinical symptoms may arise with involvement in a number of different organs. Cold agglutinins， hemolytic anemia， acute thrombocytopenic purpura， severe pancytopenia secondary to hemophagocytic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura have been described as hematologic complications. But these are uncommon manifestations.**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Laboratory studies may revealleukocytosis with toxic granulation or a left shift. The Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) are very often elevated. The liver enzymes are abnormal in approximately half of hospitalized patients. Mild elevation of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen and hyponatremia is quite common. The chest radiograph is usually abnormal most often with lobar changes \\[1-11\\]. Pleural effusions are rare but can occur. On high-resolution computed tomography， the pulmonary infiltrates may be nodular surrounded by ground-glass opacities \\[12\\]. Serology is the principal method of confirming the diagnosis Microimmunofluorescence antibody test (MIF) is the most sensitive and specific serologic test for C. psittaci but is only available in specialty laboratories \\[13\\]. A fourfold rise in antibodies or an Immunoglobulin (Ig)M antibody titer ≥ 16 is interpreted as diagnostic， but antibody titer of ≥ 32 is preferable for a sufficient diagnosis. However， negative serology in hospitalized psittacosis patients is not uncommon. The current serological tests are less sensitive than Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR). PCR methods give a rapid and specific diagnosis. It is not only more sensitive than culture and serology， it also allows genotyping. Unfortunately PCR is not available in many health care institutions in Turkey.**\n\n【14】**_cited._**\n\n【15】**The tetracycline's including doxycycline or tetracycline hydrochlorides are preferred for the treatment of psittacosis. This treatment must be continued during a period of at least 10 to 14 days in order to be effective and to prevent relapse. Other agents like macrolides and quinolones may also have been proposed as alternatives but they are less active against C. psittaci than tetracyclines and macrolides \\[14-16\\].**\n\n【16】Figure 1： Four of all separated figures of peripheral blaad smear shows numerous promonocytes and monocytes that have folded and convoluted nuclei and a finely granulated cytoplasm withaut remarkable vacuales. A and B： Thick area of blaad smear， C and D： Optimal/Medial area of blaad smear.\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 70-year old male was admitted to thehospital with the symptoms of fatigue， myalgia， fever up to 39℃ and non-productive cough since more than ten days. He had been treated with oral amoxicillin/clavulanate of 1000 mg BID for seven days. But the patient stated that symptoms were worsened under the treatment. His medical history included Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with 40year of heavy smoking which was reduced for the last few years. There were no known allergic diseases. At the time of admission his vital signs of blood pressure， respiration and heart rates were stable hence he was hospitalized at the internal medicine ward. Axillartemperature was 38.6°℃ and blood oxygen level was 86% on pulse oximetry. Physical examination revealed petechias on bilateral forelegs. Auscultation of the lungs showed bilateral coarse rales/crackles. On some areas of lungs bronchial breath sounds were also audible. Rest ofsystemic clinical examination showed no abnormalities. Blood analysis showed leukocytosis (12400/uL) with relative monocytosis(2330/uL)， mild anemia (9.5 gr/dL) and severe thrombocytopenia(13000/uL). Peripheral blood smear showed numerous promonocytes and monocytes that have folded and convoluted nuclei and a finely granulated cytoplasm without vacuoles (Figure 1). Coagulation tests**\n\n【19】**were in normal range. There was an elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP)(126 mg/L) and a sedimentation rate of 84 mm/h. Liver enzymes were slightly elevated， with an SGOT of 57 U/L， an SGPT of 66 U/L， a GGT of 104 U/L and alkaline phosphatase of 365 U/L. Bilirubin levels were normal. Auto-immune serology including rheumatoid factor， anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide antibodies and Anti-Nuclear Antibodies were all negative. Viral and bacterial serologies were negative. A chest radiograph revealed extensive pleuropneumonia in bilateral lungs and chest CT showed multiple peripheral ground glass opacities with consolidation in both lungs (Figure 2). Bone marrow biopsy was performed given acute monocytic leukemia was the potential initial diagnosis. Normocellular bone marrow with relative monocytosis， increasedhistiocytes with hemophagocytosis was revealed. Immunohistochemical staining showed normal promonocytes and monocytes without monoblasts (Figure 3). Acute leukemia which was considered as an initial diagnosis was excluded. Pulmonary function tests showed moderate COPD with FEV1/FVC (Tiffeneau Index) of60 and a reduced Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). Transthoracic cardiac echography revealed no abnormalities. Urine culture， sputum culture and repeated blood cultures revealed no specific pathogen. The patient had been keeping approximately a hundred pigeons as a pet for about five years. In the past birds had some illnesses which were treated by the veterinary physician. But there was no demonstrated document about diagnoses and treatments. With the given clinical evidences psittacosis was considered. An antibody detection of C. psittaci assay was performed at the private laboratory without under social reimbursement. Psittacosis was subsequently confirmed by specific IgG immunofluorescence testing. The serum had an IgM titer of 1：16， and elevated titers of IgG (1：512) to C. psittaci， indicating an acute infection. Genotype-specific real-time PCR could not be performed due to unavailability. After one-week course of levofloxacin， as clinical improvement was lacking doxycycline at a dose of 100 mg BID was initiated. Cytopenias due to hemophagocytos is was gradually resolved.Doxycycline was continued for three-week course in order to prevent relapse. Clinical and laboratory response was achieved. Blood values were all became normal ranges with being resolved of monocytosis. The patient fully recovered and discharged.**\n\n【20】**Conclusion**\n\n【21】**Here we present a case of human psittacosis mimicking acute monocytic leukemia which demonstrates an extraordinary clinical presentation of psittacosis. Some hematologic complications of disease have been described： Cold agglutinins， hemolytic anemia， acute thrombocytopenic purpura， severe pancytopenia secondary to hemophagocytic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic**\n\n【22】**Figure 2： A) Bilateral emphysema， bronchial dilatation， and chronic fibratic changes are present in bath lungs.

Hematologic complications usually occur in patients with fulminant disease. Disseminated intravascular coagulation has been described by two different authors as one of the lethal hematologic complication. According to published paper the case was died due to massive thrombosis and respiratory failure and psittacosis was subsequently confirmed by complement fixation tests. Other case with disseminated intravascular coagulation was fully recovered after initiation of heparin and doxycycline. Severe pancytopenia secondary to hemophagocytic syndrome similarly to our case has also been described. Cold agglutinins are sometimes noted in psittacosis， but hemolytic anemia with jaundice is rare. A case presenting with jaundice and the clinical symptoms of an atypical pneumonia which was attributed to Chlamydia psittaci with serologic results has described.Under theliterature reviewonpsittacosis andhematological complications， authors concluded that cold agglutinins may be found in association with psittacosis， but a concomitant hemolytic anemia is very rare. Hematologic complications of psittacosis occur quite rare and are defined based on case reports. According to our review of literature monocytosis demonstrating like acute monocytic leukemia has not been described. The patient was fully recovered after three-week course of doxycycline. Human psittacosis should be consider in cases who show typical and atypical respiratory signs. In recent year's pigeon keeping or pigeon fancying as a hobby is common in Turkey. Therefore detailed medical history including occupational exposure to psittacine birds should be taken in all cases even with unusual clinical presentation. Systematic review of clinical and laboratory signs are fundamental to reach the precise diagnosis. Antibody detection assays are the only diagnostic tools in many institutions to define psittacosis in humans. But in Turkey antibody detection assays are unavailable in most of the public hospitals. PCR-based testing which is highly sensitive and specific is very expensive and very hard-to-reach. In our case antibody detection assay could not beperformed in our institution. The blood samples were sent to private laboratory which does not have an agreement with social reimbursement. Unfortunately these difficulties during diagnostic process make the psittacosis infection being reported vastly underestimated. The real burden of this disease remains undetected.**\n\n【27】**References**\n\n【28】**1\\. Wolff BJ.

A 41-year-old healthy man started from an altitude of 143 feet (43.5 meters) and reached an altitude of 13，780 feet (4，200 meters) within one day. After 4 months of residence， he developed decreased vision accompanied by visual field defects in his left eye. Ophthalmic examination revealed bilateral papilledema， peripapillary hemorrhage in his left eye， and retinal hemorrhage in the macular area of optic papilla. He was diagnosed with HAR. After 3 months of treatment， the patient's symptoms and signs improved.**\n\n【20】**HAR can occur when the human body enters the high-altitude area (the altitude above 3，000 meters) from the low altitude area in a short period of time. This case has deepened the understanding of the effects of high-altitude environment on the retina， and suggested the importance of early diagnose and treatment.**\n\n【21】**Keywords： High-altitude retinopathy； Retinal hemorrhage； High-altitude sickness； Hypoxia**\n\n【22】**Introduction**\n\n【23】**When the human body enters the high-altitude area (the altitude above 3，000 meters) from the low altitude area， a series of diseases caused by hypoxia are collectively called High-Altitude sickness (HAI). The clinical manifestations of high-altitude diseases include Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)， High-Altitude Retinopathy (HAR)， High-Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) and High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE). It has been shown that HAR is closely related to the occurrence and progression ofHACE and HAPE \\[1\\].**\n\n【24】**The ocular symptoms of HAR are tortuous retinal veins， diffuse or punctate retinal hemorrhage(occasionallylocated in the macula)，vitreoushemorrhage，papillaryedema， congestion，peripapillary hemorrhage， etc. \\[2\\]. This paper describes a case of HAR in a 41-year-old healthy man who started from an altitude of 143 feet (43.5 meters) and reached an altitude of 13，780 feet (4，200 meters) within one day.**\n\n【25】**In July 2022， the 41-year-old man set off from the area at an altitude of 143 feet (43.5 meters) and reached 13，780 feet (4，200 meters) above sea level in Yushu， Qinghai Province， within one day. Yushu City is located in the eastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau， which is the backbone of the terrain formed by the remaining veins of Tanggula Mountain， and has an average elevation of 4493.4meters. It is a typical plateau and alpine climate. The oxygen content of the air is low， only 40%~60% of what it is at sea level. The atmospheric pressure is about 60 kPa \\[3\\]. He resided there until November 2022 for 4 months， with about 4 h to 8 h of physical activity every day. He subsequently developed reduced vision and visual field defects in his left eye， with no systemic symptoms such as headache， dizziness， vomiting or other discomfort. Because his symptoms did not alleviate，he returned to the area of an elevation of 143 feet (43.5 meters) to visit the ophthalmology department.**\n\n【26】**During the presentation， it was noted that he had decreased visual acuity in his left eye and a sub-nasal visual field defect that had persisted for 2 weeks. The patient had no history of other ocular diseases， systemic diseases， trauma， or surgery. At the same time， he was not taking any oral medication. At the first visit， the corrected visual acuity was 1.0 (20/20) in the right eye and 0.7**\n\n【27】**Figure 1： Color fundus photography showed indistinct and congested optic disc boundary， papilledema bulging， which is more severe on the left than on the right. The retinal veins were slightly tortuous and dilated， and the ratio of retinal artery to vein was about 1：2. As indicated by the arrow， lamellar superficial hemorrhage was seen on the nasal side around the aptic disc in the left eye， and lamellar retinal hemorrhage was seen in the optic papilla macular area (A， B)；OCT showed a W-shaped protuberance in the optic disc(C， D)： FFA showed mild late-stage fluorescein leakage in the right aptic disc and significant late-stage fluorescein leakage in the left aptic disc. Blocked fluorescence was abserved on the nasal side of the aptic disc in the left eye， which was consistent with color fundus hemorrhage (E， F)； Humphrey's visual field showed an inferior visual field scotoma in the right eye and an inferonasal visual field defect in the left eye(G， H).**\n\n【28】**(14/20) in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 12 mmHg in both eyes. Slit-lamp biomicroscope showed no positive sign in the bilateral anterior segment of both eyes. Color fundus photographs showed indistinct and congested disc boundaries with papilledema bulges， which were more severe on the left than on the right. The retinal veins were slightly tortuous and dilated， and the ratio of retinal arteries to veins was about 1：2. Lamellar superficial hemorrhage was seen on the nasal side around the optic disc in the left eye， and lamellar retinal hemorrhage was seen in the optic papilla macular area (Figure 1A，1B). OCT showed an increase in the thickness of the optic nerve fiber laver in both eves and a W-shaped protuberance in the optic disc(Figure 1C， 1D). FFA showed mild late-stage fluorescein leakage in the right optic disc and significant late-stage fluorescein leakage in the left optic disc. Blocked fluorescence was observed on the nasal side of the optic disc in the left eye， which was consistent with color fundus hemorrhage (Figure 1E， 1F). Humphrey's visual field showed an inferior visual field scotoma in the right eye and an inferonasal visual field defect in the left eye (Figure 1G， 1H).**\n\n【29】**Figure 2： The second Color fundus photography revealed a reduction in papilledema binacular. As indicated by the arrow， there was also significant absorption of superficial hemorrhage in the macular area of aptic papilla and on the nasal side of the optic disc in the left eye (A， B)； OCT showed a reductian in papilledema (C， D)； The second Humphrey visual field showed that the defect in the inferior nasal quadrant of the visual field in the left eye was smaller than that in the anterior (E， F).**\n\n【30】**At the same time， the patient underwent blood routine and biochemical tests. It was found that his hematocrit and hemoglobin content were elevated. This suggests an increase in blood viscosity， which， notably， is thought to be a contributing factor to HAR \\[4\\]. The patient was given a peribulbar injection of triamcinolone acetonide to the left eye for anti-inflammatory treatment， oral medication to improve microcirculation， oral mecobalamin tablets， and vitamin B1nutritional nerve therapy.**\n\n【31】**Four months later， the patient returned to the ophthalmology clinic and reported a reduction in visual field defects in the left eye. The corrected visual acuity in both eyes was the same as in the initial presentation. Color fundus photography revealed reduced papilledema in both eyes. There was also significant absorption of superficial hemorrhage in the macular area of optic papilla and on the nasal side of the optic disc in the left eye (Figure 2A， 2B). OCT showed a reduction in papilledema (Figure 2C， 2D). Humphrey's visual field showed that the defect in the inferior nasal quadrant of the visual field in the left eye was smaller than that in the anterior (Figure2E，2F). ERG showed that cone function was impaired in both eyes， more so in the left eye than in the right (Figure 3).**\n\n【32】**Discussion**\n\n【33】**Previous reports have suggested that high-altitude and hypoxia as risk factors for HAR\\[5\\]. Hypoxia can lead to incomplete oxidation of the body's tissues， and the accumulated metabolites can have toxic effects on the tissues， thereby increasing vascular permeability and causing retinal edema，hemorrhage， and exudation \\[6\\]. Weidman and Tabin divided HAR into four different grades. Grade 1： Mild retinal hemorrhage of the retinal vein in one PD area； Grade 2： Moderately dilated retinal vein with retinal hemorrhage in two PD areas； Grade**\n\n【34】**3： Significantly dilated retinal vein with retinal hemorrhage in three PD areas， as well as perimacular retinal hemorrhage and vitreous hemorrhage； Grade 4： The retinal vein is significantly dilated and bluish-purple， the retinal hemorrhage is larger than in 3 PD areas， and the macula and retinal vein are tortuous and dilated， affecting central visual acuity \\[7\\]. Meanwhile， high-altitude climbers often have elevated hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations， which can lead to increased blood viscosity， increased clotting， and reduced oxygen delivery \\[8\\]. In the first report on HAR published in 1968， Singhet et al. \\[9\\] observed papilledema， retinal vein dilatation and retinal hemorrhage in a patient who rose to high-altitude within a short period oftime. In addition， Frayser et al. \\[10\\] found that 9 out of 25 subjects (36%) had retinal hemorrhage at an altitude of 17，500**\n\n【35】**feet (5，334 meters). These are the earliest documented cases of HAR. Subsequent reports of related cases are rare.**\n\n【36】**Interestingly， Arora et al. \\[8\\] found that HAR is more common in young， well-trained people at high altitudes. This may be due to the dilation of blood vessels and the increase of systemic circulatory pressure to which the retina is more susceptible in young adults during exercise. This case is also a case of ocular disease in young and middle-aged people under continuous high-intensity physical activity， which may support the above statement. The study by xi Tian et al. \\[3\\] showed that three months after subjects returned to baseline altitude， their retinal condition could return to a normal state， indicating that an increase in atmospheric oxygen content and a decrease in altitude can restore nerve and vascular function. This**\n\n【37】**could also provide evidence that the disease generally has a better prognosis. The occurrence and development of high-altitude sickness depends not only on the rising height， but also on the rising speed， adaptation to high-altitude， personal baseline level and other possible genetic and environmental factors \\[11\\]. Because the human body moves rapidly from low to high altitudes in a short period of time， it is difficult for the body to immediately adapt to the high altitude and hypoxia environment， and is therefore prone to HAI. The most important thing for HAR is prevention， with a particular focus on slow ascent rates and adequate adaptation time. Once symptoms of HAI appear， stopping further ascent and starting oxygen supplementation and slow altitude reduction are recommended as the best treatment options \\[1\\].Other related literature reports \\[11\\]， if the human body can gradually tolerate high-altitude and low oxygen content during the slow adaptation process. Therefore， a climber who is already well adapted to such conditions can climb the Himalayas， reach (and descend from) the summit without using additional oxygen. This sggests that slowing the ascent rate and gradually adapting to lower oxygen levels is beneficial for HAI prevention. Moreover， Wiedman and Tabin \\[7\\] observed 40 climbers with an altitude of more than4，870 meters and found that all those with HACE had HAR. They argued that treatment of HACE with oxygen， steroids or diuretics should be initiated as soon as possible following a diagnosis of HAR， and that altitude reduction should be initiated immediately to prevent further development of HACE. Another study also confirmed that the severity of HAR was significantly associated with diseases such as HAPE and HACE \\[8\\]. All the above studies demonstrate the importance of early diagnosis of HAR to prevent the development of life-threatening HACE. With the development of science and improved examination methods， early HAR can be identified and diagnosed with modern advanced instruments. In addition to the conventional diagnostic methods， it is worth mentioning that ERG can detect the impaired function of cone cells in early HAR and it can be seen that ERG was used for early diagnosis of HAR in this patient.**\n\n【38】**Conclusion**\n\n【39】**In conclusion，this case of early HAR makes us pay more attention to the early clinical symptoms and signs of HAR. Early diagnosis and treatment， prevention and further prevention of HACE and HAPE may create a better prognosis for patients.**\n\n【40】**More importantly， timely detection and diagnosis of acute altitude illness can alert physicians to the possibility of the presence or occurrence of other more lethal conditions， such as HAPE and HACE.**\n\n【41】**Acknowledgm ent**\n\n【42】**Data collection was done by FR and WYN.

Patients with resolved HBV， rituximab-based regimen induces reactivation of hepatitis B more frequent than other chemotherapy regimens， and those patients have a higher rate of mortality compared to HBsAg-positive cohorts in the mean while. Monitoring serum ALT level monthly with HBV serology check-up mainly HBsAg (and/or serum HBV DNA) every 3 months in those patients undergoing rituximab-based chemotherapy are highly recommended.**\n\n【17】**Keywords： Hbv Reactivation；Resolved Hbv； Rituximab； Lymphoma**\n\n【18】**Introduction**\n\n【19】**The chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab has been used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) \\[1\\]. Recently， rituximab induced hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in both HBsAg-positive and HBsAg-negative patients were reported \\[2\\]. Among these studies， most rituximab therapy was concomitant with chemotherapy including steroid. Whether rituximab maintenance monotherapy could induce HBV reactivation and resulting in serious complications is unknown. Here we report one patient who has negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg-negative) and positive antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs-positive) prior to rituximab-containing chemotherapies develops HBV reactivation followed by fulminant hepatic failure when he was undergoing rituximab maintenance therapy.**\n\n【20】**Case Presentation**\n\n【21】**This 57-year-old man presented with progressive enlargement of bilateral neck lymph nodes and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia with small lymphocytic lymphoma was diagnosed by right neck lymph node biopsy. He received monthly R-CVP (rituximab， cyclophosphamide， vincristine， and prednisolone) for three courses followed by five courses monthly R-CHOP (rituximab， cyclophosphamide， doxorubicin， vincristine， and prednisolone) treatment between September 2009and February 2010. Serum HBsAg was negative and anti-HBs antibody was positive throughout this period.**\n\n【22】**Rituximab monotherapy was administered every twelve weeks as maintenance therapy from May 2010， andhe developed acute jaundice (serum total bilirubin level=8.1 mg/dL，normal upper**\n\n【23】**limit 1.2 mg/dL) and elevated aminotransferase levels (AST/ALT=1330/1590 U/L， normal upper limit <38/50 U/L) seventeen months later. HBsAg & HBeAg became positive and serum HBV DNA was greater than 2.12 X 10 IU/mL (above detection upper limit， real-time PCR， Taqman method， Roche Amplicor， US) in the meantime(Figure 1). Anti-HBV agents with entecavir 0.5 mg/day plus telbivudine 600 mg/day were administered immediately upon HBsAg positivity reporting； however， the liver enzymes increased gradually as well as jaundice and coagulopathy in the follow-up studies and he died of fulminant hepatic failure 20 days after commencinganti-HBV therapy.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**High prevalence of HBV reactivation and mortality rate of rituximab-based chemotherapy had been reported \\[3\\]， including patients with positive hepatitis B surfaceantigen (HBsAg)and positive antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs).Rituximab-based chemotherapy (R-CVP and R-CHOP) had been reported to increase the rate of HBV reactivation in Non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients with prior resolved HBV status (HBsAg negative and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen \\[anti-HBc\\] positive ±antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen \\[anti-HBs\\] positive)\\[4\\].**\n\n【26】**The rate of HBV reactivation in resolved HBVpatients would increase when anti-HBs titre <100 IU/mL or two lines of chemotherapies were administered \\[5，6\\]. Mutation in pre-core/basal core promoter and genotype non-A (especially genotype B， C，D) had been reported to be associated with HBV reactivation \\[7，8\\]， and rituximab plus steroid-containing regimen prone to induce more reactivation of HBV than other chemotherapy regimens \\[9\\].**\n\n【27】**Current HBV treatment guidelines recommend routine HBV serology test for high risk of HBV infection patients before the initiation of chemotherapy， and prophylactic anti-HBV agent should be administered to HBV carriers prior to starting chemotherapy and maintained for at least 3-6 months after cessation of chemotherapy\\[10\\].**\n\n【28】**HBsAg-negative patients (including occult and resolved HBV carriers) were relatively low risk for HBV reactivation when receiving conventional chemotherapy. Lok et al. \\[10\\] reported that HBV reactivation developed in only 2.7% (2 out of 72) of HBsAg-negative patients \\[11\\]. But Pei et al. \\[2\\] demonstrated a 22.1%(15 out of95) HBV reactivation in HBsAg-negative patients who undergoing rituximab-based therapies.**\n\n【29】**The clinical course and prognosis ofHBV reactivation were worse than those ofacute hepatitis； 27% HBV reactivation group developed fulminant hepatitis， compared with 7% in the acute hepatitis B group\\[12\\] and in patients with fulminant hepatitis， the HBV reactivation group had a higher rate of mortality than the acute hepatitis B group(100% vs.44%)\\[12\\].**\n\n【30】**According to recent AASLD practice guidelines， HBsAg and\\[IgG\\] anti-HBc test should be performed in patients who have high risk of HBV infection. Prophylactic antiviral therapy should be administered to hepatitis B carriers (regardless of baseline serum HBV DNA level) at the onset of cancer chemotherapy or a finite course of immunosuppressive therapy， and maintained for 6 months after cessation of chemo- or immunosuppressive therapies \\[10\\]. But there is no enough information regarding routine prophylaxis for patients who are HBsAg-negative but anti-HBc or anti-HBs-positive and in those with isolated anti-HBc-positive.**\n\n【31】**For HBsAg-negative patients， HBV reactivation happened not only in Non-Hodgkin lymphoma treatment but also in other cancers and autoimmune disease treatments. Mastsumoto et al. \\[13\\]reported that reactivation ofHBV in patients with resolved HBV after receiving adalimumab treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.**\n\n【32】**No standard management to prevent HBV reactivation has been established for HBsAg-negative patients seropositive for anti-HBc and/oranti-HBs.Accordingto Japanese guidelines， it is recommended that serum HBV DNA should be monitored monthly in anti-HBc or anti-HBs positive patients during and after chemotherapy for at least**\n\n【33】**1 year \\[14\\]. Because virus replication occurs one to two months before elevation of serum transaminases， prompt antiviral therapy without delay is suggested once HBV-DNA becomes detectable during follow up period.**\n\n【34】**In summary， patients with resolved HBV， rituximab plus steroid-containing regimen induces reactivation of hepatitis B more frequent than other chemotherapy regimens， and those patients have a higher rate of mortality compared to other cohorts in the meanwhile. Monitoring serum ALT level monthly with HBV serology check-up mainly HBsAg (and/or serum HBV DNA) every 3 months in resolved HBV patients undergoing rituximab-based chemotherapy are highly recommended.**\n\n【35】**References**\n\n【36】1\\.

Bacillus cereushas found notoriety as a cause of gastroenteritis， but bone infections involving this bacterium are very rare \\[3\\]. We report a case of B. cereus osteomyelitis in an otherwise healthy young girl with no identifiable risk factors， the first of its kind in the literature to our knowledge.**\n\n【11】**Case Presentation**\n\n【12】**A healthy， five-year-old Caucasian female with no significant past medical history was seen in the pediatric orthopedic clinic with an 8 week history of left sided gait abnormality. She refused to heel weight-bear and had no clear history oftrauma，insect bites， superficial abrasions or penetrating injuryto her left foot. There was no history of fever or systemic features of infection， and no history of immunodeficiency. She had no urinary， chest， ENT (including dental) or skin evidence of infection. Her hindfoot was swollen， and was tender to palpate over the calcaneus.**\n\n【13】**Several areas of lucency and sclerosis within the calcaneus were seen on radiographs. She was admitted for further investigations. Hematological tests revealed a CRP of <3， ESR 8， and WCC of10.6×10. Blood cultures showed no growth.**\n\n【14】**An MRI was performed the following day which showed increased signal within the calcaneus， talus and cuboid bones， consistent with multifocal osteomyelitis (Figure 1).**\n\n【15】**A calcaneal biopsy under general anesthesia was performed. Alateral approach was undertaken to access the calcaneus. Nofrank pus was seen， but the bone was friable and dark， altered interosseous blood was encountered. Multiple， non-cross-contaminated fresh tissue samples of bone fragments， tissue swabs and blood aspirate were sent to the lab for culture.**\n\n【16】**Microbiological culture revealed growth of Bacillus cereus in 4/4 samples， and StaphylocoCCUS hominus in 2/4 samples. Histology revealed trabecular bone with absent normal marrow， having been replaced by fibrous tissue， foamy histiocytes， and lymphocytes， consistent with chronic osteomyelitis.**\n\n【17】**Following discussion with our infectious disease physicians， intravenous Vancomycin was initiated. Following initial administration in hospital， it was continued in the community for a total of 6 weeks， during which she was kept in a non-weight-bearing below knee cast. Vancomycin was chosen to provide anti-staphylococcal cover in addition to B. cereus， although it was less clear that this was a pathogenic organism in this patient's case. The duration was chosen due to the poor vascular supply to the calcaneus， and the poorer efficacy of vancomycin compared with beta lactam antibiotics.**\n\n【18】**A follow up MRI was obtained to confirm resolution of infection， four weeks after cessation of Vancomycin. This was consistent with resolving osteomyelitis， with reduced signal intensity in the hind foot and mid foot.**\n\n【19】**Weight bearing commenced after 6 weeks in cast. By 3 months she was running and jumping normally， without any symptoms of pain or disability. At 6 months post biopsy she continued to be symptom free with normal radiographs and was discharged from routine clinic follow-up.**\n\n【20】**Discussion**\n\n【21】**Bacillus cereus is a Gram-positive aerobic or facultatively anaerobic， spore-forming， motile，rod-shaped bacterium \\[4\\]. Its environmental reservoir includes soil， marine and fresh water， and the**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： MRI.**\n\n【23】**intestinal tracts of invertebrates \\[5\\]. It is also one of the most common bacteria cultured from the drug associated paraphernalia of heroin addicts \\[6\\]. Having a spore form allows B. cereus to survive standard food cooking processes in a dormant state. Once in an active state， it produces a number of tissue destructive exo-enzymes， including an emesis-inducing toxin \\[7\\]. It is the emesis effect of B. cereus which gives it most notoriety， causing fried rice syndrome' following the consumption of cooked rice stored at room temperature after its initial preparation.**\n\n【24】**B. cereus is often regarded as an insignificant contaminant in positive clinical specimens. However， it is recognized to cause a multitude of pathologies， including fulminant sepsis， cutaneous infections，anthrax-like progressive pneumonia， severe eye infections， and meningitis \\[2\\]， as well as osteomyelitis.**\n\n【25】**While uncommon， osteomyelitis due to B. cereus is certainly recognized， though less than 10 cases have been described in the literature \\[3\\]. All of these cases were associated with surgical or accidental trauma， IV drug use， pre-existing infection or sickle cell disease. Only two cases have been reported in children - an 11-year-old boy with a depressed skull fracture and B. cereus osteomyelitis of the bone fragment \\[8\\]， and a 13-year-old girl with distal femoral osteomvelitis due to S. aureus and subsequent superimposed infection with B. cereus \\[3\\]. To our knowledge， this case represents the only case of B. cereus osteomyelitis in a child without any identifiable risk factors or history of inoculation injury， with confirmed deep infection. The patient had no other site of infection， and no definite trauma. The difficulties of history taking in a young child were illustrated in this case given the delay from symptom onset to presentation； no history of significant antecedent trauma could be recounted from the child or parents. Of note the patient was a very active child with a new trampoline； minor trauma may have had an association with this case but was below the sensitivity of the history taking to detect.**\n\n【26】**While microbiology contamination with B. cereus is common， we are confident our case represents a true causative effect as it was recovered from all four tissue samples， whereas S. hominis was only seen in two ofthese. Furthermore，there was a clinical and radiological resolution of infection following appropriate antibiotic treatment.**\n\n【27】**Osteomyelitis due to B. cereus has previously been successfully treated with gentamicin， cloxacillin， clindamycin， penicillin and vancomycin； antibiotic optionstypically revolveearoundthe susceptibility profile of the isolated strain and the antibiotic resistance is variable. One study of 54 strains of B. cereus concluded that vancomycin may be the drug of choice for invasive infection \\[9\\].**\n\n【28】**Incconclusion， while an11iincommon cailseofpediatric osteomyelitis， B. cereus should be considered in the differential diagnosis. This is particularly relevant in cases in which no response is demonstrated with traditional empiric antibiotics. Because there are no specific features to the clinical presentation or imaging， this case highlights the importance of adequate microbiological sampling prior to commencement of antibiotics.**\n\n【29】**References**\n\n【30】1\\.

In the spinal canal， the most common location is thoracic， intramedullary site. Our case is significant because it was located in the thoracic spine extending extradurally into the thoracic cavity， first reported in the literature.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation： We report a 13-year old female admitted with paraplegia and urinary retention. Sensations were lost below D8 level. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an irregular enhancing lesion in extradural location from D4-D9 vertebra with intrathoracic extension on right side. Laminectomy (D5-D9)and right rib resection (rib7 and8) was done. Subtotal excision ofthethoracic mass was achieved.D5，6-D9，10 right transpedicular fixation was done. Adjuvant radiotherapy was advised. After 8 months of follow up， the patient power in both lower limbs was grade 2.**\n\n【18】**Conclusion： Ganglioneuroblastoma in children and young adults should be included in the differential diagnosis of thoracic cord tumors.

They lie between benign gangliogliomas and frankly malignant neuroblastoma with respect to their malignant potential \\[1\\]. Primary occurrence of the tumor in spinal cord is rare \\[2，3\\]. We report a case of thoracic extradural ganglioneuroblastoma with intra thoracic extension and discuss its management.**\n\n【22】**Case Report**\n\n【23】**A 13-year old female was admitted with a history of mild upper back pain with burning pain in both the lower limbs for 3 months. She started developing weakness in both the lower limbs and20 days prior to admission to our hospital； she was paraplegic with grade 0 power in both the lower limbs. Simultaneously， she was catheterized for urinary retention. Muscles were grossly hypertonic with exaggerated jerks and clonus. All modalities of sensations were lost below D8level.**\n\n【24】**T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed an irregular hypo intense lesion in extradural location from D4-D9 vertebra with intrathoracic extension on right side. On T2-weighted images the lesion was intense relative to normal cord. After contrast administration， there was strong enhancement (Figure 1 and 2).**\n\n【25】**Operative： Laminectomy (D5-D9) and right rib resection (rib 7 and 8) was done. On extracavitary approach tumor was extradural， firm， moderately vascular， compressing the spinal cord and extending through the neural foramina into the thoracic cavity. Also collected hematoma inside the mass was aspirated. Subtotal excision of the thoracic mass was achieved. D5，6-D9，10 right transpedicular fixation was done (Figure 3).**\n\n【26】**Hematoxylin-eosin stained sections showed dural tissue with adherent tumor with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis and a small round morphology and focal neurofibrillary rosette’s. Foci of calcification were identified (Figure 4A). Other areas show sheets of ganglion cells on a fibrillary background (Figure 4B). Immunochemistry revealed a negative staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein， whereas NSE immunoreactivity was positive in most of the cells and Ki-67 positive in 60%.**\n\n| **No.**  | **Study**  | **Age/sex**  | **Diagnosis**  | **Treatment**  | **Outcome**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **1**  | **Patnaik et al. \\[1\\]**  | **25 years/male**  | **T2 Extraduralmass**  | **Excision.

Adjuvant radiotherapy was advised. After 8 months of follow up， the patient'power in both lower limbs was grade 2.\n\n【32】**Discussion**\n\n【33】**Cerebral ganglioneuroblastoma is a term used for tumors which histological consist of undifferentiated small round cells in all stages of neuronal differentiation \\[4，5\\]. These are grouped as Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors (PNETs)**\n\n【34】**al Peripheral or pPNET-those that arise from the sympathetic nervous system**\n\n【35】**b) Central or cPNETs- those that arise within the CNS \\[6\\].**\n\n【36】**Three types of embryonal tumors of the CNS have been distinguishedby theWorld Health Organizationn(WHO)(2007)-medulloblastomas， the PNETs， and the atypical rhabdoid/teratoidtumors. All threee types histological correspond1to malignant grade 4 tumors. The PNETs include the (ICD-O code9490/3)， medulloepithelioma and ependymoblastoma \\[4，6\\].

Other areas show sheets of ganglion cells on a fibrillary background \\[H & E； 400 X\\].**\n\n【39】**classified as both neuronal and embryonal tumors by WHO， are now classified only as embryonal tumors \\[7\\]. These tumors are usually found in the cerebrum， cerebellum， and suprasellar region. The other common location is posterior mediastinum and retroperitoneum. Spine is very rare site for their occurrence. In the spinal canal， the most common location is thoracic，intramedullary site \\[1\\].**\n\n【40】**Our case is significant because it was located in the thoracic spine extending extradurally into the thoracic cavity， first reported such case in the literature. Other reported cases were localized to the spinal compartment only (Table 1).**\n\n【41】**Probably the mass eroded the neural foramina and entered the thoracic cavity as was seen intra-operatively.**\n\n【42】**Ganglioneuroblastoma present from 4 weeks to 20 years. Clinical symptoms are related to the site of origin. In our case， we present a patient with compressive myelopathy at D4-D9level.**\n\n【43】**All patients with confirmed diagnosis of ganglioneuroblastoma should receive radio chemotherapy. Radiotherapy should be given as adjuvant treatment even if there is complete excision in patients over 12 years of age. Prognosis remains unfavorable due to aggressive， malignant nature of the tumor with frequent recurrences as well as distant metastases \\[1\\]. There was only one reported case of primary**\n\n【44】**ganglioneuroblastoma in an extradural location in the literature\\[1\\]. Our patient had a history of very short duration indicating the aggressive and malignant nature of the tumor. There was no primary lesion either in the brain or retroperitoneum. Ganglioneuroblastoma should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of extradural thoracic tumors in a young adult.**\n\n【45】**Conclusion**\n\n【46】**Ganglioneuroblastoma in children and young adults should be included in the differential diagnosis of thoracic cord tumors. Definitivediagnosis depends o1 post-operative histological examination. Curative treatment should be a complete resection of the tumor.

We present a large epiphrenic diverticulum with clinical andpathological features ofa true diverticulum in apatient with achalasia， which was misdiagnosed as a hiatal hernia.**\n\n【15】**Clinical Sum mary**\n\n【16】**A 67-year-old female who had undergone a transabdominal Heller myotomy for achalasia in1973 presented with a 2-year history of progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids， regurgitation， cough， pneumonia and weight loss of 10 lbs. Chest Computed Tomography (CT) without oral contrast at an outside hospital showed a 10 cm pouch filled with debris above the lefthemidiaphragm， diagnosed as a paraesophageal hiatal hernia. The patient was treated with proton pump inhibitors without response. She was then referred by a pulmonologist to thoracic surgery for respiratory symptoms attributed to aspiration caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease and a hiatal hernia.**\n\n【17】**The videoesophagram at our center showed a dilated esophagus with absence of peristaltic contractions. The distal esophagus was angulated and was connected to a 10 cm pouch in the left hemithorax. The narrowing in the distal esophagus above the pouch resembled the gastroesophageal junction. The pouch was round and filled with debris. The stomach was decompressed and was entirely located in the abdomen. The pouch in the chest mimicked a large paraesophageal hiatal hernia as shown in Figure 1. CT scan with oral contrast showed a pouch filled with debris above the left hemidiaphragm， shown in Figure 2A，2B. Upper endoscopy revealed that the distal esophagus had transformed into a large， round pouch filled with copious fermented food， shown in Figure2C. A repeat endoscopy after 3 days of clear liquid diet， under general anesthesia to protect from aspiration， revealed a large pouch and no evidence ofhiatal hernia， shown in Figure 2D. There were no dual lumens， one into the diverticulum and one into the stomach， as are usually seen in a false/pulsion diverticulum. Biopsies of the cavity showed squamous mucosa. A motility catheter placed under endoscopic guidance showed absence of esophageal contractions and failure of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter consistent with achalasia. Because of the history of prior Heller myotomy via a midline laparotomy and potential adhesions， and the size of the diverticulum， the procedure was planned as a thoracotomy， diverticulectomy and possible partial fundoplication.**\n\n【18】**A left posterolateral thoracotomy in the 7h intercostal space revealed a distended diverticulum with retained contents， shown in Figure 3A. A nasogastric tube was passed for decompression. There were dense adhesions between the diverticulum and the pericardium， left lower lobe， aorta and diaphragm which were divided. The diverticulum was a large pouch in continuation with the distal esophagus and seemed to contain all esophageal lavers. There were dense adhesions between the esophagus and aorta which continued beyond the gastroesophageal junction possibly as the result of prior myotomy， but there was no visible plane of myotomy in the chest. The adhesions were divided and a completion Heller myotomy was performed distal to the diverticulum， extending beyond the gastroesophageal junction. The diverticulectomy was performed over a 48 French bougie using an endo GIA stapler and the staple line was imbricated with interrupted stitches. As the result of adhesions at the level of gastroesophageal junction in the abdomen， no partial fundoplication was performed. Endoscopy showed an easy access into the stomach， no retained food in the esophagus and no evidence of leak. Pathology showed presence of all three layers， including mucosa， muscular layer an adventitia， which confirmed the presence of a true diverticulum in figures Figure 3B，3C.**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： The barium esophagram shows a misread gastroesophageal junction (arrowhead) above a true epiphrenic diverticulum (arrow).**\n\n【20】**Figure 2：A，B) Axial and coronal views of the CT scan showing a 10 cm pouch filled with debris. C) Initial upper endascopy showing a large pauch in the distal esophagus filled with faod and fluid with paor visibility and a connection with the stomach at the level of the gastroesophageal junction (arrow). D) Repeat endoscopy after 3 days of clear liquid diet and under general anesthesia shows a clearer view of the esophageal pouch with squamous mucosa， only one exit inferior to the pouch via the gastroesophageal junction(arrow) and no evidence of hiatal hernia.**\n\n【21】**Postoperative video esophagram showed obliteration of the pouch， an easy passage of contrast into the stomach and noleak. The patient was started on a clear liquid diet on postoperative day one and was discharged home on a full liquid diet for two weeks. She was seen in our clinic on postoperative day 21， doing well， tolerating PO intake and had gained 2 lbs. She was instructed to have soft diet and advance to regular diet as tolerated. She will be followed in three months and one year after surgery in our clinic.**\n\n【22】**Discussion**\n\n【23】**Epiphrenic diverticulaare false diverticuullaa composed1of esophageal mucosa， caused by a hypertensive or non-relaxing lower esophageal sphincter and associated motility disorders \\[1-3\\]. In contrast， true diverticula are composed of all esophageal layers and are usually associated with mediastinal inflammatory processes such as tuberculosis \\[4\\].**\n\n【24】Figure 3： A) Intraoperative view of a large epiphrenic diverticulum with adhesions to the left lower lobe. B) Resected 10 cm epiphrenic diverticulum with 5 mm thickness. The external surfaces were congested and indurated. The mucosa showed alobulated architecture with focal hemorrhagic stippling. C) Pathology slide shows a true diverticulum with adventitia (top arrow)， muscular layer (middle arrow)， and squamous mucosa (bottom arrow).\n\n【25】**Symptoms associated with an esophageal diverticulum could be similar to a hiatal hernia \\[2\\]. In our case， an unusual presentation of a true diverticulum as a roundpouch below the presumed gastroesophageal junction， resembling a hiatal hernia， made the diagnosis more complex. The anatomical location which was thought to be the gastroesophageal junction was probably caused by the combination of distal esophageal angulation and an outflow resistance created by the distended diverticulum filled with retained contents， creating a proximal a high-pressure zone. In parallel， the presence of the diverticulum， a marker of outflow resistance is probably the result of an incomplete myotomy and/or scar tissue at the level of gastroesophageal junction， creating a distal high-pressure zone. The presence of all three esophageal layers in the pathology specimen which proves the presence of a true diverticulum， confirms that the diverticulum did not consist of an out pouching of the mucosa usually seen in patients with epiphrenic diverticulum， but more likely because of gradual dilation of the distal esophagus with all its three layers， possibly as the result of an incomplete Heller myotomy. The rare presentation increases the diagnostic complexity， hence the reason for misdiagnosis as a paraesophageal hiatal hernia.**\n\n【26】**This case emphasizes the importance of a thorough assessment of patients with esophageal disease. Particularly a true diverticulum without evidence of an inflammatory process in the mediastinum， an unusual location of the presumed gastroesophageal junction， and the transformation of the distal esophagus into a large true diverticulum mandated a comprehensive evaluation. The use of complementary diagnostic tools allowed correct diagnosis and treatment of a raretrue epiphrenic diverticulum， misdiagnosed as a hiatal hernia， which was treated via left thoracotomy， diverticulectomy and completion Heller myotomy with good outcome.**\n\n【27】**References**\n\n【28】1\\.

Clinical manifestations are immediate but less frequently it could lead to insidious lung damage， as De demonstrated by the presented case. We present a case of unsuspected FB aspiration， mimicking an infection vs. lung tumor. After left lower lobectomy， pathology revealed a foreign body (animal bone) at the open of lingular bronchus.**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Tracheobronchial Foreign Body (FB) aspiration is not uncommon， though the incidence in pediatric age is higher \\[1，2\\]. The clinical manifestations range from acute asphyxiation， when FB obstruct the main airway， whereas in more distal airway obstruction， it is more common signs of a recurrent infection with insidious lung damage. A delayed diagnosis is frequent in cases where FB aspiration is not overt， so it should be considered as one of the causes of persistent post-obstructive pneumonia 3-5.**\n\n【15】**Symptoms are usually nonspecific，so a highlevel ofclinical suspicionis needed， as its presentation mimics other respiratory tract pathologies \\[6\\]. The predisposing factors in adults are male sex， old age， CNS dysfunction， psychiatric illness， alcohol and/or sedative abuse， trauma intubation， dental procedure and pulmonary disease \\[7，8\\].**\n\n【16】**Because of the anatomical features of the bronchial tree， foreign body is commonly lodged in the right， especially in the right intermediate bronchus \\[9\\]. According to the literature， based in case series， it was reported that 50.1% of aspirated foreign bodies were in the right bronchial system，46.5% were in the left bronchial system， and 3.6% were in the trachea \\[10\\].**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**We present a case of delayed presentation and unsuspected FB aspiration in an adult where a lobectomy was performed. A 63 years-old caucasian man， former smoker， with past medical history of COPD， hypertension， dyslipidemia and acute myocardial infarction in 2005， without history of alcohol or sedatives abuse. He presented in the Outpatient Clinic of Pneumology in January 2018 with complaints of weight loss， since 9 months before， and cough-syncope episodes following vigorous bouts of cough since 6 months before， with no fever or chest pain. He also reported hemoptysis since2 months before. He denied history of aspiration. Pulmonary auscultation revealed crackles in the left hemithorax. On investigation， chest- RX showed an opacification of the middle left hemithorax and chest-CT revealed a lingular consolidation with atelectasis (Figure 1 a). It was performed a bronchoscopy， with evidence of a white and necrotic plaque in the left upper division bronchi with signs of obstruction and bronchiallumen reduction， as also signs of mucosal edema and infiltration(Figure 1b-1e). The patient kept the recurrent symptoms initially described along the next 6 months， and there was also a radiological impairment in sequential chest-CT scan， with a higher extension of the lingular consolidation. It was performed a PET scan， with signs of metabolic activity in lingular consolidation (SUV maximum of 8，4). Considering the insidious clinical evolution， the persistence of symptoms and radiological impairment， the suspect was infectious or malignant aetiology. The patient underwent a left upper lobectomy， where it was removed a foreign body-animal bone-located at the open oflingular bronchus (Figure 1 f). The histological result showed an inflammatory infiltrate surrounding a foreign body (chicken bone).**\n\n【19】**_cited._ This case demonstrates the potential diagnostic challenges of FB aspiration.

The disease process usually progresses quickly from diagnosis and often management consists primarily of palliative and hospice care. In this report， we discuss a case of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma in a patient presenting with a rapidly growing neck mass. This case demonstrates the quick and aggressive progression of this cancer. Currently， treatment for anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is limited and remission is rare. More research is needed in the future to improve treatment and prognosis ofthis devastating cancer.**\n\n【18】**Background**\n\n【19】**Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a rare but deadly form of thyroid cancer that carries a dismal prognosis. Although anaplastic thyroid carcinoma accounts for only 2% to 3% of all thyroid malignancies， median survival time is 5 months and less than 20% of patients survive past the first year after diagnosis \\[1，2\\]. Given the aggressiveness of the disease， all anaplastic thyroid cancers are automatically staged as stage IV \\[3\\]. From here， further staging is determined bythe degree of spread. A stage IVa is a malignancy confined to the thyroid gland itself while stage IVb is characterized by invasion to local lymph nodes， muscles， or tissue in close proximity to the thyroid gland \\[3\\]. Stage IVa and IVb tumors may be treated using a multimodal approach consisting of radiation， chemotherapy，and surgical excision \\[4\\]. Stage IVc tumors however have distant metastases and are considered terminal \\[3\\]. These patients may opt for palliative care or choose to pursue experimental treatment in clinical trials \\[4\\]. Anaplastic thyroid cancer's penchant for rapid invasion is the most significant reason why it is associated with such high rates of mortality. 90% of patients have adjacent tissue infiltration at the time of diagnosis and 20% to 50% of patients already have distant metastases at the time of detection \\[2\\]. Of those who seek care， 75% eventually develop distant metastases and the majority of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma patients are not candidates for surgical resection \\[5\\]. In many patients， careful airway monitoring is needed due to the potential for local tracheal impingement and a tracheostomy may be required to protect a patient’s airway for longer term treatment \\[6\\]. The following case highlights the rapid progression of a patient with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma admitted to the floor for airway management and pain control. Her hospital course highlights just how aggressive this malignancy progresses and the heartbreaking speed with which patients decline.**\n\n【20】**Objectives**\n\n【21】**Highlight the rapid progression of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma in an elderly patient.**\n\n【22】**Discuss the multimodal approach to treatment and relative poor prognosis for patients with metastatic disease.**\n\n【23】**Bring to light the need for aggressive airway management and pain control in patients with terminal disease.**\n\n【24】**Methods**\n\n【25】**A 63 year old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis， chronic obstructive pulmonary disease， and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department complaining of a 4 week history of worsening left anterior neck pain. On physical exam swelling was noted at this region and the patient's vitals showed a slightly elevated temperature and tachycardia with a heart rate of111. The patient's TSH was slightly low at 0.035， free T4 normal， T3 low， and her complete blood**\n\n【26】**count was significant for a leukocytosis of 29.5 and thrombocytosis of601. A CT scan of her neck showed a large heterogeneous left thyroid lobe mass concerning for a necrotic tumor vs. acute thyroiditis. The patient met sepsis criteria upon initial evaluation and was started on empiric antibiotics and IV fluids. Laryngoscopy in the emergency department was concerning for left vocal cord paralysis secondary to the mass but there was no airway compromise noted when the patient first presented. The patient was complaining of severe pain so an aggressive pain regimen was started and an ear， nose， and throat specialist was also consulted to assess whether the patient was a candidate for surgery.**\n\n【27】**Results**\n\n【28】**Shortlyafteradmission to the floor， abiopsy ofthethyroid mass was obtained via fine needle aspiration. The oncology team was consulted for possible malignancy management and although the patient’s white blood cell count improved with fluids and antibiotics， they noted that such a high leukocytosis at the time of initial presentation was a poor prognostic indicator for thyroid malignancy. Five days after the patient first presented， she began experiencing respiratory distress and a repeat CT now showed the mass had grown and was causing tracheal deviation. The patient was stepped up to the medical ICU and an emergent tracheostomy was performed. The results of the patient's thyroid biopsy came back positive for malignancy showing poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with anaplastic thyroid cancer. The tumor cells were positive for AE1/AE3 and negative for S100 and TTF1. Her pain medication regimen also required frequent up titration as the mass grew and quickly progressed from scheduled tylenol and toradol with occasional opiates for breakthrough pain， to a Dilaudid PCA with scheduled fentanyl patches.ENT， Oncology， and Radiation Oncology were all consulted and had extensive meetings with the patient and family regarding possible treatmen options. A PEG tube was also placed for enteral nutrition. After multidisciplinary discussions with the treatment team， the patient and her family came to a mutual decision to forego treatment and return home with hospice care. The patient's total hospitalization course from the time of first presentation to the day of discharge with hospice care was just 15 days. Because the patient opted to forego all surgical， radiation， and chemotherapy options further imaging to evaluate for metastases was not done.**\n\n【29】**Discussion**\n\n【30】**While rare， anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is one of the most deadly diseases in the world with only 12% of patients surviving past two years \\[1\\]. Factors that are believed to influence survival include age， size of tumor， invasion of disease at presentation， and gender\\[2，5\\]. As demonstrated in this case， anaplastic thyroid carcinoma usually presents with rapidly enlarging neck mass and often with increasing respiratory compromise \\[1，2，6\\]. The typical neck mass associated with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is low anterior painful， hard， and may be fixed to underlying structures \\[1，6\\]. Less frequently， anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is found incidentally in a thyroid nodule \\[5\\]. Patients may also present with compressive symptoms including vocal cord paralysis， hoarseness， cough， dyspnea， and dysphagia \\[1\\]. Regional node metastasis is common and often appreciable on physical exam \\[1，5\\]. Diagnosis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma can be confirmed with Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) of mass or lymph nodes in 90% of cases \\[2，4，5\\]. In cases where FNA results are equivocal， core or open biopsy should be performed\\[2，4\\]. It is crucial to distinguish anaplastic thyroid carcinoma from**\n\n【31】**lymphoma or medullary thyroid carcinoma， both conditions with much more favorable outcomes \\[2，5\\]. Immunohistochemistry is helpful in distinguishing anaplastic thyroid carcinoma from other diagnoses. Though there are multiple genes thought to play a role in the development of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma， DNA and RNA analyses are not required for diagnosis or treatment \\[4\\]. Management of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma should include gross tumor resection whenever possible； complete resection is associated with both prolonged disease-free survival and overall survival and quality of resection is a significant prognostic factor \\[1，2，6\\]. Primary surgical management should only be delayed by imminent threatening disease in other parts of the body， which could include brain or spine metastases \\[4\\]. Non-surgical modes of treatment can be valuable， especially when combined with surgical management. The majority of patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma either present with or develop distant metastases making systemic chemotherapy crucial to long term survival in many patients \\[5，7\\]. While most anaplastic thyroid carcinomas are largely radio resistant， palliative radiotherapy has been shown to be beneficial in some patients \\[4，5\\]. In many patients， including the one presented in this case， airway management is an immediate concern. It is recommended that tracheostomy is avoided except in cases of impending airway compromise. In cases where there is not an immediate concern for airway compromise， humidity， rest， and short-term corticosteroids are recommended for airway management \\[4\\]. Surgical debulking can also remove tumor blocking airway \\[1\\]. Because of the often rapid progression of disease， a conversation about goals of care and discussing palliative care among treatment options is important \\[4\\]. Palliative care and hospice teams can improve end-of-life care for patients with a diagnosis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma \\[1\\].**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**As discussed above， anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a rare yet devastating diagnosis. The patient discussed in this case demonstrated the rapid progression of disease that many with this diagnosis face. Currently， treatment options for anaplastic thyroid carcinoma are limited and the prognosis is catastrophic. Investigation into new therapies is necessary in the future to alter the outcomes in these patients. Attention should also be paid to palliative therapies to improve quality of life and pain management in patients with the rapidly progressing diagnosis. In this case report， we demonstrated a patient who was diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma after presenting with a rapidly enlarging painful anterior neck mass. After discussions with a multidisciplinary care team the patient and her family opted to forego treatment and she was discharged home with hospice care a mere 15 days after presentation to the hospital. Her case demonstrates the devastating speed at which anaplastic thyroid carcinoma can advance.**\n\n【34】**References**\n\n【35】1\\. Imaiem F， Kashyap S， Naing PT. Anaplastic thyroid cancer.

Psoriasis is a systemic disease. In recent years， the incidence of metabolic disorders has increased significantly. A large number of studies have shown that the increased prevalence of psoriasis combined with metabolic syndrome increases the risk of MI， especially in younger patients with more severe disease.**\n\n【17】**Case Report： A 32-year-old men initially came to our hospital with chest pain for 6 h. He was diagnosed with psoriasis 8 months ago. The patient show swelling and enlargement of the distal interphalangeal joints of his hands and feet and marked flexion deformity of these joints. Onychomycosis and scaly， silvery erythema with well-defined edges were also seen on his forearms， wrists，fingers， toes and legs. The patient was diagnosed acute non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction， Killip grade I； High blood pressure， Psoriasis. Emergency coronary angiography shows90% stenosis in the middle part of the right coronary artery. So， Stent implantation was performed in the right coronary artery.**\n\n【18】**Conclusion： This case reports the treatment of ayoung patient with psoriasis complicated withacute myocardial infarction， aiming to improve the understanding of complications， control metabolic disorders， and reduce the incidence of cardiovascular diseases.**\n\n【19】**Keywords： Psoriasis； Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)； Myocardial in farction； Inflammation**\n\n【20】**Introduction**\n\n【21】**Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by extensive scaly， erythema and itchy skin. Prevalence ranges from 0.09% to 11.4%， affecting men and women of all ages and ethnicities \\[1\\]. Psoriasis not only affects the skin， but is considered to be a systemic inflammatory disease that affects multiple systems \\[2\\]. Thus， psoriasis is similar to other systemic inflammatory diseases such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)， with clear data supporting its association with a high risk of cardiovascular disease \\[3-8\\]. Psoriasis leads to a dose-dependent risk of metabolic syndrome and its components (including obesity， dyslipidemia， insulin resistance， and hypertension) and is closely associated with cardiovascular events \\[9，10\\]. Interestingly， only a few cases of psoriasis associated with MI have been reported in the literature. In this case report， we describe a young male patient who presented with severe Psoriasis and acute myocardial infarction， aimed to advice actively managing metabolic syndrome and alert predictive examination and preventive treatment of coronary heart disease in patients with psoriasis.**\n\n【22】**Case Presentation**\n\n【23】**32-year-old men initially came to the emergency department of our hospital with chest pain for6 h. He developed chest pain located in the precardiac region， which was crushing and radiating to the back and back， when he finished his night shift at 6 a.m. He was diagnosed with psoriasis8 months ago， and was treated with long-term topical hydrocortisone cream， subcutaneous injection of thymopentide (1 mg twice a week)， narrow-spectrum ultraviolet (uv)， etc. The drug was discontinued in July due to a COVID-19 vaccine injection. Deny hypertension， hyperlipidemia， diabetes， etc.， no addiction to alcohol and tobacco. Denying a family history of genetic disease. Physical examination on admission： T 36.5°C， HR 77/min， BP 141/93 mmHg (1 mmHg= 0.133kPa)， BRTH 19/min， BMI 24.2. Clear mind， poor spirit， scattered red rash， accompanied by**\n\n【24】**Figure 1： These images of the patient show swelling and enlargement of the distal interphalangeal jaints of his hands and feet and marked flexion deformity of these joints.

The abdomen was soft， without tenderness， and the liver and spleen were not palpable. There was no edema in both lower limbs. Auxiliary inspection： After admission， emergency blood routine examination showed that red blood cells were 11.3 × 102/L \\[normal (4.0-10.0)×10'2/L\\]， hemoglobin was 141 g/L (normal 120 g/L to 160 g/L)， platelet was 363 ×10/L \\[normal (100-300)×10/L\\].Hematocrit 0.42(normal 0.40-0.54). Admitted 18-lead ECG showed sinus rhythm. Myocardial injury markers： Troponin I 4.09 ug/L (normal 0-0.030ug/L)， myoglobin 54.8 ug/L (normal 0-121.0 ug/L)， creatine kinase isoenzyme 31.5 ug/L (normal 0-3.7 ug/L). Admission diagnosis：Acute non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction， Killip grade I； High blood pressure. Psoriasis. After intravenous nitroglycerin administration， the patient’s chest pain persisted， and emergency Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) was planned. The patient had a CRUSADE bleeding risk score of8 (verylow risk) and a Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score of 72 (low risk). Before operation， he was given a loading dose of 300 mg aspirin enteric-coated tablets， 180 mgticagrelor tablets and 20 mgatorvastatin calcium tablets. Procedure： The right radial artery approach was used， and 3000 U of common heparin was injected intrathecally. Coronary angiography showed 90% stenosis in the middle section of the Right Coronary Artery (RCA)， TIMI flow grade 2 to 3， plaque in the rest of the vessels， and no meaningful stenosis (Figure 1A， 1B). The middle part of RCA was determined to be the culprit vessel， and ordinary heparin was added to 5，500 U during the operation. The JR 3.5 guide**\n\n【28】**catheter was sent to the right coronary artery orifice， and the Sion guide wire was successfully sent to the distal end of RCA through the stenosis， and the Pioneer 2.5 mm×20.0 mm balloon was sent to predilate the RCA stenosis segment. A Promus PREMER 4.0 mmx38 mm drug stent was implanted in the middle part of RCA， and the Quantum Maverick 4.0 mm x12 mm balloon stent was then dilated. Reexamination of angiography showed that the stent was well dilated with no residual local stenosis， and the distal TIMI blood flow was grade 3 (Figure 1C). At this time， the patient’s chest pain was relieved， heart rate and blood pressure were normal， and the operation was ended. After the operation， he returned to the CCU and reexamined the electrocardiogram showing sinus rhythm. The patient was given maintenance doses of aspirin enteric-coated tablets (100 mg， once daily)， ticagrelor capsules (90 mg， twice daily)， atorvastatin calcium tablets (20 mg， once daily)， and metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets (23.75 mg， once daily). The patient had no chest pain and his vital signs were stable. Total cholesterol 5.4 mmol/L (normal3.0 mmol/L to 5.7 mmol/L)， triglyceride 2.26 mmol/L (normal 0mmol/L to 1.7 mmol/L)， low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 3.83mmol/L (normal： Low-moderate cardiovascular risk ≤ 2.60 mmol/L， high risk ≤1.80 mmol/L). Glucose 6.9 mmol/L (normal 3.9 mmol/Lto6.0 mmol/L). Glycosylated hemoglobin 6.3% (normal 4.0% to 6.2%). High sensitivity C-reactive protein 13.4 mg/L (normal 0 mg/L to 8.0mg/L). ESR 16.0 mg/L (normal 0 mg/L to 10.0 mg/L). Coagulation function， liver and kidney function， electrolytes， immunofixation electrophoresis， light chain， ANCA were normal. On the second day after operation， echocardiography showed EF0.63， no abnormalities in cardiac structure， normal left ventricular diastolic function and**\n\n【29】**systolic function， mild mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. Please consult dermatology department. Biologics and topical hormone cream are recommended. During the follow-up after discharge， the patient did not have chest pain or chest tightness again， and the reexamination of electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm， and the echocardiogram showed no obvious abnormalities. One month after operation， the serum lipids showed TG 3.56mmol/L，TC 1.22 mmol/L and LDL-C 1.40 mmol/L. The general condition of the patient was good， with normal blood routine， liver function， renal function， coagulation function，CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n【31】**Compared with controls matched for age， sex， and CV risk factors， patients with severe psoriasis have an approximately 7-fold increased risk of MI and a 57% increased risk of CV death \\[4\\]. The mechanism behind these associations is unclear. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors： Hypertension， dyslipidemia， and diabetes. For patients with psoriasis， in addition to the increased prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors \\[11，12\\]， inflammation may be another reason for the high incidence of CV events \\[13\\]. Inflammatory cells， including Thl and Th17， release a variety of cytokines， including IFN-y and TNF-a \\[14，15\\]. Inflammation plays a crucial role in the initiation， progression and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques \\[16-19\\]. The patient was characterized by a sudden onset of chest pain for 6 h， which was located in the precardiac region and appeared to be pressing. The pain radiated to the back and continued to be unrelieved. Troponin I was positive on examination. She had a history of psoriasis for 8 months， without formal treatment， and had a scattered rash with desquamation on physical examination. She was also complicated with metabolic syndrome， including hypertension， hyperlipidemia， diabetes， and obesity. The patient was a young male， and acute myocardial infarction was considered to be associated with cardiovascular risk factors associated with severe psoriasis. Whether psoriasis is an independent risk factor for CAD， cardiovascular events and mortality remains controversial \\[20\\].A Danish registry of 46，000CT angiography examinations in 1，500 patients with psoriasis again showed that psoriasis was associated with the prevalence and extent of CT-revealed coronary artery calcification， but that the increased cardiovascular events and associated mortality were explained by traditional risk factors rather than psoriasis itself \\[4\\]. The relative risk of coronary artery disease associated with severe psoriasis is highest in relatively young patients \\[3\\]. Another multicenter cohort study of 46，022 patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in Denmark showed that although subsequent studies found a crude increased risk of cardiovascular events and death in patients with psoriasis， this was mainly explained by traditional cardiovascular risk factors \\[8\\]. A cross-sectional study by Charles N. Ellis showed that men with severe psoriasis had a greater volume of EAT-V (Epicardial Adipose Tissue)， which implies an increased risk of cardiovascular disease \\[21\\].**\n\n【32】**Conclusion**\n\n【33】**This patient is a young patient with severe psoriasis who has been shown to be at high risk for cardiovascular events. However， this patient did not receive regular psoriasis-related treatment， nor did he receive screening and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors to predict and prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular events. For psoriasis patients' serum c-reactive protein and proinflammatory cytokines released， including Interleukin (IL) - 17， interferon alpha and tumor necrosis factor levels of detection， and related auxiliary examination， including EAT-v， CTA， etc.， for predicting those people**\n\n【34】**in the risk of serious cardiovascular events for psoriasis patients have clinical evaluation value. Because elevated levels can identify patients who require the greatest attention to the primary preventive management of CVD (e.g.， the use of diet， exercise， and appropriate medications)，consider systemic therapy for psoriasis that may reduce coronary risk， or both. Although the data collected to date suggest that psoriasis is indeed associated with an increased risk of CAD，the extent of its effect on CVD and the extent of Coronary Artery Disease(CAD) remains unclear. Larger prospective studies are needed to determine whether anti-psoriasis drugs are effective in preventing coronary events in these patients.**\n\n【35】**Funding**\n\n【36】**This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81873470) and the Municipal Natural Science Foundation of Nantong (No.MSZ20088).**\n\n【37】**References**\n\n【38】**1\\.

Gait disturbance was added thereafter， and she became unable to walk without support. Her neurological examination showed limited abduction in her left eye and ataxic gait. Her routine blood tests did not reveal any pathology. Her brain MRI showed hydrocephalus as well as leptomenigeal thickening and contrast enhancement around the brainstem Figure 1. T2-weighted spinal MR images revealed a diffuse hyperintense area between C2 and C7 in the spinal cord，consistent with edema. Post-contrast images revealed diffuse leptomeningeal contrast enhancement across spinal cord and prominent contrast enhancement in central anterior median fissure Figure 1， 2. Diffusion-weighted images revealed slightly increased diffusion in the cervical spinal cord lesion Figure 1. T2-weighted images revealed millimetric hyperintense lesions inside the thecal sac at L1 and L3 levels， which showed nodular contrast enhancement in post-contrast images Figure 2. Sedimentation rate， CRP， vasculitis and tumor markers， Brucella， hepatitis markers， Treponema pallidum test and ACE level were normal. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) analysis showed a pressure of 40 cmH，O， increased protein (350 mg/dl)，low glucose level (60 mg/dl， concurrent blood glucose 110)， and no cells. CSF mycobacterium PCR， Brucella and Lyme antibody，paraneoplastic panel were normal. Thoracoabdominal CT and PET scans did not reveal any abnormality. A 1 gr/day pulse steroid therapy was administered for five days as well as topiramate and acetazolamide to reduce hydrocephalus. Her ataxia resolved， left eye which was in midline，began to have abduction. She was discharged with oral steroid but hospitalized again due to nausea， vomiting and decreased oral intake. Her consciousness worsened to confusion. She had repetitive generalized tonic-clonic seizures and bilateral 6h cranial nerve paralysis. She did not respond to pulse steroid and diuretic therapy. L1 lesion was removed by the neurosurgeon using laminectomy. Gram and ARB staining did not reveal any microorganism； there was no growth in cell culture. While her pathological assessment was pending， her consciousness deteriorated to lethargy and she died afterwards. Histopathological evaluation revealed a tumora structure consisting of uniform oligodendroglioma-like cells with round nuclei， transparent or**\n\n【14】**Figure 1： A/B： Hydrocephalus is seen on T2-weighted axial section and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted axial image.

Immunohistochemical staining showed diffuse， strong immunoreactivity with GFAP and S100. Ki-67 proliferation index was about 3%. Thus， the diagnosis of PDLG tumor was established. The biopsy specimen was too small to perform a molecular examination.**\n\n【17】**Discussion**\n\n【18】**Primary Diffuse Leptomeningeal Glioneuronal Tumor (DLGNT) is a rare tumor of the central nervous system that has been recently included to 2016 revision of WHO classification of central neryous system tumors in the category of neuronal and mixed glial-neuronal tumors. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the tumor usually reveals diffuse leptomeningeal contrast enhancement and hydrocephalus \\[1\\]. In addition to the above-mentioned conventional MRI findings， our case had diffuse edema affecting a long segment**\n\n【19】**in cervical spinal cord without an intrinsic mass lesion. Increased intracranial pressure due to communicating hydrocephalus is the major clinical finding in DLGNT \\[2\\]. MRI findings are important for diagnosis. Conventional MRI findings of DLGNT are leptomeningeal contrast enhancement especially in the basal cisterns and throughout the spinal cord， which can be confused with tuberculous and other types of meningitis， and accompanying hydrocephalus \\[3，4\\]. The only specific radiological finding described for this tumor is subpial cysts which can only be seen in some of the patients \\[5\\]. It is of interest that various spinal cord lesions are described in DLGNT tumor patients in the literature whereas brain lesions are somewhat the same limited number of lesions. Many radiological findings such as intramedullary predominantly cystic lesion without spinal leptomeningeal contrast enhancement， enhancing intramedullary lobulated mass， small enhancing intramedullarylesions， subpial cysts， and extramedullary nodular lesions were described in the spinal cord\\[5-7\\]. Our case showed diffuse leptomeningeal contrast enhancement which was most prominent in the anterior median fissure and two tiny enhancing extramedullary nodular lesions. In addition to these classical findings， the most striking finding in our case was long segment spinal cord edema exceeding two vertebral bodies although there was no intramedullary tumoral lesion. We suggest that the most appropriate mechanism for the formation of long segment T2-hyperintense lesion is that diffuse leptomeningeal involvement prevents venous return and edema occurs in the spinal cord as a result of increased capillary pressure. In diffuse leptomeningeal involvement， parenchymal infarcts can also be expected due to alteration of the arterial supply. In our patient， diffusion restriction was not observed in the cervical spinal cord in DWI.On the contrary， increased diffusion was observed， so acute and subacute infarctions were ruled out. Another possible mechanism is that DLGNT may have made a diffuse microinvasion into the spinal cord through the perivascular spaces which is difficult to detect with MRI. This could be demonstrated by postmortem pathological examination， but this was not possible in our case. Lesions can be observed in the brain and spinal cord as a result of paraneoplastic effect， however， in this case antibody-mediated damage in myelin and neuronal elements and associated clinical findings are expected. Our patient did not have transverse myelitis findings， which ruled out the aforementioned mechanism.**\n\n【20】**Conclusion**\n\n【21】**Our case showed that increased T2 signals can be seen in the spinal cord in DLGNT. Although MR images are suggestive of transverse myelitis， they might be misleading. As in our case， the absence of clinical findings of transverse myelitis in patients with myelitis findings on MRI and diffuse leptomeningeal contrast enhancement should suggest DLGNT.**\n\n【22】**References**\n\n【23】1\\.

In this study， the aim was to report a patient with intellectual disability and refractory focal epilepsy who participated in HD-tDCS intervention for his seizure control and assessing the quality of cognitive function variation. Five days LTM evaluation results show that there was a distinct focal epileptogenic lesion in the C4. We recorded EEG and used IVA+test in three steps； before the HD-tDCS sessions (10 sessions)， at the end of the last stimulation and one month after. Attention performance showed little improvement in scores with regard to the IVA+test. The EEG studies showed a short-term benefit in reducing the generalized epilepsy severity. However， this effect did not last up to a one-month evaluation. More studies needed to be done in this area.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： HD-tDCS； Intellectual disability； Focal epilepsy； Attention performance**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**The tDCS induces cortical plasticity non-invasively with the way of sub threshold neuronal membrane polarization with constant weak direct currents \\[1\\]. Anodal stimulation results in excitability enhancement， while cathodal tDCS decreases it. When tDCS is applied for a sufficient duration， cortical function could remain altered beyond the stimulation period \\[2\\]. In many ways， the effects resemble long-term depression. Consequently， directly targeting seizure foci with parameters of stimulation that induce long-term depression such as phenomena might reverse (or at least counteract) the hyperexcitable state in the focal epilepsy \\[3\\]. High-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) is a new non-invasive technique that improves current focality and intensity of stimulation\\[4\\]. In this article， the aim is to report a patient with intellectual disability and refractory epilepsy that participated in HD-tDCS intervention study for probability of his seizure control.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**Mr. MA is a 30-year-old left-handed male. His first seizure occurred when he was only 6months old without any provocation. The patient is the product ofa normal gestation and his early development was normal. The patient had learning disabilities and difficulty with concentration. There is no history of CNS infection or CNS trauma with loss of consciousness. There is no history of epilepsy in the family. He lives with his parents and at the moment he has no job and no history of tobacco， alcohol， or illicit drug use. The latest MRI showed a few nonspecific high signal areas in the subcortical white matter of both centrum semiovale. Moreover， left sided hippocampal malformation was reported. Current medications are Valproate 1，500 mg/d； Lamotrigine 300 mg/d；300 mg/d and Carbamazepine 1，200 mg/d. Five day LTM and sleep records demonstrated sharp and slow waves coming from the right central leads (C4，P4). These findings suggested that the patient suffered from a generalized epileptic disorder and a discrete epileptogenic focus which is most probably located in C4 region.**\n\n【19】**Procedure**\n\n【20】**Firstly， the process for the patient and his family was explained and their consents were gotten. The patient and his parents weretaught how to make epilepsy dairy. The baseline EEG was recorded. Then patient's attention elements were assessed by IVA+test. The stimulations started the next day with 4×1 electrode connected to a tDCS device (Activa dose II). Ag/AgCl ring electrodes were held in plastic casings that were filled with a conductive gel that embedded in a modular EEG recording cap. The center electrode (cathode) over C4 has been positioned based on the International 10/20**\n\n【21】**Table 1： IVA+Test findings**\n\n| **IVA+Test**  | **Before** **stimulation**  | **After last** **stimulation**  | **4th weeks afterlast stimulation**  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **visual focus attention** **quotient score**  | **19**  | **50**  |  |  |\n| **Visual Response Control**  |  | **23**  |  |  |\n| **Visual Attention**  |  | **4**  |  |  |\n| **Consistency Visual**  | **0**  | **66**  |  |  |\n| **stamina Visual**  | **81**  | **85**  |  |  |\n| **Vigilance visual**  |  | **0**  |  |  |\n| **Speed Visual**  | **64**  | **64**  |  |  |\n\n【23】**Table 2： EEG fndings.**\n\n| **EEG**  |  | **Step 1**  | **Step 2**  | **Step 3**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Generalized spike slow (s/hr)**  |  | **56**  | **40**  | **127**  |\n| **focal right central spike-slow (s/hr)**  |  | **17**  | **19**  | **14**  |\n\n【25】**EEG System， and the other on F4， P4， Cz and T4 (anode). During each session (10 day stimulation with 2 day off in between)，DC was gradually ramped up over a period of 15 seconds until it reached to 2.0 mA， which was delivered for 20 minutes \\[5\\]. After the last stimulation， neuropsychological tests and EEG were repeated. The patient was followed for a month after the last stimulation.**\n\n【26】**Outcomes**\n\n【27】**IA+test findings**\n\n【28】**This patient did not validly respond to auditory test stimuli of IVA+. Only the Primary Visual quotient scale scores could be validly interpreted (Table 1).**\n\n【29】**EEG findings**\n\n【30】**According to the patient’s EEGs， he had a reactive 8 HZ PDR and two types of epileptiform discharges； the frequent generalized slow spike-slow waves (2.5 Hz) maximum bifrontal and the focal sharp waves in the right hemisphere (Table 2).**\n\n【31】**After assessment of the three recordings， it was found that the focal epileptiform discharges had no significant changes. Although the generalized epileptiform discharges were reduced immediately after the stimulation sessions， they were increased after one month to more than twice the baseline rate.**\n\n【32】**After the stimulation the patient’s physical and neurological reexamination had no change. The patient did not suffer from any adverse reaction， like a headache， vomiting， paresthesia， mood change， aggression or insomnia (Table 3). As the findings reveal， the patient’s focal seizure frequency and duration increased during and after our stimulation totally. Albeit， there seemed to be a decline in the generalized seizure frequency and duration during the intervention， this effect was reversed immediately after the stimulations and backed to the baseline in the following weeks.**\n\n【33】**Discussion**\n\n【34】**The tDCS modifies the synaptic microenvironment， for example， by modifying synaptic strength NMDA receptor in a dependent way or altering GABAergic activity \\[6，7\\]. The impacts of tDCS may be similar to those observed in a Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)， as shown by a recent animal study that applied anodal motor cortex stimulation and showed a lasting increase in postsynaptic excitatory potentials \\[8\\]. Learning ability in people with intellectual disability is very low and thus neuronal connections and the ability to remain are**\n\n【35】**Table 3： Seizure frequency and severity.**\n\n|  | **Before** **stimulation**  | **During** **stimulation**  | **First weekAfter** **stimulation**  | **2nd to 4th** **weeks afterstimulation**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Number ot seizures/week**  | **1-3**  | **6**  | **5**  | **5**  |\n| **Generalized atonicseizure frequency/** **week**  | **1**  | **0.5**  | **3**  | **1**  |\n| **Focal right clonicseizure frequency/** **week**  | **2**  | **5.5**  | **2**  | **4**  |\n| **mean seizure duration**  | **1.7 min**  | **1.16min**  | **2.2 min**  | **2 min**  |\n\n【37】**limited. These characteristics are the result of the loss of nerve cells， reducing the number and quality of synaptic connections occurs， causing an inability to create LTP and LTD in this patients.**\n\n【38】**Regarding the patient， the baseline cognitive tests showed severe impairment ofcognitive function that intervention hadlow improved the scores with regard to the attention test. The EEG studies showed a short term benefit in reducing the generalized epilepsy severity(seizure frequency & epileptiform discharges). However， this effect did not last up to the one month evaluation. On the other hand， the focal seizure severity (seizure frequency， epileptiform discharges) was increased dramatically even if temporarily. There was no other significant adverse event with this intervention and the patient could tolerate it well and found it feasible.**\n\n【39】**These findings showed that tDCS may decrease the generalized epileptic activity during the stimulation period， although this effect reversed after the stimulation is withdrawn. There is a possibility of exacerbation of the focal epileptic activity during the stimulation sessions which is also temporary and reversible. It is noteworthy that the observed changes may be coincidental and due to natural clustering of the epileptic activity. This can be assessed by more frequent sampling of EEG during a certain period of time.**\n\n【40】**Conclusion**\n\n【41】**Can this method also be useful for people with intellectual disability?Dueto the consequences ofuncontrolled seizures refractory to medication in these patients， which leads to a weak performance in creating new connections to the cerebral cortex， for selection of patients for HD-tDCS， it is important to consider the quality of their performance on IQ tests. All the same， the lack of significant adverse events or deterioration of cognitive functions and decrease of generalized epileptic activities implies that this intervention did not convey serious harmful effects and in short-term， the patient may benefit from a mild temporary reduction in generalized epileptic discharges. As expected， dramatic changes like seizure reduction and cognitive performance improvement were not achieved with common stimulation methods and more studies needed to be done in this area.**\n\n【42】**References**\n\n【43】**1\\.

Transvers colon is attached to the upper abdomen from side to side and whole surface of the peritoneum is covered by omentum. Laparoscopic entry is tricky in this case. Abdominal entry is a prime concern for laparoscopic surgeons because at least 50% of major complications occur prior to commencement of the intended surgery hence； abdominal entry in laparoscopic surgery is still debated.The last word hasn’t said yet about the optimal way of laparoscopic entry because there are no adequate randomized clinical trials； very large numbers of patients would required in each arms and this looks impossible to be achieved. So， it is said that there is no superiority of any laparoscopic entry technique over another. We discuss the laparoscopic entry techniques especiallyin case of known or suspected periumbilical adhesions.**\n\n【18】**A 27-year-old G0 PO married women admitted to our infertility clinic for achieving pregnancy.

For further work-up， laparoscopy was performed. Due to midline incision and suspicion of periumbilical adhesions， open entry technique (Hasson method)for pneumoperitoneum was preferred. A transverse incision is made in the sub umbilical region and the upper skin flap is retracted with Allis forceps. The lower flap is retracted using a small right-angled retractor. Subcutaneous tissue is dissected till the lineaalba and the rectus sheath is**\n\n【19】**Figure 1： (A-C) Douglas pouch was abliterated， bilateral fimbrial ends were not seen， whole surface of the peritoneum is covered by omentum and the transvers colan was attached ta the upper abdamen fram side to side.**\n\n【20】**visualized. Stay sutures are taken on either side of the midline. Rectus sheath is incised in the midline along the line of lineaalba pointing upwards. A haemostat is stabbed into the peritoneum， holding the stays up. The give-way of the peritoneum can be felt as peritoneum is perforated and then the haemostat is opened to widen the opening. Finger is inserted to feel all around inside the abdominal cavity to feel anypossible adhesion. Then blunt trocar-cannula inserted for the first port after visualizing the intra-peritoneal viscera. No complications were occurred. After penuemoperitoneum was achieved，laparoscopy revealed that Douglas pouch was obliterated， bilateral fimbrial ends were not seen， whole surface of the peritoneum is covered by omentum and the transvers colon was attached to the upper abdomen from side to side (Figure 1A-C). The operation was ended without any intervention and considered to send the patient to the ART department. The patient was discharged at the same day.**\n\n【21】**Discussion**\n\n【22】**In our case if you had chosen Palmer’s point， you might have injured bowel because transverse colon was attached to the upper abdomen from side to side.**\n\n【23】**Safe abdominal entry in laparoscopic surgery is still debated. Abdominal access ofanylaparoscopic surgery carries a significant risk of bowel and vascular injuries. At least 50% of major complications occur prior to commencement of the intended surgery \\[1-3\\]. Thus， preventing the complications associated with initial abdominal entry is a prime concern for laparoscopic surgeons.**\n\n【24】**The umbilicus is least likely to have omentum or bowel adhesions， perhaps because it is usually spared at laparotomy by circumscribing the incision to one of its sides. Also because the peritoneum is dimpled upward in a cone-shaped configuration at the base of the umbilicus， it is less likely that omentum and intestine will become attached and adheres to its peritoneal surface\\[4\\].**\n\n【25】**Adhesions at the umbilical area are found in approximately 10%of all laparoscopies. In women with no previous abdominal surgery， umbilical adhesions are found in 0% to 0.68% oflaparoscopies.0% to15% in women with prior laparoscopic surgery， 20% to 28% in those who had previous laparotomy with horizontal suprapubic incision，50% to 60% in those who had previous laparotomy with longitudinal incision \\[5-8\\]. Current mostly used procedures are： open technique(Hasson method)， closed technique (Veress needle) and direct trocar entry without pre-existing pneumoperitoneum.**\n\n【26】**In patients known or suspected to have periumbilical adhesions， open entry technique (Hasson method) or alternative sites other than umbilicus for insertion may be chosen (Palmer’s point is the most preferred) \\[5，9-11\\].**\n\n【27】**Theleft upper quadrant or Palmer’s point was developed by Raoul**\n\n【28】**Palmer in 1974who advocated the insertion of the Veress needle at a range of 3 cm below the left subcostal in the midclavicular line \\[12\\].**\n\n【29】**Open entry technique (Hasson method)， which is first described in1971 by Hasson， is mainly used in high-risk patient populations such as patients with multiple abdominal surgeries， severe endometriosis， a history of pelvic inflamma- tory disease， or a prior tubo-ovarian abscess.Compared with other access methods， the Hasson technique is relatively time consuming and tends to cause a greater difficulty in maintaining a pneumoperitoneum due to gas leakage \\[5，13，14\\].**\n\n【30】**Dingfelder first describes direct trocar entry in 1978. Direct trocar entry is a one blind step instead of three when compared to Veress entry， faster than any other method， near exclusion of entry failure compared to Veress entry and above all， there is possibility of immediate recognition of intra-abdominal iatrogenic injuries \\[5，15\\].**\n\n【31】**The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada practice guideline recommends left upper quadrant (LUQ， Palmer’s) laparoscopic entry in patients with suspected or known periumbilical adhesions or history or presence of umbilical hernia， or after three-failed insufflation attempts at the umbilicus. The open entry technique may be utilized as an alternative to the Veress needle technique \\[5\\].**\n\n【32】**Also Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists say that the umbilicus may not be the most appropriate site for insertion following previous abdominal surgery. The most usual alternative site is the left upper quadrant， where adhesions rarely form， although even this may be inappropriate if there had been previous surgery in this area or splenomegaly. The Hasson method of open laparoscopic entry is an alternative to closed laparoscopy that avoids the use of sharp instruments after the initial skin incision \\[5，9\\].**\n\n【33】**In the regard of laparoscopic entry techniques， latest Cochrane review says there is insufficient evidence to recommendione laparoscopic entry technique over another. An open-entry technique is associated with a reduction in failed entry when compared to a closed-entry technique， with no evidence of a difference in the incidence of visceral or vascular injury. An advantage of direct trocar entry over Veress needle entry is noted for failed entry and vascular injury \\[16\\].**\n\n【34】**Conclusion**\n\n【35】**This is a dilemma whether to choose Palmer’s point entry or Hasson method entry in case of known or suspected periumbilical adhesions. We just want to emphasize or take into consideration that as in our case Palmer's point is not 100% safe like the other methods， as well. The surgeons all over the world should keep in mind this case. Although several articles have been written on the safest， quickest， and easiest method， the current literature fails to provide a fail-proof or risk-free method of entering the peritoneal cavity at laparoscopy.**\n\n【36】**The safety of these techniques depends more on skill， education， and a clear appreciation of the anatomy and physics of the abdominal wall than on the technique itself. It is important that surgeons should choose the entry technique they are familiar with and feel most comfortable with.**\n\n【37】**References**\n\n【38】1\\. S Krishna Kumar，P Tambe.

This patient suffered from a Hepar Lobatum Carcinomatosum (HL) or pseudocirrhosis which is an acquired non-cirrhotic major hepatic dysmorphism mostly observed during systemic treatments of liver metastatic breast carcinoma patients. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is the main mechanism of HL. The radiological aspect is well described in the literature unlike the metabolic aspect on PET-CT images as presented here with a confusing partial metabolic response.**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Hepar Lobatum (HL) is an acquired non-cirrhotic major hepatic dysmorphism. Initially described in hepatic tertiary syphilis \\[1，2\\]， HL remains rare and is currently mostly observed during systemic treatments of liver metastatic breast carcinoma patients， but also in other solid metastatic tumors \\[3-6\\]. Thus， HL is currently called HL carcinomatosum or pseudocirrhosis. HL cause clinical worsening despite systemic treatment ofthe cancer， with liver failure and portal hypertension \\[7，8\\] leading to rapid death. In this article， we will report the case of a young woman with triple-negative metastatic breast cancer who experience fatal HL carcinomatosum during second line of metastatic systemic treatment.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**A 49-year-old woman， without BRCA1/2 mutation， was diagnosed in January 2020 with a non-specific infiltrating breast carcinoma. Clinical staging was T3N1M0. Axillary involvement was cytologically confirmed. PET-CT showed no evidence of distant metastases. Biopsy histological report reveals a highly proliferative triple negative breast cancer (Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grade 3， Ki-67 proliferation index of 80%). Based on multidisciplinary meeting decision， this young patient was treated with sequential neoadjuvant chemotherapy： 4 cycles of dose-dense EC (epirubicine 90mg/m²and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m’ every two weeks) followed by 12 weekly paclitaxel (80mg/m²) from February 2020 to July 2020. Breast conserving surgery with lymph node dissection revealed pathological complete response both in the breast and the axilla. Adjuvant radiotherapyon the tumor bed and supraclavicular lymph node areas was performed from September to November2020. She was then one active surveillance with trimestral clinical and biological check-up. This patient experienced intense abdominal pain during her 2021 summer holiday abroad. When she came back， biological and radiological work-up revealed a potential hepatic relapse with visceral crisis. Cytolysis was 10 times Upper Normal Limits (UNL) and associated with cholestasis and increased bilirubin up to 36 umol/L. Multiples secondary lesions of both hepatic lobes associated with hypermetabolic retroperitoneal adenopathy， were seen on PET-CT without obvious biliary tract distension (Figure 1A). Biopsy of a suspected liver secondary lesion confirmed the relapse of the breast cancer with identical IHC characteristics (estrogen receptor 0%， progesterone receptor0%， HER2 IHC scores 1+). Patient was immediately hospitalized to start a first line of systemic treatment with carboplatin in monotherapy (AUC 5) given the visceral crisis. After 2 cycles， physical examination revealed massive ascites with mucocutaneous icterus. Biological liver function was worsening with a cytolysis 12 times UNL and a total bilirubin dosed at 62 umol/l. A second line of chemotherapy with 5-FUpc (continuous treatment at 300 mg/m² for 3 weeks， every 4 weeks)**\n\n【21】**Figure 1： Series of abdominal CT and metabolic images showingthe evolution of hepatic dysmorphism and the appearance of signs of portal hypertension. A) PET scanner of September 2021， B) PET scanner of December 2021， appearance of caudate lobe enlargement， heterogeneous liver parenchyma and ascites C) PET scanner of January 2022， major atrophy of the liver as a whole and particularly of the right liver， the area initially most affected by metastases.**\n\n【22】**was started in emergency - due to the deterioration of the general condition - and corticosteroids increased. After 2 months of 5FU-pc， patient experienced acute asthenia (ECOG-performance status2) and worsening of the ascites. Liver dysfunction improved with a decrease total bilirubin to 35 umol/L and a reduced cytolysis at 9times UNL. PET scanner was in favor of a partial metabolic response with a decrease in the heterogeneity of hepatic parenchyma uptake in particular in the right liver and almost completes radiologic and metabolic regression of the retroperitoneal adenopathy (Figure 1B). However， an increase in peritoneal effusion was observed. It was then decided to continue 5FUpc and add metronomic endoxan (50 mg/day) in order to improve efficacy. A month later (less than 6 months after diagnosis of metastatic disease)，the clinical situation deteriorates with a performance status of3，appearance declivity edema， increased abdominal ascites requiring weekly punctures. The ascitic liquid was analyzed： The total protein level was 13 g/L， which suggested transudative ascites due to the presence of portal hypertension， even if， cytology of the ascitic fluid also revealed carcinomatous cells compatible with a mammary origin. However， PET-CT found a complete morpho-metabolic response of liver metastasis comparedto the previous FDG PET and CT scan. CT sequences of PET-CT shows an apparent tumor regression of all liver metastases and progressively revealed a heterogeneous liver parenchyma with regional changes(segmental hypertrophy involving segment I and atrophy ofthe right lobe)， ascites and signs of portal hypertension (Figure 1C). After multidisciplinary discussion， it was concluded a Hepar Lobatum carcinomatosum. Additional work-up (liver MRI or biopsy) was not permitted due to the rapid patient s condition deterioration who died few days after the last PET-CT of liver failure with encephalopathy.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**Even if liver is a frequent site of metastasis development in breast cancer patients， carcinomatous cirrhosis remains rare. In this observation， the diagnosis of HLC was retained in view of the association of breast cancer with hepatic metastases under**\n\n【25】**chemotherapy， and rapid onset of hepatic dysmorphism， portal**\n\n【26】**hypertension and clinical deterioration. There was no history of alcohol abuse， metabolic syndrome or viral hepatitis. In retrospective cohorts， ascites was demonstrated in 68%， portal hypertension in11%， and splenomegaly in 8% of patients with HLC \\[9\\]. As in other case reports， the histological diagnosis is missing due to clinical deterioration of the patient， although the biopsy seems essential for such diagnosis \\[10-14\\]. Here， the diagnosis was initially difficult because of the discrepancy between a complete hepatic metabolic response and the appearance of hepatic dysmorphism with rapid deterioration of the clinical state. Histologically， the most frequently type of breast cancer associated to HLC is invasive ductal carcinoma and triple negative specificity \\[9\\]. The appearance corresponds to a Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS) \\[10-13\\]. Indeed， metastatic invasion of portal venules by tumor cells and tumor extension into the sinusoids with perivascular fibrosing desmoplastic reactions have been observed in other cases of HLC \\[15\\]. SOS could be responsible of heterogeneous liver perfusion with hepatic atrophy \\[16\\]. Anti-cancer treatments (alkyling agents \\[i.e.， carboplatin\\]， anti-metabolites \\[i.e.，5FU\\] have also been reported to be associated with SOS \\[17，18\\]. Objective imaging of major capsular retractions developed rapidly(less than 3 months)， in our case， as described in the literature \\[9，17\\]. Indeed， the most frequent radiological signs of HLC described are nodular hepatic contour (98%)， capsular retraction (83%)， caudate lobe enlargement (67%) and segmental or lobar volume loss (62%) \\[19\\]. In a retrospective analysis of 374 metastatic breast cancer patients， Oliai demonstrate that 55% of patients with liver metastasis will developed pseudocirrhosis CT signs and that 100% of patients with pseudocirrhosis had liver metastases， even if some of them seems occults at the initial diagnosis \\[9，17\\]. HLC is negative prognostic factor with an overall survival in all types of breast cancer of 69 months vs. 189 months in presence of liver metastasis without HLC evolution \\[9\\]. In the literature， HLC often occurs in heavily pretreated patients， which is not the case of our patient \\[9\\]. There is really limited data in theliterature regarding the associated metabolic response as described. The metabolic response described in this case， can potentially be explained by fibrous replacement of cancerous tissue. Sass et al. reported results regarding the role of PET-CT scan in the liver of a patient with autopsy evidence of diffuse infiltration by tumor cells. In their case of diffuse desmoplastic metastatic breast cancer simulating cirrhosis， PET-CT scans showed inhomogeneous uptake consistent with cirrhosis， but no focal areas of increased uptake suggestive of FDG-avid malignancy \\[15\\]. Moreover， there is no specific treatment described because of the rapid death apart from palliative treatments such as TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt) \\[20\\].**\n\n【27】**Conclusion**\n\n【28】**HL is rare but life-threatening evolution of the disease. It requires increased morphological monitoring of the liver parenchyma in patients with liver metastases from breast cancer. This case report illustrates the need to remain attentive to the clinical and radiological data despite a complete metabolic response on the PET scanner. Given the frequency of pseudocirrhotic lesions in patients with liver metastases and the dramatic prognosis， it is necessary to identify the first signs， to supplement with examinations such as biopsy and MRI and to quickly adapt the treatment.**\n\n【29】**References**\n\n【30】**Gastroenterol. 1980；73(1)：60-1.**\n\n【31】2\\.

Deep wound infection with pathogen isolation remains the main cause in 0.8% to 6% of cases \\[3\\]， while non-infected dehiscence without detection of pathogens occurs in 0.05% \\[4\\] of cases. The list of risk factors for this complication include diabetes mellitus， obesity， osteoporosis， Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)， heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV \\[4\\] and use of corticosteroids. Bilateral IMA harvesting in particular significantly impairs the sternal healing process due to reduced blood supply \\[5\\]. Patients with sternal dehiscence can suffer from pain and a clicking sensation， frequently on movement but often also at rest during inspiration. Sternal reconstruction with bony stabilization and a revascularization strategy with transposition of the greater omentum in addition to various muscle flap techniques is a promising approach. Evidence for this approach is poor， being largely based on rare case presentations \\[6，7\\]. We present the first case of a redo sternal fixation for a recurrent sternal dehiscence with stabilization of the sternum， bone grafting， omentoplasty and pectoralis muscle advancement.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**A 63-year-old patient presented with recurrent symptomatic sternal dehiscence after having undergone 4x CABG surgery utilizing both IMAs in June 2018 for severe coronary artery disease. Initial sternal reconstruction with internal fixation plates (SternaLock， Zimmer Biomet) was performed in July 2019 but symptoms reoccurred 4 to 6 months after the intervention.On examination the sternal scar was well healed but the sternum was remarkably unstable and painful on palpation， with audible clicking. The patient’s comorbidities include obesity with a BMI of 33.4kg/m²， asthma， fibromyalgia， rheumatoid arthritis and Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)； VATS lower lobectomy for pT3N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma， open cholecystectomy via midline laparotomy，**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： 3D-resconstruction of CT-scan images of recurrent steral dehiscence and loosened SternaLock@ plates and screws.

The patient was consented for a redo repair of recurrent sternal dehiscence with titanium STRATOSTM bars， omentoplasty and bilateral pectoralis major muscle flaps advancement and bone grafting. The sternum was exposed via the old sternotomy scar. The loose plates and screws were completely removed (Figure 2A). The upper half of the sternum was largely absent (Figure 2B) and so the defect was filled with autologous bone grafts from the xyphoid process and the sternal margins cut obliquelywith the sternal saw. An upper redo-midlinelaparotomywas performed and the omentum was first separated from adhesions from the previous laparotomy and the transverse colon. The omental flap was then harvested dividing the small gastric tributaries， dependent on the right gastroepiploic artery (Figure 3A).Intrathoracic transposition of the pedicled greater omentum was then performed through a window in the anterior portion of the diaphragm. The**\n\n【27】A B\n\n【28】**Figure 4： Mobilization of bilateral pectoralis major muscle (A) for bilateral pectoralis major muscle flap with fixation/connection of the muscles in the midline on top of the omentoplasty for full sternal coverage (B).**\n\n【29】**Figure 5： Post operative chest CT-scan 3D-reconstruction of position of the implanted STRATOSTM bars. A anterior view， B oblique anterior view.**\n\n【30】**omental flap was divided longitudinally， and the smaller portion was positioned into the sternal defect over bone grafts (Figure 3B). Following elimination of the defect， stabilization of the sternum was achieved by cross-linking of the second， third， fourth and fifth rib by STRATOSTM bars bridging the sternal bone (Figure 3C). The greater portion of the omental flap was positioned on top of the STRATOSTM bars and the diaphragmatic window was partially closed avoiding compression on the vascular pedicle. Bilateral pectoralis major muscle flaps were mobilized and advanced (Figure 4A) to cover the complete sternal area， securing them in the midline with running PDS sutures(Figure 4B). Wound closure was performed in layers with a pleural drain positioned in the right pleura due to an incidental opening， a second drain positioned on top of the muscle flap and a third drain used for subcutaneous tissues. The patient was extubated in theatres. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan was performed postoperatively after removal of the drains； this showed accurate positioning of the STRATOS bars (Figure 5). The postoperative course was complicated with an exacerbation of the patient’s ILD with acutely worsened pattern of diffuse alveolar damage， accelerating pulmonary fibrosis and a diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) was made. Reintubation and tracheostomy were required along with high dose intravenous corticosteroid treatment to control the ILD exacerbation. She required intravenous antibiotic treatment after radiological exclusion of pulmonary embolism and repeatedly negative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV2) infections to exclude Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonitis. The patient was weaned off ventilation and transferred back to her local hospital 22 days postoperatively. She was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on the 30h postoperative day with clinically stable sternal repair.**\n\n【31】**Discussion**\n\n【32】**The surgical1management of sternaldehiscence remains controversial and the level of evidence is low. In this 63-vear-old female patient， sternal dehiscence was initially diagnosed six months after CABG without evidence of in fection or proof of bacterialgrowth. We suspect a rare sterile dehiscence on the basis of her combined risk factors including obesity with BMI of 33.4 kg/m’， reduced sternal blood supply post bilateral IMA harvesting and corticosteroid medication for her ILD to be causative for the sternal dehiscence. Non-union after first reconstruction can be attributed to the same risk factors and poor bone quality responsible for implant loosening. Indication for complex sternal reconstruction is given especially in non-union after previous attempt of sternal re-osteosynthesis with common sternal reconstruction plates \\[8\\]. Simple re-wiring of sternal dehiscence carries the risk of damage to the grafts and other intrathoracic structures and is not generally recommended \\[7，9\\]. The repeat use of a well-established sternal osteosynthesis systems fixed to the sternal bone，e.g. the Titanium Sternal Fixation System (DePuy Synthes) or SternaLock@ (Zimmer Biomet)， may be problematic due to the poor sternal bone quality in this case which is crucial for achieving a good result. The STRATOSTM rib-to-rib fixation system was chosen for reconstruction instead. A fter its introduction in 2007， the main indications for STRATOSTM bars were established in rib fracture fixation \\[10\\]， reconstruction after chest wall resection \\[11\\] and in pectus excavatum repair \\[12\\]. STRATOS bar usage offers the advantage of indirect sternal stabilization without compromising the sternal area in comparison to sternal reconstruction plates placed directlyonto the sternum. Another advantage of the STRATOSTMbars is the possibility of permanent implantation which was considered favourable in our redo patient. Due to the bilateral IMA harvesting for bypass grafting in this case， a simple addition of a latissimus dorsi， pectoralis major or rectus abdominis muscle flap alone was considered insufficient and the greater omentum， a well vascularized fatty abdominal apron was therefore considered. The use of the greater omentum as a salvage flap in deep sternal wound infections is well described \\[13-15\\].The omentum's unique angiogenic and immunologicalproperties have showntopromote woundhealingeven in hostile recipient sites with prior radiation exposure and infection. Another favourable characteristic is its high lymphoedema absorptive capacity and amorphous structure， easily able to fill cavity defects. The harvesting of the omentum in our case had to be done through open approach and special care taken due to previous laparotomy with resultant adhesions between the abdominal structures and abdominal wall. Unlike in our case， omental flap harvesting may be performed laparoscopically， reducing the possibility of laparotomy related complications and side effects \\[16\\]. Supplemental pectoralis advancement muscle flaps were required to ensure coverage of the omentum and implanted material. Due to the rare occurrence of sternal non-union post cardiac surgery， prospective trials are not applicable. However， we strongly suggest that in cases where complex sternal redo-reconstruction are indicated， these patients are treated as aggressively as possible.**\n\n【33】**References**\n\n【34】1\\.

Local anesthesia and steroid infiltration were performed with ultrasound guidance or fluoroscopy guidance respectively around the marked nerve roots. We observed the time it took for the needle to reach the target nerve root during treatment. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were collected before operation and one， two and three months after operation.**\n\n【23】**Results： Needle placement takes 220.3±8.9 s in the ultrasound group， and it takes 445.8±27.2s in the fluoroscopy group. VAS scores and ODI (clinical improvement) were significantly decreased at each time point.**\n\n【24】**Conclusion： Selective nerve root injection under the guidance ofboth techniques showed significant clinical efficacy (VAS score and ODI decreased). Ultrasound guidance is a safe alternative that can greatly reduce the time it takes for the needle to reach the target nerve root. However， there is little difference in the effect between the two guidance methods. As far as clinical practicality is concerned， ultrasound is still superior to fluoroscopic guidance for its convenience and non-radiation.**\n\n【25】**Keywords： Disability assessment； Fluoroscopy； Ultrasound；Lumbar nerve root**\n\n【26】**Introduction**\n\n【27】**Low Back Pain (LBP) is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. It is highly prevalent and is associated with pain， functional impairment， long-term incapacity， work absenteeism and high utilization of healthcare \\[1，2\\]. Over the years， at the suggestion of “The Current Practice Guidelines for Chronic Pain Management\"， nerve root injection was used in the treatment of waist and leg pain and radioactive pain \\[3\\]. Good curative effects have been achieved \\[4\\]. It is a target-specific technique that aims to deliver a small amount of a high concentration of local anesthetic and steroid to the site of documented pathology \\[5\\]. Fluoroscopy (FL) interventions have been used preferentially in injection therapy. However， fluoroscopy has several disadvantages， including radiation exposure， high-cost equipment housed in specialized facilities， and the necessity for a radiologist's assistance \\[6\\]. In contrast， ultrasound (shorthand for US) involves no radiation exposure， relatively low cost and more widely available. However， due to its short development period， there are very few researches on ultrasound-guided injection therapy.**\n\n【28】**Therefore， the current study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound-guided nerve root steroid injection compared with fluoroscopically guided injections for patients with lower back pain and unilateral radiculopathy.**\n\n【29】**Methods**\n\n【30】**This study is a prospective comparative study. All the patients’privacy and data were maintained confidentially throughout the research process. No direct contact with the study population was included in this study， and all patient identifiers were removed from the data set on initial collection. Approval from the Institutional Review Board of The University Hospital， Macau University of Science and Technology was obtained， including a written informed consent. Between February 2017 to March 2019， 189 patients with unilateral lower lumbar radicular pain due to spinal canal stenosis or herniated disc were referred to our pain clinic. Diagnosis of unilateral lower lumbar radicular pain was based on the clinical pain profiles， physical examinations， and CT or MRI. The clinical pain profiles mean lancinating pain， which travel along the lower limb and spread in a band no more than 2 to 3 inches wide. The EMG test was used to rule out other diseases such as other peripheral neuropathy， progressive motor deficit or significant sensory deficit， and Cauda equina syndrome，and so on. Those 123 patients who met the following inclusion criteria were selected： Aged 18 or older， agree to receive ultrasound or fluoroscopy guided selective nerve root injection. Further inclusion criteria included patients who had experienced chronic radicular pain for at least 3 months and had failed to respond to anti-inflammatory medications， analgesics or physical therapy ofat least 4 weeks. Finally， 79 eligible patients were selected. Patients with sacroiliac joint or facet joint pain based on clinical or radiological evaluations， psychiatric disorders， bleeding disorders， infection signs， inflammatory diseases， or rheumatoid disorders were excluded in this study. Patients who have had previous lumbar surgery， progressive motor deficit or significant sensory deficit， Cauda equina syndrome were also excluded. We only permitted acetaminophen and Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) for the pain control. Patients were assigned according to a computerized randomization list to either an ultrasound-guided group or a fluoroscopy-guided lumbar selective nerve root injections group. All patients were placed in the prone position on a radiology table with a pillow under the hip， under appropriate monitoring with intravenous access and with sedation as required. All patients received lumbar selective nerve root injection either between L4 and L5 or at a higher level based on clinical and radiological manifestations. If the injection resulted in significant pain relief， the second and third injections were performed using the same technique as the first. All injections were performed by an investigator experienced in ultrasound and fluoroscopy techniques. Outcome evaluators and data analysts are not aware of the plan as patients and in vestigators do. All the injection procedures were performed in an operating room setting.**\n\n【31】**Ultrasound-guided technology**\n\n【32】**It was performed using the method described by Loizides et al.\\[7\\]. A needle (22 G) was inserted approximately 45 degrees into the skin using the in-plane technique. After confirming no inhalation， a mixture of 5 mL of 0.3% lidocaine and 7 mg betamethasone was injected.**\n\n【33】**Fluoroscopic localizing**\n\n【34】**Under the guidance of C-arm， front， back and side perspectives， the image intensifier is placed above the patient， which makes the X-ray project at an angle of about 45° to display the \"Scottish dog\"image. Rotating the C-shaped arm until the injected nerve root and the front of the upper articular process of the same vertebra (\"Scottish dog\"ear) are located at the midpoint of the posterior edge of the**\n\n【35】**upper endplate of the vertebra. The nerve root normally runs a few millimeters below the pedicle (\"Scottish dog\" eye) and 1 to 2 mm above the vertebral body， where is the puncture point. The puncture needle is slightly inserted into the outer side of the pedicle， until it reaches the vertebra. If pain is not inflicted in the nerve root， the puncture of the needle is adjusted a few millimeters outwards until the patient can sense the pain. Then inject 0.5 ml to 1.0 ml of contrast medium to confirm whether the needle tip is located in the nerve root sheath. The contrast medium should be injected slowlyinto the nerve root sheath. Both groups of patients noticed the time it took from the start of the procedure to the correct placement of the needle.**\n\n【36】**Criteria**\n\n【37】**Clinical efficacy： 1. Pain relief， mainly depends on VAS score(VAS for pain from 0 to 10， where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable)； 2. The ODI， a multipurpose questionnaire of 10 items used to assess functional health status and well-being of adults \\[8\\]. Each parameter is evaluated on a six-point scale (0-5). During pre-procedural evaluation ofevery patient， the ODI score was determined(baseline ODI) and again the ODI score was evaluated after the procedure， at the end of 15，2nd， 3r month. The point in each section that best describes the patient's problem was noted. The sum of these scores from 10 sections constituted the ‘point-total. This point-total' divided by ‘50'and multiplied by 100'= percent disability(ODI score). B. Compare the timeliness of the two groups of draping to correct placement of needle was noted. C. Safety (occurrence of adverse events). We checked for immediate adverse events such as vasovagal reaction， facial flushing， or severe back pain within a few minutes after the injection. Patients were monitored for 4 h and subsequently discharged with the advice to attend our pain clinic next week. In the pain clinic， they were followed up for 3 months. VAS scores and ODI values were noted at the end of 15，2nd，and 3 month. In both groups， patients received 2 consecutive injections 2 weeks apart. The second injection proceeded conditionally. If the initial injection resulted in significant symptom reduction (VAS ≥50%)，the second and the third injection will follow the first injection method. If no pain relief or pain deterioration was observed， the second or third injection was not considered and re-evaluation would repeat. If the patients experienced pain relief of <50% reduction in VAS， a second injection was scheduled.**\n\n【38】**Statistical methods**\n\n【39】**All data were entered into an excel sheet and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20 \\[IBM Corp. Released2011. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows， Version 20.0. Armonk， NY： IBM Corp.. The continuous data were expressed as mean ±standard deviation and were analyzed using independent samples t-test except for intragroup analysis which was analyzed using paired t-test. Categorical data were expressed as number of patients (n) and analyzed using Chi-square test.

Among the injection protocols that we could not complete，there were 30 cases of violation of the protocol due to acute disc herniation， osteoporotic fractures， and participation in other injections and in 14 cases due to surgery after giving up follow-up contact， data was lost. 90% of patients received three consecutive injections. The patient's basic physical condition and initial condition are not statistically different (Table 1).

But group to group comparison between Ultrasound guided group and the X-ray fluoroscopic guided group was not statistically significant (P<0.05， Table 2). Compared with the X-ray fluoroscopy group， the time when the puncture needle was placed in the target nerve root in the ultrasound-guided group was significantly reduced， and that in the U group (220.3±8.9s)< in the F group (445.8±27.2s)P<0.001， which was statistically significant. In addition， there was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of attempts and the length of needles， (P>0.05， Table3).**\n\n【46】**Discussion**\n\n【47】**Recently， ultrasound-guided nerve rootblocks andtransforaminal injections have been well established and procedural feasibility studies have been reported \\[6，7\\]. In the “Diagnosis and Treatment of Lumbar Disc Herniation Accompanied By Radiculopathy”(2013Edition)， NASS evidence-based clinical guide\"， a global professional authority of spine， clearly points out that in most cases， selective nerve root injection of glucocorticoid can relieve pain and reduce inflammation of compressed nerve roots and surrounding tissue. Some patients can achieve long-term pain control， which can be used as the first treatment (recommendation level B， evidence level2b) \\[8\\]. In view of the guidance of this guideline， we found that the success rate of single injection oflumbar nerve roots in the treatment**\n\n【48】**Table 3： Comparison of the time when the puncture needle reaches the target nerve root under fluorascopy guidance and ultrasound guidance.**\n\n| **Project/Group**  | **U group(n=41)**  | **Group F(n=38)**  | **P**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Duration of procedure (s)**  | **220.3±8.9**  | **445.8±27.2**  | **<0.001**  |\n| **Number of needle insertion attempts**  | **0(0-1)**  | **0(0-1)**  | **NS**  |\n| **Number of needle passes (cm)**  | **5(4-8)**  | **5(3-6)**  | **NS**  |\n\n【50】**of patients with unilateral chronic low back pain was more than 50%(based on preoperative and postoperative VAS scores). There were no related complications or death events in this process. It can be said that peri-radicular injection is a safe procedure， which can alleviate the radicular pain in a large number of patients. The value of this procedure can be further elucidated in the future through further study of longer-term follow-ups.**\n\n【51】**The results of our study showed that there was no significant difference in VAS evaluation between US guided group and FL guided group. This indicates that， in both approaches， the medication is able to reach the peri-radicular space. However， the long-term pain-relieving effect still needs further investigation. Ultrasound offers the advantages of bearing no radiation exposure， more widespread availability and the possibility of performance in most inpatient and outpatient settings \\[9\\]. Furthermore， at the target point， the rate of aberrant analgesia spread (Para foraminal， epidural， or intravascular) in the US-guided method was comparable to fluoroscopic-guided methods \\[10\\]. Other studies evaluated a combined US and fluoroscopy-guided method with a success rate of 90% to 95% and a very low rate of intravascular spread， which translated into a good clinical response with effective and fast decreases in pain \\[7\\]. Another study compared the results of two groups of patients undergoing either US guided (followed by CT confirmation of accuracy) or CT-guided blocks. The needle tip accuracy and pain relief efficacy in the US-guided group was comparable to the CT-guided group， while the formerwas superior in terms ofproceduraltime(nearlyhalf) and mean radiation doses \\[11\\]. One more study has also confirmed comparable results in terms of treatment outcome， while US-guided blocks were associated with shorter performance times. This is also consistent with our findings in this study； the performance time was significantly quicker with US than with FL. This may have occurred as a result of 2 reasons. Firstly， fluoroscopic imaging requires Anteroposterior(AP)， lateral， and oblique views for the appropriate placement of the needle， which is a critical step for safe needle placement and for the correct identification of the target lesion \\[12\\]. This can be time-consuming. Moreover， the procedure involved in intermittent FL requires an ample time. Lengthier performance times to allow for the injection of contrast were required. In contrast， US allowed for the visualization of the contours of the root of the SAP， which were immediately identifiable in short- or long-axis view and were less affected by the patient’s position \\[13\\]. Furthermore， the procedure was quicker because the injection was performed under real-time**\n\n【52】**Table 2： Camparisan of VAS and ODI scores of ultrasound-guided group and flucrascopy guided group after three months of fallow-up with thase befare treatment.**\n\n| **Project/Time**  |  | **VAS** **U group**  | **VAS** **F group**  | **P**  | **ODI** **U group**  | **ODI** **F group**  | **P**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Baseline**  |  | **6.61±1.22**  | **6.24±0.93**  | **\\>0.05**  | **61.73±6.86**  | **60.24±5.14**  | **\\>0.05**  |\n| **After**  | **1 month**  | **3.32±1.51**  | **3.05±1.02**  | **\\>0.05**  | **33.20±6.00**  | **34.73±6.08**  | **\\>0.05**  |\n| **After**  | **2 months**  | **2.88±0.62**  | **3.00±0.71**  | **\\>0.05**  | **34.56±4.03**  | **33.21±4.65**  | **\\>0.05**  |\n| **After**  | **3 months**  | **3.76±0.64**  | **3.14±0.88**  | **\\>0.05**  | **32.87±4.35**  | **32.10±5.89**  | **\\>0.05**  |\n| **P**  |  | **<0.05**  | **<0.05**  |  | **<0.05**  | **<0.05**  |  |\n| **U group： Ultrasound group； F group： Fluoroscopy group**  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【54】U group： Ultrasound group； F group： Fluoroscopy group\n\n【55】**US showing the needle. Therefore， we believe that ultrasound-guided selective nerve root injection therapy is more convenient， more time-saving and safer in clinical application in patients with chronic low back pain accompanied by unilateral neuralgia. Some adverse events have been reported in the literature， such as accidental intravascular injections， hematomas， dural punctures， and nerve damages. We did not encounter any adverse events， and further observations involving larger samples are helpful. Our study， however， has some major limitations. First， the study number is low. The minimal sample size hinders us from showing statistical differences for some factors including blockage level and type. Likewise， based on selections， our results cannot be generalized to other patient groups (obese patients， those with spine deformities including scoliosis， failed back surgery patients， etc.). The BMI of the patients included in this study was relatively low， and ultrasound may not have provided good images of these obese patients. Third， it was not checked by fluoroscopy guided whether the injectate was properly injected into the targeted area in ultrasound-guided or not. This way may have effects on the result. Finally， as all studies focusing on pain as the major outcome， confounding factors and sources of bias cannot easily be controlled and excluded (lack of objective measures， patients' psychology， occupation， and litigation components and demands).**\n\n【56】**Conclusion**\n\n【57】**Selective nerve root injection is effective in treating patients with chronic low back pain and unilateral radicular pain. Compared with fluoroscopy guided injections， ultrasound-guided did not show significant differences in pain reduction and improved functional outcomes. However， ultrasound-guided greatly reduced the overall surgical procedure time and avoided the associated radiation exposure risks. Therefore， ultrasound-guided selective nerve root injection is worthy of popularization in patients with chronic low back pain combined with unilateral radicular pain.**\n\n【58】**References**\n\n【59】**1\\.

Chest radiographs are usually abnormal demonstrating cervical or mediastinal emphysema， pneumothorax， or pleural fluid. Occasionally a foreign body may migrate into adjacent structures and in some caseslead to devastatingcomplicationslike aortoesophageal and aortopulmonary fistulas. This case is unusual as it exhibits an atypical case of chronic asymptomatic esophageal perforation presenting with foreign body migration inciting an insidious presentation.**\n\n【19】**Abbre viations**\n\n【20】**CT： Computer Tomography； cm： Centimeter**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**An 84-year-old man attended theemergency department witha three-dayhistoryofprogressively worsening shortness of breath and chest tightness. The triage nurse also reported cough， although the patient denied any cough. Over the past 1 month， he has been having right shoulder pain， which he attributes to sleeping on his right shoulder. The patient denies any recent falls or trauma； he also denies any recent fever， chills， abdominal pain， nausea， vomiting， diarrhea， and dysuria. There were no other symptoms or any recent weight loss. He is compliant with his medication. Upon arrival to the emergency department the patient was hypothermic tachycardic， tachypneic with a Temperature of 34.5°C， respiratory rate was 20 to 25/min and he had an oxygen saturation of 99%in room air， his abdominal examination showed mild tenderness to epigastrium.**\n\n【23】**Hismedicalhistory waspositive for coronaryartery disease status post stent 10/2019，hypertension and hyperlipidemia， heavy tobacco use and congestive heart failure. Differential diagnosis included but not limited to myocardial infarction， pneumonia，pancreatitis and COVID-19 and heart failure. electrocardiogram did not show any significant change， His complete blood count did not show leukocytosis，his hemoglobin was 13.3， and there were no significant electrolyte derangements， renal function， liver function tests and lipase were within normal for the patient， chest roentogenogram showed a 3 cm right mid lung mass， with right basilar pleural thickening and pleural calcification were also seen and cardiomegaly unchanged from previous images was noted (Figure 1). Computer tomography of the chest was ordered to further evaluate and showed prominent loculated right pleural effusion with fluid in the minor fissure as well and pleural calcification and possible mass(Figure 2 and 3). To further evaluate the mass an abdominal and pelvic computer tomography was ordered and confirmed presence of a right-sided effusion and 3 cm parenchymal mass， no evidence of pneumothorax or soft tissue emphysema， other organs were clear (Figures 4 and 5). He was started on antibiotics for possible complicated pneumonia with a plan for video assisted thoracoscopic surgery with decortication and washout with a pulmonary wedge biopsy. During the procedure there were thick fibrous adhesions surrounding the foreign body which when released and examined grossly was determined to be a chicken bone (Figure 5).**\n\n【24】**Lung wedge biopsy， pleural， lymph node and the foreign body were sent for pathology analysis. Results showed the foreign body to be consistent with a chicken bone， the lung showed signs consistent with chronic inflammation and consolidation， while pleura showed fibrous scarring. There was no evidence of malignancy. Empyema fluid did not show bacterial growth or evidence of malignant cells.**\n\n【25】**The patient recovered and a follow-up Water-soluble contrast esophagogram was performed prior discharge to exclude leak or fistula， the results were normal， and the patient was discharged**\n\n【26】**Figure 1： Chest X-ray showing pleural effusion， calcification (red arrow)and the area containing the chicken bone (circled).**\n\n【27】**Figure 4： CT scan showing the chicken bone as indicated by the black arrow.**\n\n【28】**Figure 2： Chest CT scan， showing pleural effusion， pleural calcification (red arrow)， and the area of the chicken bone (black arrow).**\n\n【29】**Figure 5： Picture of the extracted chicken bone， measuring 3 cm in length.**\n\n【30】**the gastrointestinal tract， sharp bodies such as chicken or fish bones， however can be associated with esophageal perforation \\[3，5-8\\].**\n\n【31】**The esophagus is more vulnerable to injury than the rest of the gastrointestinal tract due to its lack of serosal layer， and its relatively poor blood supply， both which contribute to the increase risk of perforation. The mechanism of perforation is thought to be a combination of inflammation and direct pressure necrosis. The most common sites of perforation are the three anatomic constrictions：The cricopharyngeus， the crossing of the left main stem bronchus or aortic arch， and the gastroesophageal junction \\[3\\]. Patients may be immediately symptomatic or present weeks after the esophageal perforation， few cases may be asymptomatic for longer \\[3\\].**\n\n【32】**home.**\n\n【33】**Discussion**\n\n【34】**Esophageal perforation is still a life-threatening condition with an overall mortality of approximately 22%. Literature review on esophageal perforation showed that foreign bodies were the cause of7% of the perforations， with fish and chicken bones being the most common \\[1，3\\]. Foreign body ingestion is more common in children and in high-risk groups of adults such as those with underlying esophageal disease， neurological pathology， prisoners， the mentally retarded， and those with psychiatric illnesses， and has also been reported with greater frequency in edentulous patients \\[3\\].**\n\n【35】**There are numerous causes of esophageal perforation with iatrogenic being the most common. This case presents one of the uncommon complications of foreign body ingestion \\[1-4\\]. We present a case of foreign body ingestion with migration sequel exhibiting no evidence of wall perforation， in which a 3 cm chicken bone led to asymptomatic esophageal perforation and migration into the pleural space.**\n\n【36】**Perforation of the esophagus due to an ingested foreign body is uncommon as a majority of ingested foreign bodies pass through**\n\n【37】**In our case， the patient could not remember ingesting a foreign body， he presented with a clinical picture showing a mixture of thoracic and abdominal symptoms. The initial chest roentgenogram showed a loculated right-sided pleural effusion and computer tomography showed presence of a hyper dense foreign body above the diaphragm and loculated right-sided fluid collection， there was nU**\n\n【38】**evidence of pneumothorax or soft tissue emphysema.**\n\n【39】**The diagnosis was confirmed upon removal ofa 3 cm chicken bone from the pleural cavity. The removed bone was surrounded by thick adhesions indicating the presentation was not acute in nature and the pleural fluid although purulent did not show microbial growth. The most common symptom of esophageal perforation is acute chest pain； other common symptoms include the development of pleural effusion， pneumothorax and emphysema \\[3\\]. We suspect the delayed presentation in our patient was due to the local containment of inflammation as evident by the extensive fibrosis surrounding the foreign body.**\n\n【40】**The gold standard for diagnosis if perforation is suspected initially is via water-soluble contrast swallow as this patient presented atypically with no obvious risk factors for perforation； it was performed after removing the foreign body and was normal. Rigid endoscopy can also provide clues on extra luminal migration such as the presence of a hematoma， edema， mucosal laceration， punctuate hemorrhage \\[3，5-7，9，10\\]. The use of the computed tomographic scan for unusual presentations is valuable to diagnose migration of foreign bodies as was described in our report \\[3，5-7，9，10\\].**\n\n【41】**Although this case did not show evidence of perforation， and patient showed clinical improvement after removal of the foreign body， the primary goal of treatment of an esophageal perforation should be that the defect be repaired as soon as possible， with the gold standard being Primary repair \\[10\\].**\n\n【42】**Migration of a foreign body to tissues outside the esophagus is rare especially when here is no evidence of perforation. Migration of esophageal foreign bodies has been most reported in the neck， this is thought to be due to the anatomic constriction of the cricopharyngeus， and due to the fact that these muscles are circular in arrangement， thus when contracted tend to push a foreign body outward increasing the chance of perforation. There are only a few published reports of foreign body migration： Migration to the lung\\[11，12\\]， the subcutaneous tissues of the neck \\[10\\] thyroid gland \\[13\\]， the inferior pulmonary ligament， and a major blood vessel \\[14\\]， and in the pericardium \\[15\\] posterior mediastinum \\[10，14\\].**\n\n【43】**Conclusion**\n\n【44】**The absence of a clear history of foreign body ingestion and the inability to identify an ingested foreign body on clinical examination， water-soluble contrast swallow or endoscopy does not rule out its presence. The persistence of symptoms and the presence of ominous signs should raise the suspicion of a migrating foreign body； migrated foreign bodies may remain undetected leading to incorrect diagnosis of disease. The reason for diagnostic delay in patients is due to neglecting the importance of detailing the remote history of**\n\n【45】**foreign body ingestion， absence of initial symptoms and the fact that patients may have multiple co-morbid conditions， which add to the confusion. Thus， we recommend having a high index of suspicion of esophageal perforation in patients presenting with atypical neck， chest or abdominal symptoms.**\n\n【46】**References**\n\n【47】1\\.

It usually occurs as a direct extension of infection from the mediastinal lymph nodes and usually involves the middle third of the oesophagus at the level of carina \\[2\\]. We report a case of pulmonary tuberculosis with extension to the middle third of the oesophagus from the right middle lobe as evidenced on gastroscopy，bronchoscopy and Computer Tomography (CT) scan.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**A 36-year old male presented with one-week history of dysphagia and odynophagia. He also gave a three-week history of dry cough without any fever， shortness of breath or night sweats. He immigrated to New Zealand four years ago from India. He was a non-smoker with no other significant background medical history.**\n\n【21】**On examination， there was no peripheral lymphadenopathy. Auscultation revealed normal vesicular breath sounds.**\n\n【22】**Investigations**\n\n【23】**Blood tests on admission showed normal full blood count， but a raised C-reactive protein (CRP) of 20 mg/L and normal liver function tests. He was HIV negative.**\n\n【24】**Gastroscopy showed a large 5 cm cratered oesophageal ulcer with an appearance of a fistula(Figure 1)， 25 cm from the incisors. Extensive biopsy sampling repeated twice showed focal ulceration with actively inflamed chronic granulation tissue. No Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) noted anda PCR did not detect Mycobacterium species. There was no dysplasia or malignancy. Induced sputum did not show AFB and PCR did not detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA.**\n\n【25】**A CT scan of his neck， thorax and abdomen showed a 40 mm ×29 mm×44 mm， peripherally enhancing soft tissue abnormality in the middle third of the oesophagus， with the mass broadly in contact with the carina (Figure 2). There was also sub carinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy. Bronchoscopy showed a lesion in the bronchus intermedius and in the right middle lobe (Figure**\n\n【26】**Figure 1： Oesophageal ulcer with appearance of fistula.**\n\n【27】**Figure 2： Computer Tomography (CT) showing mass in contact with carina.**\n\n【28】**3). Bronchial washings and endobronchial biopsy showed only non-necrotising granulomatous inflammatory cells without any AFB. However， bronchial aspirate culture isolated Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Gastrografin swallow showedno extravasation of contrast into the mediastinum and no evidence of fistula or communication with the bronchialtree.**\n\n【29】**This was a case of pulmonary tuberculosis with extension to the middle third of the oesophagus from the right middle lobe. He was started on Anti-Tuberculosis Therapy (ATT) and has ongoing follow up with Infectious Disease specialists.**\n\n【30】**Discussion**\n\n【31】**The global burden of tuberculosis remains high. Gastrointestinal tuberculosis is a rare condition， even in countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis \\[3\\]. Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract occurs through ingestion of infected sputum or haematogenous spread1from primary pulmonary tuberculosis5..Most casesof oesophageal tuberculosis are secondary to direct extension from adjacent structures. It can involve any segment of the oesophagus， but most often involves the middle third because of its proximity to the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes surrounding the bifurcation of the trachea. Oesophageal tuberculosis is almost always associated with mediastinal lymphadenopathy with or without a trachea-oesophageal fistula \\[4\\]. The symptoms usually depend on the degree and type of oesophageal involvement. Dysphagia is the most common presenting symptom， which occurs in about 90% of the cases and was present in our patient \\[5\\]. Other symptoms incude odynophagia， retrosternal chest pain， fever， weight loss and anorexia. Complications include bleeding， perforation， fistula formation， aspiration pneumonia， fatal haematemesis and oesophageal strictures \\[6，7\\]. The most common**\n\n【32】**Figure 3： Bronchoscopy showing lesion in the bronchus intermedius and in the right middle lobe.**\n\n【33】**macroscopic finding on gastroscopy is oesophageal ulcer. Other findings include hypertrophic growth as an oesophageal polyp， tumour like lesions， strictures and external compression. The differential diagnosis includes oesophageal carcinoma， crohn’s disease， syphilis and strictures due to ingestion of caustic material. Diagnosis is usually made by gastroscopywith cytological，histological， microbiological examination of tissue biopsy. The definitive test is to _recover Mycobacterium tuberculosis by culture._**\n\n【34】**Most of the patients respond well with ATT (Isoniazid， Rifampicin， Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol). Severe stenosis will often require repeated endoscopic dilatation. Surgery is usually reserved for complications such as tracheoesophageal， aorto-oesophageal fistulas and perforation.**\n\n【35】**Conclusion**\n\n【36】**Oesophageal tuberculosis though a rare condition should be considered in patients presenting with dysphagia， especially in high risk populations such as immunocompromised patients (co-existing nature of M. tuberculosis and HIV) and immigrants from high risk countries.**\n\n【37】**References**\n\n【38】**1\\.

Management of advanced clear cell variant of HCC is challenging with no established treatment guidelines. We report a case of advanced clear cell HCC in a 55-year-old male presenting with a large liver mass measuring 22 cm x 12 cm x 15 cm with tumor thrombi extending to Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) and the right atrium with acute tumor bleeding causing hemoperitoneum， required emergent embolization of hepatic artery. Immunostains show the tumor to be positive for HepPar1， focally positive for CEA (Carcino Embryonic Antigen)-p (canalicular pattern)， and focally and weakly positive for pan-cytokeratins， establishing the diagnosis ofprimary hepatocellular clear cell carcinoma.**\n\n【16】**Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET CT) demonstrated the liver mass with tumor thrombi and lung nodules consistent with metastasis. Tumor profiling showed combined positive score 5 for Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor determined by IHC 22C3 PharmDx test. He was started on combination immunotherapy with Nivolumab plus ipilimumab with an ongoing response after completion of four cycles followed by nivolumab every two weeks without any clinical symptoms and radiologically stable disease.**\n\n【17】**Introduction**\n\n【18】**Hepatocellular carcinoma is an aggressive tumor typically associated with chronic liver disease， most commonly related viral hepatitis B and C infection \\[1\\]. Other risk factors that have been associated with the development of HCC includes hereditary hemochromatosis， cirrhosis of any cause， environmental toxins， tobacco and alcohol abuse， nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Primary clear cell HCC is an uncommon variant of hepatocellular carcinoma， though previous studies reported favorable prognosis compared to non-clear cell HCC， there is no consensus on the management due to rarity of the disease \\[2\\]. We present a unique case of a patient with no prior history of the liver disease diagnosed with clear cell HCC with significant tumor burden in the liver， with the portal vein and left atrial tumor thrombus associated with massive intratumoral bleeding. Given no clear guidelines in the management of advanced clear cell HCC patient was treated with dual check point immunotherapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab.**\n\n【19】**Case Presentation**\n\n【20】**A 61-yr-old male patient with a history of atrial fibrillation， coronary artery disease self palpated a mass in the epigastric area. Labs revealed AST 100 u/L， ALT 143 u/L， albumin 4 g/dL， total bilirubin 1 g/dL. Serclogy for HBV， HCV non-reactive. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed a large 20cm x 17 cm x14 cm mass replacing the left lobe of liver extending into the segment VII of the right lobe associated with a filling defect extending to intrahepatic inferior vena cava and right atrium， most likely a tumor thrombus (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large 4.9 cm x2.7 cm mass in the right atrium as well as large mass extending through the IVC (Figure 2).**\n\n【21】**A CT guided biopsy of the liver mass revealed sheets of malignant cells containing abundant clear cytoplasm with a round to oval hyperchromatic nuclei. Immunochemical stains showed malignant cells to be positive for HepPar1， CEA-p (canalicular pattern)， pan-cytokeratin AE1/AE3**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： Large heterogeneous liver mass replacing the left lobe of liver.**\n\n【23】**Figure 2： Large right atrial tumor thrombus on transthoracic echocardiogram.**\n\n【24】**(weak and focal) (Figure 3). Malignant cells were negative for SOX10， Inhibin， PAX8， and RCC， consistent with HCC， clear cell variant. CT abdomen pelvis confirmed no additional renal mass or adrenal masses， thus established diagnosis of primary clear cell carcinoma of the liver. The mass was staged as moderately differentiated cT4N0M1(Stage IVB). Serum Alpha-Fetoprotein Level (AFP) was elevated，24ng/ml (normal <9 ng/ml).**\n\n【25】**Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography (PET CT) demonstrated liver mass， omental metastasis， IVC， and right atrial tumor thrombus as well as bilateral pulmonary metastasis. MRI brain did not show any metastasis. A week after diagnosis， he was hospitalized due to a sudden worsening of abdominal pain with acute anemia， Hb dropped to 7.5 g/dL from 13 g/dL a week prior. A CT angiogram abdomen and pelvis demonstrated left hepatic tumor bleeding with a large amount of hemoperitoneum. Hemostasis was achieved with an emergent visceral angiogram with successful embolization of the right phrenic and left hepatic artery. The patient received palliative radiation to liver and IVC tumor thrombus for a total of 3600 cGy in 600 cGy daily fractions.**\n\n【26】**Due to ongoing bleeding and transaminitis， sorafenib was not considered in first-line therapy. Due to the rarity of the tumor， no established treatments guidelines exist to treat clear cell variant HCC. Therefore， we extrapolated data from phase 3 Checkmate 214trials， the immune blockade in advanced previously untreated renal cell carcinoma with Nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. sunitinib， an obiective response rate of 42% vs. 27% and a complete response rate of 9% with immune therapy \\[2\\].**\n\n【27】**Patient's tumor PD L-1 Combined Positive Score (CPS) is>1，he was started on a combination of systemic immune therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab every three weeks for four cycles followed by nivolumab 240 mg every two weeks. Interval PET CT imaging at the end of 4 cycles of immune therapy revealed partial response in the left hepatic lobe mass with interval development of areas of decreased uptake likely represent tumor necrosis (Standard Uptake Value \\[SUV\\]， 6.5) which represents the residual tumor. There is some concern for progression vs. pseudoprogression of**\n\n【28】**Figure 3： Malignant cell with clear cytoplasm with hyperchromatic nuclei.**\n\n【29】**pulmonary metastasis； however， no new lesions or lymphadenopathy noted. Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram showed a mass in the right atrium is smaller compared to a prior echocardiogram.**\n\n【30】**After completion of 4 cycles of nivolumab and ipilimumab， labs demonstrated grade 3 immune therapy-induced hepatitis. Immune therapy was temporarily held， the patient was treated with high dose prednisone 1 mg/kg with the resolution of hepatitis. Other than mild fatigue， the patient remained asymptomatic. To date， his symptoms(abdominal pain) completely resolved， and immunotherapy was resumed with single-agent nivolumab every two weeks with close monitoring of liver function tests with minimal adverse events except grade 1 fatigue.**\n\n【31】**Discussion**\n\n【32】**Primary dear cell carcinoma of the liver is usually a rare histological type of liver cancers， which accounts for less than 10% of HCC. It is commonly associated with a hepatitis c and cirrhosis with female predominance. It is morphologically similar to other clear cell tumors with renal clear cell carcinoma indistinguishable morphologically from it \\[1，2\\].**\n\n【33】**If diagnostic criteria for HCC are absent， hepatocyte antibody as a screening immunostain distinguishes primary clear cell carcinoma of the liver from other clear cell malignancies with sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 100%， respectively. An alternative method using in situ hybridizationifrom albumin mRNA can alsc distinguish primary liver clear cell carcinoma from other metastatic clear cell tumors to the liver \\[2\\].**\n\n【34】**Generally， the prognosis is better than other types of liver cancers and factors such as higher clear cell ratio， no vascular invasion， capsule formation and improved liver function associated with better prognosis.**\n\n【35】**ICIs (Immunotherapy) have transformed the management of a variety of advanced and metastatic tumors， such as melanoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).PD-L1 expression is the most commonly used metric to initiate immune therapy treatment.**\n\n【36】**The efficacy of nivolumab in advanced HCC with Child-Pugh A or B cirrhosis， who had progressed on sorafenib or intolerant to the drug， enrolled in checkmate 040 a phase I/II dose-escalation， and expansion trial which included 48 patients in the dose escalation phase**\n\n【37】**and 214 patients in dose expansion phase. Nivolumab was given every two weeks. Forty-nine of 255 patients had an objective response to immune therapy， and two patients had a complete response. An additional 50 percent of the patients had stable disease. The median duration of response was 17 months (95% CI 6-24)，and median OS was 15 months. Based on this data， the FDA has expanded the indication for nivolumab to patients with HCC who were treated with sorafenib in the first-line setting \\[3\\].**\n\n【38】**Since the approval of nivolumab， a phase III KEYNOTE-240trial of best supportive care plus either pembrolizumab or placebo for second-line therapy of advanced HCC after progression or intolerance of sorafenib. Total of 413 patients was randomly assigned to pembrolizumab or placebo. The objective response rate was higher for pembrolizumab (16.9 vs. 2.2 percent)， there were more complete responders with pembrolizumab (six vs. none)， and responses were durable (median duration of response 13.8 months， range 1.5 to 23.6+ months)\\[4\\].**\n\n【39】**Simultaneously blocking both PD-1 and CTLA-4 signals has been another strategy in solid tumors， currently being used to achieve a stronger effect than monotherapy. Inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1， as well as simultaneous inhibition of the B7-CTLA-4 pathway by an anti-CTLA-4 antibody， can increase the number of activated CD+T cells infiltrating into tumor tissues， thereby enhancing antitumor effects. This strategy has been proved in malignant melanoma， and clear cell advanced renal cell carcinoma， respectively \\[5，6\\].**\n\n【40】**In the Checkmate 040 HCC trial combination cohort has been added to evaluate the safety and tolerability of nivolumab with ipilimumab with advanced HCC \\[7\\]. Overall， nivolumab plus ipilimumab was well tolerated with clinically meaningful responses and an acceptable safety profile， with an overall response rate twice that of nivolumab monotherapy (31% and 14% respectively) with median overall survival of 23 months. Another phase III ongoing HIMALAYA study is looking at the combination of durvalumab(anti-PDL-1 antibody) and tremelimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) as initial treatment in a patient with inoperable liver cancer \\[8\\].**\n\n【41】**Future Prospects**\n\n【42】**HCC is heterogeneous cancer without any driver mutation and cannot be treated with agents that cause hepatic dysfunction. There is an unmet need for treatment for HCC， such as neoadjuvant therapy and adjuvants after resection and ablation \\[9，10\\] or combination therapy with trans catheter arterial Chemoembolisation \\[11，12\\] and first and second-line treatments. Novel antibodies against PD-land PD-L1 may be beneficial at these stages. Their combination with other anti-angiogenic agents， locoregional therapy， another checkpoint inhibitor such as an anti-CTLA-4 antibody (ipilimumab or tremelimumab)， or with molecularly targeted agents (e.g. sorafenib or lenvatinib) appears promising.**\n\n【43】**The development of combination immunotherapy is rapidly advancing. Immune checkpoint inhibitors， in combination with locoregional and systemic therapies as treatment strategies， will soon become the mainstay of anticancer treatment for liver cancer.**\n\n【44】**References**\n\n【45】**1\\.

A 23-year-old Japanese woman (gravida 1，para 0) was referred to our hospital at 19 weeks and 0 days gestation with the fetus having severe shortening of the long bones. According to ultrasonographic examination， thanatophoric dysplasia type 1 or ACG2 was suspected.

Here we report a case of ACG2 that was clearly identified with 3D-CT in the early second trimester.**\n\n【13】**Keywords： Achondrogenesis； Prenatal diagnosis； Three-dimensional computed tomography**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Achondrogenesis type 2 (ACG2) is a lethal disorder that presents with a large skull， very small and short limbs， and a lack of mineralization of most vertebral bodies. The pelvis has small iliac wings with absent ischia， pubic bones， and sacral elements. The extremities show severe rhizomelia and mesomelia with relative sparing of the hands \\[1\\]. It occurs in approximately1 in 20，000 births and is caused by a dominant mutation in the type 2 collagen gene (COL2A1) \\[2\\]. However， it is difficult to diagnose it exactly， because there are more than 150 different classification in skeletal dysplasia disease， of which many are extremely rare \\[3，4\\].**\n\n【16】**Recent studies have suggested that three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) is more accurate than ultrasound for prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia \\[5\\]. The morphology of the spine and pelvic bones is often inconspicuous on ultrasound， and an accurate diagnosis can be difficult using only ultrasound. On the other hand， 3D-CT can more precisely evaluate the skull， ribs， pelvic bones， vertebrae， and bone mineralization regardless of fetal position or amniotic fluid volume. Here we report a case of ACG2 that was clearly identified on 3D-CT in the early second trimester.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 23-year-old Japanese woman (gravida 1， para 0) was referred to our hospital at 19 weeks and 0 days gestation with the fetus having severe shortening of the long bones. She had no history of drug or alcohol abuse and no relevant family history. Additionally， she had no complication and any history of infection in the first of pregnancy. She had no screening of fetus by ultrasound scan from 11 weeks to 13 weeks. In 14 weeks gestation， her fetus was scanned only for measuring biparietal diameter. In 18 weeks gestation， severe shortening of the limbs was detected for the first time. In our hospital at 19 weeks gestation， ultrasonographic examination for the fetus revealed severe shortening of the limbs (-5.3 S.D.)， a narrow thorax， nuchal translucency， and no cloverleaf skull deformity. When pressing the skull of the fetus with the ultrasound probe， the skull was not deformed.No heart defects or other obvious structural abnormalities were identified**\n\n【19】**Based on these findings， thanatophoric dysplasia type 1 (TD1) or ACG2 was suspected. Therefore， we performed 3D-CT at 19 weeks of gestation. CT was performed with a multi-detector row CT unit (Aquillion ONE； Toshiba Medical Systems， Tokyo， Japan) with 3D adaptive iterative**\n\n【20】**Figure 1： Prenatal three-dimensional computed tomography at 19 weeks of gestation. Thoracic， lumber and sacral vertebral bodies had completely lack of mineralization (assification). Absence of ischia and pubic bones were observed. Skull bone was proportionately large， thorax was small with short ribs. Micromyelia was seen in extremities. Long bones were almost normally modeled.

The data acquisition parameters were64X 0.5-mm detector collimation， a 0.5s rotation time， and exposure factors of 120 kV and 75 mAs. These figures clearly revealed a lack of ossification of the fetal vertebral bodies (Figure 1A and B). This characteristic confirmed the prenatal diagnosis of ACG2. The parents decided on termination of the pregnancy. We dilated the cervix by osmotic dilators， inserted gemeprost， and then delivered the fetus， weighing 282 g·**\n\n【22】**Radiological evaluation of the fetus after the delivery showed findings consistent with ACG2 (Figure 2a， b). It showed metaphyseal flaring and cupping of long bones， absence of talus and calcaneal ossification were observed more clearly than 3DCT. In addition， the molecular analysis of DNA obtained from placenta demonstrated mutation for a c.3427G>A transition (P.G1143S) in exon 40-54 of the COL2A1 gene.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**Our case demonstrates that， even in the early second trimester， ACG2 is characterized by a lack of vertebral body ossification. Moreover， 3D-CT contributed to a precise diagnosis of ACG2. Ossification occurs at a relatively early human gestational age： the clavicle and mandible are ossified by 8 weeks； the appendicular skeleton， ileum and scapula by 12 weeks； and the metacarpals and metatarsals by 12-16 weeks \\[6\\]. Secondary (epiphyseal) ossification centers can be seen by radiographs by 20 weeks gestation. Since bone is echodense by ultrasound， the fetal bone is relatively well visualized by two-dimensional ultrasound in the second trimester of pregnancy\\[7，8\\]. However， the morphology of the spine and pelvic bones is often inconspicuous on ultrasound. In previous studies， 33-88% of ACG2cases were correctly diagnosed by ultrasonography in the prenatal period \\[9\\].**\n\n【25】**In this case， it was difficult to distinguish ACG2 from TD1. Both disorders are characterized by severe shortening of the limbs and a narrow thorax， but with ACG there is a lack of vertebral body ossification. However， the spine could not be clearly visualized in our case because the fetus was in the spine position. Accurate prenatal diagnosis allows physicians to provide appropriate counseling to families about perinatal lethality， consideration for focused molecular analysis， prediction of neonatal complications， recurrence risk， and maternal management \\[7\\]. In addition a timely specific prenatal diagnosis is important because of termination laws. In Japan， the**\n\n【26】**Figure 2： Radiograph in a stillborn infant. Showing extremely short femora and humeri with flares and cupped metaphyses. (a) frontal view (b) lateral view.**\n\n【27】**decision to terminate a pregnancy must be made by 22 weeks gestation. To allow time for patient counseling， we recommend making a diagnosis by 20 weeks of gestation.**\n\n【28】**Ultrasound examination is useful because it is minimally invasive and easy； however， the resolution depends on the fetus position and amniotic fluid volume. On the other hand，3D-CT is able to provide a precise diagnosis even if there is almost no amniotic fluid \\[10\\]. Recent studies have suggested that 3D-CT is more accurate than ultrasound for prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia \\[5\\].**\n\n【29】**This case showed a precise prenatal diagnosis of ACG2 by using3D-CT in the early second trimester. On the other hand，ACG2 was diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound at 12 weeks by Soothill in1993 \\[6\\]. The authors showed that the fetus had severe generalized subcutaneous edema and short limbs by ultrasound scanning. In addition， radiological evaluation of the fetus after termination showed marked limb shortening with flaring and cupping of the metaphyseal ends of the long bones and ribs but no rib fractures. Immunocytochemistry showed the presence of type 1 collagen. They diagnosed ACG2 by those findings. However， the fetus in that case clearly had ossification of the fetal vertebral bodies； therefore， that casemightnot conform to the current ACG2 \\[4\\]. Including molecular analysis， we considered the possibility of osteogenesis imperfecta. Except for the above-mentioned case report， our report is the first report of a precise prenatal diagnosis of ACG2 in the early second trimester.**\n\n【30】**This is the first report of a precise prenatal diagnosis of ACG2using 3D-CT in the early second trimester. This case suggests that3D-CT can provide additional and more accurate information to diagnose fetal ACG2.**\n\n【31】**References**\n\n【32】1\\. Deborah Krakow. Skeletal Dysplasias.

An electrocardiogram confirmed an inferior and an anterolateral ST depression myocardial infarction. Cardiac troponin I， (cTnI) was 0.08 ng/ml. This is typically acute myocardial infarction after non-cardiac surgery. So he was shifted to cardiologist department for further treatment and discharged two weeks later when he felt fine but was presented to emergency room and expired for acute heart failure one month after discharge.**\n\n【12】**Keywords： Myocardial infarction； Transurethral resection of the prostate surgery**\n\n【13】**Introduction**\n\n【14】**Patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery are at risk of postoperative major vascular complications (i.e.， vascular death， non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI)， non-fatal cardiac arrest， and non-fatal stroke)， and MI is the most common major complication \\[1\\]. Antiplatelet therapy should be continued as long as one lives for secondary prevention of acute myocardial infarction. But when it comes to a surgical scenario the dilemma goes to every doctor for concerning about the bleeding if the antiplatelet therapy continued or thrombogenesis when the antiplatelet therapy was discontinued. Although there's lots of guidelines which strongly recommended the continue of antiplatelet therapy \\[2-4\\] and restarted as soon as possible \\[5\\]. There are still concerns of bleeding for surgeons especially for prostate surgery beyond second vascular complications perioperatively\\[6\\].**\n\n【15】**Transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) is a common urologicalprocedure which can be associated with considerable blood loss. For this reason the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy poses a management dilemma for urologists. Significant blood loss alters the risk-benefit ratio and many urologists and patients consider that the increased morbidity and possible mortality negate the potential benefits \\[7\\].**\n\n【16】**We illustrate a case that the patient end up dead after the second attack of AMI after TURP which the antiplatelet therapy was discontinued before the surgery and was not restarted as soon as possible.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 67 year old man with progressive difficulty of micturition for ten years and now presented with dysurine and urine pain for a week was admitted for selective transurethral resection ofprostate surgery on June 23， 2014.

The ECG showed an abnormal Q wave in lead II III AVF and a depression of ST segment in lead V2-V6 (Figure 1 and 2)， then nitroglycerin was pumping but no release of any symptom and cardiac troponin I (TNI) testing was going on which was turned to be 0.08 ng/ml.**\n\n【21】**The diagnosis went to ACS. The patient was shifted to Cardiologist department for further**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： The ECG one day before the surgery day.**\n\n【23】**treatment. To prevent bleeding， there’s no anti-platelet and anti-coagulating therapy until seven days after surgery. The patient feels better and coronary angiography was checked and proved a new stenosis in right coronary artery so a stent was placed. He was discharged when the TNI goes down to 0.03 ng/ml. unfortunately， one month after discharged， he was admitted again for acute heart failure and he died within 48 hours.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**For this case， acute myocardial infarction happened after TURP surgery which was defined by James Khan etc， in 2014， myocardial infarction/injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINs) \\[8\\].**\n\n【26】**erioperative mmyocardialiinjuryy ilsSthemostcommon cardiovascular complication following non-cardiac surgery \\[9，10\\]. Most of the MINs occurred within 48 hours of surgery (74.1%)\\[11\\] of greater importance， the 30-day mortality rate was 11.6% among those who had an MI versus 2.2% for those who did not (P<.001)\\[12\\]. In contrast to the diagnosis of spontaneous acute myocardial infarction， the diagnosis of MINs takes into account the silent (90%) presentation of painless myocardial infarction and is based on cardiac troponin only，i.e. it does notrequire the presence of symptoms \\[8，13\\]. Diagnostic criteria： Troponin T level ≥ 0.03 ng/ml \\[13\\]. MINs in the POISE Trial demonstrated that two drugs (i.e.， ASP and a statin) were associated with a statistically significant， risk-adjusted reduction in30-day mortality \\[14\\]. More treatment at 9-12 days after surgery is median days for decreasing the 30-day mortality \\[15\\]. To prevent MINs after non-cardiac surgery， it seems undeniable to continue the anti-platelet therapy perioperatively.**\n\n【27】**However， if anti-platelet or anti-coagulant drugs are not stopped for TURP， there is an unacceptable burden of bleeding. If the drugs are stopped there is an unacceptable rate of cardiovascular events. So this issue still needs to be resolved. 2016 ACC/AHA guideline focused update on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery disease， there's class I recommendations that in patients treated with DAPT after coronary stent implantation who must undergo surgicalprocedure that mandate the discontinuation of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy， it is recommended that aspirin be continued if possible and the P2Y12 platelet receptor inhibitor be restarted as soon as possible after surgery \\[16\\].**\n\n【28】**For those patients with cardiac risk factors on low dose aspirin alone this can be continued in the perioperative period without increased risk of major bleeding \\[2，17\\]. A multicentre， retrospective，**\n\n【29】**Figure 2： The ECG when the patient feels chest pain.**\n\n【30】**observational study demonstrated that perioperative antiplatelet discontinuation was the strongest independent predictor of 30-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (odds ratio \\[OR\\]=25.8， confidence interval \\[CI\\] =3.37-198， p=0.002). Perioperative aspirin(adjusted OR 0.27， 95% CI 0.11-0.71， p=0.008) was significantly associated with alower risk of MACE \\[3\\]. Aspirin should be continued perioperatively in the majority of surgical operations， whereas dual antiplatelet therapy should not be withdrawn for surgery in the case of low bleeding risk. In selected patients at high risk for bleeding and ischaemic events， when oral antiplatelet therapy withdrawal is required， perioperative treatment with short-acting intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (tirofiban or eptifibatide) should be taken into consideration \\[4\\].**\n\n【31】**Conclusion**\n\n【32】**For patients who need anti-platelet therapy for prevention of the secondary acute myocardial infarction perioperatively， anti-platelet therapy should be continued until the surgery day or treatment with short-acting intravenous anti-coagulant drugs.**\n\n【33】**References**\n\n【34】1\\.

Typically， compartment syndrome is associated with high energy injuries which impart significant damage on the surrounding tissues， but it is important to recognize that compartment syndrome can develop after low energy injuries as well. It is the job of the orthopedic surgeon to maintain a high level of suspicion in order to diagnose and appropriately treat these patients. Our case highlights an atypical presentation of anterior thigh compartment syndrome following an acute quadriceps tendon rupture and addresses the management from diagnosis through treatment.**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Acute Compartment Syndrome (ACS) can be a devastating complication associated with significant morbidity in the orthopedic patient. Compartment syndrome occurs when the pressure in a confined space rises， resulting in a reduction of blood flow to the tissues within the space， leading to ischemia， necrosis and functional impairment \\[1\\]. ACS is typically associated with high energy injuries， but recent literature has demonstrated a significant proportion of ACS associated with lower energy injuries. Classically the signs of ACS include pain out of proportion to exam and pain with passive stretch， with late findings including pulselessness and paresthesias. Risk factors associated with the development of ACS include anticoagulant use，younger age，polytrauma，altered level of conscious and associated nerve injury. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are paramount as a delay in diagnosis is the main factor associated with significant sequela and treatment failure \\[1，2\\].**\n\n【16】**This article describes the case of a 67 year old man who developed anterior thigh compartment syndrome following an acute quadriceps tendon rupture sustained after a ground level fall \\[3\\]. To our knowledge there is only a single case report documenting ACS following a quadriceps tendon rupture， and it is our goal to raise awareness regarding this clinical entity.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**An obese male with a history of atrial fibrillation on Xarelto 20 mg QD presented to our ED after a groundlevel fall onto a hyper flexed right knee with thigh pain and inability to ambulate. He was initially evaluated by a non-orthopedic physician and diagnosed with a quadriceps strain， placed in a knee immobilizer and discharged home. He was not evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon on his initial emergency room visit.**\n\n【19】**The patient returned to the ED the next day with significantly worsening pain， paresthesias， and noted his thigh had become“hard like a rock”.On examination the patient appeared uncomfortable and was diaphoretic. Upon evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon he was found to be unable to perform a straight leg raise and had a palpable defect at the superior pole of the patella， and was diagnosed with a quadriceps tendon rupture with suspected complete medial and lateral retinacular tears. Even though we were unable to assess pain with passive stretch due to the disruption of his extensor mechanism there was great concern for acute compartment syndrome of the anterior thigh based on his clinical picture \\[4\\]. His anterior thigh was swollen compared to the left， measuring 58cm compared to 55 cm (both measured 10 cm proximal to the superior pole of the patella). He had developed diffuse bruising over the anterior and anterolateral aspect of his thigh with a firm anterior compartment and little swelling of the medial and posterior compartments. Paresthesias were present over the anterolateral thigh but were neurovascularly intact distally. The decision was made to take the patient to the operative room emergently fasciotomy and possible quadriceps repair.**\n\n【20】**Prior to the procedure the anterior compartment pressure was measured with the use of a**\n\n【21】**Stryker Intra-Compartmental Pressure Monitor System (Stryker， Kalamazoo， Michigan)， and found to be 85 mmHg. The diagnosis of compartment syndrome was confirmed and we proceeded with the surgery.**\n\n【22】**In reference to Kuri et al. \\[5\\] we proceeded with a longitudinal midline incision made over the anterior aspect of the knee. Upon incision of the fascia there was a gross extrusion of approximately 500cc of clot as well as an additional 500 cc of hematoma， significantly decreasing the pressure in the anterior compartment. This fascial incision was then extended proximally to the level of the proximal thigh and distally past the inferior pole of the patella and all remaining hematoma and clot was removed. Further inspection of the anterior compartment revealed an avulsion of the quadriceps tendon off the superior pole of the patella， and no continued source of bleeding was identified. Throughout the case the color， consistency， contraction， and circulation of the quadriceps muscle was continually evaluated. A small portion of the medial VMO was found to be dusky in appearance and was debrided， while the rest of the musculature was deemed viable. We then performed a repair of the quadriceps tendon with #2 fiber wire and bone tunnel construct， followed by repair of the medial and lateral retinacula. Superficial and deep Hemovac drains were placed and the wound was primarily closed and dressed with a negative pressure dressing and placed into a Knee immobilizer.**\n\n【23】**After the procedure the patient's symptoms of intractable thigh pain had resolved. His post-operative course was uneventful. At 8month follow up the patient has full active and passive ROM of the right knee 0 to 120 degrees of flexion without extensor lag. There is minimalstrength asymmetrybetweenthe operative and non-operative knee with mild palpable decrease in muscle bulk most notable over the VMO. The patient was able to ambulate independently without the use of an assistive device.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**Acute compartment syndrome of the thigh is a rare clinical entity that is typically seen in high energy injuries with associated femoral shaft fractures \\[2\\]， but none theless， ACS of the thigh has been shown to occur in lower energy injuries as well. Rupture of the quadriceps tendon is a relatively common injury， but is rarely associated with the development of ACS \\[3\\]. To our knowledge there is only a single case report documenting the development of acute anterior thigh compartment syndrome following an acute quadriceps tendon rupture \\[5\\]. It is our goal to bring light to this distinct clinical entity as well as highlight patients at risk for developing this complication.**\n\n【26】**Certain risk factors predispose patients to developing ACS，and in our situation anticoagulant use was a contributing factor. Previously reported risk factors for the development of ACS include direct thigh trauma，anticoagulant use， coagulopathy， older age， neurologic deficit， and crush or vascular injuries \\[2\\]. On initial presentation our patient bar did not demonstrate evidence of compartment syndrome. Over the next 24 h he continued to bleed into his thigh， likely influenced by his anticoagulation use， and presented back to the hospital with an evolving compartment syndrome of the anterior thigh. The posterior and medial compartments remained soft and were seemingly uninvolved which was similar to the previously reported case.**\n\n【27】**The vascular supply to the anterior knee is derived from the rich anastomotic network formed by the geniculate arteries which are branches off the popliteal artery. No identifiable source of bleeding was found intraoperatively， which supports the idea that a network of smaller vessels were disrupted， and an effective clot was only formed once a significant tamponade was achieved. After decompression and hematoma removal the thigh was soft and the decision was made to perform a tension free closure at the time of surgery. This goes against the traditional thinking that fasciotomies should not be closed acutely， but based on our intraoperative findings and after removal of a large space occupying lesion we felt this to be appropriate. Both the medial and posterior compartments remained soft and were found to have minimal swelling so no intervention was deemed necessary.**\n\n【28】**Preoperatively， the decision to hold the patient's anticoagulation was clear， but when it is safe to restart is not as clear cut. Based on our experience the patient's chemical anticoagulant was held after his injury and for two weeks following surgery. There is no evidence defining a timeline for restarting anticoagulation following ACS， but our decision was made once the patient’s wound showed no drainage and demonstrated minimal and improving clinical swelling of the thigh.**\n\n【29】**The clinical impact of ACS cannotbe understated as compartment syndrome is routinely associated with worse outcomes compared to similar fractures without ACS. Due to this there are also significant medicolegal ramifications for all parties involved. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are paramount， as a delay in diagnosis is linearly related to the value of the indemnity payment and any decompression performed within 8 h was uniformly associated with a successful defense \\[6\\]. ACS most commonly is seen in high energy injuries， but this case demonstrates the possibility of ACS developing following lower energy soft tissue injuries in at risk patients.**\n\n【30】**In conclusion， all consultations for compartment syndrome should be taken seriously. Frequently it is the responsibility of the orthopedic surgeon to appropriately diagnose these injuries， and timely management is essential to improve outcomes and prevent further complications.**\n\n【31】**References**\n\n【32】**1\\.

A 37 year-old female with an enlarged retrosternal goiter underwent a transaxillary robot-assisted gasless thyroidectomy in the American Hospital of Paris. The main outcome measures were feasibility and safety of this technique.**\n\n【14】**A huge 15 cm retrosternal goiter was completely resected via the transaxillar incision.

This innovative procedure is based on the use of the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical， Inc.， Mountain View， Calif， USA) that provides the surgeon with three-dimensional， high-definition， magnified visualization of the operative field， and allows control of various instruments with increased precision， tremor filtration， and more degrees of freedom. Since its introduction in 2007 \\[2\\]， the use of this robotic system for thyroidectomy has been seducing more and more surgeons and patients worldwide \\[3，4\\]. Recently robotic assisted thyroidectomythought transaxillar approach is become widely used in the western world \\[5\\]， however concern yet to be for large or retrosternal goiters.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**A 37 year old female presented to the American Hospital of Paris with a cervical mass that appeared few months before her presentation， complaining of dyspnea， dysphagia pressure and suffocation in s supine position.**\n\n【20】**The patient was determined not to be operated by classic cervical approach fearing a neck scar. During this time seeking for treatment the size of the goiter enlarged from 12 cm to 15 cm with marked retrosternal extension.**\n\n【21】**The neck ultra-sound revealed a huge enlargement of the right thyroid lobe with retrosternal extension， measuring approximately 15 cm. An MRI was made to evaluate the retrosternal involvement which was confirmed by a remarkable sub-sternal extension， tracheal compression and pulling to the contralateral side (Figure 1A， 1B and 2).**\n\n【22】**The patient was informed about her condition； with such a challengeable surgical case there is a very high chance of converting the operation to open approach. Furthermore， no previous data or successful cases were published in literature. With all of this she insisted on being operated initially with robot via transaxillary incision.**\n\n【23】**Under general anesthesia a 5 cm axillar incision was made， ducking time (working space creation) was 25 min， a transaxillar robotic thyroid lobectomy was performed， the console time was90 min. the procedure went without complication， the RLN was preserved and monitored via NIM(Figure 3). Both parathyroid gland from the operated side were identified and preserved.**\n\n【24】**Figure 1A： Frontal/Coronal MRIplane.**\n\n【25】**Figure 1B： Sagittal MRI plane.**\n\n【26】**T： Trachea； G： Goiter； Ao： Aortic Arch**\n\n【27】**A large specimen of 15 cm length (Figure 4) was extracted only via the transaxillar incision. Then she underwent an uneventful extubation.**\n\n【28】**During admissionthe drain was taken out 24h after the surgery，the chemical test revealed a normal calcium levels， physical examination confirmed normal vocal cord movement bilaterally. The transaxillar incision looks normal， full right shoulder and arm movement and normal post-operative pain well controlled paracetamol. The patient was so pleased and satisfied and was discharged home 72 h**\n\n【29】**Figure 3： Intraoperative view.

At 4 weeks post-operatively follow up the patient was a symptomatic with complete range movements of right shoulder， normal transaxillar scar and normal vocal cord movements.**\n\n【31】**Discussion**\n\n【32】**A resection of large thyroid goiter can be surgically challengeable especially cases with retrosternal extension. However， the patient determination of cervical scar-less operation make it more difficult， but not impossible. Knowing that we begin the operation via transaxillar incision with the possibility to convert it to classic cervical approach as it may necessitates， made the decision easier for us.**\n\n【33】**Also to mentioned，the patient was operated by a very experienced surgeon (P. A) With more than 500 robotic thyroidectomy cases in his resume including (large goiters， thyroidectomies d/t Graves’disease and another complicated cases) with satisfaction results. Recently**\n\n【34】**more and more difficult and challengeable cases can be treated by robotic assisted surgery considering the accumulated experience for each surgeon.**\n\n【35】**Conclusion**\n\n【36】**This case represents the first documented case in literature， emphasis the enormous progress surgeons made with de Vinci robotic thyroid surgery in a short time. This initial experience demonstrates that this technique can be a feasible， safe and effective method for thyroidectomy via transaxillar approach \\[4，6\\]. The use of robotic technology for endoscopic thyroid surgery could overcome the limitations of conventional endoscopic surgeries in the surgical management ofthyroid disease \\[7，8\\]. Still more operations to be done till this method can become an alternative option to the more invasive traditional approaches.**\n\n【37】**References**\n\n【38】1\\.

We present the case of a neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of the liver that mimicked Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS)， not previously described in the literature. Diagnosis can be difficult given the rarity and nonspecific presentation of hepatic NETs. Histology and immunohistochemistry remains the most definitive diagnostic modality， which can be limited in diffusely infiltrative NETs by poorly defined margins. In this case， initial biopsy failed to show NET cells and demonstrated venous obstruction as seen in BCS. Follow up hepatic venography revealed patent veins， inconsistent with BCS， and another diagnosis was sought. This case illustrates the importance of hepatic venography， the standard imaging technique for diagnosing BCS， and that a NET can mimic BCS.**\n\n【22】**A 52-year-old male presented with four weeks of abdominal distension and pedal edema. Apart from a 75 pack-years of smoking， his medical history was unremarkable. He had no risk factors for chronic liver disease. Examination revealed tender hepatomegaly， ascites， and pedal edema. His blood chemistry panels were normal. Liver serologies were not elevated but his a-fetoprotein level was elevated to 17 ng/mL. Doppler ultrasound， computed tomography (CT)， and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed compression of the inferior vena cava with absent flow in the middle hepatic and portal veins； MRI also showed flow voids in the hepatic veins. CT revealed numerous liver nodules with some hyperdense enhancement on arterial phase and heterogenous iso to hypodense enhancement on venous phase， consistent with dysplastic lesions of BCS but also raising concern for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Figures 1A and B). There were no other masses seen in other organs. On MRI， some nodules were iso to hypointense on T1 weighted images and heterogenous on T2 weighted images， but few were hyper-intense. Taken together， CT and MRI findings were less consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma but rather regenerative nodules seen in BCS. Ascitic fluid analysis showed no malignant cells and an elevated serum ascites-to-albumin gradient consistent with portal hypertension. Percutaneous liver biopsy revealed diffuse stromal**\n\n【23】**Figure 1b： CT image of liver (venous phase).**\n\n【24】**Figure 2： The liver biopsy showed centri-zonal hemorrhage， hepatocyte dropout and scattered hemosiderin laden macrophages.

Workup for hypercoagulable conditions was negative， and he was transferred to our institution for further management.**\n\n【27】**To confirm the diagnosis ofBCS，hepatic venography was pursued but revealed patient veins without any evidence of obstruction， inconsistent with BCS. His hepatic venous pressure gradient was elevated to 16 mmHg and repeat biopsy now demonstrated multiple foci of NET cells with background findings suggestive of outflow tract obstruction (Figure 2-4). Immunostains were positive for synaptophysin， chromogranin， and cytokeratin 7 (Figure 5).

There was again isolated liver uptake on positron emission tomography scan.**\n\n【31】**Discussion**\n\n【32】**Primary hepatic NETs are rare， with fewer than 150 reported cases， \\[1\\] and differentiating them from other hepatic lesions can be challenging. Our case of a diffusely infiltrative NET mimicking BCS has not been previously.**\n\n【33】**Our patient’s presenting symptoms of abdominal pain， hepatomegaly， and ascites， as well as his IVC narrowing， elevated serum ascites-to-albumin gradient， and initial biopsy were suggestive of hepatic venous outflow obstruction as seen in BCS \\[2\\]. Furthermore， radiographic tests demonstrated compression of the IVC with hepatic venous outflow obstruction. Abdominal CT revealed liver nodules inconsistent with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but rather resembles the regenerative nodules associated with BCS. Characteristic CT findings of regenerative nodules in BCS， however， hyper-attenuate on arterial phase and remain hyper-attenuated on portal and venous phases. The nodules are also hyper-intense on T1and hypo-intense on T2 weighted MRI images \\[3\\].**\n\n【34】**This is a case of NET diffusely infiltrating the liver with obstructed hepatic venules， resulting in venous congesting and mimicking BCS. The absence oftumor on initial biopsy or imaging was also suggestive of BCS. However， hepatic venography demonstrated flow through the hepatic veins， inconsistent with BCS， and concurrent biopsy demonstrated NET cells. This tumor’s rarity posed a diagnostic challenge， especially given the variable presentation of NETs in liver and absence of tumor on initial biopsy. One report describes a large primary hepatic NET presenting as BCS by extrinsically compressing the IVC， but its size made it an easy target for biopsy \\[4\\]. Diffusively infiltrate NETs are not discrete lesions and can be missed on biopsy， as in our case.**\n\n【35】**Author's Contribution**\n\n【36】**GNM： Manuscript initial design and revision； PR： Pathology slides review， manuscript revision； AS： Design， clinical evaluation， manuscript revision.**\n\n【37】**References**\n\n【38】**1\\.

Although品focal (single or multifocal) coronary artery occlusion occur mostly at rest and is related with ST elevation (variant or Prinzmetal angina)， there are scarce reports of exertional related vasospastic angina leading to ST depression.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**The 43-year old Caucasian male was admitted to the Emergency Department due to one hour lasting chest pain. The routine treadmill stress test performed prior to the admission to hospital revealed significant ST segment depression in leads II， III， aVF， V3-V6 after 3，5 minutes of exercise， without clinical symptoms characteristic for ischemia. The patient had a history of several episodes of chest pain on exertion in the last several months before the stress test； he was not diagnosed and treated for any chronic disease. Smoking was the only known cardiovascular risk factor. The exercise tolerance was sustainably optimal. The same day the ECG positive stress test was performed； patient was hospitalized in the cardiology department. The early coronary angiography revealed two proximal， borderline stenoses in the Left Main Coronary Artery (LMCA) and in Right Coronary Artery (RCA). After the Heart-Team consultation repeated evaluation of coronary arteries was advocated， with additional Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS). The latter angiography showed no narrowing's in the epicardial vessels. Subsequent IVUS of LMCA，proximal Left Anterior Descending (LAD) and Circumflex (LCX) arteries showed absence of stenoses， with no evidence of atherosclerosis (Figure 1，2). Three weeks after coronary angiography the nuclear stress test was performed according to Bruce protocol. Exercise test was terminated due to increasing chest pain in the sixth minute on exertion (achieved heart rate of 130 per min - 70% of maximal expected heart rate， workload of 4.6 METs). There was significant ST segment depression in leads V5 and V6. Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) performed one hour later showed extensive and severe perfusion deterioration within the apex， anterior and inferior walls of the left ventricle. The rest MPI revealed substantial perfusion improvement of radiotracer uptake in the regions with decreased accumulation. Furthermore， estimated region of improved perfusion comprised approximately 40%of the left ventricle's myocardium. Considering all of these results， the vasospastic mechanism has been suggested， as the reason of described coronaryarterial narrowing's observed in first angiography and not confirmed in further diagnostics. Therefore the treatment has been modified (beta blocker was withdrawn； calcium channel blocker treatment was initiated). Another MPI was suggested by interventional cardiologists a month after treatment modification. Two sublingual doses of 0.4 mg Nitroglycerine (NTG) each were administered within one hour before the next treadmill stress test. Two day stress/rest MPI with9mTc-sestamibi was performed， showing only slight reversible region of perfusion abnormalities in the basal segments of the lateral wall. The enormous discrepancy was observed between two subsequent images of the MPI (Figure 3). No coronary intervention was performed in this subject between these two MPI examinations. Following the treatment modification patient has been released from exertion related symptoms.**\n\n【20】**Figure 1： Angiograms of the LCA (left image) and RCA (right image).

Less frequent manifestation of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) that has to be taken into consideration in such cases is vasospastic angina. Coronary spasm has been observed on angiograms， but exceptionally in left main artery. Vasospastic pathomechanism was repeatedly proven by intracoronary spasm inducement with ergonovine or acetylcholine**\n\n【25】**injection. Although focal (single or multifocal) coronary artery occlusion occur mostly at rest and is related with ST elevation (variant or Prinzmetal angina)， there are scarce reports of exertional related vasospastic angina leading to ST depression \\[1，2\\]. This phenomenon could be induced by diffused spasm in distal coronaries. According to the 2019 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of chronic coronary syndromes the presence of anginal symptoms and abnormal non-invasive tests in patients with non-obstructed epicardial vessels should lead to the suspicion of a non-obstructive cause of ischemia but because diagnostic pathways to investigate microcirculatory or**\n\n【26】**vasospastic coronary disorders are often not implemented， a final diagnosis supported by objective evidence is seldom reached. The possibility of a microcirculatory dysfunction should be considered in patients with angina， abnormal non-invasive functional tests， and coronary vessels that are either normal or have mild stenosis considered as functionally non-significant on invasive or non-invasive coronary angiography. Additionally development of ECG changes and angina in response to acetylcholine testing but without severe epicardial vasoconstriction is suggestive of microvascular spasm \\[3\\]. AHA/ACC/ASE/CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR Guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasizes， that in the presence of non-obstructive coronary artery disease reduced myocardial blood flow reserve may indicate coronary microvascular dysfunction，especially among women \\[4-7\\]. In this particular case the vasospasm appeared in arteries at the catheter tip， which can indicate the mechanical irritation coexisting with hypersensitivity of vessels as potential explanation. Nonetheless it does not expound the extended and severe myocardial perfusion abnormalities in stress MPI with pronounced improvement on the rest images. The ST depression in stress MPI with reversible perfusion defects would rather suggest unoccluded， spastic variant. The repeated stress/rest MPI with mild perfusion abnormalities after treatment was changed (continuous calcium channel blocker treatment， sublingual NTG before stress test) seems to confirm the vasospastic mechanism but do not exclude microvascular dysfunction. Studies with Acetylcholine (ACH) testing revealed， that in stable CAD with normal or near normal arteries in coronary angiography， intracoronary ACH injection provoked vasospasm in 62% (the ACOVAstudy). In 55% of them the ACH test results (ECG changes， symptoms) were interpreted as microvascular spasm. The abnormal ACH tests are directly related with endothelial dysfunction. In response to ACH uptake by endothelial receptor， nitric oxide and other compounds are released， stimulating vasodilation. Instead， when endothelial cells remain dysfunctional， ACH can induce coronary vasospasm via receptors within smooth**\n\n【27】**muscles. Vasospastic variant of angina pectoris， if not demonstrated by ST segment elevation， as well as microvascular angina still cause clinical difficulties in diagnostics and management of our patients. The studies show， that in many cases of CAD there is more than one underlying pathomechanism responsible for anginal manifestation. Yet advanced diagnostic instruments may lead us to appropriate conclusion so we can introduce accurate treatment and relieve patients from inconvenient symptoms.**\n\n【28】**References**\n\n【29】**1\\.

CD20 is homogeneous or strongly positive， favoring diagnoses of lymphocyte-predominant HL， T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma \\[1\\]， diffuse large B-cell lymphoma， primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma or grey zone lymphoma. Rituximab， applied as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapeutics， is the first monoclonal antibody licensed for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) immunotherapy. Most of the clinical experience with anti-CD20 antibodies has been with rituximab \\[2\\]. The response rate， Progression-Free Survival (PFS)， and Overall Survival (OS) of NHL patients has been improved with incorporation of rituximab. In aggressive lymphoma， patients who do not respond to rituximab-combined chemotherapy in a front-line setting represent individuals with poor clinical outcomes. Infusion-related symptoms(e.g.， urticaria， fever， and chills) have been found in more than half of patients. Although these symptoms are usually modest， more serious reactions can occur， including hypotension， rigors， bronchospasm， and angioedema， in as manyas 10% ofpatients \\[3-5\\].Multiple next-generation anti-CD20 antibodies have been designed to improve the promise of B-cell lymphoma therapy \\[6-8\\].**\n\n【22】**An emerging alternative approach to immunotherapy is llama-derived VHH recombinant monoclonal antibodies， also known as“nanobodies\". Recently， the serum of came lids was found to contain not only the four conventional chain-Immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules but also Heavy Chain Antibodies (HCAbs)， which lack light chains and the CH1 domain. The VHH domain of approximately 15 kDa， which is much smaller than other recombinant antibody formats (60 kDa)， is the smallest known antigen recognition site found in mammals. VHH has full binding capacity and affinity comparable to conventional antibodies. Monomeric Nbs have dimensions of 4 nm x**\n\n【23】**2.2 nm and offer several advantages over antigen-binding fragments derived from classical antibodies \\[9\\]. Due to their small sizes， VHHs act as strong enzyme inhibitors， reaching enzyme pockets that are not accessible to common antibodies. When cloned and purified as Monomeric domains， VHHs demonstrate remarkable stability under a wide range of denaturing， temperature， and pH conditions \\[10\\]. Recombinant VHH antibody fragments are emerging as new versatile reagents for the diagnosis and treatment oftumors.**\n\n【24】**Here， we exploited the properties of VHH to develop a reagent that could be applied for the diagnosis or treatment of B cell lymphoma. We show that VHHs are broadly reactive reagents that can be engineered for use in immunodiagnostic tests for CD20antigen. The results indicate that these new antibodies are promising as immunological tools for B celllymphoma research andtherapeutic development.**\n\n【25】**Materials and Methods**\n\n【26】**Llama immunization and immune response monitoring**\n\n【27】**A male llama of one year of age was subcutaneously immunized five times (days 0， 30，50，70， and 90) with 300 ug/per dose of CD20.

This study was approved by the hospital ethics committee \\[(2017) scientific research ethics review No. (03)\\]. Incomplete Freund’s adjuvant(Sigma-Aldrich， St. Louis， MO， USA) was used in subsequent immunizations. The antibody responses to CD20 in serum during the time course of immunization were monitored by ELISA. For the ELISAs， 96-well flat bottom Maxisorp ELISA plates (NUNC， Thermo Scientific， Waltham，MA，USA) were coated with 50 ng of CD20 diluted in 50 uL ofPBS，pH 7.4，at 4°C. Then，2% skimmed Milk Powder in Phosphate-Buffered Saline (MPBS) was used to blocked the wells， and the wells were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Sera diluted with 2% MPBS were added at 100 uL per well and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Subsequently， the Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-labelled goat anti-Llama antibodies were added to each well after three washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST，pH 7.4)， and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 h.

M-280 streptavidin beads (Invitrogen， Carlsbad， CA， USA，) were incubated with 2% skim milk powder in PBS for 1 h at room temperature to block non-specific binding. The beads were drawn into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with a magnetic tube holder (Dynal Biotech， Oslo， Norway)， and the supernatant was discarded. The magnetic streptavidin beads were mixed with biotinylated CD20 antigen (500 nM) and incubated with end-over-end rotation at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently， the beads were incubated with phage for 2 h at room temperature. The magnetic streptavidin beads were rinsed 5 to 10 times. Bound phage was eluted with 200 uL of freshly diluted Triethylamine (TEA)， and then neutralized with Tris-HCl. The unbound phage was discarded. Phages were purified with PEG (20% PEG6000-2.5 M NaCl). Three rounds of selection were conducted， and phage populations from the second and third rounds were tested for specificity to CD20 by ELISA. Next， 2 to 3 rounds of panning were performed with 100 nM，20 nM，and 4 nM antigen concentration， and more than 100 clones isolated were after a single round. The isolated colonies were obtained from the second and third rounds of the bacteria， which was diluted and plated onto an LB/ampicillin plate. A single colony was selected and cultured in 96-well plates at 37°C for 5 h. Subsequently， M13K07helper phage was added and incubated for 30 min without shaking at37°C. The supernatant was collected and added to the 96-well plates， and a standard ELISA process was carried out with an HRP-anti-M13antibody (GE Healthcare， Munich， Germany). Twelve positive phage clones were analyzed by DNA sequencing.**\n\n【35】**Expression and purification of anti-CD20 VHHs**\n\n【36】**The VHH cDNA was mobilized from the phage display vector to the soluble sdAb expression vector pSJF2 by BamHI/BbsI and re-sequenced prior to transfer to TG1 by electroporation.

Biotinylated CD20 (20ug/mL) coupled to Streptavidin (SA) biosensors was used to establish a baseline in PBST buffer (PBS pH7.4， 0.1% BSA， albumin fraction and 0.02% Tween-20， both Merck KGaA， Darmstadt， Germany) prior to association at varying analyte concentrations. Serial dilutions of 200 uL were generated to produce20， 10， 5， 2.5， and 1.25 uM concentration of sdAbs in appropriate wells of the assay plate. Octet Analysis Software version 6.4 was used for automatic data processing. Biosensor data were fit by using a 1：1binding model.**\n\n【41】**ELISA competition assays**\n\n【42】**Ninety-six wells were coated with 100 pL CD20 (10 ug/mL in 50 mM NaCO， buffer， pH 9.5) and incubated overnight at 4℃.

Different concentrations (0， 50100，250，500 ug/mL) of anti-CD20e7， anti-CD20b1 and anti-CD20f1 were incubated with 50 pL CD20 (50 ug/mL) for 2 h at 37°C. Anti-BAFF sdAb was used as a negative control. After washing the microtiter wells three times with PBST， 100 uL HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were added substrate TMB after three washes with PBST， and incubated at room temperature for 10 min.

Prior to each immunization， 1~2 mL of blood was collected from the Llama jugular vein， and the anti-CD20antibody level in the Llama was measured by enzyme immunoassay. Negative and immune sera were diluted 1：100， 1：1000， and 1：10，000. As shown in Figure 1， the level of anti-CD20 antibody in the serum increased with as the immune Llama interval lengthened， and the immune times increased after the fourth immunization. ELISA revealed an A450 value of 2.22 for the antibody in the Llama serum diluted 10，000 times， whereas an A450 value was 0.132 for the blank**\n\n【46】**Table 1： Enrichment of specific phages during subsequent rounds of panning.**\n\n【47】**RoundTitre of input phageTitre of output phageOutput phages/input**\n\n| **1**  | **1.32x1012**  | **1.57x106**  | **1.89x106**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **2**  | **7.51x1011**  | **4.76x10**  | **5.33x105**  |\n| **3**  | **6.22x1011**  | **1.29x107**  | **2.82x105**  |\n\n【49】**Table 2： The relative affinity of selected antagonistic anti-CD20 sdAbs.**\n\n| **SdAbs**  | **KD (M)**  | **kon (1/Ms)**  | **kdis (1/s)**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Anti-CD20e7**  | **3.19x107**  | **2.29x10**  | **7.29x104**  |\n| **Anti-CD20b1**  | **3.18x106**  | **5.71x10°**  | **1.82x102**  |\n| **Anti-CD20f1**  | **8.23x10**  | **2.90x10°**  | **2.39x10**  |\n\n【51】**All constants were calculated from five data sets abtained with different concentrations of VHHs (from 1.25-20 uM) by a global Langmuir 1.1 method.**\n\n【52】**control，P/N>2 (positive results).**\n\n【53】**The immunized llama library construction**\n\n【54】**Total RNA was extracted from 10° lymphocytes， which were collected from EDTA-treated blood， and cDNA was prepared and used as a template to amplify VHH genes.

Among these 8 clones，anti-CD20e7，anti-CD20b1 andanti-CD20fl yielded the highest ELISA signals and were therefore selected for further characterization (Figure 3).**\n\n【64】**Expression of soluble VHH**\n\n【65】**As identified by phage ELISA， anti-CD20e7， anti-CD20b1and anti-CD20fl were expressed， and the antibodies were highly soluble and did not aggregate.

Size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex75 column generated single symmetric peaks at the expected elution position of a monomeric molecule with a molecular weight of 15 kDa， which is the average molecular weight of heavy chain variable domains. On a calibrated Superdex75 column，anti-CD20e7，anti-CD20b1， and anti-**\n\n【66】**CD20f1 antibodies were eluted from 12.5 mL to 13.5 mL， which was equivalent to 15 kDa (Figures 4).

All obtained binding constants were in the nanomolar range (10-6to10-7). According to the kinetic model， anti-CD20f1 showed the highest affinity to CD20， which has a computed Kd of 8.23×10. However， anti-CD20f1 VHH showed higher affinity to CD20 than anti-CD20e7 or anti-CD20b1 (Table 2).**\n\n【69】**Antigen binding specificity of the purified VHH**\n\n【70】**The three sdAbs were therefore tested for competition with CD20to assess the affinity of the antibodies and the concentration ofaction. The inhibition ratios of the three sdAbs significantly increased with**\n\n【71】**negative control.**\n\n【72】sdAbs concentrations (Figure 4)， which were compared with the negative control(anti-BAFF sdAb).\n\n【73】**Discussion**\n\n【74】**With advances in antibody engineering， monoclonal antibody fragments have been able to precisely select antigenic epitopes to achieve rapid access to dense tissues and inhibit local damage progression \\[11-13\\]. Different types of nanobodies have been used clinically for disease diagnosis and therapeutic agents. Recently， we have explored \"next generation\" therapeutic approaches for B-cell lymphoma using dose-dense chemotherapy regimens and immunotherapy via monoclonal antibodies.**\n\n【75】**Three mechanisms of action of anti-CD20 antibodies have been proposed \\[14\\]. First， in Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC)， the activation of the complement cascade and cell lysis through the formation of Membrane Attack Complexes (MAC) was caused by the first component of Complement (C1) binding to the Fc portion of the anti-CD20 molecule \\[15\\]. Second， in Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC)， anti-CD20 antibodies bind to the CD20 molecule， and natural killer cells or macrophages， which release effector molecules， such as perforin， bind to the Fc portion of the anti-CD20 molecule through Fcy receptors， resulting in cell lysis. Last， in direct cytotoxicity， the anti-CD20 antibody induces the internal signaling of apoptosis or other cell-death pathways within the tumor cells， causing antiproliferative effects or cell death \\[16\\]. Anti-CD20antibodies bind to an extracellular portion of the CD20 molecule. Most anti-CD20 antibodies， including rituximab， Tositumomab， and Obinutuzumab， bind to the larger of two extracellular loops within the CD20 molecule， this loop includes the Alanine-N-Proline (ANP) residues at positions 170 to 172.**\n\n【76】**The nanobody has the characteristics of low molecular weight， low immunogenicity， high stability， high solubility， high affinity， high specificity and high permeability for tumor target antigen， and this molecule can identify the unusual and unexposed epitopes \\[17-21\\]. Therefore， the early diagnosis ofnanobodies is particularly suitable for tumors or the preparation of special biological target tumor antigens to rituximab in drug treatments and is expected to make up for the lack of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma， provide new treatment options for the treatment of B cell lymphoma， and show broad application prospects.**\n\n【77】**In the present study， a novel therapeutic approach based onanti-CD20 VHH antibodies was developed. The purpose was to generate anti-CD20 sdAbs and to determine their biological effects. To our**\n\n【78】**knowledge， the present study is the first report of the effects of anti-CD20 sdAbs on B-cell lymphoma cells. Bacterially expressed recombinant CD20 was successfully produced and conveniently purified. After immunizing llamas with recombinant CD20 and constructing an immune phage library displaying the VHH antibody repertoire， three VHHs that bind to CD20 were identified after multiple rounds ofbiopanning. Anti-CD20e7，anti-CD20b1，and anti-CD20f1 bound to CD20 when expressed and purified from E. coli. The recombinant protein was suitable for use as an antigen in phage bio-panning for selecting phage clones that bind to the protein from the established VH/VHH phage display library \\[22，23\\]. According to the set positive criteria of the assays， 24VHH-phagemid-transformed E. coli clones were selected. DNA sequencing confirmed the high diversity of the obtained clones.**\n\n【79】**The immunized Llama VHH library was constructed. The choice of phage display strategy depends on the required affinity and the target application of the desired antibody \\[24-26\\]. The immune antibody library mainly originates from the specific antigens of the individual peripheral blood lymphocytes in the Llama in vivo via antigen stimulation of a highly mutated antibody， which increases the affinity by over ten or even several hundred-fold， so in the antibody library preparation and screening of the high positivity rate， it is easy to obtain better antibody specificity and high affinity \\[27-30\\]. Studies have attempted screening for anti-CD20-specific nanobodies from natural Llama-type nonimmune antibody libraries， but after four rounds of screening， the positivity rate of phage ELISA is relatively low， and it is difficult to select specific antibodies with high affinity， considering the main affected factors of nonimmune type antibody affinity and low output， despite subsequent affinity maturation. A series of methods are used to improve antibody affinity， but these methods are farless effectivethan the immune antibodylibrary. Halfof the antibodies in llama blood belong to VHH， which have light chains and CH1 regions of the heavy chain antibodies， while llamas aged 8to 12 months are in the strongest stage to resist the original stimuli， through which it is easy to produce antigen-specific antibodies. Due to the specificity of the molecular structure of heavy chain antibody， its apparent molecular weight in reducing SDS-PAGE is only 43 kDa， which is less than that of the ordinary 55-kDa heavy chain antibody. Therefore， Protein G affinity chromatography can be used to observe the production of unique heavy chain antibodies in llamas. To select the best immune antigen dose for subcutaneous injection to induce an immune effect， a moderate amount of the antigen was mixed with Freund's adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity of this molecule. The immune process and timely monitoring of serum antibody titers of Llamas can directly reflect the production of specific antibodies because of the direct impact of the quality of the antibody library. We fully considered the potential problems to focus on immune animals to ensure the quality of the anti-nanoscale antibody library.**\n\n【80】**The design of an appropriate selection strategy is equally important for the construction of immune phage library. Effective panning and gradual decreasing of the concentration of CD20antigen resulted in the isolation of the most specific VHHs during each panning. The diversity of antibodies in the antibody library determines the quality ofthe antibodylibrary. Blymphocytes undergo antigen stimulation， and most of these molecules differentiate into plasma cells that produce a large number of antibody molecules. The gene rearrangement mechanism is the basis of antibody molecular diversity. The random combination of antibody fragments at the DNA level can theoretically produce 108 different types of antibodies.**\n\n【81】**The variable regions of antibodies， particularly the different CDR regions， are the main reasons for the diversity of antibody molecules\\[31，32\\]. In the first round of PCR， we selected 11 different pairs of primers for VHH gene amplification by multiple degenerate primers to amplify Llama heavy chain antibody genes， which help to increase the diversity of the antibody gene. Moreover， the number of cycles in the two rounds of PCR amplification is controlled at 30 or more than35 cycles to avoid repeated amplification of dominant antibodies， generate redundant PCR products， and ensure the diversity of antibody libraries.**\n\n【82】**The three selected sdAbs possess unique characteristics in terms of their different CDR structures. More than 80% of the sequences for the three sdAbs share identity with the human VH domain， the main differences in amino acid sequence between the llama VHH and human VH are located in the CDRregions. The spatial conformation of antibody- and antigen-binding sites is determined by the length and amino acid composition of the complementary region of the antigen (CDR region). CDR3 is the important factor determining the variable sequence of antibodies. The nanoscale antibody has a long CDR3 area， which makes it possible to identify different epitopes and increase the affinity of nanoscale antibodies. Three strains of nano antibody affinity are different， and the main reason lies in that the CDR zone and FR zone configuration is slightly different， with some residues changed， making three monoclonal antibodies anti-CD20antibodies， namely， anti-CD20e7， anti-CD20b1， anti-CD20fl， that may recognize different epitopes， resulting in antibody affinity and biologically different functions.**\n\n【83】**In summary， three VHHs specifically recognize CD20 antigen. These clones could represent a new biotool for investigating the mechanisms of B-cell lymphoma and the development of alternative methods for CD20 diagnosis and may even be used as therapeutic agents to overcome the challenges of the current therapy.**\n\n【84】**Highlights**\n\n【85】**_1\\._ An immune Llama phage display library was constructed with phage display technology.**\n\n【86】**_2\\._ The anti-CD20 single-domain antibodies ((anti-CD20e7， anti-CD20b1 and anti-CD20f1) were selected from immune Llama phage display library.**\n\n【87】**_3\\._ Three anti-CD20 single-domain antibodies were produced at high yield in Escherichia coli and showed high affinity.**\n\n【88】**Acknowledgement**\n\n【89】**The present study was financially supported by grants from the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2014HQ008).

Second； the outer part or the annulus fibrous consists of several laminated layers of fibrocartilage made up ofboth type I and type II collagen \\[2-4\\]. The annulus fibrous contains the nucleus pulposus and it helps to distribute pressure evenly across the disc which prevents damage to the underlying vertebral endplates. Third； Vertebral end-plate， which is the upper and the lower surface of the vertebral body， consisted of hyaline cartilage， mostly type II cartilage， it anchors the intervertebral disc and it help to distribute the pressure across the vertebral body \\[5\\].**\n\n【16】**SNs mainly seen in the thoracolumbar spine， this is because of increased rotational motion and low disc to vertebral ratio in this region \\[6，7\\].To differentiate， spinal discherniation is either vertical as in SNs (intervertebral protrusion of the nucleus pulposus)， or horizontal as in intervertebral herniation through a weakened annulus fibrosus \\[8\\]**\n\n【17】**SNs can be an isolated finding， or it can be associated with intervertebral disc herniation. We reported a case of a middle-aged man who presented with a back pain， imaging studies showed both SNs and intervertebral disc herniation.**\n\n【18】**Case Presentation**\n\n【19】**A 41 years old，Middle Eastern， male， presents to our clinic with chronic back pain. The pain is progressively worsening，located at the right and left lower back， having a sharp quality， radiated to both legs (above the knees)， having a severity rated as +7/10 (10= worst)， being intermittently present and associated with marked limitation of physical activities， sleep disturbance， myalgia， paresthesia， lower extremities numbness and weakness. The pain worsens with prolonged work， rising in the morning， and walking upstairs. The pain decreases with rest， exercise， massage， and pain killer medications. The patient used NSAIDs and acetaminophen to improve the pain.**\n\n【20】**On examination， the patient is obese，BMI=31.24.On the lumbar spine， there was a decrease in strength and pain on deep palpation and on movement. Spinal flexion， extension， and rotation were intact. Neurological exams are normal.**\n\n【21】**Spinal X-ray showed nodular lucent lesion within L4. Abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast**\n\n【22】**reveals 2.1 cm lytic lesion within the L4 vertebral body appears to demonstrate sclerotic margin within the L4 vertebra， representing a Schmorl's node. MRI without contrast showed the following： At L3/L4 level， there is fluid collection in the facet joints， a left subarticular annular tear and a circumferential disc bulge measuring 4 mm producing moderate stenosis of the bilateral lateral recesses touching the bilateral L4 nerve roots and moderate bilateral neural foramen stenosis touching the bilateral L3 nerve roots. At L4/L5 level， there is fluid in the facet joints. At L5/S1， there is a mild disc space narrowing and asymmetric circumferential disc bulge， to the left measuring 4.5mm producing moderate stenosis touching the bilateral S1 nerve roots and moderate left neural foramen stenosis touching the bilateral left L5 nerve root. There is also abnormal strengthening of the normal lumbar spine curvature suggesting muscle spasm.**\n\n【23】**The patient was started on pain controlling medications(acetaminophen and ibuprofen)， heat pack， massage， and follow up. In addition， the patient instructed to maintain regular exercise and diet for weight loss.**\n\n【24】**Discussion**\n\n【25】**SNs developed as a result of the weakening of the vertebral endplates which can be due to acute， chronic， or embryogenic processes \\[9\\]. Acute processes include traumatic events， resulting in the occurren ce of SNs because ofthe axialpressure， as in motorcyclists accidents and gymnasts \\[10，11\\].**\n\n【26】**Chronic processes include a degenerative process， and the autoimmuneprocess. Chronic degeneration of the vertebral endplate， such as in osteoporosis， Paget’s disease， hyperparathyroidism， infections， tumors， and Scheuermann's disease， leads to weakening vertebral endplate and disc herniation into the vertebral body and development of SNs \\[6，9，12，\\]. The intervertebral disc (avascular tissue) exposure to the vertebral body (well-vascularized tissue) triggers an immune response. Therefore， the autoimmune process is not direct but results from other degenerative processes \\[13\\].**\n\n【27】**SNs can also be developed because of an error during embryogenesis. The interruption in the movement of the notochord， under the influence of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) gene， from the vertebral body to the intervertebral disc and formation the nucleus pulposus， can leave a space in the vertebral body resulting in herniation of the nucleus pulposus and formations of SNs \\[14\\].**\n\n【28】**SNs are more common in males than in females \\[14\\]. It can be asymptomatic and found as an incidental finding， or it can be presented as a lower back pain \\[15\\]. The gold standard modality to diagnose SNs is the MRI. According to the analysis of MRI imaging by Takahashi and et al. \\[15\\] in symptomatic cases， the cause of the pain in SNs is because of the herniation of the nucleus pulposus into the bone marrow of the vertebral body， which leads to inflammation and edema. However， the inflammatory radiological signs were not found in asymptomatic cases. Also， the MRI helps to rule out malignant bone lesions \\[16\\]. On Computed Tomography (CT scan)， SNs appears as a lytic bone lesion. The role of Plain radiograph in the diagnosis of SNs is limited； it cannot detect the inflammatory radiological signs； however， it can detect the calcification around the SNs \\[171.**\n\n【29】**Conservative treatment， including pain medications， exercise， weight loss， bed rest， heat pack， massage and physical therapy is the first-line treatment for disc herniation \\[18\\]. Several modalities**\n\n【30】**of intervention can be used in cases unresponsive to conservative treatment \\[9\\]， such as Lumbar spine fusion surgery of vertebral endplate \\[19\\]， rami communications nerve block by injecting 2mL of 1% mepivacaine and 10 mg of triamcinolone at gray ramus communications on each side \\[12，20\\]，Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha(TNF-a) blockade infusion \\[21\\]， and Percutaneous fluoroscopy assisted vertebroplasty \\[22\\].**\n\n【31】**In rare cases， SNs can precipitate infection. Kim et al. \\[23\\] reported a case of symptomatic SNs refractory to conservative treatment， and subsequent imaging showed enlargement of the cystic lesion. After surgical intervention， the histopathological report revealed osteomyelitis.**\n\n【32】**Meralgia paresthetica， a condition causing numbness and pain on the anterolateral thigh because of compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve \\[24\\]， can be misdiagnosed as spinal disc herniation(horizontal or vertical)， as both pathologies can be presented simultaneously， especially in obese patients， and careful physical exam can help to differential both cases.**\n\n【33】**Conclusion**\n\n【34】**SNs can be presented as an incidental and asymptomatic finding or it can be presented as chronic back pain， it can be presented as a solitary lesion of the vertebral end-pale at the thoracolumbar region， or it can be associated with horizontal disc herniation. First line treatment is conservative treatment， including physical therapy， weightloss， and pharmacological treatment； however， several surgical intervention options can be used in refractory cases.**\n\n【35】**References**\n\n【36】**l.

Pseudoaneurysm formation of the dorsal pedal artery following ankle arthroscopies has an incidence of 0，008% \\[2\\]. Recognition of this condition is challenging and this could impose treatment delay. The risk of vascular complications during ankle arthroscopies is mainly caused by the close anatomic relationship of the pedal arteries with the ankle joint capsule and because of anatomic variations \\[1\\]. We describe a case ofendovascular coil embolization of the dorsal pedal artery to exclude a pseudoaneurysm due to ankle arthroscopy. The treatment method we describe can help prevent long-term therapy and comorbidity， and has not been published as such in literature before.**\n\n【20】**_Citation：_**\n\n【21】**_1317._**\n\n【22】**A 57-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to our Emergency Department(ED) with complaints of a painful and swollen right ankle. Three days before the orthopedic surgeon performed an ankle arthroscopybecause ofankle impingement syndrome. Since compression ban dage was removedtwo days after the procedure the man experienced progressive swelling and pain of the ankle. The patient was treated with compression bandage. Four days later the patient presented to the ED because of persistent complaints of pain. Physical examination revealed erythema surrounding the operation wounds (Figure 1). Blood tests now revealed an elevated CRP of 40 mg/L and a WBC count of 10.4x10/L. The microbiologist was consulted and because an infected hematoma or septic arthritis with a (gram positive) skin agent was suspected， clindamycin (600 mg， 3 times a day) for 10 days was prescribed. At that moment， there was no indication for incision and drainage. Three weeks after the start ofantibiotic treatment the infection was controlled effectively with no infectious symptoms，but the patient complained about a local swelling on his foot. Physical examination revealed a pulsatile swelling on the dorsal side of the foot. Sonography confirmed a pseudoaneurysm of the dorsal pedal artery which measured 3 centimeters in diameter (Figure 2). The patient was admitted to our**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Presentation at the Emergency Department， 7 days after ankle arthroscopy.Redness and swelling of the dorsal foot.

Five weeks after the primary procedure we performed an arteriography (Figure 3) which showed the pseudoaneurysm， originating from the dorsal pedal artery without efferent flow out of the aneurysm (Figure 4). No evident aneurysm neck or orifice was recognizable. Arteriography revealed retrograde filling of the distal dorsal pedal artery from the pedal arch (posterior tibial artery and plantar arteries). Selective catheterization of the distal anterior tibial artery was conducted. Because the pedal arch and the distal pedal artery were vascularized properly out of the posterior tibial artery， during the same procedure endovascular micro-coil embolization of the dorsal pedal artery was done to exclude the pseudoaneurysm(Figure 5A， fibered platinum 3.3 mm coil， VortX； Boston Scientific， Natick， MA). Post embolic arteriography showed no flow in the former aneurysm (Figure 5B). Although peripheral coil embolization can be complicated with dislocation of the coils， ischemia and**\n\n| **Figure 4： Arteriograph showing the pseudoaneurysm of the dorsal pedalartery.

The patient had a prosperous recovery without swelling or pain complaints whatsoever. Doppler sonography confirmed the absence of the pseudoaneurysm and the patient was discharged after three months follow-up.**\n\n【32】**Discussion**\n\n【33】**Pseudoaneurysms develop in damaged vascular walls. Most pseudoaneurysms are iatrogenic of origin and usually result from vascular interventions \\[3\\]. Pseudoaneurysm formation after ankle arthroscopy is a condition hard to recognize and the timeframe to diagnosis can range to several months. Delay in treatment can lead to risk of rupture， hemarthros and compression neuropathy \\[4\\]. The risk of vascular complications during ankle arthroscopy is mainly caused by the close anatomical relationship of the pedal and crural arteries with the ankle joint capsule， the anatomic variations in vessel position and the choice of trocar placement \\[1\\]. When physical examination is inconclusive in detecting a pseudoaneurysm of the dorsal pedal artery， ultrasound presents a noninvasive， relatively cheap and accurate diagnostic tool for diagnosing pseudoaneurysms\\[5\\]. Other modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomogram angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can also play a role in detection of aneurysms\\[6，7\\]. Performing conventional angiography allows an intervention in the same procedure. We recommendphysical examination combined with duplex ultrasound (Table 1).**\n\n【34】**The choice of treatment of pseudoaneurysms depends on size，**\n\n【35】**location， and associated symptoms \\[3\\]. In the recent past several methods of treatment for pseudoaneurysms have been described in the literature， for example open surgical treatment with an autologous interposition vein graft， compression therapy， stent-graft implantation and thrombin injections \\[3，8\\]. Ultrasound-guided thrombin injections have shown to be useful， but its use in smaller， distal arteries are less supported. Also， it can be complicated with iatrogenic embolization of the plantar arteries \\[9，10\\]. Though compression therapy may be successful， it is painful，time-consuming， it can be complicated with aneurysm rupture and it is associated with frequent failures in treatment \\[10\\]. Endovascular treatment with covered stents allows vessel preservation， but it is not favored because of low patency rates in small size vessels and in relatively young patients \\[8，11，12\\].**\n\n【36】**Minimally invasive treatment such asendovascularcoil embolization has proven to be an alternative for surgical repair. It can be performed along diagnostic arteriography and has been described with good results.9 Advantages are lower complication rates， rapid recovery and no need for lifetime anticoagulative treatment as in venous interposition grafting \\[3，8，9\\]. Despite this， the use of endovascular embolization has not been described for treating a similar complication as we encountered. Embolization of the dorsal pedal artery is potentially harmful when an artery of the foot is affected by peripheral arterial disease. However， when other runoff vessels are patent， there is no evidence that embolization of a single vessel will do harm \\[5\\]. Our patient did not have relevant vascular risk factors. Regarding our case， we suggest that arterial injury caused by trocars along with attempted hemostasis and weight bearing lead to aneurysm formation. The damaged dorsal pedal artery maintained the pseudoaneurysm. Contemplating a venous interposition graft on a damaged，poor run-off vessel would not be credible. Taking in mind the limitations of alternative treatments along with our experience with endovascular embolotherapy， we favored embolization to abolish the pseudoaneurysm and prevent further harm.**\n\n【37】**Conclusion**\n\n【38】**Dorsal pedaallartery pseudoaneurysm formation iIsSarare complication of aankle arthroscopythat can have significant**\n\n【39】**complications. In the case of abnormal swelling following ankle arthroscopy， this diagnosis has to be taken into account. Several treatmentoptions have been described inliterature before. We treated the patient with endovascular coil embolization， a minimally invasive technique which showed good results without any complications. What this report adds to the existing literature is that endovascular coil embolization of a damaged dorsal pedal artery can be a treatment option for pseudoaneurysms in patients with well vascularized lower limbs and no vascular risk factors.**\n\n【40】**Inform ed Consent**\n\n【41】**Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

The etiological agent was streptococcus pneumonia， a rare cause in the age of pneumococcal vaccination.**\n\n【13】**Case Presentation： An elderly gentleman presented with non-specific chest pain. He was suspected to have had a myocardial infarction， treated as such， but was then found to have pyopericardium. There was rapid progression of the disease which led to cardiac tamponade and obstructive shock. Following emergency drainage， refractory septic shock ensued.**\n\n【14】**Conclusion： The case report highlights key differences and similarities in history， clinical examination and investigations between pericarditis and myocardial infarction. Finally， we conclude with a discussion based on a literature review focused on pyopericardium.**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Acute pericarditis is defined as inflammation of the pericardium which resolves within 6 weeks. Pyopericardium is the presence of pus within the pericardial sac. Pyopericarditis is invariably fatal without administration of antibiotics. Broad spectrum antibiotics have decreased mortality rates to 40%\\[1，2\\]. The most common cause of bacterial pericarditis is Gram-positive cocci from direct intra-thoracic spread. The case report was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee(HREC) (Certificate No.M180581).**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 54 year old gentleman presented at 09：00 to an Emergency Department (ED) with acute-onset central chest pain and non-radiating epigastric pain (grade 10/10)； associated with dyspnea. He had a 30 pack year history of smoking and lived a sedentary lifestyle. He had no fever， syncope or any preceding events leading up to presentation to the ED. He had no medical (hypertension， hyperlipidemia or diabetes) or family history of cardiovascular disease.**\n\n【19】**The initial clinical examination showed an overweight man. He was fully conscious but distressed. He was apyrexial， hypotensive (96 mmHg/58 mmHg) and maintained oxygen saturation above 96% on 4 L/min nasal prongs.**\n\n【20】**Further examination revealed no jugular vein distension， no muffled heart sounds and clearlung field auscultation. The first Electrocardiogram (EKG) is reported to have a regular pulse rate of 91/min with ST-segment elevation ofleads V2-V6，limbleads I， AVL， III and reciprocal ST-depression of AVR. At this point， an anterolateral Myocardial Infarction (MI) was suspected. An initial transthoracic 2-dimensional echocardiogram (echo) was unobtainable. Chest radiography showed no abnormalities of the lung fields but an increased cardiothoracic ratio. Given that Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) would not be achieved within 90 min from presentation (door-to balloon time)， it was decided that the patient would benefit from thrombolysis. Serial EKG's were performed and the patient reported relief of the chest pain.**\n\n【21】**Once stable， the patient was transferred to a facility capable of PCI. Upon arrival he was hemodynamically stable and not in cardiac failure， however， his chest pain was assessed as 7/10. The first echo performed revealed an ejection fraction >50%， hypokinesia of the anterolateral wall， as well as a small pericardial effusion. Subsequently a coronary angiogram (5 h after initial**\n\n【22】**presentation) discovered a distal segment filling defect of the right coronary artery which was recanalized for suspicion of a thrombus. However， on retrospective analysis the EKG changes were discordant to the angiogram findings.**\n\n【23】**At 15：00， post-procedure， he was transferred to the cardiac care unit. Six hours after transfer his Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) worsened with an increase in serum creatinine from 239 umol/l to 472 umolA(no premorbid creatinine available). During this period the high sensitivity Troponin-T level increased from 45 ng/L to 82 ng/L.**\n\n【24】**At 24：00， a rapid deterioration to shock. A repeat EKG showed ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V6，IandAVLwith electrical alternans. The cardiologist performed an echo which showed a significant pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. An emergency echo-guided needle pericardiocentesis aspirated 360 ml of foul-smelling， thick， green， purulent fluid which was sent for Gram stain and culture (MC&S). No drain was left in-situ. Post-pericardiocentesis the patient's hemodynamics improved. The gram-stain revealed gram positive diplococci. Antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) and colchicine were commenced.**\n\n【25】**Over the following 24 h the patient developed multi-organ failure. His level of consciousness deteriorated and he developed type 1 respiratory failure. He was intubated， mechanically ventilated， vasopressor support initiated and transferred to Intensive Care Unit(ICU).**\n\n【26】**He was in septic shock requiring high-dose vasopressor support(epinephrine at 0.8 rg/kg/min). Investigations were performed to isolate a primary source of infection； including chest X-ray， urine studies and blood cultures. Steroid therapy was initiated and antibiotic regimen changed to tazobactam-piperacillin (loading dose followed by continuous infusion). The choice of antibiotic was empirically based on a community-acquired gram positive organism and to optimize antibiotic concentrations above Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations(MIC) as per ICU protocol. Due to the hemodynamic instability， severe metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia that persisted despite medical therapy； sodium bicarbonate infusion was initiated. Hemodynamic management was guided by passive leg raise testing and stroke volume variation using continuous invasive hemodynamic monitoring. A repeat echo， in light of continued deterioration， showed recurrent tamponade. Due to the viscosity of the purulent fluid； repeat echo-guided needle pericardiocentesis was unsuccessful. An emergency pericardial window was performed by the surgical team. A further 1000 ml of purulent fluid was drained and sent for MC&S. Marginal hemodynamic improvement enabled initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy for refractory metabolic acidosis， hyperkalemia and anuria. At this stage， the creatinine had increased to 696 umol/l while the procalcitonin was 909 ug/l. Despite these interventions； vasopressor requirements increased over 24 h.A calcium infusion was started for hypocalcemia and positive inotropic effects. Thiamine given for increasing lactate levels. The pericardial drain output was approximately 900 mL/24 h. An echo showed very poor cardiac contractility. Without access to Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)； the patient ultimately succumbed to multi-organ failure.**\n\n【27】**The culture result received 24h after his demise reported asensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae， with a MIC<0.03 ug/ml to Cefotaxime， thus indicating that tazobactam-piperacillin was appropriate empiric treatment.**\n\n【28】**The post-mortem results indicated the presence of an occult pneumonia and thick purulent and hemorrhagic exudate on the epicardium.**\n\n【29】**Discussion**\n\n【30】**Pyopericardium has an incidence rate of approximately 1/18000cases ofpericarditis. It remains a fatal condition due to tamponade and septic shock. The most common bacterial causes of pyopericarditis _are Staphylococcus aureus， Streptococcus pneumoniae， Haemophilus_ influenza and anaerobic organisms. The incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae has decreased (51% to 9%) over the past 2 decades， following the roll out of the pneumococcal vaccine \\[2\\]. Pericarditis secondary to Streptococcus preumoniae occurs predominantly in children and young adults with a likely source of infection i.e. pneumonia (93%). However， recent studies have shown the average affected age has increased to 49 years of age \\[2\\]. It has been claimed that it is not a true primary infection but due to hematogenous or direct spread from a non-radiologically significant pneumonia or other occult infection.**\n\n【31】**Acute pericarditis presents with increasing severity of chest pain that is worse in the recumbent position， fever and other non-specific inflammatory symptoms (tachycardia， altered level of consciousness and dyspnea). Clinical examination can reveal a pericardial friction rub， pulsus paradoxus and the classical Beck’s triad of systemic hypotension， Kussmaul's sign (paradoxical rise in jugular venous pressure during inspiration) and muffledheart sounds on auscultation\\[3，4\\].**\n\n【32】**EKG changes are revealing； typical changes including sinus tachycardia， widespread ST-elevation (saddle shaped ST-segment)， reciprocal ST depression in lead AVR (+- V1)， Spodick’s sign(downward sloping TP segment)， PR depression， flattened or inverted T waves and/or electrical alternans (Table 1). It is， however， important to note 10% to 35% of patients may have a normal EKG.**\n\n【33】**Ultimately an echocardiogram revealing a pericardial effusion confirms the diagnosis and while diastolic chamber collapse (right atrial and/or ventricular) indicates tamponade\\[5\\]. Troponin concentrations may rise in many forms of cardiac injury including pericarditis. Other relevant investigations are a full blood count， renal functions，inflammatory markers (C-reactiveprotein， procalcitonin) and blood cultures. An angiogram assists to exclude a myocardial infarction， if suspected \\[4\\]. Further investigation based on the suspected primary source of the acute pyopericarditis may be appropriate.**\n\n【34】**To confirm the diagnosis of acute pericarditis the patient must meet 2 of the following 4 criteria： Typical chest pain， pericardial friction rub， typical EKG changes and new or worsening pericardial effsion.**\n\n【35】**The treatment of pyopericardium incorporates medical and surgical interventions and the urgency of intervention determined**\n\n【36】**Table 1： Steps to distinguish pericarditis from STEMI \\[16\\].**\n\n|  | **Relevant electrocardiogram feature**  | **Presence**  | **Likely** **diagnosis**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **1**  | **Is there ST depression in a lead other than** **AVR or V1?**  | **Yes**  | **STEMI**  |\n| **2**  | **Is there convex up or horizontal ST elevation?**  | **Yes**  | **STEMI**  |\n| **3**  | **Is the ST elevation greater in Ill than II?**  | **Yes**  | **STEMI**  |\n| **4**  | **Is there PR depression in multiple leads**  | **Yes**  | **Pericarditis**  |\n\n【38】**Hz).**\n\n【39】**by the presence of tamponade. The medical management includes broad spectrum antibiotics for 2 to 4 weeks. Antibiotic choice guided by the most commonly associated pathogens. Provided there are no contra-indications， these of colchicine and ibuprofen are advocated for analgesia. The anti-inflammatory effects of colchicine have been proven to expedite resolution of primary pericarditis as well as prevent recurrences by up to 50%， but use in pyopericarditis not yet studied. It is recommended as first line therapy for up to 12 weeks \\[6\\].**\n\n【40】**Early corticosteroid use may actually increase the risk of relapse \\[6\\]. Low dose corticosteroids are suggested in septic shock； if fluid and vasopressor therapies are not able to restore adequate hemodynamics. The presence of sepsis and tamponade result in a complex hemodynamic state with a combination of obstructive and distributive shock. The sepsis induced myocardial dysfunction will include poor systolic function， diastolic dysfunction and vasoplegia. Hemodynamic management is not trivial and requires advanced continuous hemodynamic monitoring. Veno-arterial ECMO may be useful for hemodynamic failure in septic shock.**\n\n【41】**Urgent source control is a priority and would include ultrasound guided emergency pericardiocentesis for tamponade and definitive surgical pericardiotomy or a pericardial window if thick purulent fluid proves difficult to drain percutaneously.**\n\n【42】**Important complications of pyopericardium are septic shock， cardiac tamponade with obstructive shock， recurrent pericarditis and constrictive pericarditis (Figures 1-4).**\n\n【43】**Figure 3： Electrocardiogram prior to pericardiocentesis (25 mm/s， 10 mV，50 Hz).**\n\n【44】Figure 4： Purulent fluid aspirated by echa-guided needle pericardiacentesis.\n\n【45】**Conclusion**\n\n【46】**Acute bacterial pericarditis is a diagnosis that requires a high-index of suspicion and is often accompanied by an associated primary infection. EKG changes need to be carefully scrutinized and the echo performed timorously to differentiate between acute myocardial infarction (cardiogenic shock) and acute pericarditis with cardiac tamponade (obstructive shock).**\n\n【47】**Despite adequate drainage， cardiac tamponade from pyopericardium may well progress to refractory vasodilatory septic shock requiring ECMO.**\n\n【48】**Permissions**\n\n【49】**1\\.

Preoperative diagnosis can be difficult， particularly， in case of thyroidal nodule without clinical or biological signs of hyperparathyroidism. We share our experience with a case of metastatic intrathyroidal PC， in a 53 year-old female， mistaken for a thyroidal tumor. Histopathological examination with immunohistochemical staining confirmed the diagnosis of PC. Signs of hyperparathyroidism should be routinely searched in the presence of thyroidal nodule. Surgery is the mainstay of the management of this pathology with close surveillance.**\n\n【12】**Introduction**\n\n【13】**Parathyroid Carcinoma (PC) is an uncommon malignant endocrine neoplasm which accounts for less than 1% of all cases of primary hyperparathyroidism \\[1\\]. PC arising from thyroid gland is an extremely rare entity \\[2\\]. To our knowledge， 25 cases have been reported in English Medical Literature. The preoperative diagnosis of intrathyroid PC can be difficult and made at later stages， especially in the absence of hypercalcemia. We share our experience on an unusual case of metastatic intrathyroid PC， with normal serum calcium level， revealed during venous thrombosis investigation.**\n\n【14】**Case Presentation**\n\n【15】**A 53 year-old female， with no medical history， presented to the emergency room with 5 days of painful swelling of the right limb. A deep venous thrombosis was confirmed by color Doppler ultrasonography and the patient was referred to the cardiology department. During investigation， the patient reported bone pain and progressive deterioration of general status. A chest-abdomen-pelvis Computed Tomography (CT) scan was performed revealing left thyroid nodule and multiple osteolytic lesions suggesting bone metastasis.**\n\n【16】**Neck examination showed firm left thyroid nodule. Neck ultrasonography demonstrated a 3cm mildly hypoechoic left thyroid nodule with an oval shape and regular margins， classified EU-TIRADS 4 (Figure 1). Laboratory examination revealed normal levels of thyroid hormones. Serum calcium was at the high limit of normal range (2.5 mmol/l) with normal serum phosphorus and normal renal function. There were no signs or symptoms of hypercalcemic crisis such as nausea， vomiting or confusion.**\n\n【17】**The patient underwent surgery. During neck exploration， a firm mass was distinctly part of the left thyroid without a plane between the tumor and the thyroid lobe. Three normal-sized parathyroid glands were identified. En-bloc resection of the left thyroid lobe was performed. The intraoperative rapid pathology demonstrated malignancy features suggesting follicular thyroid carcinoma； a total thyroidectomy was then performed. There were no lymph nodes during exploration.**\n\n【18】**Final histopathological examination showed neoplastic epithelial cells， predominantly chief cells associated to oxyhil ones in solid arrangement with mitotic figures (<5 mitoses/10 high-power fields) (Figure 2A). Capsular invasion was observed. Immunohistological staining of tumoral cells showed strong positive chromogranin expression (Figure 2B)， while thyroglobulin (Figure 2C) and calcitonin (Figure 2D) were negative； thus confirming that the tumor cells were parathyroid in origin. Osteolytic lesions on CT scan were thought to be related to bone metastasis and initial venous thrombosis to paraneoplastic syndrome.**\n\n【19】**Postoperatively， the patient presented hypocalcemia. A supplementation with intravenous and oral calcium as well as calcitriol and levothyroxine was started. The patient was discharged on the7h postoperative day with an appointment for 99mT sestamibi scintigraphy. Unfortunately， the**\n\n【20】**Figure 1： Ultrasonography showing a 3 cm mildly hypoechoic left thyroid nodule with an oval shape and regular margins， classified EU-TIRADS 4.**\n\n【21】**Figure 2： A) Histopathological examination showing neoplastic epithelial cells in salid arrangement with few mitatic figures.

D) Negative expression of calcitonin.**\n\n【22】**patient was not compliant and she refused any further exploration or treatment.**\n\n【23】**Discussion**\n\n【24】**PC is a rare malignant endocrine neoplasm. Less than 1000cases of PC have been reported in the English Medical Literature\\[3\\] and only 25 cases with intrathyroidal localization. To the best of our knowledge， our patient is the first reported intrathyroidal PC revealed by paraneoplastic syndrome and the second reported one with normal serum calcium2\\].**\n\n【25】**Parathyroid glands can be located in ectopic sites in some individuals. This event is due to faulty migration from the third and fourth branchial pouches， during embryogenesis， leading to the formation of mediastinal， pharyngeal or intrathyroidal parathyroid glands \\[3\\]. The latter is considered the most uncommon site of ectopic gland (0.2%)\\[2\\].**\n\n【26】**Patients with PC are usually severely symptomatic at the time of presentation with severe hypercalcemia， while patients with normal level of serum calcium are extremely rare (2%)\\[2，4\\]. This may lead to diagnosis at later stages and thus a poorer prognosis. In**\n\n【27】**our case， there were no symptoms related to hyperparathyroidism； serum calcium was at the high limit of normal range and venous thrombosis， related to paraneoplastic syndrome， revealed metastatic disease. A palpable mass can be found， as in our case， in 30% to 75%of patients with PC \\[1\\]. Most cases of intrathyroidal PC reported palpable thyroidal nodule at presentation， making confusion with a thyroidal tumor， especially in the absence of clinical or biological signs ofhyperparathyroidism \\[1-3\\].**\n\n【28】**The diagnosis of PC is suspected in the presence of biological and imaging criteria. However， the final diagnosis is based on histological analysis. Preoperative localization of parathyroid lesions is mainly based on neck ultrasound and especially 99mT sestamibi scintigraphy. The combined use of ultrasonography with sestamibi scintigraphy has a sensitivity of 95% vs. 80% for sonography alone and87% for scintigraphy alone \\[5\\]. Recently， 11C-methionine PET/CT or18F-fluorocholine PET/CT have been shown as useful second-line imaging tools in patients with negative or discordant conventional imaging modalities \\[6，7\\].**\n\n【29】**Unfortunately， to distinguish PC from adenomasSis still challenging. Architecturally， the PC shows a solid to trabecular growth pattern. Histopathologically， it can show islands of tumor cells separated by thick fibrous bands， tumor cell necrosis， capsular， vascular and perineural invasions. Moreover， increased mitotic activity， high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio， irregular nucleoli and perinuclear halos indicate malignancy \\[4，8\\]. Furthermore， adjacent tissues invasion， lymph or distal metastases are suggestive of carcinoma 2，4，8.**\n\n【30】**The other challenge for the pathologist is to distinguish thyroid (follicular and medullary thyroid carcinomas)from parathyroid malignancies. As in our case， immunostaining for PTH， chromogranin， thyroglobulin and calcitonin can be successfully used. Indeed， PC malignancies are immunoreactive for PTH and chromogranin and not for thyroglobulin and calcitonin \\[9\\].**\n\n【31】**Surgery is currently the only effective treatment modality of PC. It requires an “en-bloc\" resection of the tumor and an ipsilateral thyroid lobectomy with gross clear margins as well as remove of involved structures or local metastatic lymph nodes \\[1，3，10\\]. PC is usually radio-resistant \\[1\\]. In the absence of effective chemotherapy regimen， adjuvant chemo-radiation is useless \\[1\\].**\n\n【32】**After surgery， long term surveillance is required to detect persistent or recurrent PC. Besides， PTH andcalcium levels monitoring， imaging follow-up is based mainly on 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT. Recently， the role of 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT has been demonstrated， particularly in early stages \\[11\\]**\n\n【33】**Conclusion**\n\n【34】**Intrathyroidal parathyroid carcinoma is an extremely rare entity. In the presence of thyroidal nodule， clinical and biological signs of hyperparathyroidism should be routinely assessed. Localization of ectopic parathyroid gland is mainly based on ultrasonography and 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy. Surgery is the mainstay of the management of this pathology. Close clinical， biological and radiological follow-up is mandatory because of the high risk of reciirrence.**\n\n【35】**References**\n\n【36】1\\. Alharbi N， Asa SL， Szybowska M. Kim RH， Ezzat S.

An automated MRSI processing protocol calculated the metabolite peak area， which was analyzed to compare the patients and the volunteers.**\n\n【23】**Results： Although proton MRS with a 144 ms TE could detect choline with better sensitivity than MRS with a 35 ms TE， the choline content was lower in patients than that in volunteers， and the sensitivity of MRS with a 35 ms TE to lactate/lipids was significantly higher than that of 144 ms MRS. The detection baseline of MRS was more constant in the 35 ms MRS than in the 144 ms MRS Regardless of the subtype of maxillofacial carcinoma， the content of lactate/lipid appeared to be increased in the 20 patients (p<0.001) compared to that in the healthy volunteers. One year after treatment， the content of lactate/lipid returned to the baseline level in 8 patients and was reduced in 5 patients.**\n\n【24】**Conclusion： Our data have demonstrated that MRSI with a 35 ms TE better reveals the content of tumor metabolites， specifically lactate/lipid， suggesting that MRSI with a 35 ms TE can be used to monitor specific metabolites for tumor diagnosis and assess therapeutic response.**\n\n【25】**Keywords： H-Magnetic resonance spectroscopy； Metabolites； Time of echo； Maxillofacial carcinoma**\n\n【26】**Introduction**\n\n【27】**Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer \\[1\\]. Glucose and glutamate uptake are dramatically enhanced to meet the demands of rapidly growing malignant tumor cells \\[2\\]. A shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis and the conversion of pyruvate to lactate for energy production is favored by cancer cells even in the presence of freely available oxygen. This phenotype， termed aerobic glycolysis， is also known as the “Warburg effect”\\[3\\] and is a widely accepted metabolic feature of cancer \\[1\\]. Metabolites catalyzed by nutrients， such as lactate and choline， are increased in a tumor. Therefore， these abnormally accumulated metabolites could be used to monitor tumor treatment or serve as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis.**\n\n【28】Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) are complementary techniques applied in clinical practice. MRI displays tumor morphology，while MRS provides the biochemical information necessary for understanding the disease’s physiology and\n\n【29】**metabolism \\[4\\]. Choline， creatine and lactate/lipid are metabolites often detected in tumors by MRS. Elevated lactate levels have been found by 'H-MRS in cancers such as brain， lung， thyroid \\[1，2\\]， colorectal and breast \\[5-91.In vivo Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI) provides a non-invasive modality for detecting metabolite changes in malignant tumors. Furthermore， lactate levels have been identified as strong indicators of tumor grade and poor prognosis in cancers of the brain， breast， lung， and liver \\[10-13\\]. Although MRSI was initially developed for the assessment of brain tumors in terms of diagnosis and treatment response monitoring， MRSI is an established imaging technique in multiple tumors including those in the brain， prostate， and breast \\[14\\].**\n\n【30】**The incidence of head and neck carcinoma is increasing， with approximately 650，000 new cases reported annually， and accounts for 2% to 4% of all malignancies worldwide \\[15\\]. Maxillofacial carcinoma is a major subtype of head and neck tumors； the shallow location of these tumors reduces the noise due to lipid， air and large vessels in MRS signals. Although MR/CT imaging is used to detect the dimension， invasion and metastasis of tumors， chemical changes in patients can be detected only by MRS. Therefore， maxillofacial carcinoma was chosen for the MRS-based analysis of metabolite alteration.**\n\n【31】**In this study， patients with maxillofacial carcinomawere examined by MRS， and the effect of the Time of Echo (TE)parameter(35 ms and 144 ms) on 'H-MRS imaging of lactate/lipids was analyzed and optimized. The distribution of lactate/lipids in maxillofacial carcinoma before and after therapy will also be analyzed by 'H-MRS imaging.**\n\n【32】**Methods and Materials**\n\n【33】**Patients**\n\n【34】**Twenty participants， recruited from June 15h， 2016 to December30h，2017，were informed of the content of the present study and gave consent for allprocedures. All maxillofacialtumorpatients involved in this study were pathologically diagnosed. The control group consisted of 10 healthy volunteers from a physical examination center who had no personal or family history of tumor or traumatic diseases. The 20patients were diagnosed with primary adenocarcinoma or Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) of grade I or II-III by punch biopsy. The age range of patients was between 20 and 85 years (Table 1). Subjects who could not complete the exam were excluded. Reasons for exclusion included the presence of motion artifact， metal implants， cardiac pacemakers， and claustrophobia. Thirteen patients were followed up for 12 months after surgery and radiotherapy. Detailed treatment information was available in the patients'files.**\n\n【35】**Inclusion criteria**\n\n【36】**(1) Patients with primaryoral squamous cell carcinoma confirmed by pathologic diagnosis and healthy volunteers， whose ages were from 25 to 80 years old， were selected for this study.

All tumors were scanned on a 1.5 Tesla high-resolution MRI scanner (GE Medical Systems， USA) with an8-channel birdcagetransmit-receive head coil. The protocol consisted of 1) a 3-plane localization sequence， 2) an axial T1 Weighted Imaging (T1WI) sequence， 3)) an axial T2 Weighted Imaging(T2WI) sequence， 4) an axial T1WI contrast-enhanced sequence for reference， 5) an axial MRSI sequence with multi-voxel PRESS. The PRESS scan parameters were as follows： Voxel thickness =10 mm， TE=35/144 ms， TR=1000 ms， Field of View (FOV)=18 cm， matrix= 18×18， scan time =528\"， peak SAR=1.0. All tumors were scanned by MRS at two TE values， 35 ms and 144 ms. Except for the TE value， all other parameters were held constant between the short TE and long TE scanning sequences. The manual uniform magnetic field was used before scanning to ensure the water formant Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) was less than 20 Hz.**\n\n【42】**Data analysis**\n\n【43】**Three Regions of Interest (ROI) inside the tumors of all patients were sampled. The data from the PRESS sequence were processed and analyzed on a Sun workstation (GE Medical Systems， USA). The data are presented as the mean ± Standard Deviation (mean ±SD). All data were statistically analyzed by the SPSS 22.0 software (IBM Analytics， USA). The differences between groups were assessed by Student's t-test； p<0.01 for all reported differences unless otherwise stated.**\n\n【44】**Results**\n\n【45】**MRS with 35 ms TE is more sensitive than MRS with long TE for the detection of lactate/lipid**\n\n【46】**All maxillofacial carcinomas in this study， 6 of which were from females and 14 of which were from males， were primary tumors. The10 healthy volunteers included 5 females and 5 males. To determine the effect of the TE (Time of Echo) parameter on the detection of metabolites by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)， Choline(Cho)， Creatine (Cr) and Lactate/Lipid (LL) were examined by MRS in maxillofacial carcinomas， which are in a body location that may reduce the noise from lipid， air and large vessels in the MRS signal.**\n\n【47】**All subjects were first scanned by routine MRI. The Regions of Interest (ROI) inside the tumor were selected based on the MRI imaging results. The levels of Cho， Cr and LL were analyzed by MRS with a TE of both 144 ms and 35 ms. As shown in Figure 1A， the baseline was uneven and the peaks of the three metabolites were low in the control group for a 144 ms TE. The lactate/lipid peak increased in the maxillofacial carcinoma group and formed a large bidirectional peak between 1.21 and 1.45 ppm for a 144 ms TE (Figure 1B). When the TE was changed to 35 ms， the signal baseline became steady， and the peaks for two of the metabolites were still low in the controls (Figure 1C). The LL peak changed into a single peak that was significantly higher in the maxillofacial carcinoma group than in the control group (Figure 1D)， suggesting that a 35 ms TE is more sensitive than a 144 ms TE for the detection of lactate/lipid by MRS.**\n\n【48】**Lactate/lipiddcontent is increased ir maxillofacial carcinoma**\n\n【49】**To determine whether the differences in metabolite content as measured by MRS with the two TE parameter values of 35 ms and**\n\n【50】**Figure 1： MRS with a 35 ms TE is more sensitive than MRS with a long TE for the detection of lactate/lipid.**\n\n【51】**A & B： The lactate content was analyzed in the tongues of the controls by MRS scanning with a 35 ms TE and a 144 ms TE.

The localization of each voxel was based on clinical evaluation， including pathology， T2WI or T1WI contrast-enhanced MR imaging(Figure 3A-3D). As shown in Figure 3E-3H， the MRS images visualized the lactate/lipid concentration and correctly displayed the lactate/lipid distribution. Consistent with the previous finding that changing the TE values changed the pattern of the MRSI \\[17\\]， the lactate/lipid concentration and distribution in the MRSI based on MRS with a 35 ms TE was more identifiable than that in the MRSI based on the longer TE (Figure 3G，3H).**\n\n【75】**Lactate/lipid levels were closely correlated with progression of maxillofacial carcinoma**\n\n【76】**Lactate content， as well as FDG uptake， is often used to distinguish benign tumors from malignant tumors. Moreover， lactate content is also a prognostic marker in cancer patients. Thus， we are particularly interested in the MRS detection of lactate in tumors. Since the lipid around the maxillofacial tumor is less changed in patients， the lactate/lipid signal most likely represents the lactate content variation， although we cannot separate the lactate signal from the lipid signal.**\n\n【77】**The correlation between lactate content and tumor progression was determined by MR spectroscopy in maxillofacialtumors. Thirteen patients were followed up， and lactate content was analyzed by MRS before and after surgery and radiotherapy. As shown in Figure 4， the lactate level was significantly decreased in all patients after therapy， suggesting that the tumors were effectively removed or eradicated and indicating a favorable prognosis.**\n\n【78】**Discussion**\n\n【79】**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a mature technology for the investigation of anatomical changes associated with malignant disease. Moreover， MR with Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) is used to evaluate tissue organization， while MR with Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced (DCE) imaging is utilized to assess tumor vascularity. Although PET is a major diagnostic method applied to detect chemical alterations in tumors， Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)/Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) offer the possibility to obtain more functional information about features such as tumor metabolites\\[18\\]. Thus， MRS/MRSI is very useful to clinicians.**\n\n【80】**MRS is based on the fact that protons in different molecules**\n\n【81】**resonate at slightly different frequencies. This difference is secondary to the differences in the local electron clouds， which may shield the nucleus from the main magnetic field. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can provide the structure， dynamics， reaction state and chemical environment of molecules based on the changes in resonance frequency from the spins of active nuclei (such as 'H，3P，\"’C， and \"F) activated by an external magnetic field. Different metabolites with the same nucleus exhibit characteristic shifts in resonance frequency. Duetothe abundance and universal distribution of hydrogen in the human body， 'H MRS is mainly used in the clinic to analyze steady-state metabolites in a noninvasive waythat provides data complementary to the anatomic and structural information generated by MRI \\[19，20\\]. Multi-voxel MRS imaging enables the investigation of a larger volume and multiple regions of a lesion.**\n\n【82】**Abnormally increased metabolites are potentialtumorbiomarkers\\[21，22\\]. MRS can directly assess metabolic changes in tumors \\[23\\]. For example， MRS has been applied for the initial diagnosis， tumor grading， imaging-guided biopsy and treatment response assessment of brain tumors \\[24\\]. In this study， multi-voxel MRSI was applied to examine the content of lactate in maxillofacial carcinoma and to monitor the therapeutic response. Our data showed that the lactate content at the tumor site was significantly decreased after surgery and radiotherapy.**\n\n【83】**Long TEs suppress the noise from air and lipids in tissues and are commonly used for metabolite detection \\[25\\]. However， MRS with a long TE is not sensitive to lactate/lipid. Short TE (Time of Echo) MRSI has been applied in brain tumors but has seldom been used in maxillofacial carcinoma. Here， we showed that lactate， a potential tumor biomarker， was more sensitive to detection with a short TE than with a long TE and that its signal was a single positive peak between 1.20 and 1.35 ppm. Furthermore， the short TE more accurately represents the accurate content of lactate content， and results in a better image quality. However， the MRS detection on lactate is limited to specific tumor type due to the noses from blood vessel and air.**\n\n【84】**Conclusion**\n\n【85】**As a non-invasive examination technique，'HMRS can accurately detect various metabolites in or around carcinomas. Using a 35 ms TE， the metabolite detection baseline was steadier and more sensitive than with a 144 ms TE. The pseudo color map directly revealed the density and distribution oflactate. Our prospective study showed that the density and distribution of lactate were closely correlated with tumor progression and outcome， suggesting thatlactate content could be a useful biomarker for the prognosis of maxillofacial carcinoma.**\n\n【86】**Acknowledgment**\n\n【87】**This study was supported by grants from the Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology (11DZ2260200) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81372194and 81572300) to Dr. Mi and from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81602509) to Dr.Xu.**\n\n【88】**References**\n\n【89】1\\.

It is hoped that the solutions proposed will be successfully adopted and used in health facilities.**\n\n【32】**Introduction**\n\n【33】**Strategies for integrating family planning and ART services for HIV-positive women in Ethiopia’s Oromia region are described.Data were gathered from HIV-positive women of reproductive age and healthcare practitioners that give ART/PMTC. It is aimed at outlining the vision， mission， overall goal， objectives， and underlying principles of the strategies. These will be followed by presenting strategies for strengthening the integration of family planning with HIV services for women of reproductive age living with HIV. Integrated health services are defined as the management and delivery of health services such that people receive a continuum of health promotion， disease prevention， diagnosis， treatment， disease management， rehabilitation， and palliative care services. People are cared for at different levels and sites of the health system， and according to their needs throughout their life course \\[3\\]. Similarly， strategies defined in Chapter 1 are concrete skills and activities for top managers and their corporate advisers， where there are matters of policy that lead to actions \\[4\\]. In the context of this thesis， the achievement of strategies leads to the achievement ofa broader strategy.**\n\n【34】**Accordingly， strategies are defined and described as a plan of action designed to achieve a long-term goal， a solution to a problem， or a method chosen to bring about the desired future presented in Chapter 1. This studyadopted a description ofstrategies to be activities or actions that the healthcare providers and program managers would engage in to enhance and facilitate the integration of family planning services with HIV treatment for women of reproductive age that are**\n\n【35】**on ART/PMTCT for better health outcomes. Such integration should also facilitate clinical practice through the implementation of feasible strategies within the context of Ethiopian healthcare facilities.**\n\n【36】**Vision**\n\n【37】**The long-term vision of integrated family planning with HIV care for women living with HIV in Ethiopia encompasses the long-term vision of women of reproductive age living with HIV being free of the threat of HIV and sexual reproductive health concerns by 2030.**\n\n【38】**Mission**\n\n【39】**Ethiopia is committed to rapidly and inclusively integrating family planning with HIV services. To build and reinforce linkages between family planning programs and HIV/AIDS prevention and care by fast-tracking multi-sectoral responses and scaling up prioritized actions to sexual reproductive health and HIV service needs in Ethiopia.**\n\n【40】**Overall goal， objectives of the strategies**\n\n【41】**The overall goals of these strategies are for the women living with HIV to receive integrated health services that strive to achieve the 9090 90. These include providing integrated sexual reproductive health services， such as family planning， as well as HIV prevention， therapy， and care， to end the AIDS pandemic by 2030. The purpose is also to improve the well-being of people infected with and impacted by HIV/AIDS by ensuring that no one is left behind. The goals of these strategies are to prevent unintended pregnancy and HIV infections， reduce vulnerability to HIV， improve the provision of family planning services， and offer dual contraceptive methods， treatment， care， and support for women of reproductive age living with HIV. The aim is also to mitigate the socioeconomic impact of unintended pregnancy and HIV/AIDS on individuals， families， communities，and the nation.**\n\n【42】**The objective of these strategies is to describe the strategies that would help the health system to overcome the problems and challenges in offering quality integrated family planning/HIV services. Preventing unintended pregnancy and HIV transmission can be achieved through dual protection which would improve the quality of life of women of reproductive age living with HIV and neonatal health.**\n\n【43】**Underlying principles of the development of strategies**\n\n【44】**The developed strategies put focus on addressing uncertainty and women's unmet need for family planning. It creates awareness and knowledge among HIV-positive and sexually active women of reproductive age about the importance of integrated family planning/HIV services. The study assumes that awareness and knowledge would， in turn， empower women to make choices about the use of family planning for better reproductive health outcomes.**\n\n【45】**The following principles of WHO \\[5\\] were considered when developing these strategies to reflect the core values of integrated health and family planning strategies among women living with HIV to establish better health outcomes.**\n\n【46】**Comprehensive offering care that is comprehensive and tailored to the evolving health needs and aspirations of women.**\n\n【47】**Equitable-providing care accessible and available to all**\n\n【48】**Sustainable： Delivering care that contributes to sustainable development.**\n\n【49】**Empowering： Supporting women of reproductive age to**\n\n【50】**manage and take responsibility for their health.**\n\n【51】**Continuous： Providing care and services across the life coiirse，**\n\n【52】**Co-produced through active partnerships with women of reproductive age living with HIV and peer educators， and mother-to-mother support groups at an individual， organizational， and policy level.**\n\n【53】**Evidence-informed that policies and strategies are guided by the best available evidence.**\n\n【54】**Respectful： Being respectful of women living with HIV's dignity， social circumstances， and cultural sensitivities.**\n\n【55】**Collaborative： Supporting relationship-building， team-based work and collaborative practice across primary，secondary， and tertiary care， and with other sectors.**\n\n【56】**Action within and between sectors that promote public health and health promotion should also be supported. Governed through shared accountability of care providers to local women of reproductive age living with HIV to improve the quality of care and health outcomes.**\n\n【57】**Leading by whole-systems thinking that views the health system as a whole and tries to understand how its parts interact with each other.**\n\n【58】**Ethical： By making sure that care optimizes the risk-benefit ratio in all interventions， respects the individuals right to make autonomous and informed decisions， safeguards privacy， and protects the most vulnerable.**\n\n【59】**Leading by whole-systems thinking： That views the health system as a whole and tries to understand how its parts interact with each other.**\n\n【60】**Ethical： By making sure that care optimizes the risk-benefit ratio in all interventions， respects the individual's right to make autonomous and informed decisions， safeguards privacy， and protects the most vulnerable.**\n\n【61】**Strategiesfor theIntegration of Family Planning with HIV Services for Women of Reproductive Age Living with HIV**\n\n【62】**Conceptual framework**\n\n【63】**Central to this study is the notion that contraceptives have been issued through family planning services in developing countries，1W primarily as a strategy to reduce fertility \\[6\\]. Revised laws on women's reproductive health rights call for adopting a women-centered health perspective to improve access to reproductive healthcare \\[7\\]. A woman-centered integrated health service conceptual framework was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for future health systems. The approach advocates for responding to the needs and preferences of individuals， families， and communities humanely and holistically. It includes integrated health services， managed and delivered in a waythat ensures people receive a continuum of care \\[5\\]. Future health systems describe the people-centered and integrated health' service framework as a fundamental shift in the way health services are funded，managed， and delivered. The approach advocates for responding to the needs and preferences of the individuals， families， and communities humanely and holistically \\[8，9\\].**\n\n【64】**The care is provided at different levels and sites within the health system based on people’s needs throughout their life. The integrated health services can cross sectors organizational structural， budgetary or administrative constraints， to reach efficient coordination and improved outcomes \\[10\\].**\n\n【65】**The main goal of women living with HIV-centered care is to achieve optimal experience and quality of care， quality of life， and positive health outcomes \\[11\\]. This care further requires that women have the education and support to make decisions， participate in care practices and goals， with their social determinants of health\\[5\\].**\n\n【66】**Integrated strategies centered on women ofreproductive ageliving with HIV are organized around the health needs and expectations of these women rather than diseases. Therefore， this study's findings are relevant in developing strategies to integrate family planning services with HIV treatment for women living with HIV to improve their reproductive health needs based on the integrated model \\[12\\].**\n\n【67】**The researcher hypothesized that the root causes of failure to provide integrated family planning/HIV care and treatment for women of reproductive age living with HIV are lack of awareness about HIV care and preventative services through comprehensive sexual reproductive health services in the context of family planning. The researcher has the view that integrated family planning and HIV services will lead to improvements in such services. In turn， improved outcomes can be expected， such as demands for family planning being met， untended pregnancy being prevented， and dual method/family planning utilization among women of reproductive age living with HIV.**\n\n【68】**Powers， Knapp， and Knapp \\[13\\] define deductive reasoning as a method of reasoning in which the premises are viewed as supplying strong evidence for the truth of the conclusions made， the way of thinking， or logical mental processes which begin with premises about a phenomenon and systematically formulate a conclusion. Based on this study’s design， a decision was taken to adopt the best medical practice by developing strategies using deductive reasoning to empower both the women of reproductive age living with HIV， their families， and the staff at the healthcare facilities as consumers of the strategies.**\n\n【69】**The context of the development of the strategies**\n\n【70】**Strategies for women living with HIV-centered integrated health services are applied in the following contexts \\[3-5\\]：**\n\n【71】**Tackling sexual reproductive health service problems， including the unmet need for family planning， unwanted pregnancy， and pediatrics new HIV infections. Close collaboration between health， social care， education， and the wider range of local services can all contribute to better health for women of reproductive age living with HIV.**\n\n【72】**Individualwomen1living with11HIV， families， and communities are at the center， placed within integrated family planning/HIV prevention， therapy， and care service delivery， to ensure universal and equitable health services.**\n\n【73】**Enabling policy environmentEsSthat strengthen1 the implementation and promote the integration of family planning programs with HIV prevention， treatment， and care， and paves the way for universal health.**\n\n【74】**Integrated family planning with HIV prevention， treatment， and**\n\n【75】**care is aligned to national reproductive health services including family planning per national health and development policies and strategies.**\n\n【76】**Approach to the development of the strategies**\n\n【77】**Suggest \\[10\\] that the five interdependent strategic directions that underline the people-centered integrated health services can transform health systems to provide more comprehensive holistic services for women ofreproductive age living \\[5\\]. A systematic review study conducted by \\[14\\] outlines salient lessons and challenges from five countries in sub-Saharan Africa which revealed that integrating sexual reproductive health and HIV services is proposed as a means to improve service performance and reduce costs. The most common challenges with integration are related to delayed or incomplete integration of higher-level health system functions. There is a lack of appropriate regulation and unified national policies and operational frameworks. It is being widely adopted as a national policy in sub-Saharan Africa， supported by international development partners14.**\n\n【78】**The five strategic directions include empowering and engaging theseewomen，strengtheninggovernanceaand2accountability， reorienting the model of care， coordinating services， and creating an enabling environment. These directions are intended to influence different levels， from the way services are delivered to women living with HIV， families， and communities.**\n\n【79】**Reorienting the model of care that is tailored according to sexual reproductive health services and family planning. Coordinating the family planning services and HIV programs. These strategic directions are intended to influence different levels， from the way services are delivered to women of reproductive age living with HIV， families， and communities， to changes in the way organizations， care systems， and policymakers operate.**\n\n【80】**Creating an enabling environment： Policies， strategies， and programs that strengthen the integration of family planning services with HIV prevention， treatment and care.**\n\n【81】**Figure 1 demonstrates the linkages between the strategic initiatives for integrated family planning with HIV services centered on HIV-positive women ofreproductive age.**\n\n【82】**Strategy1： Empoweringand engagingwomen reproductive age living with HIV**\n\n【83】**Empowering and engaging women living with HIV is about providing opportunities， skills， and resources to these women as users of health services. It is also about reaching the underserved and marginalized groups of the population to guarantee universal access to services. Family and peer educators should also be roped into the input and co-produce their health through the integration of sexual reproductive health services， including family planning/HIV services and chronic care of ART \\[5\\]. This goal seeks to unlock community and individual resources for action at all levels. It aims to enable communities to become actively engaged in co-producing healthy environments， providing care services， and contributing to healthy public policy.**\n\n【84】**Women living with HIV need to be harnessed to achieve better clinical outcomes through co-production of care， particularly for the integration of sexual reproductive health services (including family planning/HIV) with chronic care of ART. 97.1% of respondent’s preferred integrated sexual reproductive and HIV services at the same facility or site， and almost all (96.9%) preferred to receive HIV and Sexual reproductive health services from the same provider. This is fundamental because women of reproductive age living with HIV themselves will spend the most time living with and responding to their own health needs. This is because they will be the ones making choices regarding healthy behaviors and their ability to self-care. It is also about the care that is delivered in an equal and reciprocal relationship between clinical and non-clinical professionals and individuals using care services， their families， and communities \\[5\\].**\n\n【85】**Mother-to-mother support groups and peer educators should be empowered to voice their needs and influence how care is funded， planned， and provided. It helps build confidence， trust， mutual respect，and social networks because the women's physical and mental well-being depends on strong and enduring relationships. Reaching the underserved and marginalized is of paramount importance to guarantee universal access to health services. It is essential for fulfilling broader societal goals such as equity， social justice， and solidarity. It requires actions at all levels of the health sector， as well as intensive action with other sectors and all segments of society. Urgent action is needed to improve access to sexual reproductive health services for**\n\n【86】**women and girls in developing countries. It is essential for fulflling broader societal goals such as equity， social justice， and solidarity. It requires actions at all levels of the health sector， as well as intensive action from other sectors and segments of society \\[5\\].**\n\n【87】**Recommendations for empowering and engaging women of reproductive age living with HIV**\n\n【88】**Empowering and engaging women of reproductive age living with HIV， family， and peer educators to co-produce their health through the integration of sexual reproductive health services (including family planning with HIV services) with chronic care of ART is a responsibility of every sector. It can be implemented by adopting integrated family planning/HIV indicators in an interconnected sectoral approach. Program specifics include：**\n\n【89】**Developing and distributing tailored IEC/BCC materials(posters， leaflets， flyers， brochures， magazines) related to integrated family planning and HIV services to the community by using the local language.**\n\n【90】**Engaging women in planning， implementation， and evaluation of the integration of family planning-HIV services to empower them to decide on their choices regarding family planning/HIV. Utilizing health extension workers and mother-to-mother support groups to conduct intensive post-test counseling \\[15\\] aimed at strengthening counseling on dual contraceptive methods for effective protection of women and their partners. Moreover，partners are notified with permission.**\n\n【91】**In line with the WHO \\[16\\]， more HIV-positive people should be identified and their early referral to care in some settings should be promoted.**\n\n【92】**Encouraging partner or couple testing/male involvement.**\n\n【93】**Improving the integration of services such as the provision of ART in antenatal care.**\n\n【94】**Co-producing healthy lifestyles and sexual reproductive health.**\n\n【95】**Advocating for and convincing leaders to strengthen the integration of family planning/HIV services.**\n\n【96】**Shared clinical decision-making _号_ betweenVwomenOI reproductive age， families， and providers.**\n\n【97】**Self-management， including personal care assessment of family planning/HIV service utilization and sexual reproductive health service utilization plans with ART/PMTCT treatment plans.**\n\n【98】**Developing and promoting peer educator and mother-to-mother support group-based integrated family planning/HIV service assessment，counseling， and support programs.**\n\n【99】**Conductingannual patientSsatisfactionnsirveys to determine their level of satisfaction with integrated family planning/HIV services.**\n\n【100】**Ensuring health equity goals in terms of integrating family planning/HIV services into health sector objectives.**\n\n【101】**Conducting outreach services for the underserved， including mobile units with health extension workers to minimize transportation by providing one-stop comprehensive services fully integrated based on women's needs.**\n\n【102】**Community engagement to facilitate women living with**\n\n【103】**HIV's empowerment in terms of integrated family planning/HIV prevention，treatment， and care.**\n\n【104】**Expanding integration of family planning/HIV services to the primary healthcare-based systems to increase availability and accessibility.**\n\n【105】**Advocating for the mitigation and reduction of harmful sexual reproductive health and family planning cultural practices.**\n\n【106】**Monitoring peer educators and mother-to-mother support groups'engagement and support， and establishing a referral system.**\n\n【107】**Strategy 2： Strengthening governance and accountability for integration of family planning with HIV services， and HIV care**\n\n【108】**Good governanceis essential for economic growth，socialprogress， and general development. It is especially critical for healthcare systems， where the poorest members of society appear to have the least power and are disproportionately harmed by corruption.**\n\n【109】**Governancee anlddaccountability foruniversal， egalitarian， integrated family planning/HIV services， as well as HIV care interventions， entail policy discourse and appropriate governance procedures \\[5\\]. Governance and accountability for the provision of universal， equitable， integrated family planning/HIV services， and HIV care interventions involve policy dialogue， establishing good governance mechanisms， accountability， and leadership. In this regard， all associated sectors are responsible but the Federal Ministry of Health has to be mandated in terms of overall governance， coordination， accountability， and resourcing.**\n\n【110】**Recommendations for strengthening governance and accountability for the integrated family planning/HIV services and care**\n\n【111】**Establish standard operating procedures that guide the implementation of policies and guidelines to facilitate integrated family planning/HIV services， and revise the existing curriculum to incorporate the integrated services.

The anticipated outcomes would be sustainable financing for the integration of family planning/HIV services， and ensuring the availability of essential equipment and supplies for integrated family planning/HIV prevention， treatment， and care. There would also likely be increased sustainability and accessibility of integrated family planning/HIV services in universal health coverage.**\n\n【122】**Establish good governance and accountability for the provision of integrated family planning/HIV services and care by enhancing mutual accountability for financing and resourcing.**\n\n【123】**Strategy 3： Reorienting the care paradigm to include family planning and HlV services**\n\n【124】**Reorienting the model of care means ensuring that efficient and effective healthcare services are purchased and provided through models that prioritize primary and community care services.**\n\n【125】**In this case， it entails care that focuses on primary care； co-production of health through sexual reproductive health services especial family planning in the form of the holistic approach and integrated with HIV prevention， treatment， and care， mainly within the health sector \\[5\\].**\n\n【126】**Integrated family planning/HIV service programs that center on women of reproductive age living with HIV encompass the shift from inpatient clinical HIV/AIDS and unwanted pregnancy by abortion management.

To reiterate， the study explored the integration of family planning services with HIV treatment for women of reproductive age living with HIV and attending services for the provision of ART. The findings informed the development of strategies for better sexual reproductive health outcomes in the Oromia Region，Ethiopia.**\n\n【228】**Implications of the findings**\n\n【229】**Based on the findings， the researcher determined the following implications for clinical practice， education， and training**\n\n【230】**Implications for clinical practice**\n\n【231】**Many factors were identified that can contribute to the integration of family planning with HIV services， demands for family planning， contraceptive， and dual method utilization in the study setting； these need further research.

A recall bias among women， especially concerning missed appointments and pills， is a potentiallimitation to the study. Internal validity mayalso be tampered with due to temporal effects like the premature exit of respondents or measurement effects.**\n\n【257】**Strengths of the study**\n\n【258】**The strengths of this study were recorded in terms of the high response rate of 97.61% (654/670). Moreover， the researcher pre-tested the instruments， as discussed in Chapter 3， to overcome any measurement limitations \\[21，22\\]. Quantitative studies prefer large populations， and the population of this study was reasonably large； representative samples were selected by simple random sampling computer-generated method. The research design included obtaining the views from different subgroups of women of reproductive age living with HIV， service providers， focal persons， and Health office/Bureau managers of family planning/ART/PMTCT， on the availability of integrated sexual reproductive health services.**\n\n【259】**The strengths of the study concerning its contribution to the level of health theory**\n\n【260】**From the findings presented in \\[1\\]， the study demonstrated that the integration of family planning services with HIV services ranged from counseling on available family planning in the ART room to provisions of family planning methods such as condoms， pills， and the injectable methods. This included the provision of implants in the ART rooms and referring women in need of long-acting and permanent methods for consultation. The insertion of the IUD was not part of the family planning methods in this regard.**\n\n【261】**This study assessed the existing integration of sexual reproductive health services with HIV treatment for women living with HIV and attending ART in the Oromia Region， Ethiopia. Such integration ranged from the provision of maternal and family planning，neonatal health services， and health education on sexual reproductive health， combined with HIV services. Almost all women (97.1%) preferred integrating sexual reproductive health with HIV services at the same facility. Also， most of the providers (95%) were in favor of integrated family planning/HIV services. The factors related to the integration of family planning services with HIV treatment for women of reproductive age living with HIV were identified as educational status， occupational status， residence， discussed family planning with healthcare providers， fertility desire， counseled in family planning， and CD4 count. The study assessed the magnitude of demand for family planning among HIV-infected women and established that the demand for family planning among these women living with HIV was 96.3%， of which 16% had unmet needs for family planning while attending the monthly ART drug refilling and follow-up program.**\n\n【262】**The study thus indicates that reproductive health continues to be understudied as an integrated model. The study established that women of reproductive health status are not only affected by biological factors but are also a product of sociodemographic and cultural factors that are interrelated. This suggests the importance of the application of an integrated model analysis to address negative reproductive outcomes in the Oromia Region， Ethiopia.**\n\n【263】**Despite the fact that family planning services have made a significant contribution to the elimination of new pediatric HIV infections， few PMTCT programs have extended access to contraception for HIV-infected women and couples who do not intend to get pregnant. More widespread use of evidence-based approaches to integrated family planning/HIV care can boost family**\n\n【264】**planning's contribution to the elimination of new pediatric HIV infections. The strengths of the study concerning its contribution to the level of methodology.**\n\n【265】**At a methodological level， the quantitative survey， explorative， descriptive， and contextual research design with multiple data collection approaches was used to collect data. The positivist paradigm was used to understand the underlying causes of sexual reproductive health problems among women living with HIV and HIV services like therapy， prevention， and chronic care. This was achieved by using the integrated model on the service points of integrated family planning/HIV services that were obtained from literature as conceptual frameworks.**\n\n【266】**Deductivereasoning allowed the researcher to explore experiences of sexual reproductive health that exposed repeated unplanned pregnancy； the unmet need for family planning and other sexual reproductive problems like STIs and HIV infection with different viral strains. In a survey research design， the procedures used to select respondents are of utmost importance because the primary goal is to generalize the results from the respondents to the whole population of interest. The best procedure for obtaining a representative sample occurs when the researcher randomly selects respondents from a list of all members of the group \\[23，24\\].**\n\n【267】**_1上_ 1ecomprehensive qquuaantitative researchhdesignifurther demonstrated its relevance and appropriateness for investigating core issues relating to the need for a change in policy making from disease-centered organizations to women of reproductive age living with HIV-centered integrated familyplanning/HIV services based on their needs.**\n\n【268】**The strengths of the study to its contribution to the level of health policy**\n\n【269】**The developed strategies for women of reproductive age living with HIV-centeredintegrated1family planning/HIV services contribute to HIV programs of prevention， therapy， and sexual reproductive health problems to tackle these interrelated problems under comprehensive one-stop services provision.

The integration of sexual and reproductive health/HIV policies and services delivered by the same provider is prioritized worldwide， especially in sub-Saharan Africa， where HIV prevalence is highest. Therefore， the integration of family planning services with HIV treatment is the cornerstone of reproductive healthcare for seropositive clients to ensure their reproductive health and quality of life.**\n\n【275】**The results generated from this study helped to support the existing limited available knowledge regarding how to integrate family planning services with HIV treatment and its implementation among women living with HIV in the study area for evidence-based interyentions.**\n\n【276】**The study contributed to the existing body of evidence and knowledge about the integration of family planning services with HIV treatment for women of reproductive age that are on ART for better health outcomes. Implications for practice were established， as well as recommendations for the MOH and the ORHB in Ethiopia.**\n\n【277】**The results from this study were used to improve the availability of integrated family planning/HIV services and address certain knowledge gaps to facilitate clinical practice through the implementation of a feasible strategy. This enabled the policymakers， health managers， planners， and healthcare providers to plan implement and evaluate the integration of family planning services with HIV treatment for women living with HIV as interventions for their healthcare facilities.**\n\n【278】**The study's findings emphasized the critical need to properly implement integrated familyplanning/HIV services for HIV-positive women of reproductive age attending ART clinics. The researcher also emphasized the importance of strengthening health centers capacity to provide quality family planning and HIV services. Based on the findings， the researcher proposed that service providers’ capacity building be improved through training on the integration of sexual reproductive services including family planning with HIV services for people living with HIV. The main contribution of the study to the level of women of reproductive age living with HIV follows：**\n\n【279】**Make informed choices about their sexual and reproductive health.**\n\n【280】**Represent an opportunity for women to pursue additional education and participate in public life， including paid employment in non-family organizations.**\n\n【281】**Prevent closely spaced and ill-timed pregnancies and births， which contribute to reducing infant and maternal mortality.**\n\n【282】**Reduce adolescent pregnancies. This has long-term implications for them as individuals， their families， and their communities.**\n\n【283】**Reduce the risk of unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV， resulting in a reduction in the need for unsafe abortions and fewer infected babies and orphans.**\n\n【284】**In addition， male and female condoms provide dual protection against unintended pregnancies and STIs， including HIV.**\n\n【285】**The strategies developed as informed by the findings suggest a revision of the current orientation program for newly appointed medical education and in-service training programs for those in the service. The researcher is of the view that the study objectives have been met.**\n\n【286】**Overall Study Conclusion**\n\n【287】**The study's findings support women of reproductive age living with HIV-cantered integrated family planning with HIV services that deliver numerous health cares at the same institution， often by the same clinician， based on their needs.**\n\n【288】**Further research on the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategies is needed to fully apply them at different levels. The study's findings had implications for clinical practice and laid the groundwork for future research. It is hoped that the recommended solutions would be successfully adopted and implemented in health care facilities to improve the quality of integrated family planning and HIV services.**\n\n【289】**References**\n\n【290】**1\\.

It is characterized by the perception of a sudden loud noise in the head as the patient is falling asleep or awakening from sleep. The sound is described as a painless loud bang， an explosion， or a bomb exploding but can be a less alarming sound. We report a 60 years old lady with EHS describing this disorder and the assessment and management of it.**\n\n【14】**Introduction**\n\n【15】**Exploding Head Syndrome (EHS) is characterized by the perception of a sudden loud noise in the head as the patient is falling asleep or awakening from sleep \\[1，2\\]. The sound is described as a painless loud bang， an explosion， or a bomb \\[3\\]. It is classified as a type of parasomnia in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) 3 edition and its pathophysiology is still unclear \\[3，4\\]. Armstrong-Jones first described it in 1920 \\[5\\]. Pearce coined the term exploding head syndrome in 1989 in a paper in which he described 40 patients with EHS \\[11.**\n\n【16】**Case Presentation**\n\n【17】**We report this 60 years old lady known to have hypertension and dyslipidemia who presented complaining of poor quality of sleep for 2 years. Her sleep schedule was suggestive of a total sleep time of 7 h per night with usually a regular sleep-wake schedule. Her sleep environment and habits of sleep were not suggestive of anything to cause sleep disruption. She had history of snoring but no symptoms of restless leg syndrome or insomnia. She has no excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale was 4/24) and no symptoms to suggest an underlying neurological， psychiatric or medical disorders.**\n\n【18】**She reports episodes of waking up at night with a loud sound in her head， which she could not describe. The best description she was able to provide was “a loud sound as if blood is gushing through my head\". It lasts for minutes and resolves spontaneously. It causes frequent awakenings at night and sometimes she could not go to sleep. It was causing significant distress.**\n\n【19】**Discussion**\n\n【20】**Exploding Head Syndrome (EHS) is characterized by the perception of a sudden loud noise in the head as the patient is falling asleep or awakening from sleep \\[1，2\\]. The sound is described as a painless loud bang， an explosion， or a bomb exploding but can be a less alarming sound \\[3\\]. Occasionally； it is accompanied by the sensation of a flash of light.**\n\n【21】**Although these attacks themselves are usually not painful， it is reported that EHS attacks may precede migraine as auras. EHS is classified as a type of parasomnia in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) 3 edition and its pathophysiology is still unclear \\[3，4\\]. It was first described by Armstrong-Jones in 1920\\[5\\]. The term exploding head syndrome was coined by Pearce in 1989 in a paper in which he described 40 patients with EHS \\[1\\]. It is thought to be a migrainous phenomenon \\[1，6\\]. There have been different descriptions of the noise which include the sound of an explosion， gunshot， door slamming， roar， waves crashingagainst rocks， loud voices， a ringing noise， a terrific bang on a tin tray， or the sound of an electrical buzzing. In some cases， an instant flash of what is perceived as video ‘static is reported both audibly and visually for a fraction of a second \\[1，7\\]. It arises from the transition between different sleep stages and disappears completely when awake， although it may recur on further sleep attempts \\[7\\]. There is no actual dW headache or persistent pain， but some patients may experience a brief， mild jab-like sensation.**\n\n【22】**Although EHS has been reported in patients as young as 10 years， the age of onset is usually after age 50 and the condition has a slight female preponderance. The attacks occur with variable frequency for a few weeks or months. Attacks can be one-time events or can recur with attacks**\n\n【23】**increasing or decreasing over time， sometimes with no incidents over long periods of time \\[1，7，8\\]. The cause of EHS is unknown；however some possibilities include a sudden movement of a middle ear component or the Eustachian tube， or a brief temporal lobe complex partial seizure \\[9\\]. It may be related to emotional tenseness， as some patients report a stressful life situation in periods when attacks were intense and frequent \\[8\\]. There have been reports that the events might occur during stage N1 and N2 and maybe proceeded by respiratory events 4.**\n\n【24】**It is thought to be a benign phenomenon and reassurance is usually needed. Pharmacological options include calcium channel blockers like nifedipine \\[10\\] or flunarizine \\[11\\]， topiramate \\[6\\] and clomipramine. All have been found to be effective in reducing the frequency or resolution of the EHS symptoms.**\n\n【25】**References**\n\n【26】1\\. Pearce JM. Clinical features of the exploding head syndrome.

After emergency mitral valve surgery and 6 weeks of antimicrobial treatment， she was discharged home. Prompt diagnosis and early involvement of multidisciplinary team are prerequisite for successful outcome in this case.**\n\n【13】**Background**\n\n【14】**Infective endocarditis in ectopic pregnancy is rare and not reported in literature. We present a patient with a history ofectopic pregnancy with vascularized retained product of conception in the previous caesarean section scar and infective endocarditis with a 1.3 cm x1.9 cm vegetation on the mitral valve. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first reported case of ectopic pregnancy with mitral valve surgery in the literature.**\n\n【15】**Case Presentation**\n\n【16】**A 36-year-old female was referred to the cardiac surgeons for the management of infective endocarditis involving the mitral valve. Blood cultures revealed group B Streptococcus bacteremia.**\n\n【17】**Initially， the patient tried home termination of pregnancy. She attended accident and emergency for unexplained fever. She was treated with methotrexate for medical termination of pregnancy and developed bacteremia and infective endocarditis. As a result of ongoing abdominal pain， per vaginal bleeding， fever， shortness of breath and being generally unwell， she was admitted to hospital for management of retained products of conception. High ongoing Beta-Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (B-HCG) levels raised suspicion of ectopic pregnancy. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) demonstrated retained products of conception and a scar’ectopic pregnancy， with implantation of the embryo in the myometrial defect following previous uterine incision.**\n\n【18】**She had no history of cardiac comorbidity. Her obstetric history included three caesarean sections. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 130/min. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was 110 mg/L and B-HCG was 1085 IU/L， other hematological reports were normal. The renal function was normal with eGFR 84 ml/min and creatinine 103 umol/L.**\n\n【19】**Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large irregular shaped vegetation measuring 1.3 cm ×1.9 cm attached to the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with severe mitral regurgitation. Ejection fraction was 77% and there was a trace oftricuspid regurgitation.Trileaflet aortic valve did not show any evidence of stenosis and regurgitation. Coronary artery angiogram was not performed due to the patients age and case urgency.**\n\n【20】**MRI pelvis showed retained product of pregnancy attached to the thin perimetrium of the previous caesarean section scar. Bulky uterus consistent with recent pregnancy- this extended up to the sacral prominence. There was a thick (1.2 cm deep) rim of T2 bright， avidly enhancing/very vascular material in the region the anterior lower segment C-section scar (max AP diameter 5 cm)， with adjacent low T2/T1 non-enhancing material distending the lower endometrial canal. Findings were consistent with recent scar ectopic and the suggestion of retained products of conception.No evidence of spread out with the uterine serosa/into the abutting urinary bladder wall - thin layer of myometrium anterior to it. No gestational sac was seen (Figure 1).**\n\n【21】**Cardiacsurgeons，cardiologists，cardiac anesthetists and gynecologists were involved in decision-making. It was decided to perform urgent mitral valve surgery to prevent embolic complications. Scar ectopic pregnancy is associated with high spontaneous bleeding risk and there were concerns**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： MRI pelvis demonstrating the retained product of pregnancy.**\n\n【23】**that the anticoagulation required for Cardiopulmonary Bypass(CPB) may cause hemorrhage from the heavily vascularized retained product of conception. To explore the possibility of endovascular embolization of the uterine mass， a CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed. This demonstrated a highly vascularized pelvic mass containing a number of distended， sinusoidal vessels was confirmed and early drainage into the iliac veins on each side suggestive of retained product of ectopic pregnancy (Figure 2). Following review by the interventional radiology team， embolization was not felt to be a suitable option for management.**\n\n【24】**Following multi-disciplinary team decision making it was decided that a gynecology team would be prepared in theatre. This was so emergent control of bleeding， including emergency hysterectomy， could be performed if required**\n\n【25】**The intraoperative period was uneventful. Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed the preoperative findings (Figure 3). The patient was fully heparinized to an Activated Clotting Time(ACT) above 480 sec， placed on CPB via aorto-bicaval cannulation(Superior Vena Cava \\[SVC\\] and inferior Vena Cava \\[IVC\\])， and cooled to 32°C. Carbon Dioxide (CO) was insufflated across the operative field throughout the procedure. The oblique sinus was exposed and the IVC mobilized. Tapes were passed around SVC and IVC and the bypass drainage was checked by snaring the tapes. After confirming satisfactory drainage， the snares were released. Waterston's groove was dissected. The cross clamp was applied on33the ascending aorta and 1，000 ml of cold blood cardioplegia along with adenosine 6 mg were delivered anterogradely via the aortic root. Intermittent cardioplegia doses were delivered in 20-min intervals throughout the CPB period via the aortic root. The left atriotomy**\n\n【26】**was developed and the native valve was interrogated. Mitral retractor was applied to elevate the left atrium and expose the valve. At this stage the heart was vented by sump suckers for adequate operative field clearance. Posterior leaflet revealed a 2 cm × 2 cm vegetation. Anterior leaflet’s infection extending up to the papillary muscle. All infected tissues were dissected (Figure 4). The entire anterior leaflet with associated chordae tendineae were excised along with the posterior leaflet. The Left Atrium (LA) and Left Ventricle (LV) were washed with cold saline multiple times. A series of 2-0pledgeted Ti-Cron~ mattress sutures were arrayed (pledgets in LA) around the mitral valve annulus and a size 27 mm On-X\"mechanical mitral valve(patient's preference) seated in the intra annular position. Tilting disks were tested and found to be opening satisfactorily. De-airing was performed with left ventricle massage and Valsalva maneuver. The cross clamp was removed after TOE confirmed that de airing was satisfactory， the mitral valve was well seated and there was no paravalvular leak. The patient was weaned from CPB on low levels of cardiovascular support and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in a stable condition.**\n\n【27】**Postoperative course and recoverywereuneventful with the patient spending one day in ICU and 10 days in hospital. Microbiology of the excised mitral valve tissue showed presence of numerous gram-positive cocci. The patient was on six weeks of antibiotics， ceftriaxone and doxycycline， as guided by the infective endocarditis team. HCG level dropped gradually from 1085 to 408in a week's time. Postoperative blood culture report showed no growth of microorganism. Echocardiography one week following surgery demonstrated “well seated” mitral valve， no sign of mitral regurgitation， an anterograde velocity of 1.5 m/s and good LV systolic function.**\n\n【28】**Five weeks after discharge from hospital， patient developed uncontrolleddvaginal bleeding and _d_ readmittedtOhospital. Prophylactic common iliac artery balloon replacement was carryout out along with total abdominal hysterectomy for control of on-going bleeding**\n\n【29】**Discussion and Conclusion**\n\n【30】**Infective endocarditis in pregnancy is extremely rare with a reported incidence of 1 in 100，000 pregnancies \\[1\\]. The cardiovascular system goes through considerable change and adaptation during pregnancy. IE during the physiological change of pregnancy should be managed meticulously to minimize the mortality. Moreover， early involvement of a multidisciplinary team for management of**\n\n【31】**Figure 3： Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrating the vegetation.**\n\n【32】**IE reduces mortality and morbidity in this condition \\[2，3\\]. From the beginning， we involved the cardiologist， cardiac anesthetist， obstetrician and cardiac surgeons to deal with this complex case. To our knowledge， this is the first case in literature reporting infective endocarditis following medical termination ofectopic pregnancy.**\n\n【33】**For two reasons， the case is unique. Firstly， initial attempt to termination of pregnancy at home which resulted in infective endocarditis and secondlyvascularizedretaineddproduct of conception in thin walled perimetrium that could lead to life threatening hemorrhage during cardiopulmonary bypass.**\n\n【34】**Early surgical management for infective endocarditis depends on hemodynamic conditions such as heart failure and cardiogenic shock， risk of embolicevent and risk ofpersistent infection. European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines suggest urgent surgery with aortic and mitral valve vegetations with severe stenosis and regurgitation and low operative risk， or any vegetation >15 mm (class IIa) \\[4\\]. However， American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend early surgery for left sided mobile vegetation >10 mm irrespective of lesion or severity of operative risk(class IIb) \\[5\\]. The management in pregnancy is not different from the general population. Our patient was hemodynamically stable. We considered urgent surgery due to the size of vegetation and evidence of severe mitral regurgitation.**\n\n【35】**Our case report highlights that catastrophic bleeding from retained products of pregnancy during cardiopulmonary bypass might result in hemorrhagic shock and mortality. The aggressive**\n\n【36】**involvement of gynecologist during cardiac surgery is essential for better outcome and to avoid mortality and morbidity.**\n\n【37】**References**\n\n【38】**1\\.

BMS often occurs with a range of medical and dental conditions， from nutritional deficiencies and menopause to dry mouth and allergies. The treatment of burning mouth syndrome is usually directed at its symptoms. Studies generally support the use of low dosages of clonazepam chlordiazepoxide and tricyclic antidepressants. This report presents the case of a 55-year-old woman presented to the clinic with burning mouth symptoms. Clinical and laboratory evaluations allowed us to make a diagnosis of burning mouth syndrome. Because she suffered from depression we consulted a psychiatrist and initiated treatment with paroxetin (20 mg/day). After two week the patient reported a 20% improvement (a decrease from seven to five on visual analogical scale). After six weeks of treatmnet the burning symptoms disappeared.**\n\n【15】**Keywords： Burning mouth syndrome； Paroxetin**\n\n【16】**Introduction**\n\n【17】**Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by a continuous， painful burning sensation in a clinically normal appearing oral mucosa. Affected patients often present with multiple oral complaints，including burning，dryness and taste alterations. The etiology of BMS remains unknown， although a number of local， systemic and psychological factors have been proposed as being of etiopathogenic importance \\[1\\].**\n\n【18】**According to associated etiologies， BMS may be divided into primary and secondary types. Primary type includes idiopathic， non-neuropathic BMS. Burning mouth sensations (formerly， secondary BMS) are associated with established organic/therapeutic-related etiologies (e.g.， oral cavity disorders， including oral local neuropathy， systemic disorders， nutritional deficiencies， drug-induced， neurologicaland psychiatricabnormalities) \\[2\\]. Thetreatment ofburning mouth syndrome is usually directed at its symptoms. Studies generally support the use of low dosages of clonazepam\\[3\\]， chlordiazepoxide \\[4\\] and tricyclic antidepressants \\[5\\]. A potential noninvasive treatmen for BMS patients is low level laser therapy (LLLT). In recent studies， many authors have reported significant pain reduction with LLLT in painful stomatitis and severe pain in patients submitted to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation \\[6\\]. Although a large variety of drugs， medications， and miscellaneous treatments has been proposed in BMS， the treatment managment of this syndrome is still not satisfactory， and there is no definitive cure \\[7\\]**\n\n【19】**Case Report**\n\n【20】**A 55-year-old white woman presented to the clinic with burning mouth symptoms. The burning was of moderate intensity (7 on a 10 point visual analogical scale)， worsening by the end of the day. She did not report any worsening local factor associated with worsening of the burning. She reported that she suffers from depression but she was never treated by a psychiatrist. She also reported a xerostomia. We measured the salivary flow rate but the unstimulted saliva was within normal limits.**\n\n【21】**The intraoral inspection was normal. She used wear superior and inferior partial denture both in good conditions. She had no caries or periodontal disease in her teeth. X-ray exams were performed**\n\n【22】**without alterations. Blood analysis was performed and blood routine were within normal limits.**\n\n【23】**Clinical andlaboratoryevaluations allowed us to make a diagnosis of burning mouth syndrome. Because she suffered from depression we consulted a psychiatrist and initiated treatment with paroxetin (20mg/day).**\n\n【24】**After two week the patient reported a 20% improvement (a decrease from seven to five on visual analogical scale). After six weeks of treatment the burning symptoms disappeared. She did not report side effects. The patients was followed for six months and she remains pain free.**\n\n【25】**Discussion**\n\n【26】**The etiology of BMS remains unknown， although a number of local， systemic and psychological factors have been proposed as being of etiopathogenic importance. However，these conditions have not been consistently linked to the syndrome， and their treatment has had little impact on burning mouth symptoms. In more than one half of the patients with burning mouth syndrome， the onset of pain is spontaneous， with no identifiable precipitating factor. Approximately one third of the patients relate onset time to a dental procedure， recent illness or medication course. Some anxiolitics has been studied for the treatment of BMS and has demonstrated mild to moderate improvement in this patient \\[8\\]. The beneficial effects of tricyclic antidepressants in decreasing chronic pain indicate that， in low dosages， these agents may act as analgesics \\[9\\]. The proposed pharmacological protocols have not consistently proved to be predictable and effective in all BMS subjects.**\n\n【27】**Conclusion**\n\n【28】**BMS must be considered as an exclusion diagnosis in which a dental or medical cause has been excluded. The clinically normal appearance of the oral mucosa， which contrasts with patients pronounced complaints， and the time criterion constitute important factors in differential diagnosis \\[10\\].**\n\n【29】**Following treatment with paroxetin demonstrated significant symptomatic improvement， but the therapist has to be very careful regarding this kind of therapy in order to avoid possiblecomplications.**\n\n【30】**References**\n\n【31】**1\\.

Pregnancy was revealed on the 7th of August， when the girl went to a local hospital suffering from abdominal pain. The girl claimed that she has been raped by the relative since she was 6 years old and that she did not report him to the authorities before， due to the fear caused by the uncle's threats.**\n\n【21】**Methods： Studies were identified using large-circulation international journals found in two electronic databases： Scopus and EMBASE.**\n\n【22】**Results： There are three situations in which abortion is authorized by the Brazilian Constitution and this girl was experiencing two of them： She was a victim of rape and the pregnancy brings death risk.

Pregnancy was revealed on the 7th of August， when the girl went to a local hospital suffering from abdominal pain. The girl claimed that she has been raped by the relative since she was 6 years old and that she did not report him to the authorities before， due to the fear caused by the uncle’s threats. He was 33 and was indicted for rape of a vulnerable and continuous threat \\[2\\]. The various attempts to avoid the abortion of the child created a profound outrage of the medical class， mainly gynecologist and obstetricians who urge for the risks of taking forward a child pregnancy \\[3\\]. How to imagine a 10-year-old girl victim of rape? \\[4\\].**\n\n【27】**One of the girl's physicians who attended the case claimed that she was holding a teddy bear against her chest and just the conversation about the gestation was a trigger to her suffering. She was screaming and crying just reaffirming her non-consent， according to the decision of the court. Besides the girl， her family was in favor of the pregnancy interruption \\[5\\]. The case is a “good example” of how criminalization of abortion represents a violation to girls and women’s rights \\[6\\]. It is an atrocious psychological ache. There is no bonding sentiment between the woman and the gestation. Whether it exists， it turns out to be a feeling ofanger and repulse \\[7\\].**\n\n【28】**It is important to highlight that every day in Brazil； six girls from 10 to 14 years old are admitted into hospitals to undergo abortion. Even more horrendous than this fact， only the number of victims of presumed rape (all pregnancy under 14 years old is considered this way) who are impeded of aborting： More than 20 thousand. Most of these girls who end up giving birth are black and**\n\n【29】**periphery inhabitants \\[1\\].**\n\n【30】**What is observed in this case is a situation of high life risk， because it is an unprepared infant body for a pregnancy. Cases like this are pandemic： Each hour， four Brazilian girls up to 13 years old are raped， according to the Brazilian Public Security Yearbook，and most of the crimes are perpetrated by a relative \\[6\\].**\n\n【31】**Imagine a baby passing through a birth canal of a child who does not possess a completely developed pelvis? Says the gynecologist and obstetrician Melania Amorim， professor of the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG). According to her， the risks of a precocious pregnancy are really elevated； that is， the younger the patient the greater the complications \\[3\\].**\n\n【32】**A judge was convoked. The sentence is original to some individuals， because it expresses the “will of the girl\". Yes， a 10-year-old girl has a will on this case： She was shattered by hearing that she would have to carry on with a pregnancy and become a mother. The grandmother could feel strongly the desperation of her granddaughter， but the cowards joined forces with the fanatics to enquire judicial procedures and gestational limits of pregnancy. There are three situations in which abortion is authorized by the Brazilian Constitution and this girl was experiencing two of them： She was a victim of rape and the pregnancy brings death risk. There is no more questioning-abortion is the best choice for the girls well-being- as early as possible-and in consideration to the victim， without public fuss \\[7\\].**\n\n【33】**The court of law of Espirito Santo state grants to the child the right to interrupt a pregnancy result of a rape. In Brazil， theprocedure is authorized by the Constitution in sexual abuse cases and when life risk exists towards the pregnant \\[3\\]. It is important to take into account that the Brazilian criminal code of 1940 already guarantees the right of abortion in these situations. The judicial evaluation is needless in this case， especially because it regards a situation of life risk； the debate occurs because of an “ideologization of the abortion matter in Brazil”\\[6\\].**\n\n【34】**The gynecologist and obstetrician representative of the “Medical Network for the Right to Decide\" defends that practitioners have to be trained to attend cases of legal interruption of the pregnancy. For him，conscientious objection cannot lead to the lack of aid \\[7\\].**\n\n【35】**In this context， Brazilian Health Ministry published an ordinance which determines the new rules and procedures to be followed to**\n\n【36】**acquire authorization of abortion in cases established by law. With this measure，practitioners are compelled to contact the police in cases which patients are victims of sexual abuse. According to ordinance2.282， physicians must preserve possible material evidence of the crime of rape， and forward it immediately to the authorities， such as embryonic or fetal fragments aiming the conduction of genetic clashes which may lead to the respective criminal identification. For the anthropologist Debora Diniz， the measure is a severe confidentiality violation as the victim gets to the hospital to be assisted and not investigated \\[8\\].**\n\n【37】**In agreement with Debora Diniz， the ordinance transforms the operation of a legal abortion service in a police department. It creates a bunch of barriers and comes from a clear ideologization of science， a selective science， which the only purpose is to frighten women who seek for abortion \\[9\\].**\n\n【38】**In this context， we call for an international debate， to answer the following question： How a 10-year-old girl who was raped cannot have her desire respected in defense of her pain and psychic sorrow?**\n\n【39】**References**\n\n【40】**1\\.

Craniofacial skeleton is usually affected and temporal bone involvement is uncommon. Furthermore， when a concomitant rare mastoid mucocele is already affecting the same region， the related diagnosis can be even more challenging.**\n\n【12】**The Methodology： Here we report a radiological and surgical case， with CT， MRI and surgical imaging of a patient affected by a mastoid mucocele to be considered as a first sign of fibrous dysplasia onset.**\n\n【13】**Conclusions： Mastoid mucocele is a rare finding. To date， in medical literature only three cases are depicted. Etiology is still unknown even if multiple have been the hypothesis put forward. Although fibrous dysplasia temporal bone localization is well known， to our knowledge， this is the very first case in medical literature of a mastoid mucocele as an alert of fibrous dysplasia onset.**\n\n【14】**Keywords： Mucocele； Mastoid； Temporal bone； Head CT； MRI**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Mucocele is an expansile collection of sterile mucus which， lined by epithelium or covered by granulation tissue， could be frequently found in oral mucosa. Though only sporadically observable in the air bones cavities， among them paranasal sinuses are the most predominately involved areas while temporal bone is hardly affected. Pathology uncommon in adults and rare in childhood， mucocele is supposed to arise from the obstruction of the normal drainage of mucus in normal air cells \\[1\\]. As a matter of fact， mucosal thickening， bone overgrowth or fibrosis might lead to progressive inspissation of mucus and bone remodeling with local inflammation， thus determining the compression ofthe neighboring structures \\[2\\].**\n\n【17】**Clinical diagnosis， mostly relied on neuroradiological imaging (especially CT and MRI)， can be challenging. Surgery is the gold standard for treatment whilst pathologic confirmation could be needed in atypical cases. Nowadays， medical literature provides for five cases of temporal bone mucoceles. Among them only three refer to the mastoid region \\[2-5\\].**\n\n【18】**Craniofacial localization of fibrous dysplasia， especially concerning paranasal sinuses and midface involvement， is well documented in medical literature as these regions are the most frequently affected. A recent article by Frisch has extensively presented which the clinical features of the fibrous dysplasia are and how temporal bone affection can be managed as the pathology is less common in this bone \\[6\\].**\n\n【19】**Also in consideration of the shortage of articles referring to temporal bone mucoceles available in medicalliterature， a case study ofa mastoid mucocele tobe considered an alert of fibrous dysplasia onset in a young patient treated with surgical drainage will follow.**\n\n【20】**Case Report**\n\n【21】**An 8-years-old boy， with medical history of right purulent otitis media occurred 3 years before， presented with subtle pain and swelling behind the right ear. For diagnostic reasons the patient underwent head CT and head MRI. Consequently a mastoidectomy was performed in order to drain the cyst. After the surgery the patient underwent a follow up head CT.**\n\n【22】**Figure 1： Neuroimaging of mastoid mucocele.**\n\n【23】**A) Brain MRl， axial T2 image showing a hyperintense mass in the right mastoid (arrow) dislocating the sigmoid sinus， consistent with a mastoid mucocele. B) Head CT axial image showing isodense tissue and loss of bone septa in the right mastoid (arrow). C) Head CT coronal image showing a loculated cavity (arrow) in the inferior right mastoid clearly divided by the healthy aerated mastoid. D) Head CT 3D reconstruction showing the enlargement of the right mastoid (arrow) compared to the contralateral one due to bone remodeling. E) Head CT coronal image showing a new cystic cavity (arrow) posterior to the middle ear.**\n\n【24】**Figure 2： Surgical images during right mastoidectomy for mucocele.**\n\n【25】**A) The open right mastoid shows the healthy bone (white arrow)， the cavity of the mucocele (black arrow) with a highly vascularized wall and a bone septum dividing the twa regions (arrowhead). B) The surgical field after the expasure and drainage of the mucacele with decampression of the sigmoid sinus. The wide aditus ad antrum (small white arrow) provides a proper aeration of the cavity.**\n\n【26】**After the clinical evaluation， the patient underwent head CT that showed a cyst-like lesion (Figure 1B) clearly divided from the healthy aerated mastoid cells by a bone septum (Figure 1C)； the mastoid proved to be enlarged (Figure 1D). At MRI， the lesion appeared hyperintense on T2 (Figure 1A) and iso-hypointense on T1 and diffusion weighted imaging revealed an intense peripheral contrast enhancement (not shown in figure). The surgical inspection disclosed a mucus collection with a highly vascularized cyst wall (Figures 2A and B).**\n\n【27】**After surgery the patient underwent a follow up CT (Figure 1E)， which show a growing cystic lesion， similar to the one that drove to mastoidectomy in a more anterior area， in the posterior part of the middle ear.**\n\n【28】**Discussion**\n\n【29】**Fibrous dysplasia is a rareidiopathic，progressive bone remodeling disorder. Etiology is still unknown. Craniofacial involvement is frequent， particularly with regards to membranous bones such as maxilla， mandible， frontal ethmoid， and sphenoidal. Temporal bone affection is reported to range from 25% to 70% of the cases \\[6\\]. The bone remodeling pattern can be monostotic， affecting a single cranial bone (70% of cases)， or polyostotic thus involving multiple cranial bones (30% of cases) \\[7\\]. Typically， first symptoms debut during the first or the second decade of life， males are less frequently affected and clinical features depend on both the site and growth of the lesion. Prepubertal adolescents can show rampant bone remodeling slowing down in adulthood \\[8\\].**\n\n【30】**Whenevermastoidiiss involved， recurrent mastoiditis and**\n\n【31】**conductive hearing loss can be symptomatic indicators.**\n\n【32】**To our knowledge， no case report in medical literature even suggests that fibrous dysplasia might appear concomitantly to a mastoid muicocele.**\n\n【33】**Only five cases of temporal bone mucoceles are covered by medical literature \\[2-5\\]， the latter one reporting lesions found three times in the mastoid \\[2-5\\]and only once in the middle ear \\[5\\] or in the petrous apex3.**\n\n【34】**According to the most recent literature， CT andMRI neuroimaging techniques are crucial for diagnosis and surgical planning \\[5\\]. In fact， neuroimaging findings provide with sufficient information to differentiate mucocele from other osteolytic lesions of the mastoid (e.g. cholesteatoma， cartilaginous tumors， schwannoma， meningioma， petrositis， glomus tumors， metastatic tumors， giant cell tumors， large air cell， cholesterol granuloma， histiocytosis and lymphoma) \\[3\\] while， at the same time， disclosing data about both the involvement of the neighboring structures and the best surgical approach to the lesion.**\n\n【35】**Although surgical intervention can be delayed in case of asymptomatic lesion， in light of the fact that mastoid mucocele， likewise paranasal sinuses mucocele， is expansile \\[5\\]， drainage of the cyst must be performed whenever adjacent structures are involved\\[2，9\\]. For such a purpose， mastoidectomyshould be considered a valid approach to drain the lesion and provide for an adequate aeration.**\n\n【36】**Conclusions**\n\n【37】**The etiology of temporal bone mucocele is still unknown although some authors reported history of chronic otitis media in patients affected by a temporal bone mucocele \\[4，5，10\\]， noteworthy，**\n\n【38】**our patient suffered of right purulent otitis media 3 years before the exordium of the retroauricular swelling. The very same authors suggest that recurrent local inflammation is supposed to potentially determine mucosal or bone thickening affecting the ostium of a normal air cell thus causing a local mucus collection.**\n\n【39】**In our specific patient， bone remodeling typical of the fibrous dysplasia might have been started proximal to a mastoid cell ostium， therefore determining its occlusion causing the collection of mucus and such atypical bone remodeling.**\n\n【40】**Postsurgical neuroradiological CT examination showed typical fibrous dysplasia cystic bone remodeling.

The combination of clinical， neurophysiological and neuropathological features prompted toward a possible diagnosis of Measles Inclusion Body Encephalitis (MIBE). The presence of atypical clinical signs， such as super refectory status epilepticus， and histopathological features overlapping with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis hinder an already difficult diagnosis. Furthermore， in Literature， MIBE is associated with cellular immune defects， no cases are described in patients with humoral defects， since do not usually modify the course of measles infection. At the time when decrease in measles vaccine coverage are experienced in several countries， our findings suggest that even in the absence of a clear clinical history or lab results， measles infection must be suspected in every case of super refectory status epilepticus ofunknown origin.**\n\n【20】**Introduction**\n\n【21】**Due to a decrease in measles vaccine coverage， several countries have been experiencing new outbreaks， with 7.5 million cases reported by the WHO in 2020 \\[1\\]. Measles-induced encephalitis， though uncommon， often results in severe disability or death \\[2\\]， and include： Primary Measles Encephalitis， Acute Post-infectious Measles Encephalomyelitis，Measles Inclusion Body Encephalitis(MIBE) and Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) \\[3，4\\]. The last two forms occur after the acute phase： MIBE is mainly reported in immunosuppressed patient， generally six months after Measles Virus (MV) infection \\[5-10\\]； SSPE occurs after 1 to 10 years in previously healthy patients\\[11\\]. Even though the two forms may present some overlap， each form has distinct clinical and pathological features \\[2-4，11\\]. We report a case of a 15-year-old girl with clinical signs， onset and evolution suggestive of MIBE in whom the diagnostic process was complicated by the presence of associated atypical clinical signs and histopathological features.**\n\n【22】**The patient was born in Romania and moved to Italy at the age of 6 years. There was no family or physiological history of note； she had completed the vaccination schedule， including two doses of measles vaccine at the age of one and eight years. At the age of 12， she had the diagnosis of asymptomatic thrombocytopenia， treated with corticosteroids， Immunoglobulin (Ig) and rituximab， completely recovered after about one year. In December 2017， presented to our attention for headache and rapid decrease of visual acuity suggestive of cortical blindness. A few months before the admission， she had shown acute diffuse macular rash without fever and， after that， persisting cough and asthenia， associated with lymphocyte B depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia (CD190.5%； IgA 9 mg/dL； IgM <10 mg/dL； IgG <30 mg/dL)， requiring monthly infusions of Ig. No exposure to measles could be traced. At the admission physical examination revealed intraocular pressure increase and cranial CT was normal. On day 4， she presented with daily myoclonic seizures of left hemiface and anticonvulsant therapy with levetiracetam (2000 mg/die) and clonazepam(15 mg/die) was started. Brain MRI on day 7 showed subcortical and deep white matter changes in the occipital and right frontal lobes. A slight increase in protein (47 mg/dL) was found on a Lumbar Puncture (LP) performed on day 8. EEG showed intercritical slow-waves localized on**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： Neuropathological features of the brain biopsy. The brain tissue showed light oedematous changes (A). Scattered glial and neuronal cell presented with small intranuclear， sometimes eosinophilic inclusions， compatible with measles viral inclusions (B， C) (arrow in B). The tissue displayed reactive gliosis， microglia activation and presence of CD68+ macrophages (D. E， respectively). (A-C： H&E staining； D：Immunohistochemical stainings performed with monoclonal mouse anti human GFAP and anti human CD68/PGM1 antibodies， both from DAKO-Agilent， Cernuscosul Naviglio， ltaly； immunohistochemistry performed on DAKO Omnis Auto stainer，DAKO-Agilent).**\n\n【24】**the right hemisphere and continuous rhythmic sharp-waves on the right regions， with contralateral diffusion， associated with focal motor seizures. Treatment with corticosteroids and mannitol was started. On day 12， the seizures evolved in Super Refectory Status Epilepticus (SRSE)， resistant to bolus doses of midazolam at 0.2 mg/kg. Treatment with acyclovir and deep sedation with midazolam(12 gamma/Kg/min) and propofol (5 mg/Kg) were started. LP on day 14 confirmed protein increase (60 mg/dL). CSF culture test for**\n\n【25】**neurotropic virus， fungus and bacteria were negative， as well as， Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for neurotropic agents and serum antibodies. Metabolic and immunological screening， abdomen e thoracic CT was also normal. Clinical seizure persisted despite the association of several pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies： Methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/die)， phenytoin (20 mg/Kg)，ketamine (100 gamma/Kg/min)， bolus doses of lacosamide (400mg/die)， hypothermia， plasmapheresis and Ig infusion. Continuous EEG monitoring showed delta brushes pattern predominant on the right side， followed after 10 days by periodic burst of diffuse sharp-waves. After one month， periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges or bilateral independent periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges appeared on EEG，associated to nystagmus. On day 21 a second brain MRI showed wide areas of altered intensity in the cortex， subcortical， and deep white matter of the occipital， parietal， temporal and frontal lobe with signs of corticallaminar necrosis. Mild parenchymal contrast enhancement was present. On day 27 brain biopsy was performed， revealing small fragments of brain tissue with edematous changes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed microglia activation and presence of numerous intraparenchymal CD68+ macrophages and few perivascular CD3+/CD8+ lymphocytes. The tissue showed also reactive gliosis (Figure 1). Scattered glial and neuronal cell presented with intranuclear， sometimes eosinophilic inclusions， compatible with measles viral inclusions (Figure 1). Typical eosinophilic inclusions as found in MIBE were not detectable. Nor granulomatous or vasculitic changes， neither areas of necrosis were found. RT-PCR on brain tissue revealed wild type measles virus， genotype D8， and Parvovirus B19 RNA. After one month， SRSE progressively relapsed. The girl presented vegetative status with hypertension， tachycardia and some myoclonic seizures of the left hemiface， treated with doxazosine， transdermic clonidine， lacosamide (400 mg/die)， and monthly IgG infusion (0.4 mg/kg). There was a constant increase of pancreatic enzymes up to 285 UI/L. Brain MRI on day 44， 80， 122，178， 232， 264 showed progressive involvement of cortex and white matter bilaterally， of the cerebellar grey and white matter， and of the brainstem associated with ventricular enlargement (Figure 2). After ten months， the patient presented acute worsening with hypotension，**\n\n【26】**Figure 2： Serial brain MRI findings showing the progressive changes： A) T2-weighted image on day 7 showed increased intensity in the subcortical and deep white matter in both occipital lobes and in the right cortical frontal lobe， with mild mass effect； B) T2-weighted image on day 21 highlighted progressive involvement of cortical-subcortical occipital， parietal and temporal lobes； C) T2-weighted image on day 44 showed swelling of basal ganglia and further progressive extension of areas of high signal in parietal and frontal lobes， mark of right parietal minicraniotomy for brain biopsy； D) T2-weighted image on day 80 showed new high signal of temporal and frontal lobes associated with initial atrophic evolution， E，F) FLAIR -weighted image on day 122 and on day 178 showed progression of cortical-subcortical atrophy with enlargement of the lateral ventricles； G) FLAIR-weighted image on day 232 high signal in left frontal and temporal lobes， H) T2-weighted image on day 264 showed new altered signal in the occipital lobe， right hemisphere cerebellar and focal lesion in bulb and pons.**\n\n【27】**bradycardia， associated to ST segment elevation， significant increase of troponin and left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities. She died after 24 h. Post mortem investigation was not permitted.**\n\n【28】**Discussion**\n\n【29】**We report a case in which the presumed diagnosis of MIBE was complicated by several atypical findings. The presentation with headache and cortical blindness was typical of MIBE， with no behavioral or cognitive difficulties， more often observed in SSPE\\[11\\]. Motor deficits (hemiparesis， hemiplegia， ataxia)， dysarthria and dysphagia， often reported in MIBE， were not present \\[11\\]. Focal motors seizures and early EEG findings， with intercritical slow-waves and continuous ipsilateral rhythmic sharp-waves， were also consistent with MIBE \\[4\\]. In contrast the rapid worsening of focal motor seizures， refractory to AEDs， and the onset of SRSE were not typical of MIBE. Severe seizures occur more often in patients with SSEP， but we did not observe the Radermecker's complexes，recurring at regular intervals of 5 sec to 10 sec and having clear relationship with myoclonic jerks， often reported in SSEP \\[12\\]. Brain MRI， showing widespread changes， affecting the grey， subcortical and deep white matter， with posterior-anterior progression， subsequent atrophy and involvement of brain stem， was also consistent with the multifocal areas of increased T2 signal intensity in the cortex， subcortical，and deep white matter， followed by progressive atrophy reported in MIBE\\[11\\]. Widespread lesions with posterior-anterior progression are also reported in SRSE but with a different pattern， as the early changes are characterized by early demyelination， particularly in the temporal and parietal lobes \\[4\\]. CSF analysis revealed only increased protein， also previously reported in MIBE patients \\[11\\]. Brain biopsy showed the presence of macrophage infiltrates， perivascular lymphocytes， edema， microglia activation and gliosis and， in scattered neurons， of intranuclear inclusions， sometimes eosinophilic， compatible with MV inclusions. The typical eosinophilic inclusions， often found in MIBE， were not detectable. The neuropathological findings were overall not completely typical of MIBE and in some way overlapping with SSPE， which is however also associated with a more evident inflammatory infiltration and demyelination， that was not found in our patient \\[13\\]. The mismatch between clinical and histopathological features has already been described in another case \\[10\\]. The absence of antibodies against MV in our case was consistent with the immunocompromised status typical of MIBE\\[11\\]. However， cellular immune defects were not present in our patient， who had hypogammaglobulinemia， which should not modify the course of measles infection \\[14\\]. A high Incidence of Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)， also found in our patient， has in contrast been previously reported in 315 SSPE cases， assuming a non-casual relationship between the two pathologies. The possible mechanisms considered were immune dysregulation， alteration of the immune response due to ITP pharmacological treatments or antigenic stimulation from persistent MV \\[15\\]. The atypical features did not allow to fully ascribe our case to the well characterized forms but the combination of clinical， neurophysiological and neuropathological features prompted toward a possible diagnosis of atypical MIBE. The diagnostic process was also complicated by other elements that contributed not only to hinder a specific diagnosis of MIBE but also to suspect a subacute measles related encephalitis. Our case had no clear exposure to MV， had complete vaccination schedule， reduced exanthema， undetectable serum antibodies， negative CSF culture. It was only the brain biopsy， detecting the presence of MVRNA by RT-PCR that allowed to confirm our hypothesis of a subacute measles**\n\n【30】**related encephalitis \\[16\\].**\n\n【31】**Conclusion**\n\n【32】**Our findings suggest that even in the absence of clear clinical history or lab results， measles infection must be suspected in the diagnostic flow ofevery case of SRSE of unknown origin， especially at the time when decrease in measles vaccine coverage are experienced in several countries. In Italy the measles vaccine coverage did not reach the target of 95%， coverage needed to get herd immunity， leading to a further increase in the pool of susceptible adolescents and children. Ongoing efforts to raise confidence in vaccines should be intensified.**\n\n【33】**References**\n\n【34】**1\\. World Health Organisation.**\n\n【35】**2\\. Buchanan R， Bonthius DJ.

The colon biopsy revealed tissue-invading spirochetes with an abscess. We report a case oftertiary intestinal syphilis with a previous failed treatment for latent syphilis in a patient without HIV infection. Tertiary syphilis is rare， but able to induce serious infection. Clinicians should suspect Treponemal disease based on clinical history， and should obtain adequate laboratory tests.**\n\n【15】**Introduction**\n\n【16】**Syphilis is a chronic and systemic human disease caused by Treponema pallidum. After primary infection， this organism can disseminate to whole body through the blood stream or lymphatics \\[1\\]. Then it manifests varying diseases as secondary or tertiary syphilis. This may not become clinically apparent for years or decades \\[2\\]. Since the introduction of penicillin， tertiary syphilis has been uncommon， especially in developed countries. Particularly， intestinal syphilis of late manifestation is extremely rare. Here， we present a case of tertiary syphilis involving cecum which causes colon perforation leading to pan-peritonitis.**\n\n【17】**Case Presentation**\n\n【18】**A 59-year-old man visited the emergency room because of severe abdominal pain. He complained of diffuse abdominal pain， especially in the right lower quadrant. The pain was severe and not relieved by medication. His symptoms had been lasted for a month and had aggravated over the recent 4 days. It was associated with loose stools 4 to 5 times per day. He experienced a weight loss of approximately 10 kg， which accounted for 15% of his body weight， during the previous 9months. He did not show any abnormal mucocutaneous lesions or lymphadenopathies**\n\n【19】**Regarding medical history， he was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus， which required insulin therapy， and advanced liver cirrhosis related to alcohol consumption. He was unmarried and had unprotected sexual intercourses with multiple sexual partners. His last unsafe sexual activity was over 1 year previously. He had been treated for sexually transmitted diseases several times in his 20s. He was also diagnosed with latent syphilis 3 years previously， but the treatment was limited to only two intramuscular injections of benzathine penicillin G at another hospital. He was lost to follow-up and remained in an undertreated state for latent syphilis.**\n\n【20】**On examination， his body temperature was 37.1℃ with a heart rate of 109 beats/min， blood pressure of 109/68 mmHg， and respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min. His abdomen was rigid and distended. He showed diffuse abdominal tenderness with signs of peritoneal irritation， especially in the right lower quadrant area.**\n\n【21】**Initial laboratory findings were as follows： White blood cell count， 9400/mm(absolute neutrophil count 7800/mm)； hemoglobin level， 7.9 g/dL； platelet count， 8200/mm； and serum C-reactive protein level， 9.87 mg/dl. Further testing revealed reactivity for Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption (FTA-ABS) IgG and non-reactivity for FTA-ABS IgM. Treponema pallidum Latex Agglutination (TPLA) was also reactive， and the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory(VDRL) was positive with a titer of 1：4. A human immunodeficiency virus antibody test result was negative.**\n\n【22】**Abdominal X-ray showed non-specific ileus. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen demonstrated edematous wall thickening of the ascending colon with suspicious complicated fluid collection in the anterior aspect of the cecum (Figure 1).**\n\n【23】**Figure 1： (A) Abdominal supine X-ray of ileus. (B) Axial section of abdomen CT showing edematous wall thickening of ascending colon with complicated fluid collection around the cecum.**\n\n【24】**Figure 2： (A) Gross section showing edematous and polypoid lesions on cecum， just above the ileocecal valve. (B) Three fragments of the specimen A.**\n\n【25】**These findings were thought to reflect a sealed-off perforation of the cecum； thus， he was referred to the general surgery department and underwent emergency right hemicolectomy with end-ileostomy. During operation， severe inflammation was noted around the edematous cecum without definitive bowel perforation. However， bowel necrosis was suspected in the serosal layer of the cecum (Figure2). In addition， a large amount of ascites was present， with thick and turbid fluid.**\n\n【26】**The histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed acute inflammation in almost all layers of the cecum and colon， with abscess， perforation， vasculitis， and perivascular inflammation. Spirochetes were found in specimens with Warthin starry staining(Figure 3).**\n\n【27】**We diagnosed him with syphilitic colitis and administered intramuscular penicillin G 2.4 million units per week for 3 weeks.**\n\n【28】**Discussion**\n\n【29】**T. pallidum causes chronic infection and various disease manifestations in the human host. Clinical manifestations result from the inflammatory processes driven by the presence of Treponemes within infected tissues. Syphilis is divided into a series of clinical stages. Tertiary syphilis generally presents with a cardiovascular manifestation or benign syphilis (Gumma) \\[3，4\\]. Gummas commonly**\n\n【30】**Figure 3： (A) Loss of intestinal mucosa and destruction of normal architecture with infiltration of inflammatary cells invalving whole layers of calan (H&E， x10). (B， C) The infiltration was composed of inflammatory cells including lymphocytes， plasma cells and neutrophils (B： H&E，x100， C： H&E，x500).(D) Spirochetes present in submucosa layer with red arrows (Warthin starry stain，x1000).**\n\n【31】**involve the skin and skeletal system， but any organ could be involved\\[4，5\\]. A historical Oslo study identified that gumma， defined as benign late syphilis， occurred in 15% of cases during the natural course of untreated syphilis \\[6\\]. These are usually solitary lesions ranging from microscopic to several centimeters in diameter \\[2\\]. As a part of late syphilis， intestinal syphilis， presenting as gumma， is a rare disease entity that differs from the rectum-involving primary syphilis or congenital intestinal syphilis of the newborn. Intestinal syphilis shows various symptoms depending on the location and type of lesion (non-ulcerative or ulcerative) \\[7\\]. Gumma located in the cecum might ulcerate and extend into the peritoneum， resulting in pan-peritonitis.**\n\n【32】**Syphilis has gummatous involvement， which usually develops in the tertiary stage， but possibly in the secondary stage. In the disease course of syphilis， there are considerable overlaps between clinical stages， and their boundaries are vague \\[8\\]. The natural course of syphilis may differ across cases， and atypical presentation of the disease occasionally occurs. It was very difficult to distinguish the clinical stage in this patient； however， we finally assessed that this was a case of chronic gummatous intestinal involvement in tertiary syphilis. Clinically， there was no evidence of secondary syphilis， such as a characteristic rash or lymphadenopathy. Three years had passed since his diagnosis of latent syphilis and more than 1 year from his last sexual exposure. Therefore， the possibility of early syphilis was verylow， even considering re-infection. Histopathologic examination revealed the presence of T. pallidumas determined using Warthin-Starry silver staining. Generally， there are abundant spirochetes with active duplication in the early stages. On the other hand， spirochetes are rare or absent in most gummas of tertiary syphilis \\[5，9\\]. The burden of T. pallidum was not very high in this patient.**\n\n【33】**Before the patient complained of abdominal pain， he had an asymptomatic period of over 3 years after incomplete treatment of syphilis. How can the spirochetes remain silently in the gumma for such a long time? We can obtain an answer based on the unique architecture and composition of the outer membrane of T. pallidum， unlike that of gram-negative bacteria \\[4，10\\]. First， the syphilis**\n\n【34】**spirochete lacks lipopolysaccharide on its cell wall， which typically causes fever and inflammation. Second， the outer membrane of T. pallidum contains an extraordinarily low density of proteins. The paucity of proteins and pathogen-associated molecular patterns on the spirochaetal surface is the basis of its capacity for immune evasion， which has earned it the name of ‘stealth pathogen’\\[11\\]. This makes syphilis spirochetes not readily accessible to innate immune cells. As a result， spirochetes can induce inflammatory processes slowly over several years.**\n\n【35】**Current guidelines recommend that a longer-duration penicillin therapy may be required for late syphilis because treponemes appear to replicate considerably slowly during later stages of the infection\\[12\\]. The patient should have been treated with three doses of weekly penicillin when he was diagnosed with latent syphilis 3 years ago. Partially treated disease might allow a patient to develop syphilis at an advanced stage.**\n\n【36】**We report a case of late intestinal syphilis with a previous failed treatment for latent syphilis in a non-HIV adult. At present， tertiary syphilis has become rare due to the availability of penicillin. However， clinicians should consider atypical syphilis， especially when patients have a history of untreated syphilis or are at a risk of sexually transmitted disease. Notably， histopathologic findings are important to establish the diagnosis or avoid misdiagnosis， because syphilis can occur anywhere in human body due to the capability of hemolymphatic dissemination of spirochetes.**\n\n【37】**In conclusion， tertiary syphilis is a very rare disease， but infection with T. pallidum should be suspected based on a combination of epidemiologic， clinical， and laboratory features.**\n\n【38】**1\\.

Kaposi's Varicelliform Eruption (KVE)；2. IgA nephropathy； 3. Acne.\n\n【24】**Treatment**\n\n【25】Brivudine was administered at a dose of 125 mg/d； at D8， the blisters all over the body began to shrink， and the backache disappeared quickly； two weeks later， the blisters all over the body got harder and harder， eventually leaving thick flaky scars\n\n【26】**Figure 1： Renal function.**\n\n【27】**Discussion**\n\n【28】**The young， male patient hada history ofacne and IgA nephropathy and suffered from an acute onset of generalized KVE， without pain， itch or fever but backache. Impression： Kaposi's Varicelliform Eruption (KVE). Bullous dermatosis should be ruled out before a definitive diagnosis was made (in this case， bullous dermatosis was ruled out based on pathological evidence and antibody test results). Considering his impaired renal function， the patient was first administered with 125 mg of oral brivudine tablets once daily. The idealtherapeutic effect was achieved， without seriously compromising the liver or kidney function. KVE is a sudden vesicular rash with the appearance of hilar depression， which is primarily caused by HSV-1that infects a preexisting atopic dermatitis or cutaneous rash. KVE can also result from the smallpox virus， cowpox virus， and coxsackie virus. Generalized KVE is a disseminated cutaneous infection by the pathogenic virus entering the blood circulatory system \\[1\\]. Brivudine is an antiviral nucleoside drug that reacts with viral RNA polymerases to inhibit viral replication. Therefore， brivudine can effectively suppress the replication of the Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV). In vitro trials show that brivudine， as a virostatic agent， is 200 to 1000 times more active than acyclovir and penciclovir. Animal experiments**\n\n【29】**suggest that brivudine has an inhibitory effect on Macacine herpesvirus and (mouse， guinea pig) Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV1). Dose adjustment is unnecessary for elderly patients and those with moderate to severe renal dysfunction or liver dysfunction. This case report suggests that brivudine is suitable for KVE patients with renal inadequacy without making any dose adjustments. In this case report， the patient suffered from backache following the onset of KVE， with the MRI findings suggesting no abnormality in the lumbosacral area and the symptom subsiding subsequent to the use of brivudine. This indicates an association between backache and viral infection.**\n\n【30】**Conclusion**\n\n【31】**Brivudine can be applied to the treatment of KVE and demonstrates robust efficacy and safety outcomes in patients with generalized KVE， which requires no dose adjustment in those with renal function impairment.**\n\n【32】**References**\n\n【33】**1\\.

Historically， successful management involves a combination of glucagon and high-dose insulin infusion. Occasionally， hemodialysis may be helpful in certain beta-blocker overdoses. In severe refractory cases， the utility and success of Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS) have been sporadically successful internationally but rarely reported in Australian clinical practice.**\n\n【18】**Case Report： A 24-year-old female presented with in-hospital Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA) cardiacarrest secondary to an intentional large propranolol overdose. Despite standard conventional treatment， she remained in cardiac arrest and was subsequently transitioned to Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR). She was successfully cannulated and commenced on Veno-Arterial (VA) Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) within 60 min of CPR.**\n\n【19】**Conclusion：ECPRandECMO should be considered early in patients with refractory cardiovascular collapse secondary to significant cardiotoxicity from extensive propranolol poisoning.**\n\n【20】**Keywords： Propranolol overdose； E-CPR；ECMO； Insulin infusion； Glucagon infusion**\n\n【21】**Abbreviations**\n\n【22】PEA： Pulseless Electrical Activity； SAAS： South Australian Ambulance Service； CPR：Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation； CTPA： Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography； MMSE：Mini-Mental State Examination\n\n【23】**Introduction**\n\n【24】**Propranolol， a lipophilic B-adrenoceptor antagonist， is a first-generation B-blocker used to treat various conditions， including hypertension， cardiac dysrhythmias， anxiety， and benign essential tremors \\[1\\]. Propranolol antagonizes the B and β， receptors with equal affinity， lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic activity， and is highly lipid-soluble with an oral bioavailability of 30% and a half-life (T)between 3 hto 5h \\[2\\]. It is 90% protein bound with a volume of distribution (V ) of 3.6l/kgand undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. In addition， it also produces membrane-stabilizing effects when used in high doses by the inhibition of Nat currents \\[1，3\\].**\n\n【25】**Initially regarded as a safe medication， it was later criticized for its adverse side effects， non-selectivity， high protein-bound profile， and great inter individual variation in the liver's presystemic clearance， leading to significant variability in plasma concentration (~20 times) after an oral administration \\[3，4\\]. In place of this， its use has narrowed，gradually being phased out from clinical practice and replaced with newer b-blockers with greater efficacy.**\n\n【26】**Despite this， cases of propranolol toxicity continue to occur and pose a multitude of challenges to the treating clinician \\[5\\]. Often， they present with significant bradycardia and hypotension， leading to severe cardiopulmonary compromise and death. Their immediate cardiotoxicity effects include arrhythmias， refractory bradycardia， sinus pauses， cardiogenic shock， and asystole \\[6\\]. In addition， its negative inotropyand chronotropy effects exacerbate shock states that progress quickly into multi-organ failure.**\n\n【27】**In the past， high-dose insulin infusion and glucagon have been utilized to circumvent the antagonized B-adreno receptor to stimulate cardiac contractility. These approaches， separately**\n\n【28】**and together， have been documented as successful strategies in the medical literature. The high-dose insulin infusion primarily exerts Ca'+-dependant and independent positive inotropy \\[7\\] effects via the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase dependent pathway. On the other hand， glucagon activates the adenylyl cyclase pathway， converting adenosine triphosphate to cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP)， leading to altered calcium ion influx， thus augmenting contractility.**\n\n【29】**While these modalities have been trialed and their efficacy is proven in clinical practice as reported in several case studies \\[8，9\\]，the utility of ECPR and ECMO for propranolol toxicity in Australia has not been documented in the medical literature over the last ten years.**\n\n【30】**We report on the vital role of ECLS in the resuscitation of severe propranolol toxicity and demonstrate the survival benefit derived from its use. In addition， the impact of commencing ECPR and ECMO in the early phases of resuscitation contributed to a shorter Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and greater overall survival.**\n\n【31】**Case Presentation**\n\n【32】**Our patient， an independent 24-year-old lady with a background of borderline personality disorder， is well known in the community for repeated presentations to the Emergency Department (ED) with multiple suicidal attempts in the past. She otherwise has minimal co-morbidities and does not suffer from chronic medical illnesses.**\n\n【33】**She was brought into the hospital via ambulance services after she admitted to ingesting 60 tablets of immediate-release propranolol hydrochloride (40 mg per tablet； 2400 mg in total) with three tablets of Diazepam (5 mg per tablet) at noon while being in a mental health facility voluntarily. She arrived in the Emergency Department(ED) at1408 with the following vitals： Blood Pressure (BP) of 149/90 mmHg， Pulse Rate (PR) of 81 beats per minute， Respiratory Rate (RR) of 16breaths per minute with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3/15 (Eye-1**\n\n【34】**Voice-1 Movement-1). Her vitals continue to plummet with a BP of50/20 and a HR of 40 beats per minute.**\n\n【35】**Within minutes， she developed transient generalized tonic-clonic seizures lasting for 10 sec before becoming apnoeic and progressing into a Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA) cardiac arrest. She was intubated and CPR was commenced immediately. Overall， she had two separate periods of PEA arrest interspersed by a short period of Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) lasting 8 min.**\n\n【36】**The first PEA arrest occurred over 4 min， and the second continued for 74 min before she was commenced on ECMO. She also received three separate boluses of Intravenous (IV) Actrapid 70units， IV calcium chloride 10 mmol， 500 mmol of IV 8.4% sodium bicarbonate， and 50 ml of IV Lipid emulsion (Lipidor) throughout the resuscitation. Despite the aggressive intervention， she remained in refractory PEA arrest， and thus E-CPR was activated 60 min into the second cardiac arrest (Figure 1).**\n\n【37】**While E-CPR was being established， her left femoral artery was cannulated with a 17Fr Maquet catheter while the right femoral vein received a 25Fr Maquet catheter. Then， she was placed on the Maquet Cardio help ECMO machine with the following settings：2300 revolutions per minute (rpm) generating a 3 Liter (L) flow， with a fresh gas flow of 3L per minute. CPR ceased once she transitioned onto the ECMO circuit successfully.**\n\n【38】**In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)， she remained on ECMO for a total of two days before successful decannulation in the operating theatre. During this time， the ECMO settings remained relatively the same without any significant complications encountered either from the machine or the large-bore cannula apparatus.**\n\n【39】**As per standard practice， a high-dose insulin infusion was started at 0.5 to 1 unit/kg/h， amounting to an infusion rate of 70**\n\n【40】**units/h to 85 units/h， which was subsequently weaned to 40 units per hour. However， she did not receive glucagon infusion as part of her treatment.**\n\n【41】**Post extubation， she did demonstrate a brief period of cognitive impairment but later improved， scoring 28/30 on her Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE)beforeher ICU discharge. She continued to make excellent recovery and was discharged to the medical wards for further medical and psychiatric evaluation.**\n\n【42】**Discussion**\n\n【43】**Propranolol poisoning causes severe cardiorespiratory collapse and remains a complex condition to manage. Cases in Australia continue to occur and pose many challenges to treating physicians. Despite conventional treatment， refractory cases often fail to improve solely with this. In such instances， early E-CPR and ECMO have been shown to improve patients mortality rates \\[8\\].**\n\n【44】**Briefly， there are mainly two ECMO variations； VA-ECMO(Veno-Arterial ECMO)， often used to provide cardiopulmonary support， involves inserting two large catheters into alarge venous and arterial vessel. Blood is then drawn from the venous cannula into an extracorporeal pump that incorporates fresh gas within it. It is then delivered via the arterial cannula into the arterial circulation. VA-ECMO is almost exclusively used in severe cardiorespiratory failure.**\n\n【45】**The alternative is VV-ECMO (Veno-Venous ECMO) which requires a functioning heart to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body \\[9\\]. Often it is employed in fulminant respiratory failure， providing rest to the lungs while it continues to oxygenate the systemic circulation.**\n\n【46】**The utility of ECPR and ECMO in severe propranolol poisoning has been documented in several international case reports \\[10\\]. However， in Australia over the last ten years， our literature search has shown the lack of a single documented case of either E-CPR or ECMO used in severe refractory propranolol poisoning.**\n\n【47】**The ‘dilemma of standard therapy**\n\n【48】**Before the ECLS era， the treatment for propranolol poisoning hadbeen well established. The primary treatment involved hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic infusion and glucagon in providing adequate inotropy support to the affected heart. In addition， IV calcium supplementation ensured adequate calcium for inotropy， sodium bicarbonate to antagonize the Nat channel blockade \\[11\\]， and IV lipid emulsion creating a lipid sink’ to shift the lipophilic drug from systemic circulation \\[12\\]. Hemodialysis was noted to be ineffective in propranolol toxidromes.**\n\n【49】**However， in severe refractory cases， these treatment modalities have been noted to be inadequate \\[13\\]. Often， catastrophic cases are un-survivable， with a few that are left vegetated due to hypoxic brain injury from prolonged CPR**\n\n【50】**The role of E-CPR and ECLS**\n\n【51】**Extracorporeal life support allows for the continuing perfusion andcoxygenation of vital tissues even in severe hemodynamic compromise. Once established， this temporizing artificial circulatory system provides the required amount of time for the protein-bound drug to be metabolized and excreted.**\n\n【52】**The timing of initiating ECLS is crucial. An earlier established circulation lessens the hypoxic impact on vital organs. Hence，E-CPR**\n\n【53】and ECMO offer excellent bridging options in such toxidromes \\[14\\]\n\n【54】**However， ECLS poses several challenges \\[15\\]. Firstly， expert proceduralists must perform the cannulation， which becomes more complex under E-CPR Also， echocardiographic guidance with Trans-Oesophageal Echocardiography (TOE) must be expertly performed to confirm catheter placement.**\n\n【55】**Clinical experience is vital when managing complex ECMO patients andlogistically， mobilizing ECMO patients carries significant risk with possible adverse outcomes.**\n\n【56】**Despite these challenges， overall， ECLS remains a relatively safe and efficient therapeutic option. Although previous data have demonstrated low success rates of survival to hospital discharge \\[16\\]， in this particular case，ECPR and ECMO provided the salvage therapy necessary to survive the catastrophic toxidrome.**\n\n【57】**In conclusion， ECPR and ECMO should be initiated early in patients with life-threatening cardiotoxicity secondary to acute propranolol toxicity. In addition， clinical vigilance is necessary to identify this toxidrome， start treatment with high-dose insulin and glucagon infusion， and attempt to transfer patients to a tertiary hospital with ECLS services. On the contrary，in ECLS-readyhospitals， continual excellence in service must be maintained， with fast access times and rapid initiation to ensure overall patients survival.**\n\n【58】**References**\n\n【59】**1\\.

Metformin associated lactic acidosis (MALA) remains rare， but potentially fatal condition. Metformin toxicity is driven by suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis， and interference with oxidative phosphorylation， resulting in the formation of lactate from pyruvate\\[2\\]. Metformin toxicity is typically noted at serum levels >5 mcg/mL (therapeutic range 1-2 mcg/mL). Recent evidence recommends prolonged hemodialysis or CVHDF to remove metformin serum levels in patients with hemodynamic instability \\[3-5\\]. The following case series describes the management of MALA with Sustained Low Efficiency Dialysis (SLED) \\[6，7\\].**\n\n【12】**Clinical Image**\n\n【13】**A 72 year old female with a history of RCC s/p nephrectomy， CKD， and T2DM sought treatment after five days of anorexia， vomiting， and diarrhea. Patient continued taking metformin and lisinopril. Physical exam was notable for somnolence and hypotension (90/60 mmHg). Labs notable for the following： Na 130， K 6.8， HCO，10.5， Cr 9.2 (baseline 1.2)， lactate 10.3，and pH 7.07. There was no objective data to support sepsis， ischemic bowel， or other acute process. Patient was admitted to the ICU and 8 hour SLED treatment was completed due to marginal blood pressures. Her metabolic acidosis， somnolence， and hypotension rapidly corrected.**\n\n【14】**A 67 year old male with a history of CAD and T2DM sought treatment after 3 days ofvomiting， malaise， anorexia， and oliguria. Patient continued metformin， lisinopril， hydrochlorothiazide， and furosemide. Blood pressure was 180/77 with otherwise unremarkable exam. Labs at presentation：Na 123， K 6.2，HCO3 15， Cr 9.8 (baseline of 0.8)， lactate 6.6， and pH 7.244. The patient was admitted to the ICU and SLED was initiated with rapid correction in lactic acidosis. SLED was used due to significant hyponatremia \\[6\\].

However， availability of tumor tissue for analysis maybelimited and a smallbiopsycannot reflecttumor heterogeneity \\[1\\]. The application of liquid biopsy is increasingly common thus offering new possibilities to optimize patient care. Recently， the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) placed liquid biopsy as reference diagnostic method in a context of inaccessible tumor tissue \\[2，3\\]. This situation can be encountered in the context of Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM)， occurring in 3% to 5% of advanced NSCLC patients and 9% to10% of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-mutant NSCLC patients \\[4\\]. The Circulating Cell-Free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma or Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) may provide genetic material needed for the diagnosis and management of patients with LM progression \\[5\\]. However， evidence is lacking about how to use it in practice and the operational characteristics of this test. The choice of body fluid to analyze in the context of LM involvement in EGFR-mutant NSCLC is unclear. The following clinical case illustrates this context.**\n\n【21】**Case Presentation**\n\n【22】**_is properly cited._**\n\n【23】**A 38-year-old Chinese female presented with a 2-month history of back pain. She had no family**\n\n【24】**history of cancer and no smoking history. Suspicious metastatic bone lesions were highlighted on a dorsal spine radiography. The 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose _上_ PositronEmissionTomography-Computed Tomography (FDG PET-CT) demonstrated an FDG-avid hypermetabolic process within the left lower lobe associated with a left pleural effusion， disseminated pulmonary micronodules in both lungs， ipsilateral and contralateral mediastinal hilarlymphadenopathy and multifocal bone metastases. Gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple cortical supratentorial lesions without signs of LM. Cytological analysis of the left pleural effusion by thoracic puncture led to the diagnosis of stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma \\[6\\]. Next-generation sequencing detected an EGFR exon 19 deletion (p.E746\\_A750del) from the pleural effusion. Afatinib was started. During 14 months， the patient showed an excellent tumor response with a complete extra-cerebral metabolic response and a partial intracranial response. She tolerated rather well Afatinib with some skin rash， nausea and vomiting. After 14 months of therapy， neurological symptoms (headache， increased in vomiting and a few weeks later， visual disturbances) appeared with a significant deterioration of her general condition. Gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed florid LM. A FDG PET-CT confirmed the complete extra-cerebral response (bone， pleural and lung). The patient was started on Dexamethasone. Given the absence of an accessible lesion for biopsy，plasma and CSF were collected. CSF cytology was collected twice by lumbar puncture and showed a white blood cell count of 17 per mm'(lymphocytosis of 66%) the first time and 16 per mm'the second time (lymphocytosis of 63%)， respectively， but no malignant cells in both samples. There was a proteinorachia of0.42 G/L the first time and of 0.62 G/L the second time (normal values0.15 G/L to 0.45 G/L). A Droplet DigitalPCR(ddPCR) was performed both on plasma and CSF confirming the presence of an EGFR exon19 deletion and evidencing the T790M resistance mutation in exon20.Osimertinib was started. A rapid improvement in the clinical and neurological condition was observed in the next weeks. Few months later， a complete cerebral and extra-cerebral response was observed with a complete regression of LM based on Gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance and FDG PET-CT， respectively. She has a sustained intracranial response for 24 months now.**\n\n【25】**Discussion**\n\n【26】**We observed in NSCLC a rapid evolution in the identification of targetable genetic markers for new therapies over the last decade. The development of liquid biopsies performed from different body fluids could revolutionize the genetic and molecular analyses for targeted therapies in lung cancer in the future. Many recent studies found a good concordance in mutational status between blood cfDNA and DNA from tissue biopsies \\[7，8\\]. Prabhash et al. \\[9\\] found 82.9%concordance between plasma and tissue testing. The sensitivity and specificity of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) were 68.4% and90.1% in plasma and tissue， respectively. Several other studies investigated the diagnostic accuracy of cfDNA in NSCLC patients who progressed on prior EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI)， showing a very wide range of concordance rate with the tumor tissue analysis \\[3，10-12\\]. Some studies suggested that liquid biopsy would be more representative in terms of mutational analysis than tissue biopsy because of the heterogeneity in the tumor or metastatic sites and the risk of limited tissue samples by the volume and quality\\[13，14\\]. Liquid biopsy is a minimally invasive method associated with low morbidity and mortality， improving patient acceptability \\[15\\]. It also offers economic benefits being cheaper and faster than tissue**\n\n【27】**biopsy， thanks to a reduction in turnaround time \\[16，171. Moreover， tumor tissue is not always accessible for biopsy， as it is the case with LM metastases. Aside from initial detection of an EGFR mutation， cfDNA analysis by ddPCR is also effective in detecting the T790M resistance mutation after first- or second-generation EGFR TKI therapy \\[18，19\\] with comparable accuracy to conventional histologic or cytological samples \\[20，21\\]. A meta-analysis by Zhang et al identified 11 studies that provided diagnostic accuracy values of ddPCR for the detection of the EGFR T790M mutation in plasma cfDNA showing that it achieved a 70.1% sensitivity and 86.9%specificity \\[22\\]. The study of Oxnard et al. \\[23\\] confirmed the high positive predictive value of the T790M mutation plasma genotyping by ddPCR in NSCLC with acquired resistance to EGFR TKI， in coherence with previous studies \\[24，25\\]. In contrast， in the event of a negative result， its low negative predictive value cannot obviate the need for a standard tumor tissue biopsy \\[23\\]. An increasing number of reports were interested in Central Nervous System (CNS) progression including LM in EGFR-mutant NSCLC after first- or second-generation EGFR TKI treatment given its steadily increasing incidence\\[26\\]. Indeed， the survival of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients is significantly prolonged \\[27\\] allowing more time for CNS metastases to develop， and the 15/2nd generation EGFRTKIhave poorpenetration across the blood-brain barrier which may allow the development of CNS metastases \\[28\\]. LM involvement in lung cancer has a bad prognosis and is prone to clinically devastating complications \\[29\\].In the case of CNS progression without extracranial progressive disease， obtaining a tissue biopsy is extremely difficult and yet absolutely necessary for detecting a targetable resistance mutation \\[30\\]. Moreover， it has been shown that， most likely due to the distinct brain microenvironment \\[31\\]， the genomic alterations found in CNS metastases may differ from the primary tumors \\[32，33\\]. CSF cytology is currently the only minimally invasive method for molecular analysis of CNS progression. However， its analysis is only possible if neoplastic cells are present (which is not the case in this case report) and its sensitivity remains unknown despite multiple examinations\\[34\\]. Several studies have demonstrated that cfDNA has been shown to be present in the CSF of patients with brain tumors \\[35-381.In2020 a study of Chunhua Ma et al. \\[39\\] compared the molecular characteristics from CSF cfDNA with plasma cfDNA， plasma CTC(Circulating Tumor Cells)， and brain tissue specimens in patients with brain metastases from NSCLC. They found that assessment of CSF cfDNA could provide a snapshot of what actually occurs in brain metastases and found a higher mutation detection rate in patients with LM than in those with brain parenchymal metastases. De Mattos-Arruda et al. \\[40\\] had already shown in 2015 that CSF cfDNA is more abundant and representative of CNS tumor genomic alterations than plasma， with a significantly higher sensitivity than plasma， probably due to the blood-brain barrier. These results were also confirmed in the particular case of LM progression \\[39，41，42\\]， allowing to identify the presence of multiple resistance mechanisms emerging in the therapeutic course with TKI \\[43\\]. Such phenomenon can be explained by the fact that tumoral cfDNA constitutes a very small fraction of cfDNA in plasma due to the presence of DNA released by normal cells. In CSF， significantly fewer normal cells are present， resulting in an increase in the percentage of tumoral cfDNA\\[44\\]. The CSF cfDNA can also be used to monitor CNS progression as it follows the same trend as the variation in brain tumor burden \\[45\\]. These findings mean that liquid biopsy may allow the diagnosis ofLM by mutation detection (as illustrated by this case report)， in addition to clinical and gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance**\n\n【28】**imaging. In our case， the T790M mutation was detected in the CSF cfDNA by ddPCR method， corresponding to what is described in the literature. Moreover， the T790M mutation was also detected in the plasma by the same technique. Previous reports demonstrated that EGFR T790M are more likely to occur at extracranial sites 46，471. These findings may suggest that taking two samples， CSF and plasma， may increase the chances of detecting the T790M mutation. Several studies have also shown that the use of repeated ddPCR-based cfDNA genotyping increased the sensitivity of resistance mutation detection\\[48，49\\]. Although EGFR TKI are the standard first-line treatment for EGFR mutant lung cancer， the development of acquired resistance limits Progression-Free Survival (PFS) to 10 to 12 months for first-and second generations TKI \\[50\\]. The acquisition of the T790M mutation in the EGFR gene is the most common resistance mechanism to 15l/2nd generation TKI， accounting for 50% to 60% of cases \\[50\\]. The third generation T790M mutant-selective EGFR TKI Osimertinib showed an efficacy superior to that of standard EGFR TKI in the first-line treatment of EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC in terms of PFS (17.2 vs. 8.5 months) in the FLAURA trial \\[51\\]. Based on these results， the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines included Osimertinib as a first-line treatment option， particularly in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer \\[52\\]. Thus， this particular case will naturally concern fewer patients in near future. Nevertheless， it should be highlighted that EGFR T790M is not the only mechanism of resistance to 1y/2nd generation EGFR TKI. As the treatment duration increases，the likelihood ofthe development of several secondary resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKI also inicreases \\[53，54\\].Moreover，theoccurrence ofEpithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)phenotype is closely associated with the metastatic dissemination and treatment failure in lung cancer\\[55\\]. Liquid biopsy may identify very early in the time the expression of EMT markers \\[55\\]. The question of the best sample to analyze in case of LM progression will arise again in the future as new drugs devoted to the treatment of Osimertinib resistance mutations are developed. The performance of an NGS on a liquid biopsy will open the possibility to study the different mechanisms of resistance to TKI\\[56\\]. In case of LM progression EGFR-mutant NSCLCunder TKI，the search for a resistance mutation using CSF cfDNA can be useful. Indeed， as Xi Wu et al. showed after analyzing the genetic profiling of cfDNA in CSF and plasma， the LM and extracranial lesions are thought to develop independently. To increase sensitivity repeating sampling of plasma and CSF cfDNA may be appropriate \\[57\\].**\n\n【29】**References**\n\n【30】**1\\. di Capua D， Bracken-Clarke D， Ronan K， Baird AM， Finn S.

A 12-lead ECG showed inferolateral ST-segment elevation with reciprocal changes (Figure 1). He was loaded with Aspirin and administered intravenous morphine.**\n\n【25】**_cited._**\n\n【26】**The patient had a medical background of DMD and was receiving oral prednisolone every other day. He had no known cardiac anomalies and an echocardiogram in 2018 showed a structurally normal heart. There was no history of smoking or recreational drug use. Due to progressive neuromuscular weakness， he became wheelchair-dependant by the age of 10 years.**\n\n【27】Figure 1： A 12-lead ECG showing ST segment elevation in the inferior and lateral leads of more than 2 mm with corresponding reciprocal changes. Also visible are signs of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH)，i.e. right axis deviation and a dominant R wave in lead V1 and dominant S waves in leads V5 and V6.\n\n【28】Figure 2： A 12-lead ECG on day 5 showed the ST elevation visible earlier had resolved but signs of right ventricular hypertrophy persisted.\n\n【29】**Clinical examination revealed an overweight male (BMI 24.8kg/m， 95h percentile). His vital signs were normal except a resting tachycardia of 103 beats per minute. The case was discussed with the interventional cardiologist as well as the pediatric cardiologist， the latter based in a network hospital in the same city. Initial cardiac biomarkers were significantly elevated， with Troponin-T result recorded at 7，065 ng/L (reference range 0 ng/L to 14 ng/L) using the Elecsys Troponin T-highly sensitive assay (Roche Diagnostics). The patient was admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit with a differential diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction or acute myocardial injury related to cardiomyopathy. Inflammatory markers and an infection screen were also performed and were negative for any extrinsic infectious etiology for this presentation.**\n\n【30】**Based on the presentation to ED with crushing chest pain， the ECG changes noted， and the elevated cardiac biomarkers， an initial working diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was made \\[2\\].**\n\n【31】**Another differential diagnosis was cardiomyopathy related acute myocardial injury. Cardiomyopathy is more commonly described in DMD. In this case， the cardiomyopathy may have been largely asymptomatic prior to presentation.On attendance in ER， the clinical features were not consistent with heart failure and a structurally normal heart was seen on echocardiography， however it should be noted the absence of typical symptoms of heart failure like dyspnea on exertion and limited exercise tolerance are common in DMD. Furthermore， in early stages， due to restricted LV enlargement， the echocardiogram may appear normal \\[3\\].**\n\n【32】**A 12-lead ECG in ED showed a sinus rhythm and ST-segment elevation in the inferior and lateral leads of more than 2 mm with**\n\n【33】**corresponding reciprocal changes. Signs of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH)， i.e.， right axis deviation， dominant R wave lead V1 and dominant S waves in leads V5 and V6 (Figure 1) were demonstrated. A 12-lead ECG on day 5 showed the ST-segment elevation had resolved but signs of RVH persisted (Figure 2). We did not have access to a baseline ECG to compare the current attendance's ECG changes with.**\n\n【34】**The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for monitoring and medical management for 5 days. He was commenced on Captoprilandhis usualtreatment plan with steroids was continued.**\n\n【35】**Aechocardiogramm was _F_ performedon admission， which showed depressed LV systolic function with an EF of 45%， mild insufficiency of the aortic valve and no structural anomalies. Cardiac CT angiography of the coronaries was performed the next day and demonstrated normal cardiac anatomy and normal coronary arteries. Unfortunately， our patient did not have Cardiac Magnetic Resonance imaging (CMR) on admission.**\n\n【36】**Serial troponins were collected on a daily basis which showed a decreasing trend with a troponin level of 1，271 ng/L recorded on the day of discharge. A repeat echocardiogram was done before discharge which showed an improved EF of 58% and normal ventricular systolic function.**\n\n【37】**At 8 weeks follow up， a repeat echocardiogram was reported showing mildly depressed LV systolic function with an EF of 49%and mild insufficiency of the aortic valve. Troponin-T assay was now recorded at a level of 74.8 ng/L. The patient was commenced on Bisoprolol and continues to follow up in clinic.**\n\n【38】**Discussion**\n\n【39】**Cardiac disease in DMD has been described preclinically as young as in toddlers. By the age of 18， the vast majority of DMD patients have cardiac disease， the commonest being cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is more common followed by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Symptoms are often absent due to restricted physical activity \\[1，8\\].**\n\n【40】**Arrhythmias like atrial tachycardias， ventricular tachycardia， andventricular fibrillation have been reported in advanced cardiomyopathy. Sinus tachycardia is the most common arrhythmia observed \\[3，9\\]. Heart blocks are also reported although these are less common. Severe LV dysfunction is a risk factor for arrhythmias and Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE)， a marker for myocardial fibrosis， seen on Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR)， is also associated with a higher risk of arrhythmias \\[1，3\\].**\n\n【41】**Abnormal ECG findings are found in 70% of cases including sinus tachycardia， short PR interval， dominant R wave in lead V1， deep Q waves in the inferolateral leads， right ventricular hypertrophy， aberrant conduction， and a prolonged QT interval \\[10\\].**\n\n【42】**Cardiac biomarkers can be chronically elevated due to their skeletal muscle origin with cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) being more specific than cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) possibly because it is not expressed in human skeletal muscle and is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease \\[11，12\\]. Furthermore， cut-off levels of troponin for the diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) are not validated in children， and children with DMD. In a case series by Hor et al. \\[13\\] cTnI levels ranged from 31 ng/ml to 62 ng/ml(reference range <0.03 ng/ml). Similarly， ECG criteria for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction are not well-defined or validated in children. Towbin et al. \\[14\\] suggested criteria based on ST-segment and Q wave changes.**\n\n【43】**Echocardiography has been used for assessment of cardiac wall motion and EF due to it is availability and low cost. It has limitations in being operator-dependent. CT coronary angiography might be a useful tool for assessment if CMR is not readily available. CMR is recommended for screening of disease progression showing hallmark changes in the posterobasal and basal inferiolateral area of the left ventricle \\[15\\]. LGE in the subendocardium suggests ischemic injury， whereas subepicardial localization favors myocarditis or an infiltrative disorder \\[16\\]. In DMD it is recommended CMR is conducted annually after the age of 10 years.**\n\n【44】**Hor et al. reported 8 DMD pediatric cases who presented with chest complaints， ST-segment elevation， with elevated troponin levels. In all 8 patients， normal coronary perfusion was confirmed by CT angiography or cardiac catheterization， whereas on CMR， abnormal systolic function was demonstrated \\[13\\]. They attributed this to cardiomyopathy disease progression which leads to episodic myocardial injury. Cinteza et al. \\[15\\] described the use of pulsed steroid therapy as a treatment of acute myocardial injury in a symptomatic child with DMD with favourable results. Another paper described an asymptomatic 12-vear-old child with DMD who was diagnosed with acute myocardial injury by ST-segment elevation and elevated cardiac biomarkers. They compared apoptosis and necrosis as mechanisms of cardiac cell death \\[17\\]. There are multiple case reports describing myocardial infarction in DMD children aged 10 to13 \\[18-21\\]. One paper described myocardial infarction in a 10-year-old DMD child following physical exertion and another in 13-year-**\n\n【45】**old DMD patients who experienced acute chest pain and had ST-segment elevation on their ECG and high troponin levels \\[20，21\\].**\n\n【46】**The principle of pharmacological treatment in DMD is to delay onset of heart failure. Early steroid therapy has a beneficial impact onlung function， LV function， and skeletal muscle. Similarly， uses of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been proven to delay the onset and progression of LV dysfunction \\[22\\].**\n\n【47】**Once LV dysfunction is established， corticosteroids remain beneficial and are shown to delay establishment of myocardial fibrosis on CMR \\[23\\]. ACE inhibitors are recommended first line therapy proven to reduce mortality and hospital admission in DMD patients with heart failure \\[24\\].**\n\n【48】**Beta blockers have also been shown to be beneficial in DMD as an anti-arrhythmic， improve EF， and reduce detrimental ventricular remodeling \\[25\\]. Aldosterone antagonists like Eplerenone have also had a positive impact when started at a younger age， and in addition to ACE inhibitors and beta blockers \\[8，26\\].**\n\n【49】**Some anti-arrhythmic drugs can increase skeletal muscle weakness； otherwise their use in DMD patients is similar to non-DMD patients \\[27\\]. In patients with end stage heart failure， use of mechanical cardiac support devices is also a feasible option. Similarly non-invasive ventilation is a treatment option for restrictive ventilatory defects resulting from progressive respiratory muscle weakness \\[28\\].**\n\n【50】**DMD patients can attend ED with many acute problems， respiratory complaints perhaps the commonest. Dyspnea is often mild compared to the severity of disease. Undifferentiated chest pain from cardiac and non-cardiac causes are both likely. Esophagitis and musculoskeletal chest pain， the latter from coughing have been reported. Constipation is also common but thinks of other high-risk conditions first like steroid related ulcer disease. Renal colic is another differential diagnosis when presenting with abdominal pain. They are also prone to back pain from osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Fatigue is also reported possibly attributed to nocturnal hypoventilation， mood disturbances， and advanced cardiomyopathy. Have a low threshold to discuss the care of DMD patients with their parent team， often the neurologists \\[28\\].**\n\n【51】**It is worth noting that 5% of all myocardial infarctions do not have obstructed coronary arteries， a condition termed ‘Myocardial Infarction with Normal Coronary Arteries (MINOCA). In these cases， sepsis， pulmonary embolism， substance misuse， myocarditis， or oxygen supply-demand mismatch resulting in a type 2 myocardial infarction (e.g. from anemia or thyrotoxicosis) should be excluded\\[16，29\\]. In children， MINOCA from myocarditis has been reported to be associated with Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) in 5% of cases \\[29\\]. Pediatric Kounis syndrome， a hypersensitivity coronary disorder involving mast cells and other inflammatory mediators， has also been reported as an etiology of MINOCA \\[30\\].**\n\n【52】**In conclusion， our patient with chest pain and ECG changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia was objectively evaluated for CAD. It is plausible our patient had episodic myocardial injury due to myocardial disease progression， the latter being a common cause of morbidity and mortality in DMD patients.**\n\n【53】IDMD patients can present to ED with a variety of complaints often chest or cardiac in nature.\n\n【54】**Frontline healthcare practitioners should be aware of the high prevalence of cardiomyopathy in these patients which increases with age.**\n\n【55】**As a rule， be vigilant and discuss these cases early on with their parent team.**\n\n【56】**Cardiac biomarkers can be chronically elevated in DMD. However， a high level of suspicion coupled with an echocardiogram can assist in the diagnosis of acute myocardial injury in these cases.**\n\n【57】**Where available， CMR assists in the evaluation of patients with cardiomyopathy related myocardial injury， with characteristic LGE seen.**\n\n【58】**References**\n\n【59】**1\\.
