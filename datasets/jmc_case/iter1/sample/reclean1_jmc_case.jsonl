First found during an autopsy in 1708 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, heterotopic pregnancy occurs in 1:30,000 of natural conceptions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. With increasing usage of assisted reproduction, the frequency of heterotopic pregnancies was cited to be between 1:100 and 1:7,000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】This rare obstetrics phenomenon carries a significant maternal morbidity and mortality due to the risk of ruptured ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Hence, early diagnosis and management of heterotopic pregnancy is crucial. However, the rate of early diagnosis of heterotopic pregnancy has not increased since 1970 despite advances in medical knowledge and ultrasonography technique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Health care professionals have been indoctrinated with the famous dictum by the French surgeon Henri Mondor 通用删除7(英):<u>(1885 - 1962)</u> ‘Think Ectopic’ when assessing acute abdomen of pregnant women. However, when an intrauterine gestation is seen on ultrasonography, the dictum is not translated into heterotopic pregnancy.\n\n【4】Below is a unique case history of heterotopic pregnancy in a clinically stable patient with low risk factors which was picked up on thorough ultrasonography rather than on laparoscopy. This case report stresses the importance of a holistic approach and thorough ultrasonography in managing these patients.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】KH, a 22-year-old woman, presented to the gynaecological admission unit with a 7-week history of amenorrhea and a 2-day history of lower abdominal period-like pain. She denied any vaginal bleeding, shoulder tip pain, urinary or bowel symptoms.\n\n【7】She denied having had any previous sexually transmitted infections and had never used intra-uterine contraceptive devices or undergone fertility treatment. She had no history of any tubal or pelvic pathology, ectopic pregnancies or miscarriage. She was an ex-smoker. She was on cerazette for contraception which she said she took regularly. Her periods were irregular. She had a normal vaginal delivery in 2008.\n\n【8】Her past medical and surgical histories were unremarkable. She used no regular medications. She was allergic to penicillin.\n\n【9】On examination, she was tachycardic at 105 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 122 mmHg/62 mmHg. Her abdomen was soft with mild suprapubic and right iliac fossa tenderness. On bimanual examination, she had an 8-week size uterus with a tender right adnexa and positive cervical excitation tenderness. No adnexal masses were felt. Her cervical os was closed.\n\n【10】Her urine pregnancy test was positive. Her serum bHCG was 3892 mIU/mL. Urine dipstick showed no signs of urinary tract infection. Her haemoglobin was 13.7g/dL.\n\n【11】She underwent a transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound scan which revealed a non-viable intrauterine gestational sac at 7+ weeks  as well as a large heterogenous mass with a yolk sac seen medial to the right ovary . Free fluid was noted in the pouch of Douglas .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The serum bHCG after 48 hours fell optimally to 44.1 mIU/m. Urinary pregnancy test was negative after 2 weeks.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Early diagnosis of heterotopic pregnancy is often challenging due to the lack of clinical signs and symptoms as well as diagnostic confusion with other early pregnancy issues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】A good history is important to identify risk factors for heterotopic pregnancy such as fertility treatment and tubal pathologies like pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis or previous tubal surgeries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Patients with previous ectopic pregnancy or patients who conceived while using intrauterine devices are also at risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The four common clinical signs of heterotopic pregnancies are abdominal pain, adnexal mass, peritoneal irritation and uterine fundus larger than menstrual dates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Vaginal bleeding occurs rarely in heterotopic pregnancy, compared to ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Ultrasonography\n\n【21】Ultrasonography is routinely used in early pregnancy. Despite the advancement of transvaginal ultrasonography, identification of viable early intrauterine pregnancy before 5.5 weeks and ectopic pregnancy still remains challenging. Clinicians and sonographers tend to be lulled into a false sense of security when an intrauterine gestation sac is seen. This results in inadequate inspection of the adnexae and remaining structures during ultrasonography despite a strong initial clinical suspicion of ectopic pregnancy.\n\n【22】A review article in 2008 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> which analysed 6 studies showed that transvaginal ultrasonography has a sensitivity of 74-84% in diagnosing ectopic pregnancy with specificity between 84-99.9%. However, ultrasonography is operator dependent. A comparative review of 192 cases of heterotopic pregnancies in 2007 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> showed that only 1/3 of the cases was definitively diagnosed by ultrasonography pre-operatively like in this case study.\n\n【23】The only pathognomonic sign of heterotopic pregnancy is the simultaneous visualisation of extrauterine and intrauterine fetal pole with cardiac motion. This occurs in only 10% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The ultrasound appearance of an ectopic pregnancy varies depending on location, gestation period, viability and presence of pelvic pathology.\n\n【24】However, there are a few features on ultrasonography associated with ectopic pregnancies. Firstly, the risk of ectopic pregnancy is increased with increasing amount of free fluid in the pelvis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> due to a physiological response to distortion of the Fallopian tube or bleeding from the damaged ectopic pregnancy. Hence, presence of free fluid in pelvis should trigger a thorough inspection of the adnexae despite observing an intrauterine gestation. We should not too hastily attribute the intraperitoneal free fluid to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in patients on fertility treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Secondly, it is crucial to visualise the corpus luteum. In 70-85% of cases, ectopic pregnancy normally occurs on the ipsilateral side of the corpus luteum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Ectopic pregnancy is normally visualised on ultrasound in 3 forms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In 58% of cases, the ‘blob’ sign, which is a heterogenous mass adjacent to the ovary but moves separately, is seen, 20% of cases show up as the ‘bagel sign’, which is a mass with hyperechoic ring around. The remaining cases present as a gestational sac with fetal pole like in this case study.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】A holistic approach and thorough ultrasonography is crucial in patients with high suspicion of ectopic pregnancy or in the presence of pelvic free fluid even when an intrauterine pregnancy is identified. A new dictum ‘Think ectopic. If intrauterine gestation is seen, think heterotopic’ needs to be adopted.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:54:50", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:55:00", "cost": 9.532}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:09:00", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:54:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:54:41"}

Some of these complications may require surgical interventions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In addition, premature infants are at a greater risk than the full term infants while undergoing similar surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Because of the fact that almost all premature infants have various degrees of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the risk of encountering the symptoms of coughing, laryngospasm and consequent hypoxic episodes is getting higher in the postoperative period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】In this case report, we present the anesthetic management towards an infant with a complete atelectasis of the right lung, and with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, for whom laser treatment is planned for rethinopathy of prematurity (ROP).\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】The female infant weighing 950 grams and born through vaginal delivery at the 27th gestational age was transferred to our hospital following the diagnosis of BPD and consequent bilateral stage 2 retinopathy with plus disease. As a result of the examinations and tests performed, the patient was hospitalized following the diagnosis of prematurity, respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, BPD, ROP, transient hypothyroxinemia of prematurity and intracranial hemorrhage. During the physical examination of the patient, tachypnea and retractions were observed. In the transfontanel ultrasonography performed, it was observed that both ventricles were dilated, thrombosis was present in choroid plexus, and heterogenous image in the left thalamus was seen and cystical encephalomalacia was present. In the echocardiography, secundum atrial septal defect, minimal tricuspid regurgitation, and patent ductus arteriosus were observed. When an urgent ROP surgery was planned for the patient with the above mentioned symptoms, during the preoperative assessment in terms of anesthesia, the chest radiogram showed a complete atelectasis of the right lung .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Chest radiogram preoperatively. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【6】The peripheric oxygen saturation (SpO <sub>2 </sub> ) of the infant, who was admitted to the operation room in an incubator with oxygen support, was observed to be 94%. Standard monitorization was performed for the patient and ventilation was manually assisted by a face mask, and the SpO <sub>2 </sub> was found to be 97%. Following this, sevoflurane induction with O <sub>2 </sub> was administered, and a laringeal mask airway (LMA) was placed. One minute later, the patient’s SpO <sub>2 </sub> decreased to 70%. The LMA was immediately removed and the patient was ventilated by a face mask. The SpO <sub>2 </sub> thus reached 97%. Then, the LMA was placed once again and the SpO <sub>2 </sub> again decreased to 70%. The LMA was again removed and the patient was ventilated by a face mask. Then the patient was intubated with an endotracheal tube No. 2.5. However, when desaturation continued, the tube was removed and again, the patient was ventilated by a face mask. The SpO <sub>2 </sub> of the infant rapidly increased to 96%. It was observed that the removed tube was obstructed with secretion. The patient was intubated a second time with an endotracheal tube No. 3.0 and a large amount of secretion was aspirated. While the patient was being ventilated with a mixture of 40% O <sub>2 </sub> \\-air, the SpO <sub>2 </sub> improved gradually and reached 100%. This value was maintained during the 30-minute surgery. Laser treatment was applied to both eyes of the patient and the surgery ended without any complications. At the end of the surgery, the intubated patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. The clinically stable patient was extubated after the confirmation of the SpO <sub>2 </sub> to be 100% at the 2nd postoperative hour and right lung, which had atelectasis in the chest radiogram, to be significantly treated . In the chest radiogram of the patient, who was followed up in the pediatric intensive care unit, taken the following day, it was observed that the right lung was normally ventilated . Thus, the patient was transferred to the maternity ward.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

Chest radiogram on the 1st postoperative day. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is the most common cause of chronic lung disease in infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Rather than being a specific disease, it is the symptom of a complex one characterized by airway obstruction, airway hyperreactivity, and lung hyperinflation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This results in uneven distribution of ventilation, reduced compliance, increased work of breathing, and compromised gas exchange. The clinical manifestations of this condition are rapid respiration, wheezing, cough, and frequent episodes of fever, desaturation, and bradycardia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. Instrumentation of the airway is associated with pulmonary, as well as systemic, hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Further respiratory compromise may prove to be disastrous in these patients, and it is well documented that infants with BPD are at increased risk to develop bronchospasm, atelectasis, and pneumonia in the postoperative period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】The early detection of stage 3 ROP is crucial for the exact timing of the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. When treatment is delayed, development of retinal detachment and subsequent very low visual acuity or blindness is more likely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Therefore, in our case, the infant with atelectasis of a single lung was immediately admitted for surgery without waiting for the recovery of the lung.\n\n【12】There is great variation on the types of anesthesia for the surgery of ROP including general anesthesia, topical anesthesia alone or topical anesthesia plus oral sedation or intravenous sedation or rectal chloralhydrate or paracetamol or intravenous ketamine, subtenon’s local anesthesia, ketamine sedation, remifentanyl infusion and morphine infusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\- 15 \\]</u>. However, when we look through the literature, all anesthesia types have their own advantages and disadvantages on the risk of morbidity and the patient’s, surgeon's and the anesthetist’s security, so the anesthesia technique to be used must be chosen according to the patient’s clinical aspect.\n\n【13】Topical anesthesia alone is insufficient for treatment of ROP and may be associated with an increased incidence of potentially life-threatening cardio-respiratory events. Among the variety of anesthesia alternatives for surgery of ROP, general anesthesia is the mostly used modality. General anesthesia in premature infants can be associated with a high risk of morbidity especially when intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, and necrotising enterocolitis are also present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 , 16 \\]</u>. In this case report; because the patient had an atelectesia on the right lung and low the SpO <sub>2 </sub> (94%) although she was in the incubator with the O <sub>2 </sub> supply, we decided to choose general anesthesia technique where we can use positive pressure ventilation.\n\n【14】Patients with ROP and concomitant BPD present the anesthesiologist with a significant challenge regarding airway management. General anesthesia with tracheal intubation will guarantee a patent airway, make positive pressure ventilation possible, and allow the anesthesiologist to remove their hand from the surgical field. However, these patients are sensitive to airway infections and often suffer from bronchial hyperreactivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Thus, inserting a foreign object into the bronchial tree will increase the risk both for respiratory infection and bronchospastic episodes. General anesthesia and tracheal intubation also is not uncommonly associated with a setback regarding the need for respiratory support, and certain patients thus will require postoperative ventilator treatment of varying duration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 18 , 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】It is possible to administer general anesthesia by a face mask, however, when a face mask is used, the mask or the hand of the anesthesiologist holding the mask may cause a failure in the successful completion of the surgery. Furthermore, pressure from the mask and the hand may cause an increase in intraocular pressure on the globe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. The incidence of coughing, straining movements, breath holding, and sore throat were much higher when the endotrachael tube was used when compared to the use of LMA. Since LMA does not enter the trachea, it is less irritating to both the upper and lower airways; therefore, it may be advantageous in former premature infants and other children with chronic lung disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Also, in pediatric patients, the LMA does not stimulate the sensitive tissue of the larynx and trachea. Therefore, when laryngeal stimulation is absent, for minor surgical procedures, pediatric patients may be maintained at a lighter plane of general anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. So, we decided to use the LMA at the beginning of the operation but as the patient’s SpO2 was insistently low, we had to intubate the infant with an endotrachael tube.\n\n【16】In conclusion, even if premature patients with BPD also have atelectasis of one lung, such patients should immediately be operated on for such surgeries are urgent. When administering general anesthesia to these patients, instead of the placement of LMA, we believe direct endotracheal intubation would be more efficient to ensure a patent airway and easily aspirate secretions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:49:19", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:49:53", "cost": 34.6}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:09:00", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:49:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:49:09"}

The perioperative concerns of such patients are discussed and previous reports of anesthetic care are reviewed.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Patient or parent consent for publication of a case report is not required by the Institutional Review Board of Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH, USA). This patient was cared for during a surgical mission trip of Kids First Orthopedic Group (Nashville, TN) to San Miguel, Mexico. The patient was a 9.6 kg, 5-year-old child with CS who presented for bilateral club foot repair. CS was diagnosed during the first year of life during an evaluation for poor weight gain and abnormal facies. The patient was on no medications. There was no significant past medical or surgical history. On physical examination, the patient was noted to have microcephaly and an abnormal facies with a beak-like pointed nose, large ears, and micrognathia. He was non-verbal and ambulated only with a walker or support. Airway examination was difficult due to lack of cooperation, but revealed a Mallampati class 3 airway. The cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were unremarkable. Preoperative vital signs include heart rate (HR) of 118 beats/min, blood pressure (BP) of 84/46 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, body temperature of 36 °C, and room air oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient was held nil per os for 6 h for solids and 2 h for clear liquids. He was transported to the operating room and standard American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were placed. Anesthesia was induced by the inhalation of sevoflurane in oxygen and a peripheral intravenous catheter was placed. Bag-valve-mask ventilation was provided without difficulty. Propofol (1.5 mg/kg) was administered and a size 2 laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was placed. Following LMA placement, the patient was placed in the lateral Sims’ position and a caudal epidural block was placed with the administration of 10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 and clonidine (10 µg). Anesthesia was maintained with 2-3% sevoflurane (inspired concentration) in oxygen with spontaneous ventilation and fentanyl (1 µg/kg). No response was noted to surgical incision and the sevoflurane was decreased to 1.5-2%. Intraoperative vital signs were stable with an HR of 110 - 140 beats/min, BP of 68 - 88/40 - 58 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 97-100%, and respiratory rate of 18 - 24 breaths/min. The operative procedure lasted 75 min. Total intraoperative blood loss was less than 10 mL. Intraoperative fluids included 220 mL of Hartmann’s solution. At the completion of the surgical procedure, the LMA was removed and the patient was transported to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). His postoperative course was unremarkable. He was discharged to the inpatient ward from the PACU and then home the following day. Postoperative analgesia was provided by intermittent doses of oral acetaminophen.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】There are several perioperative concerns to consider when planning anesthetic care for patients with CS. Previous reports of anesthetic care for patients with CS are summarized in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\- 20 \\]</u>. As with any anesthetic care, appropriate preoperative preparation begins with a thorough history and physical examination. Of primary concern to anesthesia providers is the potential for a difficult airway related to many physical features including micrognathia, a small mouth, large teeth, overbite, limited mouth opening, and restriction of temporomandibular joint movement. The available literature clearly shows that direct laryngoscopy may be problematic and that bag-valve-mask ventilation may be difficult. In most cases of difficult bag-valve-mask ventilation, the placement of an LMA has resulted in effective gas exchange. Given these concerns, the appropriate equipment for dealing with the difficult airway including indirect video-laryngoscopy should be readily available prior to anesthetic induction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. General anesthesia can be induced by the inhalation of sevoflurane in 100% oxygen with the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation. The report of Tsukamoto et al suggests that the use of continuous processed electroecncephalogram (EEG) monitoring with devices such as the bispectral index (BIS) may be useful as there may be discordance between the hemodynamic parameters and the depth of anesthesia from the EEG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. In their report, the authors noted a rapid decline of the BIS to less than 10 during the induction of anesthesia with 8% sevoflurane. The administration of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) should be avoided until adequate bag-valve-mask ventilation is demonstrated. Due to degeneration and involvement of the CNS, patients may have associated gastroesophageal reflux, suggesting that an RSI is indicated. However, given for the potential for airway difficulties, inhalation induction with the application of cricoid pressure may be preferable to RSI. The available anecdotal evidence has demonstrated that in many cases, a smaller than age-appropriate endotracheal tube (ETT) is frequently required due to the associated growth retardation and the potential for subglottic narrowing of the airway.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Summary of Previous Reports of Anesthetic Care for Patients With Cockayne Syndrome |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【8】With the associated neurologic and muscle involvement, one of the main perioperative concerns in providing anesthetic care of such patients is the choice of NMBA. Although it provides a rapid onset of neuromuscular blockade and is often chosen for RSI or if difficulties with endotracheal intubation are anticipated, it has been suggested that succinylcholine be avoided in CS due to the associated neurologic and myopathic involvement and the potential for an exaggerated hyperkalemic response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 23 \\]</u>. In our patient, given the surgical procedure, NMBAs were not required and the airway was managed with an LMA and spontaneous ventilation was maintained. In the event that neuromuscular blockade is required for the surgical procedure, non-depolarizing NMBAs (vecuronium or atracurium) should be used with care as the effect may be prolonged even with routine dosing in patients with pre-existing neuromuscular diseases or hypotonia. Alternatively, where available, suggamadex may provide an additional margin of safety for reversal of the neuromuscular blocking effects of rocuronium or vecuronium.\n\n【9】Comorbid end-organ involvement with CS may also include cardiovascular, endocrine, and renal involvement. Hypertension commonly occurs as part of CS, with elevated renin levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. Autopsy data have demonstrated premature cerebral arteriosclerosis with the potential for strokes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 25 , 26 \\]</u>. Coronary artery involvement may predispose to myocardial ischemia as demonstrated by one case report of Yuen et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. During perioperative care, ECG monitoring for ischemia with control of factors regulating myocardial oxygen delivery including diastolic BP and heart rate is suggested. Diabetes mellitus and renal involvement have been reported with CS. Renal biopsy specimens have revealed collapsed glomeruli with a thickened basement membrane, atrophic capillary loops, and advanced hyalinization resulting in decreased renal function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. As indicated, preoperative evaluation of renal function, electrolytes, and blood glucose may be indicated.\n\n【10】In summary, we present the anesthetic considerations of a 5-year-old boy with CS, an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dwarfism, premature aging, impaired development of the nervous system, dental complications, abnormal photosensitivity, and optic atrophy. Primary perioperative concerns include the potential for difficulties with airway management including bag-valve-mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation. Various physical features may result in problematic airway management including micrognathia, a small mouth, large teeth, overbite, limited mouth opening, and restriction of temporomandibular joint movement. Additional end-organ involvement includes progressive CNS degeneration with mental retardation, cardiovascular involvement with hypertension and accelerated atherosclerotic disease with myocardial ischemia, diabetes mellitus, and renal insufficiency. The preoperative assessment of end-organ impairment by the primary disease process, preparation for potential difficulties with endotracheal intubation, and close postoperative monitoring are suggested for the effective perioperative care of these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:48:41", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:48:55", "cost": 13.259}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:09:00", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:48:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:48:41"}

Herein, we describe the complex treatment of a man with CES following invasive arterial interventions after an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Medical management was complicated by a concurrent, new left ventricular (LV) apical thrombus.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 66-year-old man presented to his local emergency department (ED) with chest pain, and was diagnosed with an acute non-ST elevation MI. He was initiated on IV heparin and dual anti-platelet therapy and transferred to Mayo Clinic Hospital for further management. On arrival, his ECG showed mild ST elevation in the anterolateral leads. Coronary angiography showed severe multi-vessel coronary artery disease. Echocardiography showed severely reduced LV systolic function, an ejection fraction of 22%, and akinesis of the anterior and anterolateral walls and apex. The patient subsequently developed recurrent chest pain with pronounced ST-segment elevation in the anterolateral leads. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed followed by CABG surgery.\n\n【4】Following hospital dismissal, his creatinine was noted to progressively rise from a baseline of 1.3 mg/dL to 2.0 mg/dL one week post-discharge, to 5.2 mg/dL 10 weeks later. His eosinophil count was also elevated. A follow-up echocardiogram revealed a new LV apical thrombus. Because of his deteriorating clinical status, he was readmitted to the hospital. His physical examination was notable for livedo reticularis on the plantar surfaces and acrocyanosis bilaterally . Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis or localized wedge-shaped lesions. These findings, following recent endovascular interventions, raised clinical suspicion for CES. Ultrasound of the aorta showed mobile atheromatous plaques in the abdominal aorta . Renal biopsy showed morphologic alterations within arteries and arterioles consistent with atheroembolic renal disease .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Serum creatinine then resumed an upward trend as the INR increased to the therapeutic range. Corticosteroid therapy was initiated to suppress the inflammatory response to the cholesterol crystals. Subsequently, the serum creatinine level stabilized in the range of 5.8 - 6.0 mg/dL, followed by a slow decline. He was discharged in stable condition on day 12 with a creatinine level of 5.9 mg/dL. The patient’s last serum creatinine level was 4.8 mg/dL at 2 weeks after discharge.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Cholesterol crystal embolization is a rare, but serious, complication of invasive endovascular procedures in patients with advanced atherosclerosis. The incidence of clinically apparent cholesterol embolization after such procedures ranges from less than 1% after cardiac surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> to 1.4% after cardiac catheterization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 14 \\]</u>, but it has been noted in up to 30% of similar cases in autopsy series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Other risk factors for cholesterol embolization include hypertension and thrombolytic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Possible effects of the emboli include neurologic injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, gastrointestinal infarcts, renal failure and ischemic skin changes. End-organ manifestations generally correlate with blood flow distribution distal to the source. Hence, renal failure is commonly observed in association with CES since the kidneys receive 20-25% of cardiac output 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 , 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Other possible manifestations include fever, eosinophilia and elevated levels of inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Up to 80% of CES cases may show eosinophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Although eosinophiluria may be seen, its diagnostic accuracy for identifying atheroembolic renal disease is limited and varies depending on the stain used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Therefore, the presence of urine eosinophils should be interpreted in the context of other clinical clues. Definitive diagnosis is made by renal biopsy. In the present case, progressive renal failure, ischemic skin changes and eosinophilia in the situation of recent invasive endovascular procedures raised the clinical suspicion of CES, which was subsequently confirmed by renal biopsy.\n\n【11】Treatment of CES is largely supportive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> and generally consists of fluid and blood pressure support, hemodialysis when indicated, and nutritional and metabolic support. Surgical removal of the embolic source is warranted for those cases occurring spontaneously to prevent recurrent embolic showers. The role of anticoagulation therapy in CES remains controversial. Although no randomized trials have specifically evaluated anticoagulation as a potential CES risk factor, previous studies have suggested an association between anticoagulation and plaque hemorrhage, plaque rupture and subsequent cholesterol crystal embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 18 , 19 \\]</u>. In the absence of prior endovascular procedures, anticoagulation alone is temporally associated with approximately 7% of CES renal disease cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Thus, treatment of CES generally entails withdrawal or avoidance of anticoagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】In the present case, CES management was complicated by the acute indication for anticoagulation (LV thrombus). Because potential consequences of an embolus can be disastrous, withdrawal of anticoagulation in such cases requires careful consideration of potential risks and benefits. In the absence of anticoagulation, the risk of embolization in patients with LV thrombus, particularly if mobile or protruding, as in our patient, has been reported to be between 10% and 15%, with most events occurring within the first few weeks after acute MI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 \\]</u>. Prior studies have suggested that early anticoagulation lowers the risk of thrombus embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 24 \\]</u>. Current consensus is to continue anticoagulation in patients with a concurrent indication for it (e.g. mechanical prosthetic valve, new intravascular thrombus, atrial fibrillation) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Cholesterol embolism is a rare, but serious complication of invasive endovascular procedures. It may result in ischemic end-organ damage from distal embolization of ruptured plaque in the aorta. Early recognition demands a high index of suspicion based on clinical findings of ischemic skin lesions, gradual-onset renal failure, elevated levels of inflammatory markers and eosinophilia. Treatment is generally supportive. Although no definitive treatment is established for CES, use of anticoagulant therapy in cholesterol embolization appears to be feasible and safe in patients with a coexisting urgent indication for anticoagulation.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:09:49", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:10:08", "cost": 19.203}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:09:00", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:10:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:09:48"}

It belongs to the class of aminosalicylate drugs and exerts its therapeutic effects directly within the gastrointestinal system. The precise mechanism of action of the drug remains uncertain. However, the possible mechanism of action of mesalazine is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, thereby impeding prostaglandin formation, that results in decreasing signaling via PPAR-γ pathway leading to decreased activity of nuclear factor κB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. By interrupting this cascade, mesalazine contributes to the reduction of colonic inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Upon oral administration, mesalazine is primarily metabolized in the gut, resulting in localized actions in that region. As a result, the incidence of systemic side effects is relatively low, with most adverse reactions being gastrointestinal in nature, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that while rare, mesalazine can potentially give rise to certain complications beyond the gastrointestinal system. These less common adverse effects include pancreatitis, blood dyscrasias (abnormalities in blood cell counts or function), and cardiovascular complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. These manifestations may arise due to various mechanisms of action exhibited by mesalazine. Many potential sites of action include the inhibition of interleukin-2 and lipoxygenase, which are important inflammatory mediators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Myocarditis, although rare, represents a significant and potentially hazardous complication of mesalazine therapy. Therefore, it is crucial to promptly recognize and differentiate it from extraintestinal manifestations of IBD. Early recognition and discontinuation of the medication are of utmost importance, as it can potentially save lives. In this context, we present a case study of a 32-year-old male patient who developed acute myocarditis shortly after initiating mesalazine treatment.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】A 32-year-old male without prior cardiac history presented to the emergency department (ED) with an intense 8 out 10, central chest pain. The pain had been radiating to the left shoulder and the back over the previous 24 h. Concurrently, the patient experienced mild dyspnea and generalized weakness. There was no associated cough, fever, or other flu-like symptoms. Past medical history included a recent diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC), about 12 days ago, with the initiation of mesalazine 1.5 g b.i.d. On examination, the patient was afebrile and normotensive with normal oxygen saturation and normal heart rate. The cardiovascular and respiratory examination was unremarkable. Chest X-ray demonstrated clear lung fields with normal cardiothoracic ratio. Resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus rhythm with concave ST-segment elevation in I, II, V4-6 . Elevated cardiac biomarkers suggestive of myocardial damage were observed, with a troponin-I level of 6.53 ng/mL (normal range < 0.5 ng/mL) and with a CK-MB of 65 IU/L (normal range < 25 IU/L). In addition, further laboratory analysis revealed an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration of 105 mg/dL (normal range < 5 mg/dL) and others blood tests within normal parameters (including leucocytes and eosinophils concentrations). The transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated a normal-size left ventricle (LV) with normal systolic function with an ejection fraction (EF) of 55-60%. The global longitudinal strain was normal at 20.6%. Furthermore, the TTE did not show any evidence of pericardial effusion and no significant valvular disease was detected.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

However, upon discontinuation of mesalazine, the symptoms subsided. The troponin-I levels demonstrated a characteristic decline, reaching 2.53 ng/mL, as measured 3 days after admission.\n\n【8】Diagnosis\n\n【9】Following the TTE, the patient underwent a coronary angiogram, which revealed unobstructed coronaries . Based on the above findings, the working diagnosis was acute myocarditis. Considering the patient’s clinical history, presentation and the absence of significant coronary artery disease, the differential diagnoses for the myocarditis included viral myocarditis, extraintestinal manifestation of UC, autoimmune processes, or drug-induced myocarditis. These possibilities highlight the importance of considering various etiologies in myocarditis cases and conducting a thorough evaluation.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

These findings are consistent with the inflammatory process associated with myocarditis. Additionally, subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was observed in the same areas . This finding indicates areas of scar tissue or fibrosis within the myocardium, which can occur because of inflammation and damage during myocarditis. Also, there were areas of patchy LGE distribution throughout the left ventricle. This pattern of enhancement is characteristic of myocarditis, as the inflammatory process often affects different areas of the myocardium in a non-uniform or patchy manner . Importantly, despite the presence of these inflammatory and scar tissue findings, the CMR confirmed that the left ventricle was normal in size and demonstrated preserved ejection fraction.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

As part of the discharge plan, a crucial recommendation was provided to the patient to abstain from lifelong usage of mesalazine. Subsequently, a follow-up CMR was conducted 4 months later, revealing a marked improvement and significant resolution of the previously observed findings . This approach ensured appropriate patient care, monitoring, and management, resulting in the successful resolution of myocarditis-related symptoms and favorable cardiac recovery.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 4.

It exhibits a diverse range of clinical presentations and outcomes, reflecting the polymorphic nature of the disease. Myocarditis primarily affects a young and healthy individual, with a higher prevalence among males 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. It encompasses a broad spectrum of etiological factors, resulting from exposure to either discrete external antigens such as viruses, which are considered the most common cause, such as coxsackie, and also other microorganisms such as bacteria and parasites. However other external triggers, like toxins or drugs can cause myocardial inflammation. Furthermore, the disease can be activated by internal triggers, such as auto-immune conditions, as in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This wide array of potential causes underscores the complex nature of myocarditis and its multifactorial origin. Clinical presentations include a wide range of symptoms, varying from mild fatigue, palpitations, and chest pain to more severe manifestations with the development of arrhythmias and syncopal episodes. In rare cases, more lethal complications may arise with the presence of fulminant myocarditis, which can be manifested as acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and even sudden cardiac death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Approximately 20% of individuals diagnosed with myocarditis may later develop a chronic inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In the majority of cases, myocardial inflammation gradually subsides and leads to complete resolution of the disease. However, in the specific case of DCM, persistent inflammation can initiate remodeling mechanisms that contribute to the degeneration of myocardial cells and the replacement of damaged myocardium with fibrotic tissue. As disease progresses, this fibrotic transformation can lead to myocardial dilatation, global remodeling of the left ventricle, and chronically reduced ejection fraction. These pathological changes ultimately characterize the clinical presentation of DCM. This phenomenon has been observed in animal models of myocarditis induced by viral infections and autoimmune conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The diagnosis of myocarditis traditionally required a histologic diagnosis; however, endomyocardial biopsy remains largely underutilized in the clinical practice, as it possesses limitations with a diagnostic yield as low as 35% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. These limitations arise from the patchy distribution of inflammation observed in some cases, as well as the challenge of accessing the epicardial and mid-wall layers where inflammation often predominates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Consequently, clinical suspicion together with laboratory and imaging criteria, such as CMR, has been used to secure the diagnosis of myocarditis.\n\n【22】Emerging evidence suggests a potential association between IBD and an increased risk of developing myocarditis compared to the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 11 \\]</u>. Although it is not entirely clear, it is thought to be related to the underlying inflammation that is characteristic of the disease, as inflammation can affect various parts of the body, including the heart, and may contribute to the development of the disease. Another, rare but plausible explanation is toxicity from mesalazine. The distinction between these causes can be difficult and demanding; however, it is crucial, as the early cessation of mesalazine can prevent any long-term dysfunction. The precise mechanisms, through which mesalazine may contribute to heart damage, are not fully understood. It is suggested that cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction is the cause rather than a direct cardiotoxic effect. This is supported by the definitive resolution of disease following the discontinuation of the drug and by eosinophilic infiltration on endomyocardial biopsy specimens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. An additional supporting evidence of hypersensitivity reaction to mesalamine is the occurrence of rare cases presenting with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, angioedema, skin rashes, and hypereosinophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Mesalazine has been shown to inhibit the activity of COX1 and enhance the metabolism of arachidonic acid into lipoxygenase products such as leukotrienes. The excessive production of lipoxygenase products can contribute to a pro-inflammatory signaling cascade, thereby promoting the development of allergic myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. This process involves the release of cytokines that stimulate eosinophils, leading to inflammation. Another potential mechanism is through humoral-mediated hypersensitivity response. In this scenario, antibodies produced against mesalazine can cross-react with heart tissues, leading to inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Furthermore, mesalazine has been found to induce the formation of reactive oxygen species, which disrupt mitochondrial membrane. This causes mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent release of cytochrome c, eventually leading to cardiomyocyte apoptosis and eventually to cardiovascular dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Sometimes it is challenging to confirm the diagnosis of myocarditis caused by mesalazine because there are no physical findings, symptoms, or laboratory tests that are pathognomonic for mesalazine-induced cardiotoxicity. The diagnosis is based on clinical features, with symptom onset typically occurring within 2 - 4 weeks of initiation of treatment and by the early resolution of symptoms with the discontinuation of the medication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Simultaneously with the cessation of the medication, the clinicians should rule out other causes of myocarditis like cardiotoxicity of IBD, viral myocarditis and vasculitis.\n\n【24】Moreover, it is important to highlight that a recent retrospective study by Chen et al investigated the potential association between the dosage of mesalazine and the occurrence of myocardial injury. The study findings revealed no apparent link between the dosage of mesalazine and the occurrence of myocardial injury. Additionally, increasing the dose of mesalazine did not lead to a shorter onset time for cardiotoxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. These observations suggest that there is no apparent dose-dependent relationship between mesalazine and the development of myocardial injury or the timing of cardiotoxic manifestations.\n\n【25】Echocardiography is a valuable tool in the evaluation of acute myocarditis due to its ability to aid in distinguishing it from other conditions causing myocardial disease. However, there are no specific findings for acute myocarditis on TTE. The most common pattern is a dilated, spherical ventricle with reduced systolic function. Of note, a pericardial effusion usually signifies myopericarditis. In recent years, CMR has gained significant popularity for its effectiveness in detecting myocarditis. The visual manifestations of myocardial inflammation include the presence of edema, hyperemia, capillary leakage, necrosis, and fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The intensity and severity of these alterations are based on the level of underlying myocardial inflammation and the timing of the CMR in relation to the natural course of the disease, as it progresses from an acute or subacute phase to a healed or chronic state. This temporal progression of myocardial inflammation, which often lasts days to weeks before eventual resolution, narrows the optimal window for diagnostic imaging sensitivity to only a few weeks from the initial onset of symptoms. So, performing CMR in the early stages of myocarditis is considered essential 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. The assessment of CMR findings in myocardial inflammation is frequently done using the revised Lake Louise Criteria (LLC). According to the revised criteria, CMR provides strong evidence of acute myocardial inflammation for the definite diagnosis of myocarditis, in patients with a high clinical pretest probability. It demands at least one T1-based marker of nonischemic myocardial injury (abnormal T1 mapping, increased extracellular volume, or LGE) and at least one T2-based marker of myocardial edema (abnormal T2 mapping or regional abnormalities on T2-weighted imaging) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Myocardial edema arises as a consequence of acute inflammation during the initial phases of myocarditis and is commonly observed in the septum or lateral wall in a non-vascular distribution, although any myocardial wall can be affected. In contrast to edema seen in acute infarction, which primarily involves the subendocardial layer, edema associated with myocarditis tends to spare this region and predominantly affects the subepicardial and mid-myocardial layers of the cardiac tissue. Additionally, the detection of LGE indicates the presence of tissue inflammation, necrosis and early fibrosis. The presence of fibrosis is widely acknowledged as a significant contributor to the development of ventricular arrhythmias, as it promotes the formation of re-entrant circuits and also has been associated with an increased risk of LV remodeling, heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Worsened outcomes have been associated with a larger extent of LGE in myocardial imaging, defined as either LGE involvement in more than two LV segments, LGE exceeding 10% of LV mass, or LGE exceeding 17 g 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. In addition, the presence of LGE in the anteroseptal region has also been linked to unfavorable clinical outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. These findings highlight the significance of LGE as an important marker in myocardial imaging for risk stratification and prognostic evaluation in patients with myocarditis.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】Mesalazine is established as the primary treatment for patients with mild to moderate UC and remains the cornerstone of maintenance therapy. In the context of IBD, cardiac involvement can manifest as an extraintestinal manifestation or may be associated with mesalazine treatment itself. Mesalazine-induced myocarditis typically presents within a few days to weeks following initiation of the medication.\n\n【28】When a patient presents with cardiac symptoms and mesalazine-induced myocarditis is suspected, CMR is recommended as a diagnostic modality. CMR aids in establishing the diagnosis by visualizing inflammation in both the myocardium and pericardium.\n\n【29】Timely recognition and diagnosis of mesalazine-induced myocarditis are of utmost importance due to its potential life-threatening nature. Upon confirmation of the diagnosis, prompt discontinuation of mesalazine is advised. Following cessation of the medication, symptoms generally resolve, and cardiac function can improve.\n\n【30】Learning points\n\n【31】Myocarditis is a rare, underdiagnosed complication of mesalazine, which occurs early after initiation. Clinicians should be wise to this rare yet life-threating cause of myocarditis and establish the diagnosis on time, as the early cessation of mesalazine would lead to resolution of the symptoms and can improve cardiac function.\n\n【32】CMR is considered the gold standard non-invasive diagnostic modality for confirming the diagnosis of mesalazine-induced myocarditis. Its utilization not only aids in establishing an accurate diagnosis but also plays a pivotal role in guiding clinical decision-making and subsequent follow-up.\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AM participated in patient care, writing of the case report, revisions, and submission process.

The patient was hemodynamically stable, and complained of severe abdominal pain. Secondary survey revealed abdominal tenderness and superficial lacerations. A computer tomography (CT) scan of the patient’s head, neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no acute injuries, except for a right hemothorax, and a central supramesocolic retroperitoneal hematoma . Sagittal reconstructions showed subtle findings of a hematoma at the origin of the celiac artery interrupted as a disruption of the celiac axis. A chest tube was placed on the right. After consultation with Interventional Radiology and Vascular Surgery, it was determined that exploration was the patient’s best option. At laparotomy, using a left medical visceral rotation approach, the celiac artery was found to be completely avulsed. The proximal and distal ends were ligated.

We also review the previously published case report series.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Case 1\n\n【6】A 47-year-old man presented with right lower abdominal and back pain for three days associated with vomiting. The pain was throbbing in nature, had no radiation, and had an intensity of 10/10. He had smoked at least 5 cigarettes daily for the past 25 years, used heroin in the past, and currently received methadone 120 mg daily. Physical examination was unremarkable except for severe right flank pain. His vital signs showed a blood pressure was 150/80 mmHg, pulse 60 beats per minute and regular, respirations 16 per minute, and temperature 36.5 °C.\n\n【7】Laboratory tests revealed hemoglobin of 14 g/dl, leukocyte count 7600 per mm <sup>3 </sup> , neutrophils 80.5%, platelets 241000 per mm <sup>3 </sup> , serum creatinine 1.3 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase 76 units/liter (normal 10 - 42), alanine aminotransferase was 65 units/liter (normal 10 - 40), lactate dehydrogenase (LD) 657 units/liter (normal 91 - 180). Urinalysis was strongly positive for blood, and urine protein was 300 mg/dl. Three sets of cardiac enzymes gave normal results. Total cholesterol was 196 mg/dl (normal 140 - 200), low density lipoprotein (LDL) 143 mg/dl (normal < 130), triglyceride 68 mg/dl (normal 35 - 160) and homocysteine 6.9 micromoles per liter (normal < 11.4).\n\n【8】The electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at 52 beats per minute and inverted T waves in the inferior wall and chest leads. Echocardiogram revealed normal ejection fraction and no evidence of thrombus or vegetations. Impaired relaxation pattern of the left ventricular diastolic filling was observed.\n\n【9】Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed right renal infarct with occlusion of the posterior branch of the right renal artery . Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the abdominal aorta and renal arteries confirmed right renal infarction involving the upper and posterior cortex.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed right renal infarction. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【11】He was anticoagulated with heparin and warfarin. His symptom improved significantly, and was discharged.\n\n【12】Case 2\n\n【13】An 89-year-old woman presented with right lower quadrant pain that started suddenly in the early morning hours, sharp in quality, 5/10 in severity, non radiating, and associated with nausea but no vomiting.\n\n【14】Her past medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and osteoarthritis. Medications on presentation were amlodipine, metolazone, enalapril, and aspirin. She had been taking warfarin in the past but had discontinued after an episode of toxicity. She never smoked or abused alcohol or illicit drugs. Her blood pressure was 160/60 mmHg, pulse 67 beats per minute, irregular, respirations 16 per minute, and temperature 36.2 °C. She had right lower quadrant tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds were present.\n\n【15】Laboratory tests yielded a serum creatinine of 0.7 mg/dl, hemoglobin13.1 g/dl, leukocyte count 6400 per mm <sup>3 </sup> , platelets 213000 per liter, lactate dehydrogenase 1957 units per liter. Urinalysis was strongly positive for blood, and urine protein was 100 mg/dl.\n\n【16】Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Abdominal sonogram did not reveal abnormalities.\n\n【17】CECT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed poor enhancement in the lower two thirds of the right kidney and a focal filling defect in the distal right renal artery, suggestive of thromboembolism causing the infarct of the right lower two thirds of the kidney. Echocardiogram showed no evidence of thrombus or vegetations and the ejection fraction was 55%. She was treated with heparin drip and later discharged on warfarin.\n\n【18】Case 3\n\n【19】A 41-year-old male was admitted to the hospital after suffering a gunshot wound, and had penetrating and blunt injuries. Past medical history and social history were unobtainable. On presentation blood pressure was 59/45 mmHg, pulse 98 beats per minute, respirations 40 per minute, and temperature 34.2 °C. He underwent splenectomy with repair of mesenteric injuries as well serosal tears of his colon.\n\n【20】Initial laboratory data showed a serum creatinine of 1 mg/dl, hemoglobin12.4 g/dl, leukocyte count 7500 per mm <sup>3 </sup> , platelets 153000/L. No urinalysis was available. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed hypoperfusion of the left kidney with multiple areas of wedge-shaped hypodensities representing possible infarcts. The left renal artery only demonstrated contrast enhancement on some of its branches suggesting renal artery injury.\n\n【21】Anticoagulation was initiated with heparin drip. Later he developed acute kidney injury and underwent multiple sessions of hemodialysis until renal function recovered. A follow-up CECT was done and revealed normal kidneys, at which time the heparin infusion was discontinued.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】The clinical presentation of ARI is nonspecific and may be confused with that of a renal colic. Patients commonly present to the ED with flank or abdominal pain associated with fever, nausea or vomiting, or may only present with acute onset of hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The prevalence of spontaneous kidney infarction in patients with new onset hypertension is 3% and the incidence is 0.18% per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The classic triad consists of persisting abdominal or flank pain; elevated serum LD and/or microscopic hematuria; and high risk of thromboembolism.\n\n【24】Laboratory studies reveal hematuria and proteinuria in most instances, and the blood levels of LD and the aminotransferases are frequently raised. Absence of hematuria indicates more serious loss of renal function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Measurement of urinary LD may also be helpful.\n\n【25】The diagnosis is confirmed with CECT, angiography, or isotope scan. The sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) is 80%, renal isotope 97% and angiography is 100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. CT characteristically shows a perfusion defect with a mass effect representing the zone of infarct, sometimes surrounded by a cortical rim sign indicative of the zone of ischemia (functioning nephrons supplied blood via capsular collaterals). The isotope scan demonstrates absent or reduced blood flows to the affected area. Angiography can clearly delineate the lesion. Hilton S et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> correlated the CT findings with angiography and sonographic findings and concluded that the diagnosis can usually be made on the basis of specific CT findings. Angiography is valuable in helping to establish the cause and direct treatment. Sonography is less important in diagnosis but can be helpful in corroborating the CT findings. In case of high probability of renal infarction, Haung CC et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> suggested to obtain a CECT of the abdomen if no calculi are detected after unenhanced CT. They were able to make the correct diagnosis in 50% of cases during their first visit to the ED.\n\n【26】The pathogenesis of renal infarction is frequently due to thromboembolic events in the setting of dilated cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation. Frost L et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> followed 30,000 patients with atrial fibrillation over a 13-year period and noted 2% incidence of renal artery embolism. Hazanov N et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> reported 44 cases of ARI in patients with atrial fibrillation over 18-year period. Patients were mostly older than 60 years and had previous embolic events. Renal isotope scan was the most sensitive diagnostic test in this group of patients. Case 2 is an example of this complication although we could not detect any intracardiac thrombi on echocardiographic examination. Vegetations in infective endocarditis and cardiac tumors are other potential sources of emboli that could lead to a renal infarct, while case 1 illustrates an occlusion of the renal arteries due to thrombosis, which usually occurs with pre-existing renovascular disease.\n\n【27】Trauma or aortic interventions may also lead to ARI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> as shown in case 3. Other risk factors include: clotting disorders, vessel anomalies such as fibromuscular dysplasia, kidney transplantation, antiphospholipid syndrome, Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus or vasculitis, malignancies, and sickle cell disease. Cases of renal artery occlusion resulting from the use of cocaine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> and infection with mucormycosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> have been described. It can be idiopathic. Bolderman R et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u> identified sixteen patients (59%) over 2.5 years who developed ARI without any structural or arrhythmic cardiac disease. Cigarette smoking increases the risk for arterial thrombosis. Nicotine causes vasoconstriction, decreases protein C activity and increases platelet aggregation and fibrinogen concentration. All of these effects may have contributed to the thrombosis of the abnormal renal artery in case 1.\n\n【28】We reviewed ten published case series and tabulated the data in Table 1 . There were a total of 213 patients. Patients most commonly presented with abdominal pain, followed by flank pain, nausea/vomiting, and fever. In all case series, laboratory findings were similar: hematuria, elevated LD, proteinuria and leucocytosis. The most common risk factor was atrial fibrillation, followed by history of thromboembolism, coagulation dysfunction and heart disease.\n\n【29】The treatment modalities include anticoagulation with heparin followed by warfarin, except when contraindications (such as aortic dissection) are present.\n\n【30】Thrombolysis and thrombectomy had been accomplished in patients with unilateral and bilateral occlusion but the results show only occasional improvement in renal function. In one case series, of seven patients who received thrombolysis, one developed end-stage renal disease, one had mild renal failure and two died 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In another case series, out of five patients, one patient’s renal function did not recover or worsen during more than 1 year of follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In a case series reported by Korzets Z et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>, one patient had a combination of intravenous heparin and renal intra-arterial urokinase infusion, but no improvement was observed. The patient had a serum creatinine of 3.5 with a contralateral contracted kidney, required maintenance dialysis. Angioplasty and stent placement had been tried in some cases. The success of the intervention is limited by the duration of the ischemia.\n\n【31】The prognosis of ARI is determined by the etiology and the size of the infarct. In most series of unilateral disease there was not a significant loss of kidney function most likely due to compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining kidney tissue, but in most instances of bilateral infarct complete loss of renal function follows. Some patients develop persistent hypertension following ARI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n\n【33】A high degree of suspicion remains the key for early diagnosis of ARI. Patients presenting with flank pain, hematuria and proteinuria as well as elevated level of LD should undergo CECT scan to obtain confirmation. Early anticoagulation may reduce symptoms and help preserve kidney function by preventing recurrence.\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Support</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:08:32", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:09:13", "cost": 41.556}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:09:00", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:09:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:08:22"}

The patient had undergone a recent etoposide-based salvage chemotherapy for a progressive undifferentiated neuroendocrine rhino-pharyngeal cancer, with local invasion (left para-pharyngeal space, peri and sub-mastoideal space, maxillary sinuses, clivus) and laterocervical and mediastinal lymph node involvement as well as pulmonary and hepatic metastasis. His cancer was first diagnosed in 2002 and relapsed in March 2010.\n\n【5】Chest radiography was negative and, due to the suspicion of a central nervous system infection, a lumbar puncture was performed. The analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed normal values for white blood cells, glycorrachia and proteinorrachia and the direct Gram stain and culture were negative. The patient was hospitalized in the infectious diseases unit where a nutritional and supportive therapy was started via central venous catheter (inserted 30 days before), together with oxygen therapy via a reservoir mask and an empiric broad spectrum antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem (1 g tris in die) and vancomycin (1 g loading dose followed by 2 g as a 24 h continuous infusion). A purulent-like liquid flowed from his mouth and was collected and sent, together with urine and blood cultures, to the microbiology laboratory. Blood cultures were performed using the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux®, Marcy l’Etoile, France).\n\n【6】Despite initial improvement of blood pressure and diuresis, after 24 hours an acute respiratory failure occurred and respiratory assistance in C-PAP ventilation was initiated, with no substantial results. Meanwhile the microbiology laboratory informed us that 3 blood cultures were positive for gram positive cocci in the anaerobic bottles. The urine culture was negative while the oral pus culture was positive for alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Oxacillixin sensitive S. aureus and Candida albicans : no change was made to the antibiotic therapy. The patient died 48 hours after admission due to an acute respiratory distress syndrome. No autopsy examination was performed.\n\n【7】The strain grown from the positive anaerobic bottle was identified as Gemella spp. using the ATB ID32A identification system (bioMerieux®, Marcy l’Etoile, France). Unfortunately the Vitek GP card was not tested due to the patient's exitus.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】This is a case of septic shock due to Gemella spp . due to a probable retropharyngeal cancer-abscess. An organism reported as an alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus was isolated from a pharyngeal swab and was, at first, considered to represent normal upper respiratory tract bacteria, which, in our centre, are not routinely identified further not excluding that the strain was not the same Gemella isolated in blood cultures. Nevertheless, the systemic infection did occur in conjunction with an oral infection as shown by the purulent fluid observed in the mouth and the previously reported severe oral mucositis. Unfortunately a CT-scan of the head and neck could not be performed due to the patient’s poor condition and the hypotesis of a cancer-abscess of the rhino-pharyngeal region could not be proved. As 2 of the 3 positive blood cultures were obtained from the central venous catheter puncture a concomitant infection of the central venous line could also be hypothesized. There was no biochemical and cultural evidence of bacterial invasion of the subarachnoid space, therefore the neurological manifestations could be consistent with toxic encephalopathy, indeed.\n\n【10】通用删除2(英):<u>Elting, et al. studied some predisposing factors of septicemia and shock syndrome due to viridans streptococci in an American cancer center and showed that 13% among all blood streptococcal isolates were Gemella morbillorum .

With regard to the embryology of the thymus, the presence of a congenital thymic cyst outside the mediastinum is very rare, and thymic cysts located solely in the pleural space have been described in only one case report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In our case congenital thymic cyst did not show any connection with the thymus and thoracoscopy was used for complete resection in childhood.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 2-year-old boy underwent emergency admission with severe respiratory symptoms, coughing and dyspnea. For 2 days before admission, he had been feverish and had displayed a poor appetite. His medical history was unremarkable and no previous cardiac or pulmonary events were reported. The chest X-ray showed a paracardial mass and a small amount of free fluid in the left thoracic cavity. The laboratory tests were negative (normal WBC count and CRP). Ultrasonography demonstrated fluid in the lower part of the left thoracic cavity. After hospitalization antibiotic therapy was started. On the third day after admission, there was no fever, but the chest X-ray revealed an unchanged radiological status. A thoracic CT scan confirmed a paracardial cystic lesion without free fluid and compression atelectatics of the left lower lobe, assumed to be a pericardial cyst . The CT did not indicate any connection with the anterior mediastinum. The antibiotic therapy was terminated and left-sided thoracoscopy was performed under selective intubation. A huge multilocular cystic lesion and a little free fluid in the left thoracic cavity were found during the operation. The surface of the cyst was covered by pericardial fat tissue. The mass was attached to the pericardium, and there was no connection with the anterior-upper mediastinum, thymus or lung. After multiple fenestrations, we removed 350 mL of serous fluid and most of the cystic wall which had a wide connection with the pericardium and involved pericardial fat tissue and phrenic nerve . We could not find a layer that could easily be prepared and large-scale resection of the pericardium would have necessitated replacement. Accordingly the internal layer of the cyst was fully resected macroscopically after dissection of the nerve, only a small part of the external layer being left on the pericardium. A 14 Ch thoracic drain was inserted for 24 hours. The patient was discharged on day postoperative 3 in a good condition. The histologic diagnosis was a benign multilocular thymic cyst within the Hassal bodies in the cystic wall. The wall of the cyst exhibited varying thickness and contained scattered nests of thymic tissue including small lymphocytes and epithelial cells. There were no complications and no sign of recurrence during the 18-month follow-up.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Cystic wall was involved by phrenic nerve. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Cystic lesions of the mediastinum and thoracic cavity, which are mostly benign masses, comprise a small but important diagnostic group, constituting 12 to 18% of all primary mediastinal lesions. The classification of cysts, based on their etiology, distinguishes bronchogenic, esophageal duplication cysts, pericardial cysts, thymic cysts, and other miscellaneous cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]</u>. The histogenesis of ectopic thymic tissue is still unclear, the most common theory is an embryological displacement. The neck, thyroid gland, lung, middle or posterior mediastinum, pericardium and pleura have been reported as ectopic sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】Most thymic cysts can be explained as sequestered remnants of the thymopharyngeal duct system. The thymus is derived from the ventral part of the third pharyngeal pair of pharyngeal pouches. During the embryological descent from the lateral neck to the manubrium sterni, remnants of the pharyngeal system may persist and lead to the formation of congenital thymic cysts. This theory is supported by the relatively frequent observation of endocrine (mostly parathyroid) gland inclusions within the cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Despite this, a congenital thymic cyst outside the mediastinum is extremely rare, and multilocular thymic cysts located exclusively in the pleural space have not been described. Congenital thymic cysts are usually unilocular with thin walls, and are derivatives of embryologic thymic tissue. The acquired type is often multilocular as a result of an inflammatory or neoplastic process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. The multilocular thymic cyst is less common than the congenital unilocular type and is believed to arise from thymic parenchymal inflammation causing cystic dilation. Multilocular cysts have been reported in association with a variety of neoplastic, autoimmune and infectious conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Graeber et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> divided cystic lesions of the thymus into three major categories: congenital, neoplastic and degenerative, the latter involving two mechanisms of pathogenesis: cystic degeneration of thymomas and cystic masses. The local disruption of thymic tissue can induce the formation or growth of cysts. The reported prevalence of cysts in all mediastinal tumors of the adult population is somewhat higher than that in the pediatric population (14.1% vs 7.7%, P < 0.05) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】The diagnostic evaluation begins with the chest X-ray which identifies 89.5% of all mediastinal cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Small subcarinal or hilar bronchogenic cysts and small thymic cysts have been revealed by chest CT. Barium swallow studies and/or esophagoscopy are performed mainly in case of suspected esophageal and bronchogenic cysts. Most of these cysts are asymptomatic, but about 6% may cause dysphagia, dyspnea, neck pain, stridor or rhonchus. They may cause complaints because of a compression closed structure, haemorrhage is a rare complication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 10 \\]</u>. Operative indications include a cyst measuring more than 5 cm, one that causes complaints, a multilocular cyst, diagnostic problems and the wide wall of a cyst. Most cystic lesions in the mediastinum and thoracic cavity can cause differential diagnostic problems, as in our case.\n\n【10】Surgical excision can be performed via an open procedure or a thoracoscopic approach; video-assisted thoracoscopy has recently become more popular in consequence of its excellent transpleural approach to the mediastinum, providing safe removal of the mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In our case, the intraoperative diagnosis was a benign disease, including such possibilities as a mediastinal cyst, a pericardial cyst or a pleural cyst, but excluding a thymic cyst, although the definitive diagnosis was possible only on histological analysis. In all cases involving a cystic lesion in the mediastinum or thoracic cavity, an effort must be made to resect it completely or, as in our case, when it is closely connected with other organs, remove the internal layer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. We have not found in the literature any definitive protocol for the operative treatment of this huge, benign multilocular cystic lesion in thoracic cavity, but limited resection of the external part with total removal of the internal layer appears to be a good method for resection. It can be performed thoracoscopy and the late result is very good.\n\n【11】In conclusion, the intrathoracal congenital thymic cyst is a distinct clinical entity, which should be considered when the radiological findings demonstrate a rounded and well-defined paracardial mass. Thoracoscopic removal of a thymic cyst is an effective and feasible alternative in surgical treatment.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank to Dr.David Durham for critical reading of the manuscript and for linguistic corrections.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Declaration</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None of the authors have anything to disclose.

The patient denied history of jaundice, pruritis, weight loss, hematemesis or rectal bleeding. Past medical history did not reveal additional relevant information.\n\n【6】On physical examination she had tender hepatomegaly, extending 2 cm below the right costal margin. Her weight was on the 25th-50th centile and 10th-25th for height. Pubertal development was normal. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.\n\n【7】Abdominal ultrasound showed liver enlargement (23.7 cm span) with heterogeneous texture and without evidence of splenomegaly or ascites.\n\n【8】She had elevated aspartate aminotransferase 226 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 109 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 117 U/L and abnormal lipid profile, total cholesterol 2.52 g/L and low density lipoprotein 1.74 g/L.\n\n【9】Complete blood cell count, bilirubin, liver function panel, serum ferritin level and thyroid function were normal. Serology for HIV, hepatitis A, B and C, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus were negative.\n\n【10】Other causes of immune and metabolic hepatic diseases where excluded: serum ceruloplasmin, copper, alpha 1-antitrypsin and immunoglobulin A levels were normal; anti-transglutaminase IgA, antinuclear smooth muscle antibody and anti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies were negative.\n\n【11】During the following 2 years, she maintained poorly controlled diabetes, as she refused adhering to the therapy, despite multidisciplinary interventions. At this point, the consistently elevated liver enzymes with severe flares (5 to 6 times above normal) led to liver biopsy that revealed normal trabecular architecture, without evidence of fibrosis, necrosis or inflammation. The hepatocytes were swollen, with abundant clear cytoplasm due to accumulation of glycogen, the cell membranes were thickened and the sinusoids were collapsed, conferring a vegetal-like appearance to liver parenchyma . A diagnosis of hepatic glycogenosis secondary to poorly controlled diabetic disease was suggested. After biopsy, clinical improvement was only seen when glycemic control was achieved, later on.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Typically, it is associated with uncontrolled T1DM, although it has been recently reported in type 2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>. GH presents with abdominal pain, nauseas, vomiting, hepatomegaly and elevated liver enzymes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\- 6 \\]</u>. Glycogen loading of the liver was first described as a component of Mauriac syndrome: growth retardation, hepatomegaly, cushingoid features and delayed puberty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 5 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>. However, it is now known that GH can develop without the full spectrum of the features of Mauriac syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】In the clinical setting of diabetes, it is important to distinguish GH from NAFLD, in patients with abnormal liver tests. Persistent mild alterations in liver enzymes are more in favor of NAFLD, whereas aminotransferase flares are more suggestive of GH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Contrary to NAFLD, GH is not known to progress to fibrosis and the hepatic changes are reversible with adequate glycemic control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 6 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The wide fluctuation in glucose and insulin levels is an essential element in the pathophysiology of GH. High levels of glucose cause an insulin independent inflow of glucose into the hepatocytes where it is rapidly phosphorilated and trap in the cell. Subsequent treatment of high glucose levels with insulin causes the trapped glucose to polymerize to glycogen. Glycogen production persists for some time after insulin levels are declined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In NAFLD lipid accumulation results of chronic hyperinsulinemia and hepatocellular insulin resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】On liver biopsy, GH displays a characteristic vegetal-like appearance of the hepatocytes, with no evidence of fibrosis, necrosis or inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 5 , 7 \\]</u>. The need for liver biopsy, in this context, is a debated issue. Some authors favor the need of liver biopsy to make the distinction between GH and NAFLD, to obtain information for the prediction of prognosis, as pathobiology and therapy are different 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 6 , 8 \\]</u>. On the other hand, some recent publications suggest that, although NAFLD cannot be excluded by history, physical examination or ultrasound, invasive evaluations should be postponed until the response of metabolic control is accomplish 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. In our case, liver biopsy was performed in order to differentiate the pathological findings, as glycemic control was very difficult to achieve, while the patient persistently maintained symptomatic hepatomegaly and abnormal liver biochemistry.\n\n【19】It is important that pediatricians be aware of GH and the association with poorly controlled T1DM, as insulin-reversible hepatic glycogen accumulation is the most common cause of hepatomegaly and abnormal liver biochemistry, in children and young adults with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there was no financial support, including governmental assistance and pharmaceutical company support, involved in this research.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:57:59", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:58:20", "cost": 20.665}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:09:00", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:58:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:57:58"}

MS resembles solid cancers in histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and RNA sequencing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Its morphology can be described as a single-filing architectural pattern, identical to that of invasive lobular breast carcinoma and with dense desmoplastic keloid-like fibrosis, similar to colon, gallbladder, and pancreatic carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Cytogenetic and molecular studies have identified similar mutation patterns as those found in AML 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Prognostic cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities have not been determined yet in EML; however, reported cases show that the presence of MS confers a worse prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In recent clinical practice, the treatment modalities for EML incorporate surgery and radiation therapy that can be utilized in localized disease as well as in the palliative setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The definitive treatment approach almost always requires the addition of systemic therapy usually in the form of AML induction chemotherapy, as well as consolidation with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in the first line setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. New targeted therapies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy comprise a potential therapeutic breakthrough for the future. In this paper, we present a case of extramedullary bone and epidural involvement of AML arising from an underlying MPN.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】We present a case of a 57-year-old female with history of cerebral aneurysm, transient ischemic attack and JAK-2-positive essential thrombocythemia (ET). The patient was initially diagnosed in 1987 and progressed to spent-phase myelofibrosis in 2011. The bone marrow pathology at the time of spent phase diagnosis revealed myelofibrosis with no increase in blast count and a decision was made to treat the patient with hydroxyurea. Six years later, she presented to the hospital with debilitating low back pain and pancytopenia.\n\n【6】Diagnosis\n\n【7】On presentation, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast of the lumbar spine showed multiple lesions throughout the lumbar spine and a mass centered at the S1 vertebrae extending into the epidural space as well as into the S1-S2 neural foramen . The surgical sacral mass biopsy was indicative of a small blue cell neoplasm favoring MS. The tissue stained positive for CD34, CD117 (not shown), CD99 (not shown), CD33, CD11c, and equivocal for CD 68-KPI . Negative stains included CD43 (weak), CD45, CD56, CD13, TdT, and myeloperoxidase (MPO). The bone marrow biopsy indicated presence of AML, arising within a chronic MPN . Approximately a third of the marrow space was involved by a dense proliferation of primitive cells. The remainder of the marrow demonstrated marked megakaryocytic expansion with abnormal forms associated with scattered erythroid and myeloid precursors. The reticulin stain revealed marked reticulin fibrosis in much of the marrow. The bone marrow aspirate was insufficient for evaluation. Cytogenetic studies revealed a normal karyotype. The fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) study was normal and the next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel identified a TP53 Arg273His mutation with 17% allele frequency.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Next, she received one fraction of radiation therapy to the S1 joint which resulted in the improvement of her lower back pain. She was subsequently induced with cytarabine and daunorubicin 7 + 3 protocol.\n\n【13】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【14】A repeat bone marrow biopsy at day 14 after induction chemotherapy revealed a hypocellular marrow with less than 5% cellularity. The stain for CD34 was largely negative. There were mostly areas of dense fibrosis with few lymphoid cells coinciding with myelofibrosis. There was no evidence of AML on flow cytometric evaluation. The bone marrow aspirate was insufficient for evaluation. A bone marrow biopsy on day 28 was positive for an MPN (post-ET myelofibrosis). There was no morphological or immunophenotypic evidence of AML. The marrow had a cellularity of 95-100% with 1% blasts present. The repeat NGS panel identified a persistent TP53 Arg273His mutation with unchanged allele frequency at 17%.\n\n【15】Two months after, a repeat MRI with contrast of the lumbar spine redemonstrated marrow signal abnormality identified throughout the lumbosacral spine concerning for interval progression of prior EML. The epidural mass described previously, at the level of S1, appeared less prominent . A positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) identified focal areas of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) activity within the posterior left iliac bone as well as in the sacral region . A bone biopsy of the left iliac bone showed bone remodeling fibrotic changes. A repeat biopsy of the prior soft tissue area near the right sacroiliac (SI) joint showed fatty tissue with necrosis. Based on the biopsy results, we concluded that the patient had regenerative bone changes as opposed to relapsed leukemia. A repeat bone marrow biopsy showed stromal changes including loose fibrosis and maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. The marrow had 30-45% cellullarity and 1% blasts. The flow cytometry was negative. The bone marrow biopsy was compatible with an underlying MPN, and showed no evidence of AML. The TP53 Arg273His mutation persisted in the bone marrow with 25% allele frequency, which had increased since the prior biopsy. The patient received four cycles of 5-azacytidine and venetoclax with goals to bridge to allo-SCT and suppress the TP53 mutation. She received full intensity fludarabine and busulfan and then proceeded with allo-SCT from a 10/10 matched unrelated donor. A repeat bone marrow biopsy 60 days after transplant did not show any evidence of iAML. The cytogenetics and FISH analysis were normal, but the TP53 mutation testing was not done at the time. Shortly after, the patient was admitted with altered mental status and was found to have leukemic meningitis. At this point, the patient decided to pursue hospice care. The time from her diagnosis of EML to her death was 9 months.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 4.

Imaging is one of the first diagnostic tools that can detect a suspicious mass early and it can also be used to evaluate treatment response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. PET/CT scans should be considered in diagnosing new-onset EML, as well as relapsed EML, because it can help detect small lesions that are difficult to visualize with other imaging modalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. PET/CT scans aid in facilitating diagnosis as well as identifying obscure foci of relapsed disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. A retrospective analysis showed that an F-FDG-PET/CT is more accurate than an F-FDG-PET or CT alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>; however, in both cases, bone marrow and tissue biopsies are essential for diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The differential of EML includes Ewing’s sarcoma, peripheral neuroendocrine tumors, neuroblastomas, lymphoblastic lymphomas, Wilms’ tumors, sarcomas, and Burkitt’s lymphoma. Often MS resembles small, round, blue-cell tumors that are embryonic in appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>. Morphologically, EML is characterized by infiltrative myeloblasts derived from adnexal destruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. In regards to IHC, CD68-KP1 is the most expressed marker followed by MPO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 20 , 21 \\]</u>. Other markers include CD34, CD43, CD45, CD68, CD56, CD117, CD11c, CD13, and CD33 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 19 , 20 \\]</u>. Cytogenetic aberrations correlate closely with those found in AML, MPN, or MDS. The most common cytogenetic abnormalities are t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv通用删除7(英):<u>(16)</u>通用删除11(英):<u>(p13;q22)</u> which are also associated with AML subclassifications with the most favorable prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 22 \\- 24 \\]</u>. Even though cytogenetics can characterize MS, their prognostic value is uncertain in EML. In our patient’s case, the NGS panel only revealed a TP53 mutation. In other reports, FLT3 and NPMI mutations have shown to be the most common mutations found in EML case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 22 \\- 24 \\]</u>. Gene encoding tyrosine kinases (FLT3, KIT, and KRAS), tumor suppressors genes (WTI and TP53), spliceosome proteins (SF3B1 and SRSF2), transcription factors (RUNX1), as well as epigenetic modifiers (TET2 and ASXL1) are commonly found in EML 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 24 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】The incidence of the TP53 mutation is only 12.7% in AML; however, it reaches an incidence up to 40-50% in solid malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\- 27 \\]</u>. In AML, the TP53 mutation is most commonly associated with the use of prior chemotherapy or with the presence of a complex karyotype. TP53 mutations have also been found in secondary AML associated with polycythemia vera (PV) and ET 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 , 28 \\]</u>. We identified five cases of MS associated with TP53 mutations published in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. One of these cases reported a mediastinal MS preceding AML with a PICALM-MLLT10 fusion gene mutation in addition to the TP53 mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. Two other cases reported de novo MS and two additional cases had underlying MDS before developing MS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 11 \\]</u>. Pre-clinical studies have shown that inactivation of TP53 leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and increased oncogenesis in hematopoietic stem cells as well as enhanced engraftment in various tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. In mice, TP53-deficient cells were shown to have an engraftment advantage over the TP53 wild-type stem cells which could potentially aid in the engraftment of myeloblasts to the extramedullary tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\- 34 \\]</u>. This could relate to our patient’s case, where a TP53 mutation may have helped the development of MS. TP53 is often seen as a later finding in hematological malignancies, as it is known to confer poor prognosis.\n\n【21】The pathogenesis of EML has yet to be fully elucidated. For a long time, CD56, the blast neural cell adhesion molecule, was a protein of high interest in the mechanism of homing of myeloid blasts to various extramedullary sites that expressed high CD56 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 20 , 35 \\]</u>. High CD56 expression is most commonly associated with t(8;21) and 11q23 aberrations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 , 36 \\]</u>; however, most patients with MS do not express CD 56 in their leukemic cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 37 , 38 \\]</u>. Another important cell adhesion protein is CD11b (surface β2-integrin member macrophage-1 antigen) which is derived from mononuclear cells and is found to be highly expressed in AML with monoblastic/myelomonocytic differentiation, where the risk of developing MS is higher 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 , 39 \\]</u>. Studies have shown the expression of CD11b in AML associated with MS to be higher than in AML alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 37 \\]</u>. The RAS-MAPK/ERK pathway is another potential pathway in the development of EML as metastasis-suppressor RAF kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) loss has been reported in 50% of patients with AML associated with MS, versus only 14% in patients with AML alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 40 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Several factors need to be taken into consideration while choosing therapy for the management of MS, such as the timing of initial diagnosis versus relapse, the presence of concurrent AML, and the presence of local symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Local therapies such as surgical decompression or radiation therapy have been used in isolated MS cases, as well as in cases of severe symptoms with palliative intent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In our patient with bone involvement, surgical decompression followed by radiation therapy played a major role in her treatment approach, as well as in the relief of her symptoms. The risk for impending cord compression remains a real risk for patients with epidural/bone involvement. Even though our patient did not have cord compression, her symptoms required surgical intervention. Systemic therapy, however, should almost always be considered in both local and metastatic disease. Clinical data have shown that 75-90% of patients with isolated MS who do not receive systemic therapy progress to AML within 4 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 41 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】AML induction chemotherapy has found usefulness in the treatment of EML since this is preceded or followed by iAML within a short period of time in most cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 42 \\]</u>. The current suggested approach is utilizing anthracycline-based induction regimens, and allogeneic transplantation in the initial setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 43 \\]</u>. The presence of EML itself confers a poor prognosis in patients with iAML 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. A series of case reports have demonstrated that addition of systemic therapy to surgery and radiation can achieve a 65% remission rate and an overall survival (OS) of 40 months in patients with EML 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 44 \\]</u>. Retrospective data suggest that allo-SCT should be offered in the first line setting, after induction chemotherapy in patients with isolated EML as well as in patients with concurrent iAML 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 43 , 45 \\]</u>. Patients who benefit the most from allogeneic transplant are those who achieve complete response (CR) prior to it and second transplants are sometimes indicated as salvage therapy in patients with relapsed disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 46 \\- 49 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】While induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline combination is the preferred initial treatment in fit AML patients, this is not the case in TP53-mutated patients due to the discouraging data in this group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. More recently, the combination of venetoclax and the hypomethylating agent (HMA) 5-azacytidine has gained great interest in the treatment of TP53-mutated patients. In a recent randomized prospective trial of older AML patients, the doublet was associated with a higher incidence of composite remission in the TP53-mutated group, but this was not translated into OS benefit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 50 \\]</u>. The mechanism of apoptosis mediated by venetoclax appears to be TP53-independent, while HMA agents have shown up to 47% response rates in TP53-mutated patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 51 , 52 \\]</u>. Currently, there are several clinical trials investigating novel therapies in this group of patients. The mutant p53 reactivator, eprenetapopt (APR-246), has shown some promise. Phase I/II data show the combination of APR-246 with 5-azacitidine in patients with TP53-mutant MDS and AML has achieved a CR of 44% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 53 \\]</u>. TP53 mutation predicted higher CR when this regimen was given as maintenance therapy after allo-SCT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 52 \\]</u>. An anti-CD47 IgG4 monoclonal antibody that stimulates cellular phagocytosis and T cell-mediated cytotoxic effect on leukemic cells called magrolimab is also being investigated in combination with azacytidine in the untreated AML as well as relapsed setting. In the TP53-mutant cohort, this combination has shown a CR of 45% with a median duration of response of 7.6 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 52 \\]</u>. Other targeted therapies that are being investigated are eprenetapopt in combination with venetoclax and azacytidine and bispecific dual affinity retargeting antibody (DART) against CD3 and CD123, flotetuzumab in the early relapse setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 52 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Non-randomized data that support venetoclax combination with HMA in AML patients also exist in the salvage setting. This is supported by a small retrospective analysis of AML patients that reported a CR of 58% with venetoclax and 5-azacytidine in the salvage/pre-transplant setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 54 \\]</u>. We thought that this combination of therapy would have benefited our patient as a bridge to allo-SCT, by hopefully inducing CR. In the relapse setting, other potential targeted therapies that have shown activity in relapse EML based on reported patient cases are anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody gemtuzumab ozogamicin in patients with concurrent positive CD33 AML 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 55 \\]</u> and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib for patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA and BCR-ABL mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 56 \\]</u>. The newest consideration for relapse EML is the PRGN-3006 ultra-CAR-expressing T-cell therapy, which is currently under investigation in a phase 1/1b trial. This is a multigenic, autologous CD33 CAR T-cell therapy trial that is currently open for enrollment for relapsed/refractory AML, including extramedullary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 57 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Learning points\n\n【27】MSs are infrequent and vexing for the clinician when it comes to making a diagnosis and approaching treatment outcomes.\n\n【28】We hypothesize that TP53 mutation may have been the initiating event for developing EML and its persistency may have been a major factor of contribution in this patient’s poor prognosis.\n\n【29】Localized treatment with surgery and radiation in conjuncture to AML-based systemic therapy and stem cell transplantation remain the current approach to treating EML, although the outcomes are poor overall.\n\n【30】TP53-mutated AML patients have poor outcomes with standard therapy, therefore targeted therapies and clinical trials should be considered. We can predict similar poor outcomes in EML with TP53 mutations.\n\n【31】Considerations for targeted molecular therapies in relapse MS are anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody gemtuzumab ozogamicin, as well as the tyrosine kinase imatinib.\n\n【32】CD33 CART therapy is currently under investigation for relapse disease, including EML, in the clinical trial setting.\n\n【33】Further large randomized controlled studies are necessary to establish these and other novel agents as the standard of care for the treatment of EML.\n\n【34】In general, extramedullary presentations are unique and not fully understood. Finding the best treatment approach poses a complicated challenge.\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We did not require any funding.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We do not have any conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Verbal consent from the patient’s family was obtained.</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr. Jorgena Kosti gathered the patient’s information and wrote the manuscript.

Leptospires are thin, spiral-shaped Gram-negative aerobic organisms . They have hooked ends and paired axial flagella allowing them to burrow into tissues. They can be isolated on artificial media, which makes them unique among spirochetes. Its life cycle starts with hematogenous spread of leptospires to the proximal renal tubules where they colonize and shed via urine into the environment. Rats, dogs, and ungulates, among others, that can become chronic, asymptomatic carriers. Humans, however, shed leptospires for a limited time and are accidental hosts. Leptospires are transmitted when mucous membranes, lungs via inhalation or abraded skin is exposed to body fluids of an acutely infected animal and by soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of a chronic carrier. Seventy percent of leptospirosis cases occur from occupational and recreational exposures. Urban workers and residents in economically deprived areas may contract the disease through exposure to rat urine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Most cases of leptospirosis start with nonspecific signs, like fever, headache, nausea, vomiting. The disease course of leptospirosis falls into two phases: acute phase of illness lasting 5 - 7 days, followed by a 1 - 3 day period of improvement in which the fever and symptoms subside. Leptospirosis can either regress to a relatively asymptomatic illness or progress to a more severe illness. Weil’s disease, also known as icteric leptospirosis, occurs in approximately 10% of cases, and has a fatality rate of 5-10%. Patients with this presentation can have fever, jaundice, renal failure, and hemorrhage. The pulmonary system, cardiac system, and central nervous systems are also frequently involved.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Silver stain of leptospires in fatal human leptospirosis. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【3】Culture times for Leptospira are long so treatment is begun empirically in patients with a plausible exposure history and compatible symptoms. Serologic identification of leptospires, microscopic agglutination testing (MAT), is available only at reference laboratories. Antibiotic therapy in the treatment of mild leptospirosis is not necessary because the disease is self-limited, and most cases resolve without medical attention. Oral antibiotics shorten the course of illness and urinary excretion of leptospires. Doxycycline is a good first-choice oral antibiotic. For more severe presentations, intravenous penicillin G and third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime and ceftriaxone) have shown effectiveness. Severe cases of leptospirosis also require supportive care for renal, hepatic, hematologic, and central nervous system complications. Early initiation of hemodialysis may be needed along with cardiac inotropic medications, eye drops and diuretics. Vasculitis of capillaries, exhibited by endothelial edema, necrosis, and lymphocytic infiltration appears to be the most common presentation. It appears that capillary vasculitis is found in all affected organ systems. The resulting loss of red blood cells and fluid through enlarged junctions and fenestrae, which cause secondary tissue injury, probably accounts for many of the clinical findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 54 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Although leptospirosis is a well documented clinical condition, the sequelae of peripheral polyneuritis has not yet been reported to our knowledge. The following case is an example of such an occurrence.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 49-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department with flu-like symptoms after recently volunteering in an urban Detroit neighborhood clean-up project. She admitted to picking up wood from stagnant water without wearing personal protective equipment. She was alert, oriented and able to follow commands on admission. Within hours, she rapidly developed hepatitis, rhabdomyolysis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and ultimately, acute respiratory distress syndrome. All initial infectious disease testing was negative. The patient’s history of cleaning up wood from stagnant garbage-filled water was clue to perform zoonotic analyses, with the primary differential diagnosis being Weil’s disease from Leptospirosis. Serologic testing was sent to the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, which tested positive. She was treated with ceftriaxone and doxycycline for 12 days. Her overall status improved, she was extubated and transferred out of the intensive care unit (ICU). A CT abdomen and pelvis demonstrated lymphadenopathy near the lumbar and sacrum regions of the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. She continued to follow up in the outpatient setting and complained of shock-like pain and neuralgia bilaterally in her lower extremities. The rhabdomyolysis resolved, but her pain remained despite completion of antibiotic treatment which is most likely caused from direct invasion of leptospires into the nerves or compromised blood flow to the nerves. She remains a clinic patient and her pain is controlled with oral medications.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】The clinical condition presented above likely was polyneuritis caused by leptospires due to the chronological association seropositivity of leptospirosis, CT evidence of lymphadenopathy near peripheral nerves and spinal cord, persistent neuralgia and polyneuritis symptoms post discharge in the outpatient setting, and lack of an alternative explanation. One could argue that her nerve-type pain was caused from spinal stenosis in the cervical vertebrae, which was seen on subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However, the patient stated that the pain and shock-like sensations in her lower extremities were new, and started happening immediately after she got leptospirosis. Additionally, cervical spinal stenosis is a chronic, insidious condition and would create neuralgia in both upper and lower extremities. The patient’s pain started from areas seen in the CT where lymphadenopathy was prominent, which were located mainly in the lumbar and sacral regions. Additionally, Leptospirosis is known to cause vasculitis which can cause poor blood flow to the nerves and subsequent damage. This was a plausible theory instead of direct invasion from the leptospires directly into the nerves. However, leptospires may remain in immunologically privileged sites despite being cleared from the blood for months. The only true way to determine the etiology of the patient’s neuralgia would be to biopsy the peripheral nerves, which was not done in this case to date. The patient also suffered from rhabdomyolysis from leptospire invasion which caused pain initially. However, the creatinine kinase level normalized while in the ICU. Plus, the “shock-like” pain the patient complained of after discharge in the clinic is more typical of neuralgia. Regardless of the nerve destruction mechanism, the pain and discomfort felt by the patient is ongoing and knowing the etiology would unlikely change the treatment regimen.\n\n【9】Several recent publications suggested that leptospirosis can lead to meningeal symptoms in 50% of patients. For instance, cranial nerve palsies, encephalitis, peripheral facial palsy and changes in consciousness are less common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Meningitis can last for weeks. Additionally uveitis, iridocyclitis and chorioretinitis can develop and may persist for years. Leptospirosis has also been noted by researchers to be an infective systemic vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. For example, focal necrosis, inflammatory infiltration, and hemorrhage have been documented within the adrenal gland. The main pathologic factor in skin is caused mostly by epithelial vascular insult. Skeletal muscle involvement is secondary to edema, myofibril vacuolization, and vessel damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 45 \\]</u>. Although the systemic immune response may eliminate leptospires from the body, a large inflammatory reaction can develop which can produce secondary end-organ injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Leptospirosis is most prevalent in Hawaii, which consistently reports the highest annual occurrence rate. However, 30% of children in urban Detroit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and 16% of adults in Baltimore 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> demonstrated serologic evidence of past infection. The Detroit study also showed correlation between rat infestation levels and seropositivity rates. This finding suggests rats are major vectors for human leptospirosis in the United States. Leptospires from infected animal urine survive best in damp alkaline soil, freshwater, vegetation, and mud with temperatures higher than 22 °C 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】The woman in this case presented with acute infection, septicemia, and multiorgan failure, followed by rapid immune clearance. She now is stricken with sequelae of polyneuritis and chronic pain. Leptospirosis symptoms are vague and resemble many common viral illnesses. She was started on empiric antibiotic therapy, but she was found to be seropositive for leptospirosis days after her admission and after many immunologic tests. Nonetheless, the turning point for this patient occurred after gaining knowledge from her history of exposure to rat urine during an urban Detroit clean-up project. A high index of suspicion of a zoonotic infection helped save her life. Furthermore, it is essential clinicians are aware that leptospirosis can occur in urban areas, perhaps near a large academic hospital, and be mindful that it often mimics common viral illnesses. There have been no reported cases yet about someone having peripheral neuralgia and polyneuritis from leptospirosis. A peripheral nerve biopsy would help distinguish if this woman had nerve pain from a direct spirochete invasion or vasculitis impeding blood flow to the nerve. But it would not necessarily change her symptomatic treatment, which at this time consists of oral pain medications. It is paramount to educate patients to avoid contact with environments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 55 \\]</u> potentially contaminated with animal urine, especially rodent-infested areas and wear protective clothing and shoes. For severe leptospirosis, intravenous penicillin G is considered the drug of choice. But doxycycline and ceftriaxone was used in this case, based on susceptibilities.

Standard safety procedures usually reflect these hazards 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Hydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic, inflammable, fat-soluble and colourless gas, readily recognized at low concentrations by its “rotten egg” odour.

The symptoms developed after an accidental exposure to a leak of sewer gas nearly eighteen hours before admission. A “rotten eggs” body odour was evident despite previous full body wash.\n\n【9】On physical examination, the patient presented with severe respiratory distress. Blood pressure and pulse rate were 109/74 mm Hg and 110 bpm, temperature 36.2 °C and respiratory rate 36 cpm. Bilateral expiratory fine crackles were present on both lung bases. Neurological exam was unremarkable.\n\n【10】Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a type I respiratory failure with PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FIO <sub>2 </sub> ratio of 271 .

Further treatment strategy included fluids, large-spectrum antibiotics, corticoids and appropriate oxygen supplementation. Weaning support measures were kept up for 12 days until discharge. Day 7 chest X-ray , lung CT scan and discharge echocardiogram showed no significant changes in comparison to admissionfindings. Clinical course was favourable and biomarkers of organ dysfunction gradually normalized.\n\n【18】The patient received close follow-up at the Internal Medicine Outpatient Clinic. At 3-month reassessment the patient remained asymptomatic: full recovery of pulmonary parenchyma lesions  and improvement of left ventricular heart function (ejection fraction of 60%) was documented. At 1-year post-exposure, no long-term sequelae have yet been detected.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Unknown toxic gases may be encountered within sewers. Currently, the usual gas detection equipment is unable to identify the wide range of potential hazards. Any unidentified and unusual odour represents a hazard until proven otherwise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although use of gas detection equipment remains important for the readily identified hazards, adequate protection for workers and medical teams in such scenarios must be provided by appropriate training and use of positive pressure breathing apparatus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The severity of H <sub>2 </sub> S intoxication depends on the concentration and duration of exposure with a wide variety of symptoms. At levels as low as 0.05 ppm it is described as a pungent, “rotten egg” gas. Under 100 ppm it may be sensed as a sweet odour. Outstandingly, its warning odour is lost at higher concentrations because of olfactory nerve paralysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\- 5 \\]</u>. H <sub>2 </sub> S is rapidly absorbed by the respiratory tract at concentrations of 250 ppm or higher and its direct toxicity result from induction of a hypoxic state due to respiratory blockade at a cellular level by inhibiting the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. Mental status depression and cardiac arrest within 30-60 minutes occur with exposure to concentrations above 500 ppm. Inhalation of concentrations superior to 1000 ppm results in immediate fatal situation (“knock down”) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】The precise nature of the toxic agent in this case remains uncertain since H <sub>2 </sub> S laboratorial quantification was not available in our setting. Nevertheless, H <sub>2 </sub> S has been described has the major toxic compound in sewer gas and the clinical picture was compatible to previously reported cases in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\- 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Toxicological analysis of sulfide or thiosulphate (a metabolite of sulfide) in blood and urine of the patient would have been useful to definitely determine the poisoning substance and monitor the clinical course. However, these specific laboratorial assessments are not readily available in Portuguese hospitals.\n\n【24】Left ventricular systolic dysfunction has been suggested as a possible cause for the cardio-respiratory complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Probably both pulmonary reactive pneumonitis and cardiogenic oedema contribute to the initial picture.\n\n【25】Neurological impact varies from headaches to convulsions, coma and respiratory arrest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Alterations in consciousness state may be due to cerebral oedema and ischemia affecting the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae may affect motor function, memory, vision and hearing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Some authors argue that neuropsychological testing is a key issue in neurotoxicology assessment because conventional neurology has been shown to be insensitive to the chemical neurotoxic effects and neuroimaging techniques are often unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】No management guidelines addressing H <sub>2 </sub> S poisoning are available. Currently, treatment approach is not evidence-based (as in most toxicological hazards) and shares some features with the approach to cyanogens poisoning. The most well described and used therapy is nitrite therapy, including 3% sodium nitrite or amyl nitrate, which are more effective if administered soon post-exposure. In one case report, the authorshypothesize that repetitive intravenous administration of sodium nitrite is effective in cases of hydrogen sulfideexposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Anecdotal reports have mentioned the prompt use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy or hydroxocobalamin but these options remain controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may act by a competitive mechanism against H <sub>2 </sub> S at the level of cytochrome oxydase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 20 \\]</u> and may have a role in the prevention of both short and long-term neurological sequelae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Hydroxocobalamin is believed to form a complex with H <sub>2 </sub> S in detoxification pathways. It has been widely described as an antidote for cyanide in smoke inhalation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Decreased sulfide and thiosulphate concentration has been documented in a patient treated with hydroxocobalamin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】These additional therapies were not performed in this case since the patient arrived at the ED out of the therapeutic window of nitrites effectiveness and showed global improvement with the aforementioned supportive measures.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n\n【32】Exposure to sewer gas should recall the strong possibility of H <sub>2 </sub> S poisoning and medical teams approaching such scenarios must ensure adequate protective safety procedures.\n\n【33】Immediate treatment strategy relies in clinical presumption since laboratorial tests to identify sulfide compounds are not readily available.\n\n【34】H <sub>2 </sub> S direct toxicity and subsequent cellular hypoxic induction may rapidly lead to multi-organic dysfunction and death depending on the level of gas exposure.\n\n【35】Treatment options based on case reports options may include nitrites, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and hydroxocobalamin. Decisions must be adapted to each case depending on the timing of post-exposure medical approach and severity of organ dysfunctions. However, the mainstay of care relies mainly in early supportive measures.\n\n【36】In our perspective, an urgent need exists for better scientific data. While more research is needed to establish appropriate treatment guidelines, occupational preventive measures are fundamental to avoid this highly lethal poisoning.\n\n【37】In the field of toxicology, and due to the relatively rare occurrence of poisonings, a comparative-effectiveness research is difficult to accomplish. A solution to improve the degree of evidence-based treatments could result from an international collaborative effort to set up a registry on toxicological hazards. In addition, it would be recommendable that national health systems include well-prepared toxicological protocols in order to avoid unnecessary delays and obstacles in identification, monitoring, and treatment of poisonings.\n\n【38】Consent\n\n【39】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal.\n\n【40】Authors’ Contributions\n\n【41】DS gather all the data and wrote the main draft of the case report.

Different conditions have been associated with IM, and although over 80% of all cases can be attributed to acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, other possible etiologies are cytomegalovirus (CMV), primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, acute Toxoplasma gondii infection, and infections produced by human herpes simplex virus (HSV) 6 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

IM was therefore diagnosed and confirmed by the presence of IgM against EBV, with seroconversion 1 month later of IgG against EBV viral capsid antigen. During admission, the laboratory tests made in citrated tubes with manual counts yielded a platelet count of > 120,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . One month later, control testing in tubes containing EDTA revealed a platelet count of 132,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> , with no platelet aggregates in the smears.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The cause of the reaction with EDTA appears to be related to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (platelet fibrinogen receptor) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. The explanation for the platelet aggregates would be a change in the structure of the glycoprotein, with the expression of new surface antigens that would be targeted by certain antibodies.

In addition to a drop in platelet count evidenced by the auto-analyzer, other laboratory test alterations can also be seen, such as pseudoleukocytosis and platelet “satellitism” phenomena.

The laboratory findings showed leucocytic count of 21.1 cc/L (91% neutrophils and 0.1% eosinophils), hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL, mild hyperbilirubinemia and normal liver function tests, bicarbonate 12 mmol/L, urea 22.5 mmol/L and creatinine 249 µmol/L.\n\n【11】Osephago-gastro-dudenoscopy was done, revealing esophagitis and signs of delayed gastric emptying. Bronchoscopy was performed and bronchoalvealor lavage was sent for analysis which showed parasitic larva consistent with strongyloides stercoralis associated with acute inflammatory process mainly macrophages and lymphocytes. The patient was started on albendazol 400 mg BID. With those interventions the patient’s hemodynamics and respiratory status marginally improved. However, his neurological status did not improve, despite daily sedation interruption.\n\n【12】Over the next few days, the patient developed refractory septic shock with acute kidney injury requiring continuous renal replacement therapy.

Strongyloides hyperinfection should be considered if the recipient condition deteriorated rapidly despite proper antimicrobial prophylaxis and treatment of critically ill.\n\n【30】Empirical antimicrobial for such critically ill should consider ivermectin and/or albendazole along with a reduction in immunosuppression.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declared no conflicts of interest with respect to the authorship and/or publication of this article.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not available.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:56:47", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:57:15", "cost": 27.061}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:57:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:56:46"}

Serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (78 mg/dl; normal range, 8 - 22 mg/dl), creatinine (2.2 mg/dl; normal range, 0.4 - 0.7 mg/dl) and C-reactive protein (38.9 mg/dl; normal range, 0 - 0.3 mg/dl) were remarkably elevated. Urinalysis revealed no ketone bodies, and numerous bacteria and leukocytes. These symptoms and data suggested the presence of HHS and urinary tract infection (UTI). Axial section  and coronal section  of computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed the presence of gas in the renal area with extensive renal parenchymal destruction, indicating the diagnosis of EPN. Cultures of blood and urine grew Escherichia coli . She was successfully treated by intensive insulin therapy, antibiotics and left nephrectomy.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Classically, CAAs are rare and are incidentally found either during post-mortem autopsy or open-heart surgery. In recent years, due to the increased usage of advanced cardiac imaging, the incidence of CAA is increasing. More patients are being diagnosed with CAA, either as a cause of their symptoms or incidentally. While studies estimate CAA incidence to be about 1% of the general population, many patients may live asymptomatic lives with these anomalies and never be diagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Studies estimate about 80% of CAAs to be benign, with about 20% causing symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Over the years, surgeons and angiographers alike have struggled when faced with patients who have CAA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. CAAs have been considered as possible causes for dyspnea, angina, and syncope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Serious complications have been documented to include myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, or sudden death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. Focus has also been given to CAA as a cause of sudden death in the young 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> after hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and idiopathic left ventricular hypertrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】To frame these complicated issues surrounding CAA, we present the case of a young patient found to have two CAAs, concurrently on coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), while in the emergency room being evaluated for chest pain.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Investigations\n\n【6】A 30-year-old healthy male presented to the emergency room for intermittent sharp left-sided chest pain that radiated to his left arm. Patient reported that the pain started 1 week prior to presentation, and it was brought on by exercise and relieved with rest. He denied any past medical history or taking any medications. Additionally, he denied the use of cigarettes, alcohol, or illicit drug. Family history was irrelevant for any cardiac disease. Vital signs on admission were remarkable for blood pressure of 180/104 mm Hg, pulse of 71 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 16 breath per minute. Physical exam was unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showed normal sinus rhythm with no significant ST-T wave abnormalities. Troponin T on admission were negative on two separate occasions. All other laboratory findings were within normal limits. CCTA was ordered as for initial noninvasive evaluation of patient’s chest pain.\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】A CCTA was done for further evaluation, showing a short segment of intra-atrial course in distal right coronary artery (RCA). Incidental findings on CCTA also revealed that origin of the left circumflex artery emerged from the right coronary cusp and followed a retro-aortic course without evidence of compression. Additionally, there was a focal shallow myocardial bridging in the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD). For a better assessment of any possible blood flow compromise at effort, the patient underwent nuclear stress test that came back negative for a reversible defect.\n\n【9】Treatment\n\n【10】Patient was found to be in the coronary artery disease reporting and data system (CAD-RADS) group 1 with minimal nonobstructive coronary artery disease. He was observed for 24 h with no episodes of chest pain or abnormal events on telemetry monitors. He was treated medically with low-dose aspirin and pain management.\n\n【11】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【12】The patient was discharged home with instructions to return to the emergency department if symptoms recur and to follow up with cardiology as outpatient. The patient did not require any further intervention later.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Many challenges exist in defining anomalous coronary arteries as there are expected variations to normal anatomy. Since the development of detailed and noninvasive imaging techniques, more efforts have been launched into describing and categorizing these anomalies with precise anatomy description. As Angelini had first described and other authors seemingly agree, an “anomaly is observed in less than 1% of the general population” and anything more is considered a typical variation on a normal distribution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, there is no strict classification system in defining these anomalies. Given the increasing propensity for noninvasive imaging, such as CCTA, our definitions of an anomaly may change as more abnormalities are found. CCTA was shown to be a high-quality study for diagnosing CAA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Most common anomaly is the origin of left circumflex artery from RCA or right coronary cusp, as seen in our patient. According to the study of angiographies by Yuksel et al, which was performed on approximately 16,000 patients, 0.29% were found to have anomalous coronary arteries. Of those patients, 58% were found to have the origin of left circumflex from RCA (17 patients) or right sinus of Valsalva (11 patients). The study of Yuksel et al is a single-center study, in which two cardiologist retrospectively reviewed angiograms over a 10-year period to determine the prevalence of different coronary anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. While angiographies are an excellent diagnostic tool and remain gold standard in determining coronary artery disease state, it is still considered an invasive test and carries many risks including but not limited to bleeding, radiation risk, contrast reaction, arrhythmia, and infection.\n\n【16】Less than a year later, another study was published by Opolski et al who performed approximately 9,000 CCTAs at a single center over a 3-year period; and these images were reviewed retrospectively for coronary anomalies. The results were similar to the study of Yuksel et al in that the most common anomaly is left circumflex artery with right-sided origin (0.37%), and then secondly, RCA arising from left-sided origin (0.23%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Due to the ability to reconstruct a three-dimensional image of the heart from performing CCTA, this study had additional information on the course of these anomalous arteries instead of the origin site alone as seen on angiographies. The intra-atrial course of RCA was found in 0.15% of all patients with CCTA; and in most of these cases, the RCA traverses through the inferolateral portion of right atrium. The study also found that the intra-atrial course of RCA is most often associated with anomalous left circumflex artery with right-sided origin and an intramuscular course of the LAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient had all three characteristics. While coronary anomalies independently are uncommon, it is even more rare to find multiple anomalies in one patient. The clinical course and symptom management remains a mystery in patients with multiple coronary anomalies due to the lack of compiled data on adverse cardiac-related events and overall prognosis. In a single-center retrospective study done to evaluate CAA in Turkish populations, high take-off coronary was the most common anomaly at 0.77% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Some high-risk anomalies that are strongly associated with sudden cardiac death are in the class of anomalous coronary artery from the opposite sinus (ACAOS). When the right main or left main coronary artery arise from the contralateral sinus, the risk of compression, stenosis and arterial hypoplasia is more pronounced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. These patients can have more serious complications such as MI or sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmias. In 2004, Eckart et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> published a study reviewing autopsies of sudden death in young adults recruited for intense military training over a 25-year period. This study was significant in that it found that 50% of deaths were identified to be cardiac in origin. Of this cardiac-related death, 33% were due to ACAOS which was found on autopsy. In these patients that expired due to ACAOS (21 patients), it was suspected that half of them had symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, or syncope but may not have been forthright due to fear of disqualification from the military training 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In comparison, only 8% of sudden cardiac deaths were due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but this can be accounted for the pre-screening testing the military recruits undergo for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy characteristics via baseline ECG and obtaining family history.\n\n【18】Given the aforementioned studies detailing the incidence of CAA, which are summarized in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\- 10 \\]</u>, these anatomical aberrations are an under-recognized cause of cardiac morbidity and mortality. The risk of sudden cardiac death due to coronary artery anomalies is highly unpredictable and heavily dependent on many factors, most importantly the aberrant anatomy and course of the coronary arteries. Currently, the treatment is based on expert opinion, type of CAA, and clinical signs and symptoms. For asymptomatic patients, the expert consensus of practitioners is to manage conservatively and allow these patients to participate in competitive athletic sports with informed consent. For patients experiencing clinical signs and symptoms of ischemia with a high-risk anomaly, many practitioners recommend limiting exertional activity and consider surgical intervention. Some of the surgical interventions described are unroofing, ostioplasty, ostial translocation, and bypass grafting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. A major limitation in current research and expert consensus is our inability to isolate and appropriately manage the asymptomatic patients with high-risk CAA that have sudden cardiac deaths without any preceding signs or symptoms of ischemia. Similarly, we are presenting a sole case of CCA that we rarely encounter in practice which makes it hard for us to conduct whether a retrospective or even a randomized clinical trial for a better understanding and risk stratification of such disease.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Prevalence Data for Coronary Artery Anomalies With Various Imaging Studies |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【20】Learning points\n\n【21】CCAs are sparsely described in literature because of the rarity of this entity, which makes it hard for cardiologist to classify these patients based on their anatomical variants. For now, it is important to classify these patients based on their symptomatology as well as other risk factors, in conjunction with their anatomical variant. With the advancement of noninvasive cardiac imaging, we might be able to identify more anomalies and maybe a scoring system for us to better manage these patients. Despite the advancements in the field of CAA, there is a long road ahead in order to understand the full impact of CAA. For cardiologists and internists alike to properly understand the natural history and physiology of CAA we call for large multi-center prospective studies to be conducted. These studies should evaluate the natural history of CAA, helping practitioners to determine which anomalies are of highest risk for future cardiac events. Finally, we also call for cardiology societies to consider releasing guidelines about who and when to screen for CAA.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank the Internal Medicine Research Department at Staten Island University Hospital for helping us finalize the project.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This paper received no financial support from any third party.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors have made contributions to writing this case report.

Chronic starvation can lead to a spectrum of histologic changes, ranging from glycogenic insufficiency to fatty deposition in hepatocytes. These changes are further reflected in liver biochemical derangements, previously described in patients with anorexia nervosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. While nourishment ultimately leads to the resolution of these laboratory abnormalities in most cases, physiologic changes in refeeding can also cause an acute but temporary worsening of transaminases. We present a patient who exhibited both phenomena of nutrition-related transaminase abnormalities.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】A 45-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a failure to thrive. She was in her usual state of health until 6 years prior to admission. She developed a poor appetite and severe food aversion, and her weight declined from 54.5 kg to her admission weight of 34.2 kg. The patient reported chronic constipation and intolerance of many foods, including oil, fats and meats. She denied dysphagia, odynophagia, abdominal bloating, pain, or diarrhea. The personal and family medical histories were unremarkable. She was not on any prior medications or supplements. She denied tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use.\n\n【5】Diagnosis\n\n【6】On physical examination, the patient was afebrile with normal vital signs. She measured 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighed 34.2 kg, with a body mass index (BMI) of 14.2 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . There was profound cachexia. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal tenderness, or distention. A comprehensive gastrointestinal workup including computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, videofluoroscopic swallowing study, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, gastric emptying study, and small bowel series, was unremarkable. Complete blood count was normal. Notable abnormalities on the metabolic panel were the sodium at 129 mEq/L (normal 135 - 148), chloride at 88 mEq/L (normal 96 - 109), and creatinine at 0.4 mg/dL (normal 0.5 - 1.2). The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were 154 U/L (normal 0 - 31) and 136 U/L (normal 0 - 31), respectively. The serum bicarbonate, urea nitrogen, glucose, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin and prealbumin were normal. Psychiatry was consulted, and she was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa.\n\n【7】The patient was started on a regular diet on day 1 of hospitalization, with estimated needs of 1,345 - 1,598 calories per day and 40 - 47 g of protein per day. However, given her gastrointestinal symptoms and laboratory abnormalities, several tests were pursued which required alterations in her diet during the initial week of hospitalization. For the most part, she was nil per os (NPO) status or ordered for a clear liquid diet while workup was pending until day 8 of hospitalization. Thus, refeeding was determined to have started on day 8 of hospitalization. She was initially ordered a vegan diet per her request, with subsequent liberalization to a regular diet. A calorie count performed on days 14 - 16 of hospitalization revealed she was consuming almost 100% of all food trays. Total parenteral nutrition was discussed early during her hospitalization, given food intolerance and disruptions in oral nutrition; however, it was not pursued. Notably, her weight initially decreased from her admission weight of 34.2 kg to a nadir around 30.8 - 31.0 kg on days 10 - 13 of hospitalization. Her weight began to increase starting day 14 of hospitalization or day 7 of refeeding.\n\n【8】On hospitalization day 6 (i.e. before refeeding), the patient’s AST and ALT rose steeply to 671 and 362 U/L, respectively. They peaked at 750 and 638 U/L, respectively, on hospitalization day 10, 2 days after refeeding was initiated . Additional laboratory workup for the etiology of liver injury (LI) included hepatitis A, B, and C serologies, which were negative. Serum ceruloplasmin and copper were normal. Ferritin and serum iron were mildly elevated. Anti-mitochondrial antibody titers were slightly elevated at 1:20 dilution, but this was considered a false positive with negative anti-nuclear and anti-smooth muscle antibodies. The immunoglobulin profile was also normal. Acetaminophen levels were undetectable. A right upper quadrant ultrasound was normal. A percutaneous liver biopsy was performed on hospitalization day 11, 3 days after refeeding; histology revealed mild glycogen depletion, marked ceroid pigment around the central veins, and scattered hepatocellular atrophy . There was no histologic evidence of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, or significant fibrosis.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

She was eventually transferred to an Eating Disorders Unit for monitoring and treatment. She then started on the nutrition protocol for eating disorders with a slow increase in daily nutrition from 1,500 calories per day to 4,000 calories per day by day 40 of hospitalization. Over the subsequent 2 months, the patient’s weight increased from 34.2 kg (BMI 14.2 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) to 38.4 kg (BMI 16.0 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), and her transaminases normalized.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Malnutrition is known to cause hepatic dysfunction and even severe liver failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. One of the first reports linking anorexia nervosa to hepatic dysfunction included two anorexic women found to have elevated AST and ALT, which resolved with increased body weights 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A prospective study of 101 anorexic Japanese women found that BMI negatively correlated with both AST and ALT levels prior to refeeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Elevations in serum transaminases may stem from malnutrition-related hepatic steatosis. One hypothesis has been the impaired degradation and secretion of lipids, resulting in the depletion of several amino acids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In carnitine deficiency, for example, long-chain acyl-CoA cannot be shuttled into the mitochondrial matrix for β-oxidation and is instead shunted toward triglyceride and very-low-density lipoprotein synthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. A recent case report also noted the presence of abundant lipofuscin and hepatic steatosis in a patient with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass who presented with severe protein-calorie malnutrition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Our patient, however, did not have evidence of hepatic steatosis on liver biopsy.\n\n【16】Another proposed mechanism of LI is starvation-induced autophagy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Autophagy involves the lysosomal degradation of cellular components into potentially reusable subunits; it has an adaptive cytoprotective role under stress conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In nutrient deprivation, autophagy can delay cell death by recycling endogenous metabolites and even suppressing apoptosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. An increase in hepatocyte permeability during autophagic cell death has been posited as a reason for elevated serum transaminases in the absence of significant cellular necrosis on histology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Refeeding\n\n【18】Interestingly, our patient also had an acute and sharp rise in transaminase levels during her hospitalization that coincided with increased oral intake, though it preceded her increase in weight. LI during the refeeding phase is hypothesized to be related to a rapid increase in glucose availability leading to fat deposition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 9 \\]</u>. In a study of 67 patients with anorexia nervosa and normal ALT on admission, 32 (48%) developed elevated ALT during oral refeeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Similar to other studies, the degree of ALT elevation was mild compared to starvation-related ALT levels prior to refeeding. One study showed that the quantity of initially prescribed calories was associated with increased odds of elevated liver enzymes in 14 patients, further implicating increased nutrition as a causative factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Normalization\n\n【20】While on the Eating Disorders Unit, our patient’s serum transaminases progressively normalized, coincident with continued oral intake and an increase in BMI. The improvement presumably stemmed from the resolution of chronic and acute insults: malnutrition and acute refeeding.\n\n【21】In summary, severe malnutrition and acute refeeding are distinct entities of LI relevant to the malnourished patient. In this case, the peak in AST and ALT occurred shortly after the start of refeeding but before the nadir in the patient’s weight, so it is unclear whether it was malnutrition or refeeding, or both, that led to the acute rise. Both are important considerations on the differential diagnosis when evaluating a malnourished patient with abnormal transaminases. Early risk stratification and close monitoring may help minimize acute hepatic injury and other serious adverse events in patients with eating disorders and malnutrition.\n\n【22】Learning points\n\n【23】Both chronic starvation and refeeding have been associated with LI. In chronic starvation, malnutrition may lead to hepatic steatosis due to impaired degradation and secretion of lipids. Starvation-induced autophagy is another potential mechanism of LI, with increased hepatocyte permeability during this phase potentially causing elevations in AST and ALT. Reintroducing nutrition may also result in rises in AST and ALT, possibly due to a rapid increase in glucose availability, though the mechanism is less clear. These liver injuries are crucial for clinicians to recognize in patients with malnutrition or those undergoing refeeding. Fortunately, they often resolve with conservative management.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr. Robert A.

There was macrocephaly, a flat face appearance, frontal bossing, synophrys, depressed nasal bridge, antevert nostrils and small nose. We also observed short hands and short fingers . There was mesomelic shortening of upper and lower extremities. There was macrocephaly and a J-shaped sella turcica on radiograph of the cranium. The radiographic examination of the thoracolumbar spine demonstrated thoracolumbar hump and mild platyspondyly. The radiographic examination of upper and lower extremities showed shortening of humerus, radius, ulna femur, tibia and fibula. Radiograph of the pelvis showed squared iliac wings . Routine biochemistry tests and blood count were normal. Ophtalmology and cardiology consultations were reported as normal. The cytogenetic analysis of peripheral leukocytes showed a normal 46, XX female karyotype. The informed consent of the parents was taken.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Only a few patients with OSMED syndrome have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Our patient showed the major findings of this syndrome such as bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, midface hypoplasia with a flat nasal bridge, anteverted nostrils, and mesomelic shortening of upper and lower extremities. The radiographic changes also supported OSMED syndrome with the findings of shortening of humerus, radius, ulna femur, tibia, fibula and squared iliac wings. Short hands and fingers were other common findings of this syndrome that are also present in this patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】The phenotype of OSMED syndrome resembles that of a group of skeletal disorders. These are Stickler syndrome type 3, Weisenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome (WZS), Marshall syndrome and Kniest dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In Marshall syndrome and Kniest dysplasia, there are ocular symptomes like myopia, congenital cataracts, glaucoma, etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In our patient, no ocular anomalies were found. The other symptomes in our case are similar to Stickler syndrome type 3 and WZS, but these disorders show autosomal dominant inheritance, and only OSMED is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. These findings confirm our diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】OSMED syndrome is a very rarely seen syndrome. To diagnose the syndrome as early as possible will be beneficial for normal development of the patients. Genetic counselling may be an important step for the affected patients and their families.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】In this case report, we aimed to help clinicians for the diagnosis of a rare syndrome in the early stages. Although there is no spesific treatment for OSMED syndrome, the early diagnosis can be important at the symptomatic treatment of the patients.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that that there is no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:55:07", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:56:32", "cost": 85.571}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:56:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:55:07"}

Stroke has been proven to produce changes in autonomic function, increase the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias and increase the serum levels of catecholamines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Most deaths occurring after an ischemic stroke can be directly attributed to the neurological injury, but 2-6% of all stroke patients will die from cardiac causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】In clinical studies, the most important control sites of autonomic function are the insular cortex, amygdala and lateral hypothalamus. Further analysis has shown that strokes in the right hemisphere produce more significant sympathetic effect than left-sided strokes. Localization and mapping of the right hemisphere has actually shown the right insular cortex in particular to be very significant in producing some of the more deadly cardiac arrhythmias after a cerebrovascular accident 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. This case report will highlight a similar case in which the arrhythmia developed after a stroke and led to further deconditioning and heart failure.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 58-year-old female presented to the emergency room (ER) with a 4-h history of left-sided weakness and dysarthria. Her past medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes and breast cancer for which she underwent bilateral mastectomy and chemotherapy. In addition to the weakness, she was complaining of a day of chest pain and shortness of breath but was denying any other accompanying symptoms. Upon presentation, her vitals were significant only for mild hypotension. A stroke code was immediately called and she had lab work done and was sent for a head CT. Labs including cardiac enzymes were unremarkable. Initially, the head CT was within normal limits, but a repeat CT showed a new hypodensity in the right posterior insular cortex . MRI was unable to be performed in this patient due to implants. EKG on admission showed a prolonged QTc, poor R wave progression, Q waves . Echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% with global cardiomyopathy. She was admitted and treated medically, and her weakness resolved. During her stay, she had multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and upon discharge, she was sent home with a beta-blocker, aspirin, high-dose statin and a life vest.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Upon arrival, her vitals were significant for tachycardia into the 120 s. Her labs were significant for an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide. During her stay, she had multiple runs of premature ventricular complexes and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient was sent for a coronary angiogram that showed normal coronary vessels. She was treated with amiodarone and digoxin and then evaluated by electrophysiology regarding the placement of an internal defibrillator. Due to her ejection fraction being above 35%, the team felt she did not qualify for the defibrillator and was sent home with her beta-blocker, amiodarone and apixaban once she was diuresed and asymptomatic.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】In humans, stroke in both hemispheres has been shown to produce changes in autonomic function leading to arrhythmias and even sudden cardiac death. In a study by Lane et al, it was determined that right hemisphere infarction is associated with a greater number of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). They speculated that this was due to a decrease in parasympathetic activity in the right-sided infarcts leading to a reciprocal rise in sympathetic tone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Of all the areas involved in autonomic function, studies have shown the insular cortex to play a major role. This area within the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory is of particular importance as it has been shown to play a role both in the sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular regulation. Usually the insula is involved in MCA occlusion, which is a major cause of ischemic stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】It has been shown that focal cerebral ischemia in animals tends to lead to fluctuation in heart rate and blood pressure only if the insular cortex is involved. In fact, stimulation of different areas within the insular cortex will invoke different cardiac autonomic responses. Microstimulation of a rat left insula resulted in QT interval prolongation, ST depression, bradycardia and complete heart block. On examination, the plasma noradrenaline levels were elevated without a change in adrenaline, indicating a neural rather than an adrenal origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Lesions in the right posterior insula have been shown to increase blood pressure and heart rate without altering baroreceptor sensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Spectral analysis of the heart rate can often be used as a surrogate for measuring sympathovagal balance. Stimulation of the area of the right posterior insular area increases sympathetic tone in the absence of heart rate, blood pressure or respiration changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, in a study by Li et al, it was determined that SVTs were more frequently encountered after right insular infarction compared with strokes in other locations. Additionally, higher serum noradrenaline levels, longer QTc prolongation and more cardiac arrhythmias were observed after a right hemisphere infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. It is proposed that the sympathetic overactivity and the catecholamine surge following a stroke in the right insular cortex increases myocardial oxygen demand, limiting coronary perfusion. This results in a calcium overload in the ventricular myocytes. This cascade of events is considered pro-arrhythmogenic and can trigger ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Furthermore, in the absence of coronary artery disease, this sympathetic hyperactivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> together with reduced cardiac parasympathetic innervation and baroreceptor function prolongs the repolarization duration and accounts for ventricular repolarization changes and increased susceptibility to arrhythmias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Continuous activation of β1 adrenergic receptors leads to opening of the calcium channels which induces the stimulation of the actin-myosin complex and causes cardiac muscle contraction with an inability to relax, consequently leading to metabolic imbalance and cell death. When this area of myocyte cell death involves the cardiac conducting system, it frequently presents as QTc prolongation and tachyarrhythmias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】The association between tachycardia and cardiomyopathy has been known for some time. Virtually every form of SVT including ectopic atrial tachycardia, junctional tachycardia and atrial fibrillation has been associated with reversible cardiomyopathy. Very frequent ventricular ectopic beats like premature ventricular contractions have also been associated with cardiomyopathy. Chronic tachycardia produces significant cardiac structural changes, including left ventricular dilatation and cellular morphological changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Our patient presented with the described variability in autonomic function. Following his stroke, the patient was found to have heart rate lability. After a period of time, this continuous onslaught of tachycardia and ventricular ectopy lead to left ventricular dilatation and a reduction in systolic function.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Cardiac death is the second most common cause of death following an acute ischemic cerebrovascular event. This is especially true when there is an ischemic stroke involving the right MCA. Lesions to the right insular cortex lead to a surge of catecholamines leading to heart rate variability and a multitude of tachyarrhythmias. Untreated, the tachycardia will lead to cardiac structural changes and left ventricular dilatation causing a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. This case highlights the importance of monitoring for and treating tachyarrhythmias in stroke patients especially in the territory of the right MCA. When deemed necessary, these patients would benefit from strict rate control, thus preventing tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the writing of this manuscript.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:44:09", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:44:31", "cost": 22.034}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:44:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:44:09"}

When ascites is first identified, it is important to determine whether it is isolated or whether other signs of hydrops are present, including skin oedema, scalp oedema, pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, and tricuspid regurgitation. The prognosis and therapy for a foetus with hydrops depends on the aetiology. However, when foetal ascites is seen alone (i.e. without other signs of hydrops), it may represent a separate problem requiring a different management strategy, leading to a different outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】A careful search for underlying causes should be undertaken in all cases of apparently isolated ascites. A systematic protocol for the diagnostic work up of foetal ascites should be followed, as an aetiology or associated disorder can be identified in 92% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Numerous mechanisms have been implicated in the generation of ascites, including abnormal lymphatic drainage; obstruction of venous return, as observed for any space-occupying lesion in the thorax; cardiac failure; decreased plasma oncotic pressure, as in foetal anaemia; hepatic insufficiency (storage disease) or congenital nephrosis; increased capillary permeability; urinary tract obstruction; or meconial peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Infections such as congenital syphilis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella, toxoplasmosis, and hepatitis A can uncommonly cause foetal ascites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Here, we present a case of prenatally diagnosed isolated foetal ascites secondary to perforation of the extra-hepatic bile duct.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 24-year-old primigravida was referred to our institution at 27 weeks gestation with a diagnosis of isolated foetal ascites. Further work-up revealed a normal foetal echocardiogram scan and a normal karyotype on amniocentesis. The patient has an A-Rh positive blood type and was rubella immune. Tests for hepatitis B and C, CMV, toxoplasmosis, herpes simplex, and syphilis were all negative.\n\n【8】Our initial ultrasound at 27 weeks of gestation showed severe isolated foetal ascites and peritoneal calcification  without any other structural anomalies. Two weeks later, we performed a foetal paracentesis, and a laboratory work-up revealed sterile peritonitis. Cultures of the ascitic fluid for TORCH (toxoplasmosis, other agents, rubella, CMV, herpes simplex) infections were all negative. The foetal ascites disappeared on a subsequent ultrasound examination performed at 33 weeks of gestation .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The indication for caesarean delivery was a foetal breech malpresentation.\n\n【12】Subsequently, the newborn was operated on by a paediatric surgeon with the indication of an intrauterine extra-hepatic bile duct perforation in the first post-partum week and was discharged from the hospital without any problems.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Isolated ascites is diagnosed by demonstrating fluid surrounding the liver, spleen, bowel, extra-hepatic portion of the umbilical vein, falciform ligament, or greater omentum. When discovered on an initial sonogram, ascites should be followed by an ultrasound approximately 1 week later to determine whether progression to foetal hydrops has occurred. If the ascites remains isolated to the foetal abdomen, then progression to hydrops is much less likely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Isolated ascites is most often secondary to an intra-abdominal disorder, rather than a generalized condition. It is most often secondary to obstructed uropathy; however, 20% of cases are due to gastrointestinal disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\- 8 \\]</u>. Of these, meconium peritonitis is the most common cause, which results from a bowel obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The work-up for any case of ascites should include a detailed ultrasound examination to exclude the presence of any associated foetal abnormalities. The mother should be screened for the presence of viral infections such as parvovirus, CMV, hepatitis, varicella, herpes simplex, rubella, syphilis, and toxoplasmosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Additionally, the blood rhesus factor and blood antibody titres of the mother should be identified.\n\n【17】An amniocentesis for foetal karyotyping should be considered, as the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities could be up to 15% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Other than a cytogenetic analysis, evaluating for a possible foetal infection (TORCH titres, antigen-specific IgM/IgG) and a prenatal diagnosis of inherited metabolic diseases are helpful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. These data could also be obtained from foetal blood sampling.\n\n【18】A foetal paracentesis can be performed to evaluate the meconium, protein/lymphocyte counts, TORCH titres, and the foetal karyotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Massive compression of the chest caused by intra-abdominal ascites before 24 weeks of gestation may lead to pulmonary hypoplasia, but it is uncertain whether foetal paracentesis is helpful in this situation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 10 \\]</u>. A foetal echocardiogram is also warranted to rule out a cardiac anomaly or arrhythmia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Bishry reported a series of twelve cases with isolated foetal ascites without any other anomalies detected antenatally, and ten survived postnatally. Only one of the ten cases had ileal atresia detected postpartum, which was repaired. The other nine cases had no abnormalities that could be detected either antenatally or postnatally. The two cases of foetal loss were diagnosed before 20 weeks of gestation and one had laryngeal atresia, which was terminal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】A larger series reported by Favre et al. detected approximately the same survival rate (8/8) for idiopathic isolated foetal ascites, in which no cause could be demonstrated during the foetal and neonatal periods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. They documented a significant relationship between survival rate and gestational age at diagnosis.\n\n【21】Furthermore, Bishry could detect the cause of isolated foetal ascites in 26 of 28 cases antenatally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, whereas Favre et al. could detect the cause in only 8 of 25 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】In our case, we could not identify any cause using data from the work-up we performed antenatally.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】Isolated foetal ascites is a rare and separate condition from foetal hydrops. The perinatal outcome for isolated ascites is much better than that for hydrops foetalis.

We describe two cases of venous thrombosis that occurred several weeks after stopping bevacizumab, raising the question of a delayed adverse drug effect.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Case 1\n\n【5】A 72-year-old female initially presented to an outside hospital with right upper quadrant abdominal pain for 3 weeks. Her past medical history was significant for controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Her family history was significant for heart failure and stroke. She was worked up with a CT scan of the abdomen which showed extensive hepatic metastatic disease, minimal ascites and right mesenteric pericolonic lymphadenopathy. A colonoscopy was performed that showed an ulcerated near-obstructing 6 cm mass in the proximal ascending colon. Biopsies confirmed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon. She was referred to our institution for further care. Patient was started on 5-Fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, leucovorin (mFOLFOX6) and bevacizumab. She tolerated chemotherapy very well. However, bevacizumab was discontinued after 2nd cycle of chemotherapy due to wound dehiscence with some drainage at the port site.\n\n【6】Two months later, the patient started having worsening shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. She was seen in the clinic. Her Physical examination was unremarkable except for 2 + pedal edema. A CT scan of the chest showed acute pulmonary embolism involving the right upper lobe and posterior segment of the right lower lobe pulmonary arteries. CT scan of the chest did not reveal any pulmonary metastasis and a CT scan of the abdomen later on, revealed stable appearance of thickening of the cecum, hepatic and nodal metastatic disease. Patient was admitted to the hospital for further management with anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【7】Case 2\n\n【8】A 48-year-old female presented to emergency department with chest pain and dyspnea. She had a cardiac workup and was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) which was treated medically with heparin drip for 72 hours and aspirin. A CT scan of the chest was also obtained and was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed a 1.6 cm right upper lobe nodule with hilar adenopathy. She underwent bronchoscopy and hilar lymph node biopsy came back positive for adenocarcinoma of the lung. A PET/CT showed uptake in right upper lobe and right hilar and right mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A mediastinoscopy was performed and pathology revealed multiple positive mediastinal lymph nodes. The patient was initially treated with chemo-radiation (cisplatin and etoposide) but progressed. She was then treated with a combination of carboplatin, taxol and bevacizumab for 4 cycles which she tolerated very well and achieved a partial remission. She was then started on maintenance bevacizumab. Bevacizumab was discontinued after 4 months due to intolerance.\n\n【9】Three months later, the patient presented with dyspnea and chest pain and was found to have an acute pulmonary embolism. She was treated with enoxaparin with a questionable compliance. About two months later she also developed neck swelling and CT scan of the neck demonstrated a right internal jugular vein thrombosis. One month later, the patient reported recurrent headaches and MRI of the brain showed thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus, right sigmoid sinus, right jugular bulb, and upper right internal jugular vein . MRI of the brain did not show any conclusive evidence of metastasis. CT scan of the chest showed stable appearance of lung mass and lymph nodes and bilateral malignant pleural effusions.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Vascular endothelial growth factor is involved in cytoprotection, proliferation of endothelial cells, and increased synthesis of nitric oxide and prostacyclin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Bevacizumab prevents VEGF ligand-receptor binding and down-streams signaling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Anti-VEGF therapy inhibits the development of new tumor vasculature and causes the normalization of surviving tumor vasculature and the regression of existing immature tumor vasculature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Bevacizumab has been reported to cause arterial thrombosis, recurrent PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and venous thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 13 \\]</u>. Shobha Rani Nalluri et al performed a meta-analysis of 7,956 patients from 15 phase II and II randomized clinical trial (bevacizumab, n = 4,292; control, n = 3,664) and concluded that bevacizumab increased the risk of VTE, both with high and low doses and the risk may vary with tumor type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Bevacizumab related/induced thrombosis may be caused by several mechanisms. First, VEGF inhibition due to bevacizumab results in vascular endothelial cell dysfunction which exposes sub-endothelial procoagulant phospholipids and tissue factor, reduces production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin and increases expression of proinflammatory cytokines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\- 16 \\]</u>. All these factors enhance coagulation and thrombosis. In addition, bevacizumab forms immune complexes (IC) with VEGF. These IC can directly induce platelet aggregation and granule release in vitro and cause thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in vivo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. While some bevacizumab treated patients may not experience thrombosis during the treatment period, it is possible that cumulative, localized IC assembly and platelet interactions may occur over an extended time period due to the long half-life of the drug (about 20 days; range: 11 - 50 days) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>. This may explain a delayed effect resulting in thrombosis even after stopping bevacizumab. Finally, VEGF is a physiological regulator of both adult erythropoiesis and synthesis of erythropoietin. Inhibition of VEGF induces normally dormant adult hepatic expression of erythropoietin which may cause thrombosis due to increase in hematocrit and blood viscosity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Our patients presented with thrombotic complications several weeks after stopping bevacizumab. Our patients were at increased risk of thrombosis due to cancer and its progression but bevacizumab may also have contributed to VTE even after discontinuation. We propose that VTE in these patients could have been related to the relatively long half-life of bevacizumab, IC formation and platelet interaction as described above.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】Bevacizumab treated cancer patients are at increased risk of VTE and this risk may vary with tumor type. Bevacizumab induced thrombosis usually presents as an acute complication during the treatment period. Here we present two patients experiencing VTE several weeks after stopping the drug.

Prior to coming to the hospital, he had been seen by his primary care provider on three different occasions. He was initially diagnosed with orchitis and then with epididymitis. He had finished two courses of outpatient antibiotic treatments with levofloxacin and amoxcillin with no relief in symptoms. A month prior to his hospitalization, he was started on prednisone 40 mg daily. One week prior, he was started on a tapering dose of prednisone and his symptoms flared back again which made him come to the hospital. His past medical history was significant for a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and gastritis. His past surgical history was significant for right middle lobectomy for bronchiectasis. The patient had a 50 pack year smoking history but had quit a few months prior to hospitalization. There was no history of alcohol or illicit drug use. His home medications included albuterol inhaler and famotidine taken on an as needed basis. On examination, the patient was afebrile and normotensive. A complete physical examination was unremarkable except for the left scrotal area which was warm, erythematous, and exquisitely tender to palpation. Significant laboratory data included an elevated ESR at 85 and an elevated C-Reactive protein (CRP) at 10.5. All other laboratory data including complete blood count, liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. A scrotal ultrasound was obtained which revealed a shrunken left testes, normal blood flow through the testes, and increased blood flow in epididymis consistent with epididymitis. The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. However, the patient continued to have progressive testicular pain and swelling. A urology consult was obtained and left orchiectomy was performed. Pathology analysis of the excised testicle and adnexa showed fibrinoid necrosis of medium and small sized arteries associated with PMN’s, a brisk lymphoid infiltrate and occasional eosinophils and plasma cells. The angiocentric and destructive inflammation was present within the testicle, epididymis, and the loose connective tissue around the vas deferens. No thrombi or gross infarcts were seen . Additional laboratory studies including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), serum complement levels, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C antibodies, cryoglobulins, perinuclear and cytoplasmic ANCA, and HIV were negative. The patient was started on high dose corticosteroids with resolution in his symptoms.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The extent of testicular involvement seen in PAN is reported to be between 38% - 86%, however, clinical symptoms are noted in approximately 18% of the patients with systemic PAN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. On rare occasions, systemic PAN presents with testicular involvement as the first sign 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Rare case reports of isolated testicular PAN have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 8 \\]</u>. However, almost all of these patients had complete remission after surgical removal of the affected testicle with no requirement for either corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy. In the case report by Warfield et al, the patient had a relapse of his underlying disease in the contralateral testicle and he required long term therapy with steroids to achieve remission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】The exact etiopathogenesis of PAN is unknown. Isolated PAN of the testes may occur concomitantly with other connective tissue disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Local immunostimulation following exposure to antigens or infectious agents may contribute to the development of isolated PAN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】The clinical presentation of testicular PAN is variable. It may be completely asymptomatic or present with features of pain, swelling and/or a local mass in some cases. This clinical presentation frequently leads to a misdiagnosis of acute orchitis, torsion, or neoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\- 8 \\]</u>. Clinical presentation of isolated testicular PAN is similar to systemic PAN with testicular involvement. Laboratory data usually is non-specific. Histological analysis of biopsy specimens remains the mainstay of diagnosis. The histological analysis of testicular PAN is also similar in both forms, however, the existence of infarcts in the affected testis is seen more often with systemic PAN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Because it is unlikely to have systemic progression without evidence of underlying connective tissue disorder or cryoglobulinemia, a serological profile to include ANA, complement levels, ANCA, and Hepatitis panel was recommended within the pathology report and was negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Whether our patient had isolated PAN of the testis or systemic PAN with initial testicular involvement cannot be determined at this moment.

It is characterized as innervation of medial and lateral part of palm involving the deep branch of the ulnar nerve crossover to the recurrent branch of the median nerve in the hand. Clinical presentation of RCA can be three forms.

Phallen and Tinel signs were negative and peripheral nerves were normal by palpation.\n\n【4】Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and needle electromyography was performed using standard techniques. Skin temperature was kept above 32 °C. Motor nerve conduction studies were obtained by recording compound muscle action potential (CMAP) responses from abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digit minimi (ADM) muscles following stimulation of median and ulnar nerves. Orthodromic sensory responses from the median and ulnar nerves were obtained from 2nd and 5th digits by using ring electrodes. Left median nerve motor conduction studies recorded from APB muscles obtained by stimulating the nerve at the wrist showed unusual bifid appearance with a small amplitude. Also stimulating the nerve at the elbow showed a similar appearance and amplitude so this also excludes Martin Gruber anastomosis. Recording from APB, this time ulnar nerve was stimulated at the wrist and cubital tunnel surprisingly responses with normal CMAP amplitude and latencies obtained . Recording from ADM ulnar motor nerve conduction velocities were normal. After median nerve stimulation no response was recorded from ADM muscle. Similar findings were obtained on the right hand, though mildly higher CMAP amplitudes in right median nerve in comparison to left median nerve. Normal sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) were recorded from median and ulnar nerves bilaterally. Needle electromyography of APB, ADM, biceps, triceps and deltoid muscles were normal. All these findings pointed out dual innervation of APB (ulnar dominance), and RCA with pure motor innervation was diagnosed.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Otherwise there may be misdiagnosis, as a case Saperstein and King reported ulnar neuropathy and RCA co-existence incorrectly diagnosed as motor neuron disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. If the hand muscles are clinically intact but electrophysiological examination shows a severe median nerve lesion in the forearm, RCA should be suspected.

GrMF is caused by unusual expression of cluster of differentiation (CD)4 T lymphocytes, a part of immune system. GrMF has an incidence of 1 in 100,000 - 350,000. Most cases are in people 40 - 55 years of age. It is twice more common in males than in females.

A similar lesion was found on her back in L3 - L5 dermatomal region . Further history and exam were largely unremarkable. Skin biopsy with immunohistopathology of the two regions showed areas of epithelioid histiocytes with multinucleated giant cells mixed with a significant lymphocyte component. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen showed no adenopathy. The granulomatous reaction was initially diagnosed as sarcoidosis, and was started on corticosteroids. Unfortunately, there was no improvement in the lesions.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

However, she later developed significant numbness and tingling of the toes as an adverse effect of brentuximab, leading to its discontinuation. The biopsy at this stage stained positive for CD30. Finally, radiation therapy was started, following which the lesion showed marked improvement in its appearance .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 4. Improvement of plaque over back. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Mycosis fungoides is the most commonly described primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. GrMF is a rare subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma first described by Ackerman and Flaxman in 1970. GrMF is characterized by dermal invasion of T cells with associated epithelioid and giant cells. It typically affects middle-aged adults and may present initially as a patch and then progresses to plaque and eventually evolve into a tumor in some individuals. In different studies, it is also found that there is a slightly increased incidence of lympho-proliferative disease, occurring after chronic sarcoidosis, probably as a consequence of immunologic abnormalities observed in lymphoproliferative disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】A strong granulomatous component can sometimes obscure the underlying cutaneous lymphoma, which is mistaken for cutaneous sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Only few cases have been reported in literature about GrMF being mistaken for sarcoidosis as depicted in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]</u>. In most cases, cutaneous granulomatous lesions follow the course of underlying lymphoproliferative disease and are considered as a possible malignant lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Diagnosis can be challenging due to heterogeneous clinical and histopathological features. No particular diagnostic clinical criteria are available for diagnosis of GrMF, because of its variable presentations and hence the detection of GrMF is primarily considered histopathology diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Histologically, GrMF shows dermal T-cell intrusion with epithelioid and giant cell granulomas without necrosis mimicking other granulomatous disease like sarcoidosis. Variants may be misleading simulating other inflammatory dermopathies when the epithelioid and giant cell feature dominates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Distinct clinical characteristics are not present. Apart from granulomatous formation, no other noticeable features are evident. The same features were seen in our patient, which misdirected the diagnosis as sarcoidosis. The International Society of Cutaneous Lymphoma consensus algorithm advocates immunophenotyping and molecular gene rearrangement studies to aid clinic-pathological diagnosis of GrMF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Patients with stage 4 disease, advanced age, blacks have worse prognosis, while a survival rate of stage 1 disease is more than 20 years. The clinical significance of granulomas in prognostication of mycosis fungoides is uncertain as both indolent and aggressive cases have been described.\n\n【16】Conclusions\n\n【17】GrMF is a diagnostic challenge, in the light of perplexing histopathological variants. Our case adds to growing number of GrMF cases misdiagnosed as sarcoidosis highlighting the plight of diagnostic obstacles. When the patient’s clinical course does not support the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, the coexistence of granulomas and typical histologic features of mycosis fungoides should indicate GrMF. Clinical dissection of atypical clinic-pathological variants coupled with immunophenotyping and molecular genetics, is crucial for early diagnosis and accurate treatment.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest to disclose.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient consent was taken.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors equally contributed to this manuscript.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:46:12", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:46:51", "cost": 38.965}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:46:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:46:11"}

Sir Astley Cooper was the first to describe a GCT in 1818. They were previously known as myeloid sarcoma, tumor of myeloplexus, osteoblastoclastoma, or osteoclastoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Approximately 2% of GCTs present in the head and neck, primarily in the sphenoid, ethmoid, or temporal bone as these sites develop from enchondral ossification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Given the lack of pathognomic radiographic features, a biopsy of a solid (not cystic) component of the lesion is the only definitive way to confirm the diagnosis of GCTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. When they occur in unusual sites, such as the skull, it may be difficult to make a correct preoperative diagnosis. Giant cell tumors are locally aggressive bone lesions characterized by vascularized tissue that contains numerous multinucleated giant cells dispersed through plump, spindly and/or ovoid cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Jaffe and Lichtenstein had described three levels of aggressiveness:通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Grade I with absence of atypia and rare mitoses; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Grade II, where stromal cells show some atypical characteristics, but insufficient to be classified as malignant tumors, with a sub-grade II+ corresponding to potentially malignant lesions; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Grade III reserved for malignant tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>\n\n【10】Otalgia, headache, hearing loss, and cranial nerve palsies are the most common presenting symptoms of temporal bone GCTs. As to ancillary diagnostic tests, skull X rays and angiography have represented the traditional investigations for cranial osteoclastomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The advent of modern neuroimaging technology has changed the traditional scenario in this as well as generally in all cranial lesions. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have maximally restricted the indications for diagnostic arteriography. With a well-defined, expansile bony lesion of significant hypointensity on T2-weighting, bony erosions and no abundant matrix calcifications on CT, one should consider giant cell tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Prognosis of GCTs is mainly related to extent of surgical excision, with little contribution from radiographic and histologic grading systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Treatment options and prognosis are mainly derived from the literature on tumors in long bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Primary management was recommended by Prosser et al, using curettage for intraosseous giant-cell tumors without adjuvant treatment or filling agents, but tumors with soft tissue extension or with local recurrence require more aggressive treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The treatment of choice is complete surgical excision which if achieved can be curative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. However, the skull base location of these tumors can make total surgical excision hazardous and not possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. While adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended to eliminate residual tumor tissue, there is evidence that irradiation predisposes the tumor to subsequent sarcomatous degeneration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Therefore, a single course of moderate dose super voltage radiation is recommended in achieving a high success rate and at the same time lowering the likelihood of malignant transformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. A single modality extremity radiation therapy protocol using 40 to 60 Gy over 3 to 6 weeks yielded 85% local control rate, as determined by examination, resolution of pretreatment symptoms, and radiographic studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Doses less than 30 Gy with prolonged fractionation result in increased local recurrence and are not recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. With large doses delivered by protons (57.6 to 61.2 Gy), Hug et al reported the control of the disease in four children, all followed for more than three years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The use of protons allow to best protect the healthy tissues adjacent to the tumor and deliver a higher dose which is confined to the target volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, but in our case we achieved the same objectives using 3D conformal radiotherapy with high energy photons, the homogeneity of the dose and the protection of healthy tissue were ensured by using wedge filters and a multileaf collimator. For unresectable tumors, radiotherapy remains the only option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Chemotherapy, on the other hand, has not been largely evaluated in the skull base GCTs. Yamamoto et al reported two cases of cranial base GCT that responded well to chemotherapy on periodic CT scans with regression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, where adriamycin was used after partial tumor excisions. Metastases occur in only 2% of cases and are usually to the lungs, but spread to rare areas like lymph nodes, mediastinum, skin, scalp and pelvis has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. However, the rate of malignant transformation in previously irradiated lesions is between 5 and 10% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Although rare, GCT can occur in the skull. Preferential sites for GCT of the skull are the temporal and the sphenoid bone. The location and the infiltrative quality of these tumors can be extremely devastating, leaving the patient severely disabled. Radiotherapy alone or in combination with surgery is a safe and effective treatment for primary and recurrent giant cell tumors of the temporal bone. Radiotherapy should be used in their management if surgery would result in significant functional morbidity, and should be considered in this select site where the probability of recurrence is high and where there is potential for significant morbidity from relapse or subsequent surgery.\n\n【12】Declaration of Competing Interests\n\n【13】All authors declare that they have no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【12】Declaration of Competing Interests\n\n【13】All authors declare that they have no competing interests.", "content": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Giant cell tumors (GCTs) of bone are uncommon primary bone neoplasms that usually occur in the epiphysis of long bones.

After nine months of a well control, patient had local recurrence with hearing loss clinically, associated to a larger and a consistent mass in the temporal area. CT scan showed in the temporal bone, the presence of multiple lacunar images, associated to a tissue component that invades the subcutaneous soft tissues in outer part and in outside the dure-mere and cerebral parenchyma, reaching the rocher with an extent to the ossicular chain of the middle ear . The patient was lost from view for two years. A new CT scan showed an increase of the tumor size. Then, the patient had surgery; with macroscopic complete resection. Pathological examination showed a giant cell tumor, grade II of Jaffé Lichtenstein. The patient received adjuvant radiotherapy with photons 6 and 18MV, at a dose of 60 Gy (2 Gy per day, five days a week). After more than 15 months of follow-up, the patient achieved local control of complete response.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Sir Astley Cooper was the first to describe a GCT in 1818. They were previously known as myeloid sarcoma, tumor of myeloplexus, osteoblastoclastoma, or osteoclastoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Approximately 2% of GCTs present in the head and neck, primarily in the sphenoid, ethmoid, or temporal bone as these sites develop from enchondral ossification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Given the lack of pathognomic radiographic features, a biopsy of a solid (not cystic) component of the lesion is the only definitive way to confirm the diagnosis of GCTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. When they occur in unusual sites, such as the skull, it may be difficult to make a correct preoperative diagnosis. Giant cell tumors are locally aggressive bone lesions characterized by vascularized tissue that contains numerous multinucleated giant cells dispersed through plump, spindly and/or ovoid cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Jaffe and Lichtenstein had described three levels of aggressiveness:通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Grade I with absence of atypia and rare mitoses; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Grade II, where stromal cells show some atypical characteristics, but insufficient to be classified as malignant tumors, with a sub-grade II+ corresponding to potentially malignant lesions; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Grade III reserved for malignant tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>\n\n【10】Otalgia, headache, hearing loss, and cranial nerve palsies are the most common presenting symptoms of temporal bone GCTs. As to ancillary diagnostic tests, skull X rays and angiography have represented the traditional investigations for cranial osteoclastomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The advent of modern neuroimaging technology has changed the traditional scenario in this as well as generally in all cranial lesions. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have maximally restricted the indications for diagnostic arteriography. With a well-defined, expansile bony lesion of significant hypointensity on T2-weighting, bony erosions and no abundant matrix calcifications on CT, one should consider giant cell tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Prognosis of GCTs is mainly related to extent of surgical excision, with little contribution from radiographic and histologic grading systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Treatment options and prognosis are mainly derived from the literature on tumors in long bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Primary management was recommended by Prosser et al, using curettage for intraosseous giant-cell tumors without adjuvant treatment or filling agents, but tumors with soft tissue extension or with local recurrence require more aggressive treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The treatment of choice is complete surgical excision which if achieved can be curative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. However, the skull base location of these tumors can make total surgical excision hazardous and not possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. While adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended to eliminate residual tumor tissue, there is evidence that irradiation predisposes the tumor to subsequent sarcomatous degeneration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Therefore, a single course of moderate dose super voltage radiation is recommended in achieving a high success rate and at the same time lowering the likelihood of malignant transformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. A single modality extremity radiation therapy protocol using 40 to 60 Gy over 3 to 6 weeks yielded 85% local control rate, as determined by examination, resolution of pretreatment symptoms, and radiographic studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Doses less than 30 Gy with prolonged fractionation result in increased local recurrence and are not recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. With large doses delivered by protons (57.6 to 61.2 Gy), Hug et al reported the control of the disease in four children, all followed for more than three years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The use of protons allow to best protect the healthy tissues adjacent to the tumor and deliver a higher dose which is confined to the target volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, but in our case we achieved the same objectives using 3D conformal radiotherapy with high energy photons, the homogeneity of the dose and the protection of healthy tissue were ensured by using wedge filters and a multileaf collimator. For unresectable tumors, radiotherapy remains the only option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Chemotherapy, on the other hand, has not been largely evaluated in the skull base GCTs. Yamamoto et al reported two cases of cranial base GCT that responded well to chemotherapy on periodic CT scans with regression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, where adriamycin was used after partial tumor excisions. Metastases occur in only 2% of cases and are usually to the lungs, but spread to rare areas like lymph nodes, mediastinum, skin, scalp and pelvis has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. However, the rate of malignant transformation in previously irradiated lesions is between 5 and 10% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Although rare, GCT can occur in the skull. Preferential sites for GCT of the skull are the temporal and the sphenoid bone. The location and the infiltrative quality of these tumors can be extremely devastating, leaving the patient severely disabled. Radiotherapy alone or in combination with surgery is a safe and effective treatment for primary and recurrent giant cell tumors of the temporal bone. Radiotherapy should be used in their management if surgery would result in significant functional morbidity, and should be considered in this select site where the probability of recurrence is high and where there is potential for significant morbidity from relapse or subsequent surgery.\n\n【12】Declaration of Competing Interests\n\n【13】All authors declare that they have no competing interests.", "index": 8485, "show": true, "start": 8485, "end": 8587, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:11:41", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:12:10", "cost": 28.153}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:12:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:11:40"}

Adhesion can vary from minor to complex fibrotic tissue that leads to loss of surgeons’ ability to definitive anatomical tissue plane that can cause increased operative time and risk of surgical trauma. There are different consequences of adhesion. For bariatric procedures involved foregut, abdominal pain and bowel obstruction from adhesion are uncommon but adhesion may cause increased operative time and surgical risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Case Reports\n\n【3】Typical cases\n\n【4】Case 1\n\n【5】A 45-year-old female presented with reflux and failure to weight loss 14 months after gastric banding. Decision was made to precede for gastric sleeve. Gastric band was removed initially as primary procedure followed by gastric sleeve after 3 months. During the second procedure (gastric sleeve), significant adhesion was found in upper abdomen that made the procedure difficult and prolonged.\n\n【6】Case 2\n\n【7】Another 35-year-old female presented with failed gastric band. Adhesive barrier was used during removal of gastric band. During the second procedure (gastric sleeve) after 3 months, there was less adhesion in comparison to the first case.\n\n【8】Considering these two cases, a study was conducted on similar cases to observe the effect of adhesive barriers on revision bariatric surgery.\n\n【9】Case series study\n\n【10】Participants\n\n【11】The actual study was introduced to 30 patients undergoing removal of gastric band. Nineteen have gone through the study having band removal followed by sleeve gastrectomy 3 month later . Others were waiting for further procedures or follow-up or had other bariatric procedures rather than sleeve gastrectomy.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Participants of the Study |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【13】Design\n\n【14】A prospective, single-center, controlled, single-blinded, randomized study was conducted. Patient blinding was performed intra-operatively through a third person with externally prepared randomization using envelopes. To blind the reviewer to subject and treatment, all videos were assigned a unique blind code.\n\n【15】Interventions\n\n【16】The patients were randomized intra-operatively when they had their gastric band removed to either a control group (11 patients) who received band removal only or the active group (eight patients) who had a sprayable adhesion barrier applied at the time of band removal, using not more than one kit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The second procedures (sleeve gastrectomy) for both groups were independently graded for adhesions. All procedures were recorded and were assessed in a blind fashion as to the severity of adhesions (grade 1 - 5).\n\n【17】Outcome\n\n【18】The primary outcome with respect to efficacy was the incidence, severity of adhesion and time required for the second procedure (sleeve gastrectomy) scored by a single reviewer.\n\n【19】Statistical analysis\n\n【20】The primary endpoint was the severity of adhesion and duration of second procedure. We calculated means and standard deviations and used a two-sample t \\-test to identify differences in means between participants in each group. P < 0.05 was considered significant for all comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS.\n\n【21】Results\n\n【22】Adhesion score was grade from 1 to 5 for each control group (n = 11) and active (n = 8) group. For the active group, the score was 1 to 2. On the other hand, it averaged from 3 to 5 for the control group . Total adhesion score for control group was 32 and for the active group was 12 . Unpaired t \\-test results showed P value and statistical significance. The two-tailed P value was 0.0464. By conventional criteria, this difference was considered to be statistically significant. The average operative time for control group was 73 min and for active group was 56 min .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

They searched PubMed, CENTRAL, and Embase for randomized clinical trials assessing use of oxidized regenerated cellulose, hyaluronate carboxymethylcellulose, icodextrin, or polyethylene glycol in abdominal surgery. The primary outcome was reoperation for adhesive small bowel obstruction. Their search returned 1,840 results, from which 28 trials (5,191 patients) were included. No trials reported data for the effect of oxidized regenerated cellulose or polyethylene glycol on reoperations for adhesive small bowel obstruction. Oxidized regenerated cellulose reduced the incidence of adhesions. No barriers were found to be associated with an increase in serious adverse events.\n\n【29】Adhesions are the most frequent complications of abdominopelvic surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> and a life-time risk of small bowel obstruction with considerable morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\- 5 \\]</u>. Adhesion increases the risk of admission to hospital for related complications following gynecological procedures and up to 56% of all patients are in need of further surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In clinical and autopsy studies of patients who had prior laparotomies, the incidence of intra-abdominal adhesions was 70-90% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Evidence-based practice of adhesive barrier is poor. There are different methods of adhesive barrier. In our study ,we used SprayShield adhesion barrier because 1) the only adhesion barrier with a unique blue color can easily be seen during laparoscopic surgery; 2) the air assisted sprayer and flow regulator provide an accurate and controlled delivery of hydrogel to the application site during surgery; and 3) it polymerizes rapidly and gently, forming a flexible, tissue adherent, smooth and lubricious adhesion barrier. The barrier allows adjacent surfaces and organs to move freely over protected areas, allowing natural healing. Though SprayShield is no longer regularly practiced and available in Australia as it is sold to other company towards the end of our study but there are other adhesive barriers available in market with similar property. This is suitable for multiple site abdominopelvic protection in laparoscopic surgery, complex anatomy and dry surfaces.\n\n【31】A variety of adhesion prophylaxes have been investigated to reduce occurrence and severity of adhesion formation. Antiadhesion barriers basically fall under two main categories: macromolecular solutions and mechanical devices  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 2. Adhesive Barriers |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【33】Hydrogel spray gel, which is similar to SprayShield, and which forms a solid, flexible, absorbable hydrogel, has demonstrated efficacy in a population of patients known to be particularly at risk of adhesion formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n\n【35】In our study, an adhesion barrier leads to a statistically significant reduction in adhesion formation and operative time. There are many research projects before to see the outcome of adhesive barrier mainly for gynecological and colorectal surgeries but not for bariatric procedures. This warrants consideration of a larger trial to assess whether adhesion barriers may reduce morbidity in re-operative bariatric surgery.\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies.</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical Declaration</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Compliance with Ethical Standards.</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was taken from the patients.</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ahmed Arifur Rahman: data collection, analyzing and interpreting the data; writing manuscript; approving final version of the manuscript.</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:50:44", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:50:54", "cost": 10.054}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:50:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:50:35"}

Enzinger and Harvey first described SCLs as a benign lesion occurring in middle-aged men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A number of anatomical sites affected by this disease have been reported in the literature including the head and neck, oral cavity, orbit, upper back, abdomen, esophagus, breast, bronchus, vulva and extremities.\n\n【2】Pathological characteristics of SCLs have been well described and include the following features: a well-circumscribed subcutaneous lesion that contains a variety of mature adipocytes, spindle cells and collagen bundles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-3 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Immunohistochemical staining of SCLs is usually positive for CD34. However, this is not pathognomonic and is used as an aid for making a diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Four cases of posterior neck triangle SCLs have been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5-8 \\]</u>. We present a further case of SCL presenting in the posterior triangle and discuss the current pathological methods used to diagnose SCLs and the surgical approach taken to manage such cases.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 51-year-old man with a large right posterior neck triangle mass was referred to our Head & Neck Clinic. Further questioning revealed that this swelling had been growing for over two and a half years. An increased rate of growth and associated symptoms (neck pain, difficulty swallowing and recurrent skin infections at the base of the mass) over the preceding months led the patient to present for medical attention. Functionally, the patient was experiencing great difficulty washing and dressing and therefore was eager to have the lesion removed.\n\n【7】The patient was born prematurely at 34 weeks of age and subsequently developed hydrocephalus requiring a VP shunt system. His other comorbidities included epileptic seizures, chronic calcified subdural hemorrhages, gastroesphageal reflux disease, inflammatory bowel syndrome and osteoarthritis. He was a life long non-smoker on a number of medications to control his seizures and reflux disease.\n\n【8】Radiology\n\n【9】Ultrasound imaging was undertaken in the first instance. A well-circumscribed mass on the right posterior neck triangle was visualized. No areas of internal vascularity were noted. An ultrasound-guided core biopsy was performed.\n\n【10】Computed tomography (CT) imaging was performed revealing a fat encapsulated mass in the right posterior triangle measuring 106 × 72 × 92 mm. The posterior edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle was displaced laterally. No internal calcification, cervical lymphadenopathy or metastatic lesions were identified . Following discussion at the multi-disciplinary team meeting, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was recommended. Unfortunately, MRI was not possible as the patient was unable to tolerate lying flat for a period of time needed for the study.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

An elliptical cervical incision was made.

The accessory nerve was subsequently identified and preserved with the aid of a nerve stimulator. Deeper dissection of the lesion revealed an outer appearance of a pseudocapsule , in addition to its infiltrative nature abutting the posterior edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 4.

Immunochemistry confirmed spindle cells to be positive for CD34 . Molecular genetic studies in the form of Mdm2 gene amplification were undertaken but were negative when assessed with fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of an SCL.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 9.

To the best of our knowledge, there have been four other reports documenting posterior neck triangle SCLs. Therefore, this report represents the fifth documented case of a posterior neck SCL.\n\n【29】SCLs have the tendency of presenting as a solitary, painless, slow growing, benign lesion presenting on the posterior neck or upper back of middle-aged men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 11 \\]</u>. Metastasis of this lesion is uncommon and has not been reported in the literature.\n\n【30】Following clinical examination, pathological analysis and radiological imaging are necessary to aid diagnosis and formulate a plan for surgical excision. Reoccurrence following surgical excision is thought to be low.\n\n【31】Light microscopic appearances of SCLs consist of mature adipocytes either partially or fully substituted by a homogeneous group of spindle cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Further definition of an SCL is they are atypical benign lesions, composed of atypical adipocytes with varying shaped and sized hyperchromatic nuclei associated with slightly atypical spindle-shaped cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】The growth of SCLs is somewhat similar to Schwannomas and neurofibromas; however, precise histological analysis would sufficiently differentiate the latter diseases from SCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】CD34 expression is not pathognomonic for a diagnosis of SCL. CD34 immunoreactivity can also be demonstrated in atypical lipomatous neoplasms and well-differentiated liposarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 12 \\]</u>. Therefore, CD34 expression alone is not pathologically diagnostic of SCL, but can aid the pathologist in making the diagnosis. This is vital, as low-grade liposarcomas carry a significant risk of metastasis.\n\n【35】SCLs are associated with negative Mdm2 and/or CDK4 gene immunohistochemical expression. It is thought that although some SCLs may express Mdm2 or CDK4 on immunohistochemical staining, invariably, such expression is not detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis which is considered to be the gold standard and more sensitive in detecting such gene expression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】Radiological appearances supportive of a diagnosis of SCL include a lesion consisting of 25-75% of fat in the form of adipose globules containing a variable amount of thin and thick septa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Signal intensity of the non-adipose component of SCLs is greater than fat on conventional T2-weighted images, whilst gadolinium-enhancement MRI would show enhancement similar to that of the adjacent vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Vascular prominence of the non-adipose tissue contained within SCLs is considered to be significantly more intense than liposarcoma. However, calcification and bony erosion are not associated with SCLs on imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】Due to the rare nature of SCLs, such cases should be discussed in a dedicated multi-disciplinary team meeting. Although metastasis from SCLs is rare, experienced pathologists and radiologists should be consulted early in order to distinguish the type of lesion and the risk of metastasis from more sinister lesions such as liposarcoma. Surgical excision of SCLs is currently accepted as the gold standard and mainstay of management.\n\n【38】Conclusion\n\n【39】SCLs are a rare, slow growing and benign form of the lipoma family. They tend to present in middle-aged men usually on the upper back or posterior neck. Although the risk of metastasis is low, early and definitive diagnosis is essential in order to rule out lipomas with a higher incidence of metastasis. This is the fifth case to report a posterior neck SCL. Similar to the previous cases, surgical excision was undertaken, which is considered to be the gold standard treatment.\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Dr Charles Tilley, Consultant Histopathologist at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust for preparing the pathology pictures provided in this report.</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grants</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:25:21", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:25:54", "cost": 32.487}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:25:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:25:12"}

In contrast, the recessive form lacks the somatic features and has severe recurrent viral infections, extreme eosinophilia and devastating neurologic complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】This article presents 3 patients suffering from HIES that were followed in our hospital at different times and with different outcomes; then, a description of the clinical, laboratory and therapeutic aspects of the disease will be made.\n\n【4】Case Reports\n\n【5】Case 1\n\n【6】The first patient was a woman, born in 1975, without consanguineous parents, but 3 of her 4 siblings died in the first 2 years of life (cause of the deaths unknown). Since birth, she suffered from recurrent herpetic keratitis of the eye, motivating a corneal transplant at seven years old, that was rejected three years later. She also had a history of atopic eczema, recurrent mucocutaneous candidiasis, multiple verrucae , infected cutaneous ulcers and dental abscesses, one episode of intestinal infection with Giardia lamblia , and multiple hospitalizations from recurrent infected bronchiectasis. The infectious agents identified were Haemophilus influenzae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter spp . Her IgE values ranged from 2000 to 5000 UI/mL. She was hospitalized almost every month because of infected bronchiectasis and hemoptysis (pulmonary artery embolization was necessary). She had poor antibody response to polysaccharide antigens and started intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) in a dose of 0.4 g/kg/month. There was no change of the clinical picture. At 26 years old a spinocellular carcinoma in the vulva (T1N0M0) was diagnosed and she was submitted to surgery. She developed persistent respiratory insufficiency and died, at 27 years old, from one episode of infected bronchiectasis.\n\n【7】Case 2\n\n【8】The second patient was a woman born in 1976, with consanguineous grandparents (one healthy brother). She had a history of multiple infections of the eye, with three rejected corneal transplants. Recurrent respiratory infections were the rule in her life (the infectious agent identified was always Staphylococcus aureus ) with structural and functional respiratory abnormalities. She also had recurrent infections of other organs (otitis, skin abscesses and purulent gingivitis). It was described, from the records, a rough skin and scoliosis. Her IgE values ranged from 900 to 1500 UI/mL. It was described an increased activation of lymphocyte B (increased expression of CD23). At 21 years old, she started IVIg in an irregular basis (0.4 g/kg), because of poor antibody response to polysaccharide antigens, and prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole because of persistent skin abscesses and respiratory infections. The quality of life was improved after this treatment, with decreased number of hospitalizations. At 28 years old she had an advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma and started chemotherapy. She died two months later from sepsis.\n\n【9】Case 3\n\n【10】The third case is a man, born in 1985, that at present is followed in our hospital. There is no known consanguinity in the family, but he has a cousin with the same disease. Since childhood, there has been a history of recurrent pneumonias (Staphylococcus aureus) and purulent otitis. At 20 years old he was hospitalized because of skin abscesses in the buttocks and dental abscesses, treated with antibiotics. Months later he had corneal ulcer of the eye ( Staphylococcus aureus ) and prolonged febrile syndrome, and it was the first time he had contact with our team. We documented some characteristic features like prominent forehead, facial asymmetry, a broad nasal bridge, prognathism and rough skin with prominent pores, scoliosis, lack of some teeth, eczematoid dermatitis, oral candidiasis and central depression on the tongue. He had no abnormalities in lung imaging and respiratory functional tests. No cause for the fever was encountered. He started topic treatment with antibiotics, and also systemic empiric antibiotics and antifungal (ciprofloxacin, flucloxacilin, itraconazole,trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole and albendazole). The fever and the ulcer were treated, although he maintains a chronic diminished visual acuity. His IgE levels are between 8000 and 24700 UI/mL and eosinophilia is 2 - 4 times higher than the normal range. The levels of IgE and eosinophilia never were correlated with the clinical status of the patient. He had a low response to polysaccharide antigens. Since then, he has been with IVIg 0.4 g/kg/month, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (960 mg twice a day) and vitamin C. Now he is 25 years old and no longer has new infections.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Clinical manifestations of HIES\n\n【13】HIES usually presents very early in life. The clinical manifestations of the dominant form are resumed here.\n\n【14】Almost all patients suffer from recurrent staphylococcal infections, beginning in infancy and predominantly involving the skin and lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 12 \\]</u>. A newborn pustular and eczematoid rashes are usually the first manifestations of the disease, typically affecting the face and scalp, with an eopsinophilic infiltrate and caused by Staphylococcus aureus . Boils are a classic finding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Trouble areas may persist in intertriginous areas such as the axillae, the inguinal region, or under the breasts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Recurrent pyogenic pneumonias are very common, starting in the childhood. They may present with fewer symptoms, leading to a subsequent delay in clinical presentation, contributing to advanced disease and significant tissue damage before identification and initiation of therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】In these patients, the degree of inflammatory symptoms is variable. The “cold” abscesses, without external signs of inflammation, initially described by Davis and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, are common. Staphylococcus aureus is the bacterium most frequently isolated, but Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , enteric Gram-negative bacteria, Candida and Aspergillus are also common. Pneumonia is frequently followed by pneumatocele or bronchiectasis, that are commonly superinfected by Aspergillus fumigatus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 13 , 14 \\]</u>. The secondary infections are more indolent and difficult to clear. These long-term infections are more frequently associated with mortality than the acute pyogenic infections, causing rupture into large pulmonary vessels with life-threatening hemoptysis or fungal dissemination to the brain, for example 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Mucocutaneous candidiasis is the most common opportunistic infection. Several cases of pneumocystosis , cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 13 , 15 \\- 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The facial appearance is very characteristic: facial asymmetry, prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, a broad nasal bridge, mild prognathism, and rough appearance of the facial skin with prominent pores 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 20 , 21 \\]</u>. Some individuals retain their primary teeth, because of the failure of those teeth to exfoliate. The secondary teeth can be present simultaneously when the secondary teeth emerge before primaries have fallen out. Other features are central depressions in the tongue and high arch of the palate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 22 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】One of the most recent documented features are arterial aneurysms, which can be coronary and extra-coronary. We must recognize in the adult patients the high risk of myocardial infarction as the result of an aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Brain abnormalities, like T2-weighted hypersensities seen on brain MRI are also present, but gross neurologic abnormalities are not detected in the majority of patients with these findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Ophthalmologic pathologies such as extensive xanthelasma, giant calazia and undefined tumors of the eyelid have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\- 25 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Osteoporosis is common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 14 \\]</u>, and other skeletal abnormalities include scoliosis, minimal trauma fractures, hyperextensibility, and degenerative joint disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 , 26 , 27 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】An increased risk of malignancy is associated with this disorder, contributing to the high mortality. Several malignancies have been reported, including Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, leukemia, and cancers of the vulva, liver and lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 28 \\- 31 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Laboratory investigations\n\n【21】Serum IgE concentrations are extremely high in patients with HIES (> 2000 IU/ml) sometimes even at the time of birth. The molecular mechanism of hyper-IgE-emia remains unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 14 \\]</u>. The IgE levels are not static: they usually are undetectable in cord blood and rise to the adult range slowly over the years, and can diminish again. Substantial fluctuation has been documented over time without any obvious change in clinical presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. HIES patients have normal or decreased serum IgM, IgG and IgA levels, but most have defects of various types in the antigen-specific antibody response to immunization. IgG subclass deficiencies have been reported in some patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Eosinophilia is the other consistent laboratory finding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. There is no correlation between eosinophilia and IgE levels or eosinophilia and infectious complications of HIES 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Total white blood cell counts are normal but they often fail to elevate appropriately during acute infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】An impaired chemotaxis of neutrophils or monocytes has been described, a defect that explains the “cold abscesses” presented by the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】There is a lack of other pathognomic laboratory signs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Autosomal recessive HIES\n\n【26】Patients with the recessive form have no skeletal and connective tissue abnormalities. They have recurrent or severe infections by Staphylocuccus aureus , Haemophilus influenzae , Proteus mirabilis , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Cryptococcus , chronic refractory Molluscum contagiosum infections, recurrent aphtoid herpes simplex infections. They are also susceptible to intracellular bacteria (mycobacteria, Salmonella ). The neurological symptoms are more severe, from partial facial paralysis to hemiplegia. The levels of serum IgE are more elevated than the dominant form. Eosinophilia is also more severe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Therapy of hyper-IgE syndromes\n\n【28】There is no cure for HIES yet. The consensus favors long-term prophylactic therapy of Staphylococcus aureus skin and lung infection with an anti-staphylococcal antibiotic such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis remains unproven 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. If possible, the etiologic agent should guide treatment of pneumonia; bronchoscopy may be helpful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Because patients feel well and are unware of how severely ill they are, we need to have a low threshold for investigating slight changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】IFN-gama had inconsistent effects on IgE levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>. Intravenous immunoglobulin may decrease the number of infections for some patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\- 36 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Conclusion\n\n【31】In the past five years, there was a significant improvement of the diagnosis of the HIES syndromes. These primary immunodeficiency disorders are rare and usually first manifest during childhood. Patients usually die prematurely due to pulmonary infections; early diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving and can lead to a significant reduction in morbidity. To best diagnose and treat, we should be familiarized with the clinical and laboratorial aspects of the disease. Besides the infections, we should not forget the risk of malignancy that is associated with HIES. The long-term prophylactic therapy with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is mandatory. We hope that developmental, biochemical, and molecular studies should help us to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and lead to new therapies for patients with HIES.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:57:07", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:57:21", "cost": 14.693}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:57:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:56:57"}

Immunodeficiency is the only well-documented risk factor. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) accounts for the vast majority of cases of PCNSL in immunocompetent patients.

A brain MRI scan revealed a right hemisphere small ill-defined mass in the posterior centrum ovale and extending inferiorly towards the basal ganglia , which was considered to be inflammatory.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Axial T2-weighted MRI showing the extensive vasogenic oedema surrounding the hyperintense mass in the right posterior centrum semiovale. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【5】Within four months the patient experienced a spontaneous near-full recovery, enabling him to perform heavy exercise. An MRI scan at that time demonstrated that the ring-enhancing lesion had increased in size and developed central cavitation . From this time the patient began to clinically deteriorate with increasing left hemiparesis. On examination he had marked left upper motor neuron facial weakness, and power was 3/5 and 4/5 in the left arm and leg respectively.\n\n【6】In November 2009, the patient suddenly deteriorated, with an abrupt loss of sensation in the left arm and impairment of coordination in the left leg. There was no headache, dizziness, visual or hearing impairment. Clinical examination revealed fixed-flexion of the left arm, and brisk reflexes in the left lower limb accompanied by an up-going plantar reflex. Cranial nerve examination was normal, except for the previously reported left-sided weakness of the face, which was now accompanied by a loss of sensation. A third MRI scan demonstrated further progression, with increased size of the mass (2 cm), cavitation, and irregular thick ring enhancement .\n\n【7】At this time routine haematological examination was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was also within normal limits with an opening pressure of 12 cm (10 - 25 cm), 1.33 g/L protein (< 0.4g/L), 3.9 mmol/L glucose (2.8 - 4.4 mmol/L), normal cytology, negative bacterial culture and gram stain. No monoclonal or oligoclonal bands were detected and polymerase chain reaction for Toxoplasma, Cryptococcus, syphilis, hepatitis B and C viruses were negative. Anti-nuclear, anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic, anti-mitochondrial, anti-smooth muscle, anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibodies were all negative. CSF angiotensin-converting enzyme however, was elevated at 115 U/L (< 1.2 U/L). Human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2 antibodies were negative.\n\n【8】A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed, which identified a mass on the lower pole of the right kidney measuring a maximum diameter of 6.6 cm. The possibility of renal cell carcinoma with cerebral metastases was considered, but renal biopsy revealed a diagnosis of an incidental oncocytoma.\n\n【9】Dexamethasone 6 mg TDS was initiated leading to a significant clinical improvement. Due to the development of intolerable side effects, the steroid dosage was gradually reduced to 2 mg BD, and azathioprine therapy was initiated. However, due to adverse effects (hepatic dysfunction), azathioprine was discontinued after one week.\n\n【10】Three months later the patient was admitted with weakness in the left side of the face, left arm (particularly the fingers) and left leg. On examination, there was marked weakness and hypertonia, and reflexes were brisk throughout the left side. Sensation was impaired in both the upper and lower left limbs, particularly light touch and pin-prick. The MRI at this stage revealed that the pre-existing lesion was of similar size but had become less discrete, and with less contrast enhancement but greater restricted diffusion .\n\n【11】In addition to the neurological features mentioned, the patient also complained of lethargy and dyspnoea on mild exertion together with episodes of epistaxis and per rectal bleeding. He did not report any weight loss or night sweats and there was no clinical evidence of lymphadenopathy. The full blood count demonstrated a pancytopaenia with 8.4g/dL haemoglobin (13 - 18 g/dL), 105.3 fL mean corpuscular volume (76 - 96 fL), 86 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L platelets (150 - 400 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) and 4.8 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L leukocytes (4 - 11 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L).\n\n【12】In view of the patient’s deteriorating haematological profile bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy were performed. The bone marrow aspirate demonstrated abnormal mononuclear cells, the morphology favouring a haematopoietic process (for example, large cell lymphoma). There was also evidence of hemophagocytosis and erythroid hyperplasia, accounting for the anaemia. There was a grossly abnormal cellular infiltrate raising the possibility of haematological malignancy. Trephine biopsy revealed small clusters of cells in keeping with marrow involvement by DLBCL.\n\n【13】The patient was initiated on rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone therapy for treatment of PCNSL with bone marrow involvement. Two further brain MRI scans in May and July 2010 showed poorer definition of the lesion, which had remained constant in size, but with greater surrounding oedema . Unfortunately, the patient’s symptoms progressed to include visual impairment, and power on the left side deteriorated to 0/5 throughout. Treatment was complicated by several episodes of neutropenic sepsis, from one of which the patient died, two months later.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】This case demonstrates an unusual presentation of a rare, but increasingly encountered condition in immunocompetent hosts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Owing to the relative rarity of PCNSL, it has proved difficult to study, and the optimum treatment strategy has yet to be determined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Clinical manifestations of PCNSL include neuropsychiatric signs, raised intracranial pressure, seizures, ocular symptoms and other focal deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. The so-called, ‘B symptoms’ include weight loss, fever and night sweats, and are rarely encountered at initial presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Neuroimaging is important in the diagnosis of PCNSL, with contrast-enhanced MRI being the modality of choice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Lesions may be multiple, and may resemble inflammatory and infectious diseases, as well as other neoplastic processes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. PCNSL masses have acquired the pseudonym of “ghost tumours”, as radiological changes may disappear, particularly after corticosteroid therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Definitive diagnosis is achieved by stereotactic biopsy, although this is sometimes unnecessary owing to the presence of lymphomatous cells in the CSF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Glucocortcoid therapy may obscure the histological diagnosis, so steroids should not be administered (pre-biopsy) if PCNSL is likely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】The development of effective chemotherapy regimens has meant that a proportion of patients may achieve remission. Relapse however, is a common occurrence, and only 20-30% of patients are cured 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The spontaneous remission of symptoms that occurred initially in this case is an extremely unusual occurrence, and may impose a significant diagnostic challenge in cases with PCNSL. Consequently, this patient’s symptoms were initially considered to be due to an inflammatory or demyelinating process, culminating in a delay in the initiation of appropriate cytotoxic therapy.\n\n【19】The diagnosis of PCNSL in the case described was not established until symptoms of bone marrow involvement had developed. The incidence of systemic involvement following PCNSL is controversial, with some studies suggesting that extensive staging is unnecessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, investigation for occult systemic disease is increasingly undertaken, with full body CT scanning and bone marrow biopsy now recommended for staging of PCNSL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Testicular ultrasonography may be performed in elderly males, as testicular lymphoma frequently disseminates to the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】The incidence of PCNSL in immunocompetent hosts is increasing. Spontaneous remission of symptoms is unusual, but can occur, and should not discourage a differential diagnosis of PCNSL if consistent with clinical and radiological findings. Extra-neural disease is increasingly recognised in PCNSL, and patients should undergo thorough staging to exclude systemic disease.\n\n【22】Declaration\n\n【23】The authors declare no competing interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Declaration\n\n【23】The authors declare no competing interest.", "content": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare variant of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, accounting for 3-5% of brain tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

Glucocortcoid therapy may obscure the histological diagnosis, so steroids should not be administered (pre-biopsy) if PCNSL is likely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】The development of effective chemotherapy regimens has meant that a proportion of patients may achieve remission. Relapse however, is a common occurrence, and only 20-30% of patients are cured 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The spontaneous remission of symptoms that occurred initially in this case is an extremely unusual occurrence, and may impose a significant diagnostic challenge in cases with PCNSL. Consequently, this patient’s symptoms were initially considered to be due to an inflammatory or demyelinating process, culminating in a delay in the initiation of appropriate cytotoxic therapy.\n\n【19】The diagnosis of PCNSL in the case described was not established until symptoms of bone marrow involvement had developed. The incidence of systemic involvement following PCNSL is controversial, with some studies suggesting that extensive staging is unnecessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, investigation for occult systemic disease is increasingly undertaken, with full body CT scanning and bone marrow biopsy now recommended for staging of PCNSL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Testicular ultrasonography may be performed in elderly males, as testicular lymphoma frequently disseminates to the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】The incidence of PCNSL in immunocompetent hosts is increasing. Spontaneous remission of symptoms is unusual, but can occur, and should not discourage a differential diagnosis of PCNSL if consistent with clinical and radiological findings. Extra-neural disease is increasingly recognised in PCNSL, and patients should undergo thorough staging to exclude systemic disease.\n\n【22】Declaration\n\n【23】The authors declare no competing interest.", "index": 10166, "show": true, "start": 10166, "end": 10225, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:43:08", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:43:37", "cost": 28.554}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:43:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:43:08"}

The majority of patients have a history of upper respiratory tract infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u> prior to developing SAT. SAT has typical findings on ultrasound (US), which consist of focal ill-defined hypoechoic areas on gray scale US and no hypervascularity in the acute stage, with slightly increased vascularity seen in the recovery stage on color Doppler US 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]</u>. SAT associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma is very rare. Only three case reports of SAT associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma have been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\- 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Recently, we had a case of SAT associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma diagnosed by immediate repeat US-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA).\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 44-year-old woman visited a local medical clinic for a routine exam. On thyroid US, a nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid was detected incidentally. She was referred to our center for FNA of the thyroid nodule. She had an upper respiratory tract infection about 3 months prior to presentation and then subsequently developed anterior neck pain 2 months prior to presentation. She was treated at a local medical clinic. Physical examination revealed diffuse enlargement and mild tenderness of the thyroid gland, and there were no palpable cervical lymph nodes. On laboratory investigation, T3 was 132.0 pg/mL, (normal range: 60 - 181 pg/mL), free thyroxine (FT4) was 1.34 ng/dL (normal range: 0.89 - 1.76 ng/dL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 0.06 µIU/L (normal range: 0.35 - 5.50 µIU/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 56 mm/h (normal range: 0 - 20 mm/h). Antithyroglobulin was 155.8 U/mL (negative < 60 U/mL), antimicrosomal antibodies were 52.7 U/mL (negative < 60 U/mL), and thyrotropin-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII) was < 1 U/L (normal range: 0 - 10 U/L).\n\n【5】US examination was carried out using a real-time scanner (Philips Healthcare IU 22, Bothell, WA, USA) equipped with a 10 MHz linear array transducer using color Doppler imaging. The thyroid US revealed a 1.2 x 0.8 cm hypoechoic, irregularly-shaped nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid which was suspicious for malignancy and ill-defined hypoechoic areas in both lobes of the thyroid, findings compatible with SAT. Color Doppler US showed slightly increased vascularity in the hypoechoic areas . An US-guided FNA of the nodule was done, and one week later, cytologic diagnosis was found to be benign. We repeated the FNA that day and the result was papillary thyroid carcinoma. Tc-99m scintigraphy showed non-visualization of both thyroid lobes and 24-hour radioactive iodine uptake was 0% , which suggested destructive thyroiditis. We started oral prednisolone 20 mg per day, and the anterior neck pain and tenderness improved within several days. Total thyroidectomy was performed with dissection of the central compartment of the neck and the nodule was confirmed to be papillary carcinoma without lymph node metastasis. Pathologic finding revealed a stony hard papillary carcinoma and the other portion of the thyroid showed some scattered foci of granulomatous thyroiditis . The patient was treated with 30mCi of adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy. Four months after discharge, she remains in stable condition.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

However, the prognosis of SAT is excellent. More than 90% of the patients with SAT recover completely, with or without treatment. SAT is diagnosed after evaluating clinical manifestations and laboratory findings including elevated ESR, abnormal thyroid function tests, and thyroid scan with radioactive iodine uptake. Our patient had anterior neck pain, elevated ESR, and non-visualization of the gland on <sup>99m </sup> Tc thyroid scan. The first reports on ultrasonographic findings in SAT were published as early as the 1970s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Several recent reports have shown that US is a useful tool for diagnosing and monitoring SAT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 10 \\]</u>. Typical gray US findings include the presence of ill-defined hypoechoic thyroid lesions without a discrete round or oval shape. Color Doppler US demonstrates no hypervascularity in the acute stage, and slightly increased vascularity is seen in the recovery stage. This suggests that US features of SAT are more useful in the acute stage. US of our patient revealed ill-defined hypoechoic areas in both lobes of the thyroid and color Doppler US showed slightly increased vascularity in the hypoechoic areas. Though our patient complained of anterior neck pain, the US findings suggested that the patient was not in the acute stage. In terms of the thyroid function tests, T3 and FT4 were normal range, which also suggests that our patient was not in the acute stage.\n\n【11】As thyroid US has become increasingly common, many incidental thyroid nodules are being detected. US features suggestive of thyroid cancer include the presence of microcalcifications, irregular margins, marked hypoechogenicity, nodule height greater than width, and evidence of invasion or regional lymphadenopathy. Many guidelines recommended FNA for such suspicious thyroid nodules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. FNA of thyroid nodules is widely used as a diagnostic method in identifying malignant lesions. However, false-negative results are reported in 1.3% to 13.6% of cases. Repeat FNA may reduce the false negativity of FNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. However, there has been continuous debate on the management of thyroid nodules with benign cytologic results. Most guidelines suggest that benign lesions may be followed annually by US only. However, Kwak et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> recommend that repeat FNA should be performed for thyroid nodules that have suspicious US features, even if the initial cytologic results are benign. Timing of repeat FNA also has been debated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. The Bethesda System recommends that thyroid nodules with an initial fine-needle aspiration (FNA) result of non-diagnostic, unsatisfactory, or atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) be re-aspirated, but no sooner than 3 months following the initial aspiration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】The US features of our patient’s nodule were suspicious for malignancy. We performed US-guided FNA and the initial cytologic results were benign. Therefore, we performed immediate repeat aspiration which revealed papillary thyroid carcinoma. Although the prognosis of thyroid carcinoma is good and the growth rate of tumors is slow, patients worry about malignancy. Therefore, it is helpful to perform early repeat aspiration in patients with US features suspicious for malignancy to obtain a prompt diagnosis.\n\n【13】The coexistence of subacute thyroiditis and papillary carcinoma is generally regarded as coincidental. Therefore, when SAT is suspected clinically and by laboratory findings, thyroid US is a useful tool for diagnosing and monitoring this disorder and it may help identify a hidden thyroid malignancy as in this case.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:44:33", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:45:58", "cost": 84.596}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:45:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:44:33"}

GPN-associated syncope has been attributed to a combination of vasodepressor and cardioinhibitory mechanisms. Such syncopal episodes tend to be debilitating and may result in injury, necessitating aggressive neuropathic pain management and, in refractory cases, insertion of a permanent pacemaker. We present a patient who sustained lower extremity fractures due to malignant syncope precipitated by GPN, necessitating the insertion of a permanent pacemaker. We review the pertinent literature with regard to the incidence, mechanism, triggers, reported complications and potential therapeutic options of this rare entity.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 64-year-old Caucasian female with hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 and dyslipidemia, presented to the emergency department (ED) after a witnessed syncopal event. Over the preceding 9 months, she experienced multiple syncopal episodes triggered by neck pain, and was diagnosed with GPN by an ENT specialist. She reported a severe, stabbing pain in the right side of her neck prior to the event. Her vital signs and physical examination were unremarkable, except for bilateral leg tenderness. Laboratory data were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, a rate of 72 beats per minute (BPM), and otherwise normal. Lower extremity X-rays revealed bilateral non-displaced fibular fractures . In the ED, she sustained another syncopal event; bradycardia with heart rates as low as 22 BPM were documented, and ECG performed promptly revealed sinus bradycardia . A temporary transvenous pacemaker was placed. She required pacing repeatedly for repeated bradycardic episodes preceded by right-sided neck pain. The episodes could be precipitated by opening her mouth, talking and application of pressure on the right side of neck. Due to the severity of the symptoms, the patient often communicated by writing on a note pad instead of talking, and also declined examination of oral cavity by physicians. She was started on carbamazepine, without complete resolution of her symptoms. Due to recurrent bradycardia with frequent neck pains, requiring temporary pacing, an MRI-compatible permanent pacemaker was placed, to allow for further MRI recommended by neurology service. At the time of her discharge from the hospital, she had a modest improvement in the severity of her neuralgic pain on an escalated dose of carbamazepine with reduction in frequency of episodes. At 8-week follow-up, she had fully recovered from her neuralgic pain and fractures, without further syncope.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

ECG following syncopal episode revealing significant sinus bradycardia. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】GPN causes paroxysmal attacks of brief stabbing pain, localized to the external ear canal, the base of the tongue, the tonsil or the area beneath the angle of the jaw, with triggers such as speaking, swallowing, eating, breathing, cold air and slight touch of the mouth and pharyngeal region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although it is mostly idiopathic without major pathology, and often caused by compression of glossopharyngeal nerve as it exits or enters the brainstem, secondary causes have been described including trauma, neoplasm, infection or vascular malformations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. GPN is rare in the general population, with an incidence rate of approximately 0.7 per 100,000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】Syncope has been reported in four out of 216 GPN cases (approximately 2%) of a Mayo case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The syncope appears to be hemodynamically mediated, with a drop in blood pressure and heart rate coinciding with the onset of pain, as demonstrated by Kim et al in a 53-year-old man admitted with recurrent syncope associated with pain from GPN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. One plausible mechanism explaining the association between bradycardia, hypotension and syncope, and GPN is the close connection between the vagus nerve and glossopharyngeal nerve with respect to visceral sensations, creating a vagoglossopharyngeal reflex arch 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Barbash et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> examined the mechanism of syncope in a patient with GPN. They reported that while atropine prevented asystole (without relieving pain), blood pressure continued to decrease due to inhibition of the sympathetic tone, with decrease in the serum norepinephrine levels during the attacks. Weinstein et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> also reported a case of GPN due to metastatic head and neck tumor with hypotension but without bradycardia. Atropine resulted in sinus tachycardia but did not abolish the hypotension, suggesting selective stimulation of baroreceptor vasodepressor activity.\n\n【9】However, pain may not always be the trigger for the syncope seen in GPN. Korkes et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> reported a 71-year-old male with sporadic syncopal episodes, who complained only of ill-characterized spasms in the throat. A loop monitor revealed 4.4 s sinus arrest with presyncope while eating; his symptoms resolved after placement of a permanent pacemaker. Reddy et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> reported another case of syncope necessitating a permanent pacemaker insertion in a patient with GPN, but without pain in the distribution of the glossopharyngeal nerve.\n\n【10】The consequences of GPN-induced syncope vary. Our patient sustained bilateral fibular fractures due to an episode of GPN-induced malignant syncope. She also had stopped communicating verbally due to induction of pain while talking, and these symptoms were relieved with carbamazepine at 8-week follow-up. GPN patients may avoid eating, out of fear of chewing-induced pain and syncopal attacks, which can lead to weight loss. Odeh and Oliven 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> reported a 50-year-old woman who lost 6 kg in 2 weeks because she refused to eat and drink, following 3 months of episodic pain in the left side of her throat precipitated by swallowing, which gradually progressed to loss of consciousness several times a day. Therapy with carbamezepine abolished the pain and syncope, and allowed restoration of her weight over 12 months. GPN-induced syncope may expose the patient to risk of automobile accidents, as in the report by Dunn et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> of a 60-year-old male with multiple episodes of syncope from GPN, refractory to medical therapy. While the patient was driving to the nearest ED, after having experienced six syncopal episodes in 1 day, he developed another episode and had just enough time to pull off to the side of the road before losing consciousness. Bodily injury can also be a complication of GPN-induced syncope, as in our patient. Elias et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u> reported an 80-year-old white male with GPN who sustained head trauma and right maxillary sinus fracture following a syncopal episode triggered by lancinating pain in the pharynx. Seizures have also been reported in patients with GPN-induced syncope, likely due to the transient hemodynamic compromise and decrease in cerebrovascular perfusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\- 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Therapy for GPN-induced syncope varies among reports. In some reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u> treatment with carbamazepine abolished the pain and associated cardiovascular manifestations. However, in other cases, treatment with carbamazepine alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>, carbamazepine and gabapentin combination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u> or clonazepam 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u> was not sufficient to alleviate the pain and syncopal episodes in GPN, necessitating the insertion of a permanent pacemaker to prevent syncope. Other successful treatments of refractory cases included section of the ninth (glossopharyngeal) nerve alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 24 \\]</u>, or combined with rhizotomy and microvascular decompression of the lower cranial nerves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Our patient’s syncope resulted in severe bodily injury causing lower extremity fractures. MRI of the head and neck was recommended by neurology service. However, since the presence of temporary myocardial pacing leads is considered a safety contraindication for MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>, it was deemed unsafe for her to undergo MRI testing due to her dependence on temporary pacing. Therefore, the permanent pacemaker brand inserted was REVO (Medtronic), which is compatible with 1.5-Tesla MRI scanners 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. She later was discharged in good condition, and was scheduled to undergo an outpatient MRI for further evaluation.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】In conclusion, GPN is a rare, but serious cause of cardiac syncope, which is associated with a well-defined presentation. It is paroxysmal, but episodes can be frequent enough to result in bodily injury. Treatment may address pharmacologic or surgical pain relief, versus addition of a pacemaker in refractory cases to prevent episodic asystole. Insertion of a novel MRI-safe pacemaker allows for safe future use of MRI for further workup when indicated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:48:47", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:48:59", "cost": 11.268}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:48:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:48:38"}

On the other hand, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined MAC as a carcinoma confirmed by > 50% of extracellular mucin pools that contain malignant epithelial or individual tumor cells including SRCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. SRCC mainly occurs on the right side of the colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The main differential diagnosis is metastatic gastric carcinoma with SRCC, and it is necessary to rule out this diagnosis by endoscopy before finalizing a diagnosis of primary colorectal SRCC. SRCC is associated with poor prognosis. Despite the rarity of SRCC, it is more frequently associated with patients with ulcerative colitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Herein, we present a rare case of metastatic signet cell carcinoma of the colon in a young patient with ulcerative colitis.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】The patient was a 27-year-old African American man with past medical history of ulcerative colitis diagnosed 2 years prior to this presentation, on mesalamine. Patient presented to the emergency department with the complaints of generalized body aches, weakness, chest discomfort for 3 weeks, and palpitations with mild exertional dyspnea for 3 days. He had few episodes of bloody diarrhea 2 days prior to this presentation. He did not have jaundice, fever, nausea or vomiting, hematemesis or h/o recent weight loss. Vital signs showed blood pressure (BP) of 90/62 mm Hg, heart rate of 109 beats/min, sinus tach, temperature of 36.4 °C, respiratory rate (RR) of 16 breaths per minute and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. Other physical examination was unremarkable except for generalized and conjunctival pallor. Initial laboratory investigation revealed serum potassium 2.8 (3.5 - 5.2 mmol/L), serum creatinine 1.11 (0.44 - 1.0 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 640 (38 - 126 IU/L), elevated lactic acid 8 (0.5 - 2.0 mmol/dL), severe anemia hemoglobin of 2 (12 - 17.5), aspartate transaminase (AST) 87 (10 - 42 IU/L) and alanine transaminase (ALT) 85 (10 - 60 IU/L). Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with intravenous (IV) contrast showed distention of the colon containing air-fluid levels and loss of haustra. Clostridium difficile PCR test was positive. Diagnosis of toxic megacolon was due to C. difficile infection and CT scan findings. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. He received a total of four units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). He was started on oral vancomycin and IV fluids. On the following day, the patient symptomatically improved with resolution of leukocytosis and lactic acidosis. Liver ultrasound was normal. On the fourth day of admission, the patient complained of abdominal pain and fever. Repeat labs showed leukocytosis and elevated lactate 3.5 reference value (0.5 - 2.0 mmol/dL). A diagnosis of refractory ulcerative colitis failing medical treatment was made. The patient underwent subtotal colectomy and ileostomy with Hartmann pouch and a small bowel resection. Surgical pathology of the subtotal colectomy showed severe ulcerative colitis. There was a multifocal high-grade glandular dysplasia arising from the inflammatory background in the transverse colon . A 15-mm focus of invasive signet ring cell adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated in the transverse colon stage invading subserosa and involving two of 45 pericolic lymph nodes arising from a background of ulcerative colitis was reported . Metastatic signet cell carcinoma of the stomach was ruled out based on a normal endoscopy that the patient had 2 months prior to this presentation as a workup for iron deficiency anemia. The patient had a port inserted and was started on adjuvant chemotherapy oxaliplatin, leucovorin and 5-flurouracil as an outpatient by his oncologist. Patient is undergoing 12 rounds of chemotherapy. He is currently in round 8 without complications. Patient is scheduled for screening colonoscopy and reversal of colostomy upon completion of chemotherapy.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

In the USA, annually, approximately 145,600 new cases of large bowel cancer are diagnosed, of which 101,420 are colon and the remainder are rectal cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Annually, approximately 50,630 Americans die of CRC, accounting for approximately 8% of all cancer deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. More than 90% of CRC cases are adenocarcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>; however, several histological variants have been distinguished such as mucinous, signet ring cell, medullary, adenosquamous, micropapillary, spindle cell and undifferentiated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Signet cell carcinoma is a subtype of colon cancer. The name SRCC is a descriptive term describing a carcinoma cell retaining abundant intracytoplasmic mucin that causes the nucleus to be pushed to the periphery of the cell. In affected sites, the tumor infiltrates the entire wall, therefore results in a rigid and contracted structure called the linitis plastica 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The majority of these tumors arise in the stomach. However, it was also described in breast, lung, bladder, pancreas, gallbladder and the colon. It is a rare tumor comprising less than 1% of all CRC cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. SRCC is predominant in males with a ratio of 2:1. Belli et al reported the most common location is the right side of the colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient is a young man and had the tumor on the transverse colon. These tumors can be classified into either MAC with signet cell (a subtype of MAC) or SRCC. WHO definition of SRCC is carcinoma confirmed by > 50% of SRCC but states that SRCC can occur within the pools of MAC or in a diffusely infiltrative process with minimal extracellular mucin in a linitis plastica pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Luis et al described in his retrospective study that 68.7% of SRCC cases occur in the right colon, 9.4% in the transverse and 21.9% in the left colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Our patient had the tumor on the transverse colon. Of the patients, 43.7% present with metastasis, whereas 64.3% of cases metastasize to the peritoneum, 46.5% present with lymph node metastasis (LNM) (mean of 14.3 positive lymph nodes), 62.5% with lymphovascular invasion and 25% with perineural invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, in the same study when SRCC was compared to MAC with signet cell, SRCC showed some distinctive characteristics. Patients presented a decade later (65 versus 56.5 years in comparison to MAC) as well as, in a higher clinical stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】The pathogenesis of colorectal SRCC has not been fully understood yet. Tendon et al reported adenoma to carcinoma sequence for colorectal SRCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. However, it is believed that SRCC may have a different mode of pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Hartman et al reported that precursor adenomatous lesions were more frequently observed in mucin-rich SRCC, and not in mucin-poor SRCCs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. There is an association between ulcerative colitis and SRCC. Colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC) leads to development of cancer through a different carcinogenic pathway known as the inflammation-metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence with earlier identified molecular changes in TP531 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Genetically, microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of heterozygosity are present in SRCCs, similar to Lynch-associated tumors. Together they represent about 30% of tumors with these genetic features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The impact of MSI on survival in colorectal SRCC has not been confirmed to have a prognostic value on survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. It is most likely due to small size of previous studies. Further research is required to confirm or reject this hypothesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In our patient DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein analysis was performed. Analyses for MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS2 were all normal. Mutations in the ras gene family (K-ras, H-ras and N-ras) are found in about 50% of CRCs. Ninety-five percent of ras mutations are identified at k-ras gene, with 80% at codon 12 and 15% at codon 13 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. There are limited data in the literature on ras gene mutations in colorectal SRCC.\n\n【10】Colitis-associated signet cell carcinoma in situ is associated with alterations of TP53 and CDH1 genes, resulting in a low expression of E-cadherin protein which impairs cell-cell adherence junctions and cell-proliferation signaling pathways. E-cadherin promoter methylation, the downregulation of E-cadherin expression, and aneuploidy have been frequently observed in ulcerative colitis-associated dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Our patient’s SRCC cells showed positive staining for CK20 and CDX2, and negative staining for CK7. MUC2 is negative and MUC5AC is positive in 41.7% of the cases. In our patient, intracytoplasmic mucin was positive for mucicarmine stain. MACs of the predominant signet ring cell type had the worst overall survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. A high proportion of extracellular mucin and signet ring cell morphology in the non-mucinous component is also associated with poor overall survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Other negative prognostic factors include age older than 65 years, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), advanced stage and an absence of MSI.\n\n【12】The main differential diagnosis is a metastatic gastric carcinoma with SRCC, and it is necessary to rule out this diagnosis before finalizing a diagnosis of primary colorectal SRCC. It is difficult to differentiate between the two tumors based on immunohistochemical staining because one half to two-thirds of gastric SRCCs express MUC2, MUC5AC, CK20 and CK7; 90% are CDX2-positive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Our patient had an endoscopy done beforehand to assess microcytic anemia and it was negative for any pathology. Studies have shown that SRCCs of the colorectum respond poorly to current cytotoxic treatments and have lower rates of curative resection and poorer outcome so that new approaches are needed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. However, our patient is receiving 12 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy oxaliplatin, leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil with complete remission. Surgical management has a key role in the treatment of localized tumors. The impact of curative surgery on survival in metastatic CRC is well established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. However, this option is limited to liver and lung metastasis and there are no data regarding the influence of the histology on the outcome after surgery in this setting. Furthermore, SRCC patients more often develop peritoneal and ovarian metastases, which are less relevant for curative surgery. Niek Hugen et al reported that stage III patients with colon SRCC who were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy had better survival than patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-year relative survival of 52% versus 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. However, in spite of the results of this study, the evidence base for adjuvant chemotherapy is unclear because of the lack of randomized controlled studies.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】SRCC of the colorectum is very rare, comprising between < 1% and 2.4% cases of CRCs. It occurs mainly on the right colon and present on later stages. It is associated with ulcerative colitis. Sometime presentation of this rare tumor might get complicated by other infection and associated comorbidities. So, clinicians should consider this diagnosis in appropriate clinical scenario. Due to the rarity of the disease, no conclusive guidelines exist for the treatment of this type of tumors.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank Chunwei, Ma (Liberian at Jersey Shore University Medical Center for the help providing us with other case reports of signet ring cell carcinoma to compare it to our case.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Each author has individually been involved and participated in drafting the manuscript and revising it critically for important intellectual content and has given final approval of the version to be published.

One type of small-vessel vasculitis affects the entire body and was originally known as Churg-Strauss syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> but underwent a name change to eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) after its classification at the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference in 2012 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In the Japanese population, EGPA has a prevalence of 1.78 per 100,000, is usually observed in those aged 30 - 60 years, and has a male-to-female ratio of 1:2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. EGPA causes necrotizing vasculitis and granulomatous inflammation and is composed of three phases: 1) a prodromal stage characterized by allergic conditions such as bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis; 2) a period in which the number of peripheral eosinophils increases markedly, and local infiltration such as eosinophilic pneumonia is observed; and 3) a period during which symptoms of multi-organ vasculitis appear. However, it is important to note that the clinical presentation of EGPA may not always strictly follow this triphasic pattern. Furthermore, the extent of vasculitis involvement may vary, ranging from multifocal to organ-limited manifestations. The heterogeneous nature of EGPA underscores the complexity of its pathogenesis and the challenges in its diagnosis and management. EGPA is classified using the American College of Rheumatology criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. It is important to note that unlike diagnostic criteria, classification criteria are intended to provide a standardized framework for research and clinical studies rather than strict guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of individual patients.\n\n【2】Recent studies have provided valuable insights into the pathophysiology of EGPA and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. Notably, research by Haruki et al in 2022 visualized the dynamic behavior of eosinophils in EGPA, highlighting their role in the disease process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. They also elucidated the contribution of neutrophil-associated vascular damage in ANCA-associated vasculitis, further enriching our understanding of these complex conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Incorporating these recent findings into our understanding, this report aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge regarding the clinical and immunological features of EGPA.\n\n【3】Here we report a case in which specific changes in PR3-ANCA and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA were involved in the development of EGPA. The case may help shed light on the serologies involved. Changes in ANCA are deeply involved in the pathology of EGPA.\n\n【4】The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of The Nihon University Hospital (approval number RK130412-19). Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】Investigations\n\n【7】An 81-year-old man complained of fever and dyspnea. He had a history of allergic rhinitis and had undergone surgery for sinusitis at the age of 20 years. Despite recurrent symptoms of sinusitis, he had not sought further treatment. He had developed asthma in adulthood, but the symptoms were stable and did not require treatment. He also had lumbar spinal stenosis, prostatic hyperplasia, sinusitis, hypertension, hypothyroidism, iron deficiency anemia, angina, and chronic heart failure. He reported no drug or food allergies. His medications included diltiazem 100 mg/day, neurotropin 16 U/day, mecobalamin 1.5 mg/day, mirabegron 50 mg/day, pregabalin 50 mg/day, teprenone 150 mg/day, iron supplementation of 105 mg/day, and febuxostat 10 mg/day (the initial treatment regimen for gout in Japan). At the time of the third admission, a blood test had shown elevated C-reactive protein and eosinophil levels and a positive PR3-ANCA result. The authors examined ANCA using the chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay method, with the reference values for both PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA being below 3.5 U/mL. In terms of cardiac markers, the N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level was mildly elevated at 251 ng/L. However, cardiac ultrasound did not reveal any evidence of heart failure. Ground-glass opacities were observed on chest computed tomography (CT). However, 2 weeks prior to the present admission, fever, left precordial pain, and dyspnea were noted, and the patient was hospitalized for further examination and treatment of suspected pneumonia and heart failure.\n\n【8】The patient’s height was 160 cm, his bodyweight was 69 kg, and his body mass index was 26.9. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 115/60 mm Hg, heart rate 62 bpm, respiratory rate 21 bpm, body temperature 36.9 °C, and oxygen saturation 94% (nasal tube 3 L/min). Chest auscultation revealed coarse crackles in the lower left lung field and no signs of wheeze or a heart murmur. His abdomen was flat and non-tender. There was no lower leg edema; however, a rash was observed on the lower extremities. There were no neurological findings.\n\n【9】A transition of ANCA serologies occurred during these two hospitalizations. At the first hospital admission, PR3-ANCA was positive; however, during outpatient follow-up, PR3-ANCA became negative and MPO-ANCA turned positive. After 9 months, there was worsening of the ground-glass opacities on chest CT, and PR3-ANCA turned positive again. Three months after the MPO-ANCA and PR3-ANCA became positive, the patient was hospitalized a further time.\n\n【10】Diagnosis\n\n【11】Laboratory data were collected and are summarized in Table 1 . Hematological findings included an increased eosinophil count (435/µL) and decreased renal function (aspartate transaminase 49 IU/L, creatinine 1.38 mg/dL). The N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and Krebs von den Lungen-6 levels were within the reference range, and there were no other findings suggestive of systemic autoimmune disease. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus grew on sputum culture. Subsequently, his C-reactive protein levels decreased steadily. Nevertheless, the two ANCA serologies and eosinophil counts increased, the pleural effusion did not improve, and his symptoms worsened. Thoracocentesis was performed; the pleural effusion was exudative with lymphocytes. The number of eosinophils increased significantly to 5,635/µL, and both types of ANCA increased. The patient met Lanham’s criteria and was diagnosed with EGPA.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Summary of Laboratory Findings |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【13】The urinalysis findings were normal. The immunoserologic test results suggested systemic autoimmune disease and were negative for procalcitonin, β-D glucan, Aspergillus antigen, Mycoplasma antibody, urine Legionella antibody, and influenza A/B antigen. The arterial blood gas test was performed with O <sub>2 </sub> at 3 L/min and revealed a pH of 7.443, PaO <sub>2 </sub> of 51.9 mm Hg, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> of 31.4 mm Hg, HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>- </sup> of 21.2 mEq/L, and SaO <sub>2 </sub> of 87.2%. P. aeruginosa and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were detected in the sputum.\n\n【14】On admission, radiographs revealed right middle and lower lung interlobar infiltrates, a dull right costophrenic angle, and a light shadow in the left middle and lower lung fields. Interlobar thickening and pleural effusion were seen . A biopsy was performed of the skin lesions, including ulcerative lesions, erythema, and purpura on the front of the left ankle joint. Pathology revealed edematous blood vessel walls with lymphocytic and histiocytic infiltration as well as fibrinoid necrosis around the blood vessels; these findings are consistent with vasculitis, absence of eosinophilic infiltration .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Although the possibility of drug-induced eosinophilia cannot be ruled out, the drug was frequently used for a long time and there were no problems even after continued use, so it was excluded as the cause. He was started on prednisolone 30 mg/day. Immediately thereafter, his eosinophil count reduced to 0, his ANCA levels declined, and his symptoms improved. No relapse was observed even when the dose of prednisolone was gradually reduced to 17.5 mg/day; he was discharged 53 days after admission .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 2. Clinical Course |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【20】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【21】After discharge, the patient was treated on an outpatient basis while weaning the dosage of steroids. His progress was favorable. In view of the patient’s advanced age and the fact that his condition was well controlled with low-dose steroids alone, we opted to add mepolizumab, which has fewer adverse effects, to his treatment regimen. This decision was made in view of the patient’s age and the desire to minimize the potential risk of adverse events. The patient’s Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, which was 15 points at the time of admission, had decreased to 0 points by the time of discharge, and he was reported to be in good condition.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Our patient’s PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA showed changes over time that are hitherto unique. His hospitalizations were associated with acute respiratory failure following infection, followed by increased eosinophil counts. However, imaging findings at the time of the second admission showed a change in the ground-glass opacities, and pleural effusion was noted. Antimicrobial treatment increased the number of eosinophils and exacerbated the pleural effusion (which was exudative, and pleural eosinophil counts were increased at the time of exacerbation). Corticosteroids markedly improved the pleural effusion, ground-glass opacities, and eosinophilia.\n\n【24】It has previously been reported that 2% of patients with vasculitis show changes in PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA, as observed in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The ANCA test was consistently measured in the same way in our patient. A search of our hospital records for the most recent 5 years identified only two cases of EGPA, and there was no association of ANCA with disease activity. However, it is generally known that there is a relationship between the disease activity of ANCA and EGPA, and ANCA-positive cases with an increase in the number of eosinophils are the most common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. There have been no reports of the MPO-ANCA subtype reversing, as in our patient.\n\n【25】More than 10 subtypes of ANCA have been identified. Hyperactivation of neutrophils by ANCA is thought to involve bacterial infection and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Different types of ANCA may be positive, as in our case. Moreover, it is possible that another type of ANCA (e.g. bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein-ANCA, which is triggered by P. aeruginosa infection) may be positive on indirect immunofluorescence.\n\n【26】Our patient’s ANCA levels may have decreased before hospitalization because a bacterial infection occurred, causing ANCA to decrease and eosinophil counts to rise. However, when an infection is most active, neutrophils predominate and EGPA is masked. Considering that the ANCA levels decreased, it is possible that the infection subsided and EGPA-related inflammation was reactivated. The PR3 could have been a false positive, but there was a correlation with the transition of symptoms. It is unclear whether PR3 affected the symptoms.\n\n【27】Approximately 30-40% of cases of EGPA are MPO-ANCA-positive and 55-65% are ANCA-negative. The heart is the organ most frequently damaged by vasculitis in EGPA, and the prognosis is said to be poor. Furthermore, 30-45% of patients with EGPA-induced heart damage are ANCA-negative, and thrombosis is attributed to eosinophilic cardiomyopathy and intimal damage in these cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In our patient, ultrasound was the only cardiac examination performed, and although there is little evidence that EGPA was the cause of his heart failure, this possibility cannot be excluded.\n\n【28】Possible mechanisms for a change in ANCA subtype include abnormalities in the immune system. First, production of ANCA involves immune cells, such as B cells and T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, dysfunction of which may lead to changes in the amount or types of ANCA produced. Second, expression of genes that affect production of ANCA could be regulated by epigenetic changes. For example, changes in DNA methylation may be involved in changes in subtype of ANCA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Third, production of ANCA can be affected by environmental factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. For example, smoking is known to promote production of MPO-ANCA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Hypothyroidism can also cause a positive ANCA. Finally, ANCA may have a high affinity for specific antigens, which is determined by the binding affinity of immunoglobulin. Changes in this affinity may result in changes in the ANCA subtype. These mechanisms are being investigated to further our understanding of changes in ANCA subtype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Within the spectrum of vasculitic disorders, the co-occurrence of ANCA and specific autoantibodies associated with distinct vascular components has garnered attention for its potential immunopathogenic significance. While initially observed in disorders like Goodpasture’s disease, where renal and pulmonary involvement is driven by anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, the phenomenon of dual positivity for ANCA and other antibodies has broader implications. This phenomenon challenges the conventional boundaries of antibody specificity, suggesting a more intricate interplay between the different antibody types.\n\n【30】Furthermore, the dynamic nature of antibody profiles extends beyond dual positivity, with shifts in antibody dominance or subtype having been noted over time. This evolving pattern prompts inquiry into the evolving pathogenesis of vasculitic disorders and the potential clinical significance of such shifts. The observed duality and changes in antibody responses raise questions about shared immunopathogenic pathways, potential crosstalk between different antibody-producing cell populations, and the possible influence of one antibody type on the production or response of another.\n\n【31】While initial exploration has focused on Goodpasture’s disease and its dual positivity, this pattern may extend to other vasculitic conditions. Investigating the presence and shifts of multiple antibodies in vasculitic disorders can afford insights into complex immune interactions and the resulting clinical ramifications. In summary, the emerging landscape of dual positivity and antibody changes presents a compelling avenue for future research to unravel the intricate network of immune responses underlying the pathogenesis of vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】The patient’s Five-Factor Score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u> was as follows. High age over 65: the patient’s age was 81 years, meeting this criterion (score 1). Renal insufficiency: information on the patient’s creatinine level was not provided, so it could not be determined if this criterion was met (score 0). Cardiac insufficiency: the patient had a history of angina and chronic heart failure, indicating cardiac involvement (score 1). Severe gastrointestinal involvement: there was no mention of specific gastrointestinal complications such as bowel perforation, bleeding, or pancreatitis in the case report (score 0). Ear, nose, and throat involvement: clinical symptoms consistent with EGPA involving the ear, nose, and throat were confirmed by physical examination and CT (score 1). Based on the definitions and information provided, this patient would have a Five-Factor Score of 3.\n\n【33】EGPA has a high relapse rate. However, we did not use immunosuppressive therapy in our patient because of his advanced age and the possibility of adverse events. After administration of mepolizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>, there was no increase in the eosinophil count, even after steroid tapering, and there has been no relapse of symptoms in the year since discharge from hospital. Furthermore, the pleural effusions that persisted from the time of hospital admission through to outpatient follow-up improved after starting mepolizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Learning point\n\n【35】This case underscores the significance of monitoring ANCA profiles during the course of EGPA. Shifts from one ANCA serotype to another can influence disease classification and treatment decisions. The complex dynamics of ANCA emphasize the need for multidisciplinary assessments and a comprehensive approach to diagnosis. Our case also highlights the challenges in distinguishing EGPA from other conditions with eosinophilic manifestations. Atypical presentations, like the transition from PR3-ANCA to MPO-ANCA positivity in this patient, emphasize the importance of broader clinical evaluation. The implications of ANCA fluctuations in terms of treatment strategies should not be overlooked. Our case exemplifies how changes in ANCA profile can prompt adjustments in therapeutic decisions, such as considering targeted biologic agents like mepolizumab.\n\n【36】Conclusion\n\n【37】We have encountered a case in which specific changes in PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA were involved in the development of EGPA. EGPA is characterized by genetically and clinically different phenotypes. Usually, only one type of ANCA is followed when observing the course of ANCA-associated vasculitis. This is the first report of a case in which changes occurred in a different subtype of ANCA. The case may provide clues regarding the pathology of EGPA and help to establish biomarkers of this disease.\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to express their gratitude to the patient who allowed us to report his case.

NTM infections exhibit a wide geographical variation worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 4 \\]</u>. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is the most reported species causing pulmonary disease globally, followed variably by Mycobacterium kansasii ( M. kansasii ), Mycobacterium xenopi ( M. xenopi ), and other NTM, largely depending on geographic location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. M. xenopi is the second most pathogen of pulmonary NTM infections in Canada, southwest Europe, and UK 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, while M. kansasii is only behind MAC as an isolated organism of non-tuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) in the USA, predominately Southwest and Midwest regions of the USA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.

NTM infections are universally not contagious 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】The majority of NTM-PD were reported in hosts with underlying lung diseases, mostly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and prior mycobacterial tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Despite immune deficiency being considered a risk factor for NTM lung infections, immunocompromised patients comprise only a small population of those with pulmonary disease, in contrast to typical mycobacterial tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The clinical features of NTM lung disease are variable and usually mimic the symptoms of pre-existing lung diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】The diagnosis of NTM-PD is challenging, partly because of the nonspecific nature of their clinical features and radiological characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 6 \\]</u>. The diagnosis typically requires specific microbiological criteria in the presence of pulmonary symptoms and suggestive radiological findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 6 \\]</u>.

The infections were caused by M. xenopi in two patients and MAC in the third patient. The NTM-PD masqueraded clinically and radiologically as lung malignancy, which posed a diagnostic dilemma. The current literature reporting on the epidemiology, clinical and radiological features, diagnosis, and management of NTM-PD is briefly reviewed in this communication.\n\n【5】Case Reports\n\n【6】Case 1\n\n【7】Investigations\n\n【8】A 67-year-old male with a past medical history of heavy smoking (a 55-pack-year), emphysema, and occupational asbestos exposure, presented initially to the pulmonary outpatient clinic for abnormal findings on a low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan for lung cancer screening. The patient was asymptomatic, and the physical exam was only notable for a hyperinflated chest wall with decreased breath sounds bilaterally. The low-dose chest CT scan showed diffuse emphysema with large bulla/cavities most significantly in the upper lobes and bilateral small lung nodules. A follow-up CT was recommended within 3 months for close monitoring of the nodular lesions, but the patient lost to follow-up. After 2 years, the patient presented to the pulmonary clinic with exertional shortness of breath and a productive cough for several weeks. The patient’s symptoms only partially improved with courses of oral antibiotic therapy and bronchodilator inhalers. A CT scan of the chest redemonstrated a similar appearance of severe emphysema and thick-walled apical bullae with an interval progression in the number and size of left-sided pulmonary nodules . Positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrated only a hyper-metabolic uptake in the prostate region. He was referred to the urology service, and further workup ruled out prostate cancer. The patient’s complaints continued to progress despite regular compliance with the prescribed inhalers, and he lost significant weight over 3 months’ time.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Other lung pathologies were fairly stable. Sputum Gram stain and culture were negative for any growth. Urine antigens for fungal pathogens were unrevealing. Serial expectorant morning sputum samples were positive for many acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and cultures grew M. xenopi , which was further identified by the direct matrix-associated laser desorption (MALDI) technique. Sputum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ) and MAC. A diagnosis of an atypical mycobacterial infection with M. xenopi was made based on a combination of a suggestive clinical history with possible radiological findings and confirmatory microbiology.\n\n【12】Treatment\n\n【13】The patient commenced triple therapy comprising a multi-drug regimen of rifampin, ethambutol, and azithromycin after the diagnosis was made.\n\n【14】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【15】The patient’s symptoms started to gradually improve with the triple therapy and a repeat CT chest revealed an interval reduction in the size of the left upper lobe lesion.\n\n【16】Case 2\n\n【17】Investigations\n\n【18】A 73-year-old female with a medical history significant for heavy smoking (a 25-pack-year), daily marijuana use, long-standing COPD with bullous emphysema, and prior unprovoked pulmonary embolism on anticoagulation, presented to the pulmonary outpatient clinic with increasing tiredness and worsening productive cough for a few months. The patient endorsed regular compliance with her medications, but she admitted to continuing active smoking. Notably, the patient has a history of cavitary and nodular lung disease under yearly surveillance. Her last PET scan 7 years prior to her index presentation was concerning for abnormal hyper-metabolic uptake in an upper right lobe cavitary lesion. Subsequently, she underwent endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) which ruled a neoplastic process but revealed a non-caseating granuloma. Extensive infectious workup at that time (i.e. AFB stains, and serial cultures of the sputum, bronchial lavage, and lung biopsy) did not yield any infectious culprit for the granulomatous pathology, particularly, mycobacterial, and fungal etiologies. The patient remained relatively asymptomatic for the interval 6-year period with fairly stable cavitary and nodular lesions appearances over the serial scans. The physical examination revealed a low body mass index (BMI) of 16.5, which was significantly reduced from the prior visit 1 year ago. The respiratory examination showed reduced breathing sounds bilaterally with diffuse expiratory wheezes. An acute exacerbation of COPD was suspected, and she was commenced on an albuterol inhaler, a short course of prednisone, and oral antibiotics. However, the patient’s symptoms were not adequately controlled.\n\n【19】Diagnosis\n\n【20】A CT chest demonstrated an interval significant progression of the right upper lobe cavity lesion (3.2 × 1.7 cm)  from the prior exam (1.1 × 0.8 cm) which was nearly 1 year ago . The bilateral nodular lesions and advanced emphysematous bullous disease were relatively unchanged. A PET scan depicted no significant hyper-metabolic activity in the right upper cavitary lesion at this time. An interdisciplinary review of the serial CT images suggested a possibility of a chronic infectious process given the low metabolic activity of the lesion. Nevertheless, the possibility of lung malignancy remained a concern considering the patient’s high-risk status and the patient has been counseled about further invasive workup if needed. Sputum cultures grew M. xenopi , which was identified by the MALDI technique. Sputum PCR was negative for M. tuberculosis and MAC.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

He also reported a chronic cough and intermittent sputum production. The patient was discharged from our hospital 2 days prior to his index presentation following a short-coursed admission with an acute exacerbation of COPD due to coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infection. The patient had no increase in supplemental oxygen requirement at that admission. The patient improved with supportive management with analgesics, albuterol nebulizers, dexamethasone, and COVID-directed therapy (remdesivir). Notably, the patient had several admissions to the medical floor with acute flare-ups of COPD in the past few months. The patient is originally from Iraq and immigrated to the USA 10 years ago, but he denied any recent traveling outside the USA. Initial evaluation revealed a frail and underweight elderly patient (BMI of 16.5) with signs of acute respiratory distress. He was afebrile with sinus tachycardia (heart rate of 110 beats per minute), tachypnea (respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute), and stable blood pressure. The lung examination was significant for decreased breathing sounds bilaterally and mild diffuse expiratory wheezing.\n\n【29】Diagnosis\n\n【30】Chest X-ray (CXR) showed stable reticulonodular and emphysematous changes with a volume loss in the left upper lung from scarring . CT chest demonstrated diffuse random-sized nodules with an ill-defined cavitary lesion in the posterior aspect of the left upper lobe, extending inferiorly into a more solid component along the pleura, which was seen in a previous CT chest that was performed 1 month ago . Further review of prior images revealed that the cavitary lesion was visualized 1.5 years ago on imaging performed at an outside hospital to rule out pulmonary embolism, but it has progressed in size during the index imaging. The patient was started on empirical cefepime and vancomycin, nebulizer, and dexamethasone for possible worsening bronchiectasis. An infectious workup revealed positive sputum for Pseudomonas aeruginosa , but serial blood cultures remained negative. Urine antigens for histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis were also negative. Consecutive sputum cultures grew many AFB, which was identified as MAC. Sputum PCR was negative for M. tuberculosis .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

The parenteral antibiotic therapy was transitioned to levofloxacin upon discharge to complete a 4-week course.\n\n【34】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【35】The patient continued MAC therapy with close follow-up with pulmonary and infectious disease services.\n\n【36】Discussion\n\n【37】The exact incidence of NTM-PD in the USA is not precisely known, as the disease is not mandatory reportable in most states 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】There are four distinct clinical syndromes described with various NTM species in humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>; pulmonary disease, especially in elderly patients with chronic lung disease, is caused primarily by MAC, both globally and in the USA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 7 \\]</u>, followed by M. kansasii , particularly in midwestern regions of the USA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Less common species include M. xenopi , which is more prevalent in Canada, southwest Europe, and the UK 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Superficial lymphadenitis, commonly cervical lymphadenitis in the pediatric population, is largely caused by MAC and Mycobacterium scrofulaceum ( M. scrofulaceum ) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Mycobacterium marinum ( M. marinum ) and Mycobacterium ulcerans ( M. ulcerans ) are the principal pathogens for skin and soft tissue infections that are acquired through direct inoculation, and they may also cause surgical site infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The disseminated disease is typically noted in severely immunocompromised patients (mostly caused by MAC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】Our case series demonstrated NTM-PD in three elderly patients with COPD and significant smoking history, consistent with the literature reported above 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 , 7 , 9 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, M. xenopi was isolated in two out of three patients in this series, a finding that is not much in keeping with the epidemiological pattern of NTM-PD in the midwestern USA, where those patients were diagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The reported patients had no history of recent traveling to regions where M. xenopi is more prevalent.\n\n【40】The clinical presentation of MAC and M. xenopi lung disease of our patients is similar to those in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. The symptoms of NTM lung diseases are nonspecific (i.e. dry or productive cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and occasionally hemoptysis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 9 \\]</u>. They closely resemble the symptoms of the underlying lung disease, thus making clinical suspicion quite difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【41】The clinical course of MAC is generally less progressive compared to mycobacterial tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Extensive lung parenchymal destruction is often evident at the time of MAC diagnosis, partly because of the indolent nature of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Disseminated disease is usually associated with severe cell-mediated immunity deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. A less frequent variant of MAC lung disease is notably reported in older women without prior overt lung disease or smoking history, which is characterized by a right middle lobe or lingular infiltrate; referred to as the Lady Windermere syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The least common MAC variant is described in relatively younger immunocompetent hosts with significant exposure to hot tubs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The latter variant is considered a hypersensitivity pneumonitis-like reaction to aerosolized MAC from hot tubs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【42】M. xenopi is a low-virulent NTM that emerged as an opportunistic pathogen for pulmonary disease and less commonly extrapulmonary infections (mostly osteoarticular infections) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. A comprehensive review of 136 cases of M. xenopi lung disease from a single tertiary center in France described three disease patterns; cavitary disease in patients with chronic lung disease, mostly COPD (as observed in our reported patients), acute infiltrates in immunocompromised hosts, and rarely solitary nodular disease in immunocompetent patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【43】A retrospective study of 74 patients from a single institution in Canada by Carrillo et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> compared the radiological characteristics of the lung disease caused by MAC and M. xenopi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The study noted that patients with M. xenopi were relatively younger and more often had advanced emphysema and lung malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. MAC patients mostly had a nodular bronchiectatic pattern, followed by a cavitary pattern (which was noted in our MAC patient) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. While the cavitary pattern tended to predominately occur in M. xenopi infection, the majority of patients had variable patterns of random nodules, consolidation, bronchiectasis, tree-in-bud appearance, and ground-glass opacities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, these imaging patterns were not statistically significant and were neither pathognomonic for MAC nor M. xenopi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The cavitation process of M. xenopi typically involves the upper lobes, as observed in the second patient with M. xenopi infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【44】Interestingly, M. xenopi infection was reportedly associated with lung malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. This suggested association was postulated by scar tissues that may potentially undergo a malignant transformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 14 \\]</u>. Heavy smoking, as a risk factor for lung cancer, is also prevalent among M. xenopi patients, which is an observation that may partly explain the coincidence of M. xenopi and malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. In the review of Carrillo et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, about one-fourth (25%) of patients with M. xenopi had prior or concurrent lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The concern of lung malignancy was evident in our M. xenopi patients, considering their suggestive clinical history and the suspicious radiological findings on initial presentation. A similar case reported by Fogla et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> described an elderly, heavy-smoker, male patient who had an upper lobe cavitary lesion on imaging. Percutaneous needle biopsy and bronchial lavage did not yield neoplastic cells but necrotic tissues. The patient underwent a wedge resection because of a high malignancy suspicion; histology demonstrated caseating granulomas with positive AFP, and further molecular studies with 16S RNA confirmed M. xenopi infection and ruled out typical tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, the small possibility of concurrent lung cancer cannot be entirely ruled out in our presented patients.\n\n【45】Microbiological confirmation remains the gold standard to diagnose NTM-PD, as their clinical course and radiological findings greatly mimic typical mycobacterial, fungal, and neoplastic lung diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 8 \\]</u>. Specific diagnostic criteria were established by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These criteria require at least two positive expectorated sputum cultures, a positive sputum culture from a bronchial wash or lavage, and a lung biopsy with histologic findings of mycobacterial infection (granulomatous inflammation or AFB) in the presence of a positive NTM culture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【46】Nevertheless, positive sputum results should be interpreted cautiously as these NTM have variable virulence, therefore, they can be only transiently recovered from the respiratory tract without causing a progressive infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In addition, NTMs may contaminate laboratory specimens, for instance, tap water (liquid or frozen) may contain NTMs that can potentially contaminate these specimens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Fortunately, highly accurate nucleic acid probes are becoming readily available for faster identification of NTM, including MAC and M. xenopi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【47】Management of NTM-PD remains challenging. As the infection is usually chronic, a multi-drug regimen is warranted, and there are no randomized comparative trials that evaluated the currently employed regimens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. The ATS/IDSA treatment guidelines from 2007 include a combination of a macrolide with rifampin and ethambutol, which should be continued until sputum cultures remain negative for 12 months for MAC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, with the same guidelines being currently recommended for M. xenopi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In contrast, the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines from 2017 recommend initial treatment with four medications including a macrolide, rifampin, and ethambutol combined with either a fluoroquinolone or isoniazid for NTM infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. These guidelines are based on limited evidence obtained from non-randomized controlled trials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【48】Surgical intervention for NTM-PD is currently limited only to patients who failed medical therapy (i.e. remained sputum positive after 6 months of continued anti-tuberculous therapy), those who cannot tolerate various medications, and hosts with macrolide-resistant strains 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【49】Conclusions\n\n【50】This case series highlights NTM-PD as an uncommon etiology of cavitary and nodular lung disease in three elderly patients with underlying lung conditions. Interestingly, two of the NTM infections in our series were caused by M. xenopi , a less frequent culprit of NTM-PD in the midwestern USA. The NTM infections masqueraded clinically and radiologically as lung malignancy, which posed a diagnostic dilemma. Physicians should be aware of NTMs as causative pathogens for chronic pulmonary diseases, especially in certain high-risk patients. The diagnostic criteria for NTM-PD established by the AST/IDSA should be followed to achieve an accurate and timely diagnosis to start anti-tuberculous therapy.\n\n【51】Learning points\n\n【52】NTM-PD is an uncommon etiology of cavitary and nodular lung disease in three elderly patients with underlying lung conditions.\n\n【53】NTM-PD can greatly mimic lung malignancy both clinically and radiologically, which may pose a diagnostic dilemma.\n\n【54】Physicians should be aware of NTMs as causative pathogens for chronic pulmonary diseases, especially in certain high-risk patients.\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to acknowledge the Department of Infectious Disease at Ascension Saint Francis Hospital for providing valuable input to this case series.</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors confirm that there is no funding to declare regarding the publication of this submitted work.</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors declare that they have no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this case series.</u>\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the patients to write and publish their cases with all accompanying clinical and radiological data.

There are four types based on cardiac catheterization findings including the apical type (> 80% of cases), midventricular type, basal type and focal type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The most common presenting symptoms are acute chest pain and dyspnea while associated clinical findings include elevation in cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Other laboratory abnormalities include elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and BNP/peak troponin ratio when compared to ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. There are no randomized trials or expert consensus for medical management and treatment.\n\n【2】Although the etiology of TC is not clear, it is thought to be related to a catecholamine surge from a preceding physical or emotional stress. However, over 15-20% of TC episodes do not have clear triggers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Catecholamine overload may also lead to chronic inflammatory states and oxidative injury as myocardial biopsies have demonstrated increased fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration in TC patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Estrogen may also play a role as meta-analysis has demonstrated about 80% of cases occur in women > 50 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> and women represent 90% of cases overall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】In 2012 over 6,000 cases of TC were reported in the United States with increasing annual incidence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> representing 1-2% of all myocardial infarctions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.

Six months prior, she presented to the emergency department for new and severe epigastric pain which lasted for 12 h. ECG was significant for ST-depressions in the septal leads concerning for acute posterior myocardial infarction. Laboratory tests were significant for elevated troponin I (TnI) of 13 ng/mL and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) > 600 pg/mL. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% with hypokinesis of the mid and distal segments and apical dyskinesis consistent with TC. Catheterization revealed markedly elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 26 mm Hg with apical ballooning . No obstructive coronary artery disease was seen. She was discharged home on losartan and carvedilol.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Angiogram during the first episode demonstrating marked apical ballooning and hypercontracting base . |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【7】Four months later, she experienced similar episode of severe epigastric and chest pain lasting for hours. ECG showed nonspecific ST abnormalities. Laboratory tests revealed mildly elevated TnI (0.7 ng/mL) and BNP within normal limits (62 pg/mL). TTE demonstrated no wall motion abnormalities and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65-70%. Repeat catheterization showed no obstructive coronary artery disease. Interestingly, she denied any recent physical or emotional stressors related to either episode.\n\n【8】She was seen at our clinic 1 month later for cardiology consultation. She had no complaints of chest pain or dyspnea at time of presentation and reported being able to exercise rigorously daily without experiencing cardiovascular symptoms. Daily home medications included carvedilol 3.125 mg twice a day, losartan 25 mg, isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg, aspirin 81 mg, and oral estradiol 2 mg daily, and nitroglycerin 0.4 sublingual tablets as needed. Following this consultation, the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (losartan) was discontinued and she was started on the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) ramipril 2.5 mg twice daily. The oral estradiol was stopped due to concern of thrombosis. She has now been symptom free for 6 months and able to exercise regularly without experiencing symptoms.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】The pathogenesis of TC is unclear though several hypotheses exist. It could be due to excessive production of epinephrine after beta-adrenergic response resulting in a decline of cardiac myocyte activity and inefficient myocardial function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. This may also explain the predilection and worse outcomes in women as myocytes in males may have greater resilience and restorative properties than females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Mental stressors and subsequent increases in epinephrine and catecholamine levels also impact endothelial function and may result in catecholamine-related myocyte toxicity, coronary microvascular dysfunction and coronary microvascular vascular spasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. These theories are supported by the relationship between TC and estrogen withdrawal, as these patients lose the protective qualities of estrogen from catecholamine toxicity, calcium overload and oxidative stress. Fatty acid metabolism may also play a role as one retrospective study utilizing data from a national patient registry found patients with TC were less likely to be treated for hyperlipidemia at the time of presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Several treatment strategies have been explored. As a result of the proposed mechanism involving catecholamine surge, beta-blockers have been explored as a potential treatment. To date, large prospective observational studies have found no improvement in recurrence rates or mortality when treating patients with normal doses of beta-blockers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> or interventricular pressure gradients may experience greater benefit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Current understanding is that clinicians should choose combined alpha and beta-blockers such as carvedilol to minimize vasoconstriction due to alpha effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In addition, beta-blockers have been found to assist in associated complications of TC including cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Overall, a reduced ejection fraction is noted in 86.5% of patients with TC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> and therefore ACEI and ARBs may play a role in treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. A retrospective analysis in a large multi-center international registry including 1,118 patients with medications prescribed at hospital discharge after a TC event found improved survival rates 1 year after TC event in patients taking ACEI and ARBs but not beta-blockers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. A systematic review also found that ACEI/ARB prescriptions are associated with decreased recurrence rate, but not beta-blocker prescriptions. However, both studies did not distinguish between types of beta-blockers (selective vs. non-selective) or combined beta-blocker and ACEI/ARB therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Another retrospective review including 66 patients at two hospitals found that patients taking ACEI prior to admission did not develop critical complications including arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Long-term clinical management to minimize recurrence rates and optimize overall prognosis is less clear. We substituted an ACEI for the ARB in this patient because large multi-center registries have found an associated decreased mortality and recurrence of TC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Information surrounding recurrent episodes of TC is limited. Some estimates have found recurrent episodes to occur between 3 weeks to 3.8 years and are associated with consistently poor left ventricular ejection fractions of ≤ 40% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. There are no clinical trials exploring medical management for effectively minimizing recurrent episodes. Therefore, assessing the efficacy of medical interventions including ACEI/ARBs and beta-blockers in relation to recurrent episode severity represents a potential point of interest for future exploration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Conclusions\n\n【15】TC is a form of ACS where pathophysiology and optimal treatment is unknown. Recurrence is observed in 2-12% and there is little information surrounding medical interventions to optimize outcomes within this subpopulation. Because the condition is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, further exploration into management and treatment plans is warranted. We present a case where ARBs and beta-blockers dampened the symptoms of recurrent TC.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This work was supported by contracts from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institutes nos.

Various abnormalities are found that the characteristic facial changes include microphthalmia, deep-set ears, ear anomalies, micrognathia, large anterior fontanels, and bulbous nose. This condition is rare, accounting for only 1% of all chromosomally abnormal cases or 2.4% of trisomic cases among spontaneous abortions.\n\n【2】CDH is associated with chromosomal anomaly. The association of CDH with chromosomal anomalies such as trisomy 13 and 18 is well known 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The cases complicated with CDH associated with trisomy 9 have been reported by various countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]</u>. In this report, we present a case of trisomy 9 associated with CDH and severe IUGR. The clinical course of the case would suggest the importance of correct diagnosis and appropriate patient counseling without delay. In addition, there are no English literatures about CDH associated with trisomy 9 and this case may be the first report in Japan.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 36-year-old Japanese pregnant woman (gravida 2, para 2) had been undergone prenatal managemen and care at the hospital near her residence. Fetal growth restriction had been pointed out since the 16th week of gestation and CDH was pointed out in the 24th week of gestation, so that this patient was referred to the obstetric outpatient clinic at Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital for close examination of CDH and IUGR in the 25th week of gestation. Her obstetric, medical, and family histories were unremarkable. Her husband was 36 years of age and healthy. She and her husband were not consanguineous.\n\n【5】Ultrasonographic examinations performed at the first visit revealed left-side diaphragmatic hernia at our hospital . Fetal lung area to head circumference was 0.83, below 1.0, so that severe lung hypoplasia was suspected. The estimated fetal weight was 385 g, corresponding to the 21st week of gestation, so that severe IUGR was suspected. Ventriculomegaly and narrowing of cysterna magna were also observed . The amniotic fluid volume was within normal limits. She was hospitalized for close examination. Fetal MRI revealed CDH, no detection of left lung, hydrops fetalis, agenesis of corpus callosum, and cerebellar hypoplasia at the 26th week of gestation . She was counseled that aneuploidy was suspected and offered genetic amniocentesis at the 25th week of gestation. Three weeks later the results of cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniotic cells revealed trisomy 9, a karyotype of 47, XY, +9 in all 64 of metaphase cells examined . They were counseled regarding the poor prognosis of trisomy 9 and chose no further intervention for fetal indications at our hospital and only supportive care for neonate at the hospital near their residence. At the 32nd week of gestation, intrauterine fetal death was confirmed and on the next day, a stillborn male infant was delivered with a body weight of 875 g and a length of 39 cm after induction of labor. Macroscopic findings included small palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, micrognathia, low-set ears, hypoplastic phalanges, cryptorchidism, hypoplastic scrotum, micropenis, and rocker-bottom feet. Autopsy was declined by the parents.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Prenatal ultrasound findings in a fetal thorax at the 25th week of gestation.

In this case, CDH was easily diagnosed because mediastinal shift and intrathoracic herniation of the bowel were noted in the 24th week of gestation by the ultrasound. CDH is also known to be associated with other malformations, and at least one associated malformation was diagnosed in about 36% of CDH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In this case, ventriculomegaly and narrowing of cysterna magna were also observed by ultrasound. In addition agenesis of corpus callosum and cerebellar hypoplasia were diagnosed by MRI.\n\n【12】Chromosomal anomalies were presented in 9.5%, and the association of CDH with chromosomal anomalies such as trisomy 13 and 18 is well known 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In this case, karyotyping was performed to detect chromosome aberration and trisomy 9 was revealed. Trisomy 9 is a very rare chromosomal abnormality, occurring only 2.7% of all trisomic cases, so that most such cases result in first trimester spontaneous abortions and are rarely seen at near term 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Trisomy 9 has striking features in ultrasound findings including abnormalities of craniofacial, cardiac, skeletal, and genitourinary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 9 is difficult due to similarities to trisomies 13 and 18 in sonographic appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In this case, we could not detect above anomalies in ultrasound findings but facial (such as small palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, micrognathia and low-set ears) and genitourinary (such as cryptorchidism, hypoplastic scrotum and micropenis) anomalies were detected by macroscopic findings after birth.\n\n【13】Prognosis of trisomy 9 is extremely poor and universally lethal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> as well as trisomies 13 and 18. Most trisomy 9 fetuses are spontaneously lost, and prognosis of newborn infants with trisomy 9 is extremely poor. It was reported that 12 of 15 infants died within 1 month and one died within hours or days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In this case, we could inform them about the poor prognosis of trisomy 9 because of accurate prenatal diagnosis by chromosomal analysis. They didn’t hope further intervention for fetal indications. After all, the fetus spontaneously died at the 32nd week of gestation. To the best of our knowledge, no cases of trisomy 9 with CDH have been reported in the English literature in Japan.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 09:59:48", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:04:27", "cost": 279.558}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:04:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 17:59:45"}

However, even in cases of recalcitrant infections there can be situations where patient demands or clinical circumstances might compel physicians and other healthcare providers to attempt to eradicate an infection with the use of oral antibiotics alone. In our clinic we occasionally see patients who are referred for potential additional surgical or medical management of persistent septic OB. In these cases initial bursectomy and antibiotics have failed to eradicate the infection, and continuing treatment with oral antibiotics seems to have only a suppressive effect even though they have typically been taken for over six weeks. Explanations for the persistence of these infections include the resistant or atypical organisms that fail to grow in culture, poor tissue penetration of the oral antibiotic, and/or the development of olecranon osteomyelitis. Currently, the published literature is sparse with respect to the potential duration of treatment that might be required when special circumstances necessitate consideration of treatment with only oral (and seemingly appropriate) antibiotics for atypical cases where the infection persists despite a bursectomy and an initial conventional course of antibiotics.\n\n【2】In the perspective of these referred cases of unusually recalcitrant septic OB, we could not locate any reports that provide information for decision making and patient education regarding the potential duration of oral, when compared to typical i.v. antibiotic treatment that might be required to eradicate the infection. More specifically, we could not locate information that would help in estimating the potential duration of the oral-only antibiotic treatment that is requested by some patients (i.e. those that refuse i.v. antibiotics) including the patient that we describe here.\n\n【3】We describe a case of septic OB resulting from a scorpion sting that, despite initial bursectomy, organism-appropriate i.v. antibiotics, and subsequent multiple irrigations and debridements, took nearly 240 days of two concurrent oral antibiotics for full resolution. One important reason for this prolonged duration for complete resolution was not because of tissue necrosis, but because the patient refused i.v. antibiotics in order to avoid impeding his demanding business and personal travel schedule. An additional important aspect of this case is that underlying olecranon osteomyelitis was suspected, which helps to explain why a long duration of two oral antibiotics was required.\n\n【4】We report this case to illustrate how the duration of successful oral-only antibiotic treatment can be extremely prolonged, and hence is typically inadvisable, for some cases of recalcitrant septic OB.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 56-year-old Caucasian male, who worked as an engineer, presented to an emergency department in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA with pain, swelling, and erythema on the posterior aspect of his right elbow. He was 188 cm tall, weighed 110 kg (BMI 31kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), and reported being in excellent health. His past medical history corroborated that he was not taking medications, did not smoke, occasionally drank alcohol, and had no personal or family history of heart/vascular disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorder, or poor wound healing.\n\n【7】On the previous morning, he was working in the desert near Henderson, Nevada. While clearing sagebrush from beneath his truck, he felt a sharp stinging sensation on his right elbow as it contacted the ground. He thought that a scorpion might have stung him, but he did not attempt to retrieve the organism. The following day he was admitted to a cardiac monitoring unit of a local hospital because of a ventricular arrhythmia (premature ventricular contractions), tachycardia, and hypertension (177/104 mmHg). A twelve-lead electrocardiogram showed multiple pre-ventricular contractions and nonspecific S-T wave changes, but no infarction pattern. It was surmised that these abnormalities were caused by envenomation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Punctate erythematous marks at the site of injury were consistent with the sting of a bark scorpion ( Centruroides exilicauda ), which explained the arrhythmia and hypertension within 24 hours of the sting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Blood tests showed normal cardiac enzymes and elevated glucose (137 mg/dL, normal 65 - 99 mg/dL). A complete blood count (CBC) revealed leukocytosis (15,000/µL) (normal 4,000 - 10,500/µL) and a low platelet count (105/µL, normal 150 - 450/µL). Blood cultures revealed no growth. The cellulitis was treated with i.v. cefazolin.\n\n【8】An adenosine cardiac stress test revealed reduced ejection fraction (46%; normal 50-75%) and mild decreased tracer uptake in the inferior wall on the stress/rest studies. Ventricular cavity size was within normal limits. In view of these relatively minor findings, and the rapid improvement of the hypertension and arrhythmia with 50 mg/day of oral metoprolol tartrate, further work-up was not conducted. One day later, he was discharged to his home with metoprolol tartrate 50 mg/day and two oral antibiotics: cephalexin 500 mg four times a day and moxifloxacin hydrochloride 400 mg/day.\n\n【9】At admission for bursectomy in Salt Lake City, Utah, his erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated at 42 mm/hr (normal 0 - 20 mm/hr).Wound cultures from the bursectomy grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) . Treatment included one gram of i.v. ertapenem sodium for three days in the morning followed by two weeks of oral 875 mg of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium twice a day, and daily dressing changes for the open wound.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Antibiotics, Cultures, and Blood Test Results |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【11】At two weeks after surgery, his ESR and C-reactive protein (CRP) were normal and primary closure was done. One week later, purulent drainage recurred. Repeated bacterial, fungal, and tuberculosis cultures showed no growth . Another irrigation/debridement was done and the wound was left open. The patient continued taking 500 mg of oral levofloxacin each morning and 875 mg of oral amoxicillin/clavulanate potassiumevery evening, and wound irrigations and dressing changes were done in the clinic. The patient refused our recommendation that i.v. antibiotics should be used for treatment, stating that allowing this would preclude his demanding business and personal travel schedule.\n\n【12】An infectious disease specialist recommended switching antibiotics to the concurrent use of oral double-strength trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole two tablets three times a day (t.i.d.) and oral rifampin 300 mg t.i.d. for broad bacterial coverage and good bone penetration for the possibility of underlying osteomyelitis. Continued use of oral-only antibiotic treatment reflected the patient’s insistence on avoiding i.v. treatment. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures obtained at 64 and 103 days after the initial bursectomy continued to show no growth . ESR and CRP values also remained within normal limits. Although the magnetic resonance (MR) scans that were then obtained showed findings consistent with osteomyelitis , continuing oral antibiotics with this double regimen was considered reasonable because of progressive improvement including: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> retraction of the wound margins, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> blood tests remaining within normal ranges, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> no evidence of systemic toxicity. Treatment now also included warm whirlpool treatments to enhance vascularization.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Lateral (A, B) and axial (C) MRI views of the patient’s right elbow.

The infection was considered eradicated by 236 days following the initial bursectomy. Four years later the patient remained free of recurrence and had no deficits in elbow function. Although he was extremely pleased with the final outcome, he stated that in retrospect he would have consented to i.v. antibiotic treatment had he realized that nearly eight months of oral-only treatment might be required.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Among all bursae, sepsis most commonly occurs in the olecranon bursa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>, with arthropod bites or stings being a frequent cause. Staphylococcus aureus is the cause in over 80% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 , 9 \\]</u>. One explanation for the persistence of our patient's infection is the possibility that the wound was also inoculated with an atypical organism (e.g. Nocardia or atypical mycobacterium) that was never identified. Regardless of the possible cause of our case of septic OB, it is distinctive in the reported literature because of the extremely long duration of oral antibiotic treatment  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 4 , 10 \\- 14 \\]</u>. Raddatz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> is the only report that we could find of prolonged oral treatment, with a range of 10 - 135 days (mean 40 days).\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 2. Antibiotic Treatment of Septic Bursitis; Summary of Selected Studies |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【18】Osteomyelitis seems to be the best explanation for the persistence of the infection. Although successful treatment of acute osteomyelitis with long-term oral antibiotics is a well established form of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u> and successful treatment of recalcitrant or virulent bacterial infections with oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole alone or concurrently with rifampin have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\- 20 \\]</u>, we could not locate a case of septic OB (with or without olecranon osteomyelitis) that required using these two antibiotics with prolonged duration similar to that required for our patient. Scully and co-workers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u> reported on the prolonged use (mean 40 days, range: 5 - 283 days) of oral ofloxacin for infections due to multiple-resistant bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus . However, in that study there was no report of septic OB and the prolonged treatments were for osteomyelitis or infections associated with endoprostheses.\n\n【19】Similar to our case report, none of the 82 patients in the previous report of Scully et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u> had hepatic, renal, or hematologic toxicity despite long therapy. Additional complications that can result from long-term oral antibiotics include Clostridium difficile diarrhea and antibiotic-related marrow suppression (e.g. thrombocytopenia). Because of these and other potential complications, especially the length of prolonged therapy and potential increased cost, we do not advocate treatment using a prolonged course of oral antibiotics instead of conventional parenteral antibiotics for exceptional cases of virulent/persistent septic OB that may or may not be associated with olecranon osteomyelitis. A drug holiday could have been suggested with repeat cultures in order to better elucidate the target organism or to simply confirm bacterial eradication without underlying antibiotic serum levels.\n\n【20】In conclusion, this report shows how prolonged the course of treatment of recalcitrant septic olecranon bursitis (OB)/osteomyelitis can be when using only oral antibiotics. This report should help healthcare providers to educate some patients about the wisdom and comparative benefits of accepting i.v. antibiotic treatment when they might otherwise refuse it.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflicts of interest in either a financial or other capacity that would bias this work.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:00:57", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:01:55", "cost": 58.777}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:01:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:00:56"}

Some cases have been reported that following M. pneumoniae infection, acute cerebral infarction, intracardiac or splenic thrombus was commonly detected in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 8 \\]</u>. It has been considered that the circulation problems caused by abnormal coagulation or thrombosis could be responsible for the extrapulmonary complications of the infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. However, the mechanism of the coagulation problems and thrombosis has not been fully understood. Some authors concluded that the release of cytokines with mycoplasma infection produced the vascular wall inflammation, leading to local vasculitis and thrombosis. Also, some studies have shown that activation of the complement system caused by mycoplasma infection activates the coagulation system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\- 13 \\]</u>. The mechanism of abnormal coagulation and the promotion of thrombosis after M. pneumoniae infection could be explained by the activation of exogenous and endogenous coagulation systems by multiple pathways which provokes the imbalance in coagulation and anticoagulation factors. Some inflammatory factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin, might accelerate the coagulation. In the process of inflammatory reactions, the synthesis of some anticoagulation factors such as antithrombin III (AT-III) and protein C is affected, which results in the promotion of coagulation. It has been reported that AT-III levels and protein C activity are significantly different in M. pneumoniae \\-infected children compared to the healthy children, and after anti-mycoplasma treatment, protein C activity returns to normal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Thrombus caused by M. pneumoniae infection has been successfully treated with oral or parenteral anticoagulant therapy such as intravenous heparin, intra-subcutaneous injection of low molecular weight heparin, and oral administration of warfarin, in previously reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\- 10 \\]</u>. Local vasculitis and thrombotic vascular occlusion disappeared within a few weeks to months following the treatment of M. pneumoniae infection.\n\n【10】In conclusion, M. pneumoniae infection may cause thrombosis formation and transient production of the antiphospholipid antibodies which may involve its mechanism. Thrombolytic therapies should be taken into account as soon as possible when the appearance of M. pneumoniae pneumonia clinical symptoms has been detected.\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no acknowledgments to state.</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This was an unfunded evaluation.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflict of interest to disclose.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All participants enrolled in the study provided written informed consent.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All of the authors have contributed sufficiently to the project through drafting and revising the manuscript to be included as authors.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:52:57", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:55:05", "cost": 128.093}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:55:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:52:56"}

We report a case of spontaneous rupture of a deep femoral pseudoaneurysm that mimicked lymphedema after radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph-node dissection in a patient who was receiving warfarin, even though the dose of warfarin was adjusted to maintain the INR within the therapeutic range.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 69-year-old woman noticed swelling and pain in her left thigh after doing some light stretching for about half an hour. She thought that the symptoms were caused by lymphedema developing as a complication after the radical hysterectomy as it had occurred in the past. However, she visited our hospital because she felt the pain in her thigh, which she had not experienced previously. The patient had undergone a radical hysterectomy for stage IB1 uterine cervical cancer 11 years ago. Although just after surgery, she had several episodes of lymphedema of the thigh, there was no lymphedema since then. Two years prior, she underwent a choledocholithotomy at another hospital. Immediately after surgery, she had pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis, and an inferior vena cava filter was left in place permanently. She had been receiving warfarin in a dose of 6 mg per day since then. The patient had no history of trauma, and puncture of the femoral artery had not been performed for several years. Although the left thigh was swollen as compared with the right thigh, its skin color was normal. There was no palpable thrill in the left thigh. The hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, and INR levels were 10.3 g/dL, 0.66 mg/dL, and 2.19, respectively. Subsequently, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed. A pseudoaneurysm of the left deep femoral artery surrounded by a large hematoma in the adductor muscle was confirmed . Active bleeding from the left deep femoral pseudoaneurysm appeared to continue. Moreover, the large hematoma in the adductor muscle might progress to the compartment syndrome. Selective angiography of the left deep femoral artery was performed after the patient received 10 mg of vitamin K by slow intravenous injection. The findings confirmed a 7.3-mm pseudoaneurysm in a muscular branch of the deep femoral artery  and extravasation of contrast medium from the pseudoaneurysm . Coil embolization was successfully performed . Postoperatively, the patient recovered uneventfully.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

First, pseudoaneurysm can develop in the deep femoral artery even when the INR level of warfarin is maintained within the therapeutic range. Second, swelling of the thigh caused by rupture of the deep femoral artery resembles the lower-extremity edema that occurs after radical hysterectomy. Third, contrast-enhanced CT is useful for diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm of the deep femoral artery with hematoma and for evaluation of the extent of muscle damage caused by hematoma.\n\n【9】First, pseudoaneurysm can develop in the deep femoral artery even when the INR level of warfarin is maintained within the therapeutic range. Warfarin is used to treat venous thrombosis. Its safety and efficacy depend on the administered dose, and an INR value of 2.0 - 3.0 is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. A dose of warfarin exceeding the recommended therapeutic range can cause bleeding as a complication. Etiologic factors for spontaneous pseudoaneurysm formation include sports activities with muscle overcontraction or overstretching, use of anticoagulants, arterial wall weakness caused by arteriosclerosis, advanced age, inherited connective-tissue disease, infection, and congenital arterial disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6-8 \\]</u>. Our patient was an elderly (69 years old), receiving warfarin, and lightly stretched her muscles for about half an hour, before coming to our hospital. Only one of the following factors is unlikely to cause pseudoaneurysm: advanced age, warfarin treatment with an INR value of 2.19, and light stretch exercise. In our patient, the presence of all three of these factors, particularly warfarinization, probably led to the formation of a pseudoaneurysm.\n\n【10】Second, swelling of the thigh caused by rupture of a deep femoral pseudoaneurysm resembles the lower-extremity edema occurring after radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph-node dissection. We often encounter patients who have lower-extremity edema after pelvic lymph-node dissection. If the patient had thought that her swollen thigh was caused by edema and massaged her thigh, bleeding might have increased considerably and caused the compartment syndrome. In patients who receive warfarin after pelvic lymph-node dissection, thigh swelling is likely to be caused not only by edema, but also potentially by femoral pseudoaneurysm. Moreover, rupture of a femoral pseudoaneurysm can directly cause thigh edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. These factors might create difficulty in the diagnosis of rupture of a femoral pseudoaneurysm after pelvic lymph-node dissection.\n\n【11】Third, contrast-enhanced CT is useful for the diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm and for evaluation of the extent of muscle damage. Although color Doppler imaging is a sensitive and specific modality for the evaluation of pseudoaneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, it is difficult to accurately diagnose rupture of a pseudoaneurysm with hematoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Furthermore, it is difficult to obtain information on muscle damage after rupture of a pseudoaneurysm on color Doppler imaging. Several case reports have documented that pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery can lead to compartment syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12-14 \\]</u>. In the absence of appropriate treatment, compartment syndrome can in turn cause permanent muscle and nerve damage. Although our patient had a swollen left adductor muscle caused by hematoma, early diagnosis of the large hematoma in the adductor muscle was possible on contrast-enhanced CT, and angiography confirmed the presence of a pseudoaneurysm, allowing early treatment to be performed, thereby preventing the development of compartment syndrome.\n\n【12】In conclusion, our experience indicates that rupture of a pseudoaneurysm of the deep femoral artery can occur in patients who are receiving warfarin, even when the INR value is maintained within the therapeutic range. Swelling of the thigh caused by rupture of a deep femoral pseudoaneurysm resembles the lower-extremity edema occurring after pelvic lymph-node dissection. We found that contrast-enhanced CT was useful for the diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm and for evaluation of the extent of muscle damage. Some cancer patients have venous thrombosis and require anticoagulation therapy. In cancer patients with risk factors for pseudoaneurysm who are receiving warfarin, physicians should consider the risk of pseudoaneurysm formation, even when the dose of warfarin is maintained within the therapeutic INR range.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Support</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:26:27", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:27:20", "cost": 53.327}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:27:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:26:27"}

Although fractures during removal of intramedullary tibial nails have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-4 \\]</u>, there have been few reports of difficult removal for femoral nails 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5-7 \\]</u> and no reports of fracture during removal of a femoral intramedullary nail, to our knowledge. A case of femoral fracture during removal of a femoral intramedullary nail is presented. The fracture appeared to be closely tied in with the structure of the femoral intramedullary nail.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 28-year-old man sustained a transverse fracture on his right femur while playing soccer. A week after the injury, intramedullary interlocking nailing was performed using a Zimmer (Warsaw, IN) ZMS <sup>® </sup> femoral nail. An intramedullary nail, 10 mm in diameter, was inserted after 11 mm reaming according to the standard reaming-nailing technique. The operation was completed without any trouble, and the postoperative radiograph showed favorable reduction . Postoperative course also was uneventful, and he did not visit the hospital over a period of more than 1.5 years after the bone union.\n\n|  Figure 1. A postoperative AP radiograph showing anatomical reduction. |\n| --- |\n\n【5】Two years and 5 months after the initial operation, the nail was removed at the patient’s request. The radiograph immediately before the removal showed complete healing of the fracture with an anatomic alignment and without any hardware failure . Following removal of interlocking screws, the intramedullary nail was tried to be extracted. The nail started to be pulled out with relatively little resistance at first, but considerably greater resistance was encountered after it was taken out several centimeters. After an addition of harder blows, the resistance suddenly disappeared and the nail was pulled out completely without stopping. There was no breakage in the removal instruments and the nail. However, the radiographs taken immediately after the removal demonstrated several new, longitudinal fracture lines proximal to the primary fracture site . A CT image showed fracture lines that radiated in three directions (posterior, medial, and lateral) and a narrow, newly formed intramedullary bone that was the same in configuration as the nail surface . The fracture was treated conservatively with protected weight-bearing. In the fifth postoperative month, the patient could tolerate full weight-bearing and no significant functional disorders were observed thereafter. The patient gave his informed consent prior to being included into this case report.\n\n|  Figure 2. An AP radiograph taken immediately before the nail removal showing complete union of the fracture. |\n| --- |\n\n|  Figure 3.

A CT image showing fracture lines that radiate in three directions (posterior, medial, and lateral) and a narrow, newly formed intramedullary bone that is the same in configuration as the nail surface. |\n| --- |\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】The Zimmer ZMS <sup>® </sup> femoral nail is made of stainless steel. The entire surface of the nail is treated with shot-peening to enhance the strength and corrosion resistance of the nail. It has flutes in the four directions to provide space for revascularization and to enhance fixation by four-point cortical contact. Nails which are larger in diameter (12 - 16 mm) have a slot anteriorly instead of a flute to increase the flexibility of the nail. The flutes stop at the level above the distal holes for interlocking screws to preserve the nail strength, and the cross-sectional shape of the distal end of the nail, several centimeters in length, differs from the upper part of the nail, being cylindrical except the thin anterior slot .\n\n|  Figure 5. ZMS ® femoral nail (distal end). |\n| --- |\n\n【12】In postoperative CT, the fracture lines were observed in three directions (posterior, medial, and lateral) of the femur. There existed a mature bone, which was newly formed in the same configuration as the cross-sectional shape of the intramedullary nail. These findings suggest that the mechanism of the fracture is closely tied in with the structure of the nail stated above. That is, the mature, hard bone which was formed in the three flutes was hit against the distal cylindrical part of the nail at the distal end of the flutes when the nail was extracted, producing strong resistance, and eventually giving rise to a fracture. Seligson et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> reported two cases of irremovable interlocking femoral nails, including one case of 13 mm-diameter ZMS <sup>® </sup> femoral nail, and stated that the bone overgrowth into the slot of the nail might have prevented the distal, unslotted end of the nail from being extracted from the medullary canal. They recommended the use of nails with closed and constant cross-sectional designs to prevent the problem of difficult removal. Although the 10 mm-diameter ZMS <sup>® </sup> femoral nail used in our case did not have the slot and had a closed cross-section, it had flutes that stopped at the level above the distal holes for interlocking screws. Our case suggested the importance of the constant cross-sectional design to prevent the difficulties and the fracture on nail removal.\n\n【13】There have been some reports of fracture on removal of tibial intramedullary nails 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-4 \\]</u>. Takakuwa et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> reported four cases of fracture on removal of an ACE tibial nail, and stated that 5° bend at the distal tip and the posterior slot which stopped at the level of the distal bend as well as late retrieval of the nail contributed to the fracture. Moreover, skepticism was brought against the necessity of reaming to use nails of larger diameter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Im and Lee 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> also reported three cases of fracture on removal and two cases of inability of removal of ACE tibial nails, and stated that younger age of the patient was significantly associated with the difficulty in nail removal, comparing with 30 cases of uneventful removal. Problems of the inconstant cross-sectional design, the late removal, the reaming, and the young age of the patient could be considered as contributory factors to the fracture on removal also in our case.\n\n【14】Although the nail used in our case was made of stainless steel, which is known as less osteoconductive material than titanium and its alloys, postoperative CT demonstrated abundant bone formation along the nail surface. This might be related to the micro-texture of the nail surface, in addition to the late removal and the patient age. The surface of the nail was not smooth because of the shot-peening applied for strength and corrosion resistance. It is known that, when the surface of a titanium implant is roughened, bone apposition onto the implant surface and bone-implant interfacial strength is increased 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. This property seems not peculiar to titanium alloy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, and it is possible that the roughened surface of the stainless steel nail accelerated osteoconduction on the nail surface. Unlike the surface of the metal implants for cementless arthroplasties, the surface of the metals for osteosynthesis would not have to be highly osteoconductive.\n\n【15】We were unable to find any previous reports on cases of the femoral fracture that occurred during removal of the intramedullary femoral nail 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12-14 \\]</u>. Husain et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> reviewed their 45 cases of femoral nail removal, and did not find particular difficulties in late removal of titanium nails as well as stainless steel nails. The titanium nail in their report was a fluted nail with a satin surface, and the stainless steel nail was a slotted nail with a polished surface. Thus, in addition to the macrotexture such as cross-sectional design, the surface roughness of the nail could be a significant contributory factor to the fracture on nail removal.\n\n【16】The succeeded model of the intramedullary nail from the same manufacturer (M/DN <sup>® </sup> Femoral Nail, Zimmer, IN) is a stainless steel nail with a polished surface, and also the flutes do not stop above the distal holes, extending almost to the distal end of the nail.\n\n【17】Although some previous studies have indicated that the removal of intramedullary femoral nails should be restricted in asymptomatic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>, the nail removal might be useful for symptomatic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. In Asian countries, patients prefer the removal of metallic hardware also for cultural reasons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】When internal fixation is to be done with an intramedullary nail and its removal is to be expected, we consider it necessary to choose a nail whose cross-sectional shape does not differ at levels and whose surface is not rough. At removal, the structure of the nail as well as the period that extends to the nail removal should be considered.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have received nothing of value, and no financial support of this study has occurred.

A case of femoral fracture during removal of a femoral intramedullary nail is presented. The fracture appeared to be closely tied in with the structure of the femoral intramedullary nail.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 28-year-old man sustained a transverse fracture on his right femur while playing soccer. A week after the injury, intramedullary interlocking nailing was performed using a Zimmer (Warsaw, IN) ZMS <sup>® </sup> femoral nail. An intramedullary nail, 10 mm in diameter, was inserted after 11 mm reaming according to the standard reaming-nailing technique. The operation was completed without any trouble, and the postoperative radiograph showed favorable reduction . Postoperative course also was uneventful, and he did not visit the hospital over a period of more than 1.5 years after the bone union.\n\n|  <mark>Figure 1. A postoperative AP radiograph showing anatomical reduction.</mark> |\n| --- |\n\n【5】Two years and 5 months after the initial operation, the nail was removed at the patient’s request. The radiograph immediately before the removal showed complete healing of the fracture with an anatomic alignment and without any hardware failure . Following removal of interlocking screws, the intramedullary nail was tried to be extracted. The nail started to be pulled out with relatively little resistance at first, but considerably greater resistance was encountered after it was taken out several centimeters. After an addition of harder blows, the resistance suddenly disappeared and the nail was pulled out completely without stopping. There was no breakage in the removal instruments and the nail. However, the radiographs taken immediately after the removal demonstrated several new, longitudinal fracture lines proximal to the primary fracture site . A CT image showed fracture lines that radiated in three directions (posterior, medial, and lateral) and a narrow, newly formed intramedullary bone that was the same in configuration as the nail surface . The fracture was treated conservatively with protected weight-bearing. In the fifth postoperative month, the patient could tolerate full weight-bearing and no significant functional disorders were observed thereafter. The patient gave his informed consent prior to being included into this case report.\n\n|  Figure 2.

The entire surface of the nail is treated with shot-peening to enhance the strength and corrosion resistance of the nail. It has flutes in the four directions to provide space for revascularization and to enhance fixation by four-point cortical contact. Nails which are larger in diameter (12 - 16 mm) have a slot anteriorly instead of a flute to increase the flexibility of the nail. The flutes stop at the level above the distal holes for interlocking screws to preserve the nail strength, and the cross-sectional shape of the distal end of the nail, several centimeters in length, differs from the upper part of the nail, being cylindrical except the thin anterior slot .\n\n|  Figure 5. ZMS ® femoral nail (distal end). |\n| --- |\n\n【12】In postoperative CT, the fracture lines were observed in three directions (posterior, medial, and lateral) of the femur. There existed a mature bone, which was newly formed in the same configuration as the cross-sectional shape of the intramedullary nail. These findings suggest that the mechanism of the fracture is closely tied in with the structure of the nail stated above. That is, the mature, hard bone which was formed in the three flutes was hit against the distal cylindrical part of the nail at the distal end of the flutes when the nail was extracted, producing strong resistance, and eventually giving rise to a fracture. Seligson et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> reported two cases of irremovable interlocking femoral nails, including one case of 13 mm-diameter ZMS <sup>® </sup> femoral nail, and stated that the bone overgrowth into the slot of the nail might have prevented the distal, unslotted end of the nail from being extracted from the medullary canal. They recommended the use of nails with closed and constant cross-sectional designs to prevent the problem of difficult removal. Although the 10 mm-diameter ZMS <sup>® </sup> femoral nail used in our case did not have the slot and had a closed cross-section, it had flutes that stopped at the level above the distal holes for interlocking screws. Our case suggested the importance of the constant cross-sectional design to prevent the difficulties and the fracture on nail removal.\n\n【13】There have been some reports of fracture on removal of tibial intramedullary nails 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-4 \\]</u>. Takakuwa et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> reported four cases of fracture on removal of an ACE tibial nail, and stated that 5° bend at the distal tip and the posterior slot which stopped at the level of the distal bend as well as late retrieval of the nail contributed to the fracture.

In 2015, malaria was reported to be endemic in 91 countries and territories in the tropics and subtropics, with approximately half of the world population at risk for infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 212 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide in 2015, resulting in 429,000 deaths. The African region accounts for an estimated 92% of all malaria deaths with Plasmodium falciparum and vivax causing the majority of the morbidity and mortality worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】The Plasmodium parasite is transmitted by the infected female Anopheles mosquito. The bite from an infected mosquito introduces Plasmodium sporozoites from the mosquito’s saliva into the patient’s blood. Following introduction into the bloodstream, the sporozoites travel to the liver and undergo maturation. The Plasmodium life cycle consists of exoerythrocytic and erythrocytic stages. During the exoerythrocytic phase, the sporozoites invade hepatocytes and divide until schizonts are formed containing thousands of merozoites. The schizonts rupture and release merozoites into the bloodstream, which invade red blood cells (erythrocytic phase). Asexual reproduction within erythrocytes eventually results in hemolysis of the red blood cells, releasing thousands more merozoites into the bloodstream. This release can result in a pro-inflammatory cytokines response. The released merozoites may then infect new red cells, while others differentiate into gametocytes, which circulate in the bloodstream until they are ingested by a mosquito to continue the transmission cycle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Malaria is a multisystem disease with a varied clinical spectrum based on the parasite species, epidemiology, immunity, and age. Groups at highest risk include young children and pregnant women. Features of complicated malaria may include cerebral malaria, renal impairment, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatic dysfunction. Patients with malaria may present for anesthetic care during radiological imaging or surgical procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. We present a case of a 4-year-old child, with P. falciparum malaria infection, secondary anemia and thrombocytopenia, who required anesthetic care for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lumbar spine. The multisystem involvement of the disease process is presented and anesthetic implications are discussed.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Institutional Review Board approval is not required for presentation of single case reports at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH). At the time of surgery, the patient was a 4-year-old, 15.4-kg child, from Burkina Faso, Africa, who was scheduled for MRI of the lumbar spine under general anesthesia. Her past history was significant for an anorectal malformation, which had previously required surgical correction with a colostomy. She was also diagnosed with P. falciparum infection 1 week prior to this hospitalization after presenting with intermittent episodes of high-grade fever. She had subsequently developed thrombocytopenia and anemia secondary to the malarial infection. There was no history of previous problems with general anesthesia during her surgical procedures. Her immunization status was incomplete and she had no known allergies. Current medications included atovaquone/proguanil HCl (Malarone), acetaminophen and ibuprofen oral suspension, and multivitamins with iron oral drops. On the morning of the procedure, her physical examination and preoperative vital signs were unremarkable. Preoperative laboratory studies demonstrated hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, hematocrit 28.6%, and a normal platelet count. Renal and hepatic function tests had normalized. After the initiation of treatment, the peripheral blood smear demonstrated no parasites. The anesthetic plan, risks, benefits and alternatives to general anesthesia were discussed with the parent and informed consent for general anesthesia was obtained. The patient was held nil per os for 6 h and was transported to the operating room. After arrival in the operating room (OR), the patient was placed in the supine position and standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors were placed. The induction of anesthesia was carried out with the incremental inhalation of sevoflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen. After anesthetic induction, peripheral intravenous access was obtained under aseptic conditions with a 22-gauge intravenous catheter, and a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was placed. The patient was then positioned, padded and secured under the MRI scanner for imaging of the lumbar spine. Maintenance anesthesia included sevoflurane in air/oxygen with spontaneous ventilation. Additional medications included dexamethasone (4 mg), ondansetron (1.5 mg), glycopyrrolate (0.15 mg), and dexmedetomidine (5 µg). Intraoperative fluids included 250 mL of lactated Ringers. The MRI was completed with no intraoperative complications. The total anesthetic time was 60 min. At the completion of the procedure, the LMA was removed and, the patient was transported to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) in stable condition. She was discharged to home later that day and her post-discharge course was unremarkable.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Malaria should be suspected as a potential diagnosis in patients with a febrile illness if they lived in or visited an endemic region. The initial symptoms of uncomplicated malaria are non-specific and can vary greatly, with non-specific presenting features including tachycardia, tachypnea, fever with chills, fatigue, diaphoresis, headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and myalgia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Regardless of the species involved, a malaria infection may result in no clinical symptoms and be considered uncomplicated. However, such patients may still transmit the disease.\n\n【8】P. falciparum is most commonly associated with complicated malaria, although patients with severe vivax infection may also manifest severe end-organ involvement including pulmonary complications and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Major risk factors for increasing severity of infection include immunocompromised and asplenic patients, children 6 - 59 months of age, and pregnant women. Some of the common manifestations of severe malaria which can herald a grave prognosis and warrant immediate treatment include altered consciousness with or without seizures, circulatory collapse, ARDS, hepatic and renal failure, acidosis and severe hypoglycemia. Cerebral malaria is the most fatal complication of malaria. It is an encephalopathy presenting with altered consciousness with or without seizures and neurologic deficits, arising from multifactorial causes including, sequestration of malarial parasitized erythrocytes within cerebral capillaries, impairment of the blood-brain barrier, parasite-induced apoptosis, and tissue degeneration, as well as decline in neuroprotective angiogenic growth factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\- 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Changes in the structure and function of parasitized erythrocytes are implicated in the pathogenesis of severe falciparum malaria. The deformability of the erythrocyte cell membrane is decreased and its osmotic fragility is increased because of the parasites within the erythrocytes. Specific membrane glycoproteins are subsequently expressed leading to adherence of erythrocytes to the surface of the vascular endothelium (cyto-adherence), resulting in microvascular obstruction of capillaries and small venules. The parasitized erythrocytes also trigger the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to systemic inflammatory effects, fever, hyperdynamic circulation, and direct myocardial suppression. These effects may result in mortality from severe malaria through impairment of both mitochondrial function and oxygen utilization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\- 11 \\]</u>. Additionally, it is imperative to rule out concomitant infections. There is a proven association between malaria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malnutrition, and invasive bacterial infections. The immunosuppression caused by HIV increases the severity and degree of parasitemia, hindering the treatment process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Microscopic visualization of the parasite within erythrocytes in Giemsa-stained films is standardly used to diagnose malaria, although a single negative blood film does not rule out the diagnosis. Visible parasitemia on the blood film may be obscured by sequestration of the parasites within deep tissues. Other investigations used as an adjunct for diagnosis include rapid diagnostic tests for specific malarial antigens or enzymes. However, these do not quantify the level of parasitemia which is crucial in monitoring the response to treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Laboratory evaluations may also demonstrate non-specific findings such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminases, mild coagulopathy, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine.\n\n【11】The treatment strategies include those aimed at eradicating the disease causing organism and those aimed and preventing remission of disease. Prompt assessment and initiation of antimalarial therapy are essential, followed by concurrent supportive care to manage the life-threatening end-organ complications of the disease. The WHO has laid out treatment guidelines based on species subtype and disease severity, with the first-line treatment options being primarily focused on the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies, chloroquine and primaquine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Additional supportive care aimed at treating severe anemia with transfusion of blood, intravenous fluids, appropriate management of coagulopathy, and measures towards replenishment of nutritional stores should be implemented.\n\n【12】Patients with malarial infections may present for surgery. As with any anesthetic care, the first step is a thorough preoperative examination with identification of associated co-morbid conditions as well as end-organ involvement of the disease. One of the most common presenting conditions requiring surgery for patients with malaria is tropical splenomegaly with splenic rupture due to traumatic or non-traumatic causes. Plasmodium vivax and ovale remain dormant in the liver for long durations, and the stress associated with anesthesia and surgery may induce relapse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\- 17 \\]</u>. Complete general and system-wise physical examination, along with preoperative laboratory investigations including a complete blood count, blood type with cross-match, electrolytes, coagulation profile, renal and hepatics function tests, blood glucose and lactate, chest X-ray and electrocardiography should be performed. General intraoperative anesthetic goals adopted in patients with malaria include maintaining hemodynamic stability, avoiding cerebral vasodilation and alterations of intracranial pressure (ICP), lung protective ventilation strategies with attention to peak inflating pressure (PIP) and the application of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) as needed, avoidance of fluid overload and hypoglycemia, and the transfusion of blood and blood products 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Cardiac system\n\n【14】In severe malaria, ischemic cardiomyopathy due to microvascular occlusion of coronary arteries has been reported on postmortem examination. Conduction defects and electrocardiogram abnormalities may occur in patients on quinine therapy. Elevated levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), indicating left ventricular dysfunction, has been demonstrated in some patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\- 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Respiratory system\n\n【16】Respiratory involvement with cough and ARDS may occur with severe falciparum malaria. Respiratory compromise can arise from the effects of severe anemia, associated pneumonia, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, cardiac dysfunction, and metabolic acidosis. Preoperative assessment of respiratory function with continuous intraoperative attention to respiratory mechanics including PIP along with adoption of lung protective strategies is suggested. In those with concurrent cerebral malaria, protective measures aimed at maintaining normocarbia and use of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal devices may be beneficial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>\n\n【17】Central nervous system (CNS)\n\n【18】Obstruction of the cerebral microvasculature by parasitized erythrocytes has been implicated in the pathologic process leading to cerebral symptoms. This can lead to hypoxia, ischemia, increased ICP, and seizures. Cerebral malaria is the most common fatal neurological presentation of falciparum malaria and is diagnosed by confirmation of parasitemia coupled with altered consciousness, in the absence of other causes of coma. Volatile anesthetic agents should be used with caution as they may cause cerebral vasodilatation and increase ICP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 23 \\]</u>. Severe CNS involvement may necessitate continuous ICP monitoring and aggressive therapies to treat elevated ICP. Benzodiazepines (lorazepam or midazolam), barbiturates, propofol or other standard anticonvulsant agents can be used to treat seizures.\n\n【19】Hematologic system\n\n【20】The hematologic complications include anemia, thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. Thrombocytopenia and anemia are secondary to immune-mediated lysis and splenic sequestration of platelets and parasitized erythrocytes. Activation of the coagulation cascade and fibrinolytic pathway, with release of tissue factor, are implicated in the pathogenesis of coagulation disturbances and disseminated intravascular coagulation which may occur with severe malaria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Gastrointestinal system\n\n【22】Hepatic dysfunction, if present in P. falciparum , indicates a poor prognosis. The spleen is the main organ involved in the destruction and removal of parasitized erythrocytes. Impairment of splenic function can impair the immune response to malarial parasites and antigens. The hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly syndrome (HMS) is a leading cause of massive splenomegaly in malaria-endemic countries and is caused by chronic antigenic stimulation by malarial parasite. The enlarged spleen can be injured in blunt abdominal trauma with splenic rupture presenting as hemoperitoneum or hemothorax. Acute acalculous cholecystitis has been reported in children with falciparum and vivax malaria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 25 , 26 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Metabolic system\n\n【24】Malaria is often complicated by hypoglycemia, the symptoms of which may be masked by general anesthesia. Hypoglycemia results from diminished hepatic glycogen stores, hyperpyrexia, and impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis with anaerobic glycolysis. Hypoglycemia may also be an adverse effect of quinine therapy. Metabolic acidosis may result from impaired hepatic function, tissue hypoxia and renal impairment. Parasite lactate production, anaerobic glycolysis, tissue hypoxia and secondary to microvascular obstruction are the main factors for development of lactic acidosis. Fever is a common clinical finding, which under general anesthesia, along with the hyper-metabolic state seen in malaria, may lead to an increased end-tidal carbon dioxide level, being mistaken for malignant hyperthermia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\- 29 \\]</u>. Therefore, careful observation and perioperative monitoring of temperature and vital signs are essential in malarial patients. Patients with normal coagulation function including platelet counts may be candidates for regional anesthetic techniques as an alternative to general anesthesia. However, use of neuraxial anesthesia in patients at risk for secondary bacterial infections with bacteremia is not without risk. The development of meningitis and vertebral column abscess after regional anesthesia is rare, with sepsis and pregnancy being major risk factors. Recommended guidelines by the American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA) are that patients with evidence of systemic infection may safely undergo spinal anesthesia after appropriate antibiotic therapy has been initiated and a response to therapy has been seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】To date, there are only a limited number of reports in the literature regarding anesthetic care for patients with malaria  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 31 \\- 34 \\]</u>. Anesthesia providers should be mindful of the end-organ effects of the disease process. A relevant history of the presenting illness, a thorough physical examination, and careful preoperative assessment of diagnostic laboratory investigations to identify the pathogen and assess the severity of disease are key to effective perioperative care. Intraoperative monitoring and choice of anesthetic agents are chosen based on the end-organ effects of the disease and the anticipated physiologic impact of the specific anesthetic agents.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1.

AMI is extremely rare in young patients: in one study in Poland, individuals under age 40 represented only 1-6% of all AMI patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\- 5 \\]</u>. The rate of incidence has increased over years past in younger patients (< 35 years old) compared to older patients, and the age of onset is gradually falling, likely due to the following multiple risk factors such as smoking, obese, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia (higher level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C)), higher level of uric acid, history of coronary artery disease, family history of premature AMI, non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), and genetic polymorphisms related to blood coagulation, fibrinogen, homocysteine, being present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\- 9 \\]</u>. Among previous reports, current age of onset was 19 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\- 9 \\]</u>. Age range between 19 and 29 years, and female sex were the only categories in which the number of patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries was higher than those with atherosclerotic CAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This could mean that patients with normal coronary anatomy may not be having an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and could be presenting with symptoms due to other conditions, or out of fear that they may be experiencing an ACS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Etiological factors among the younger population are less studied and in patients under age 35 who have AMI, the atherosclerotic burden is very low 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 , 9 \\]</u>. Of these, young ST-elevation AMI (STEMI) patients aged 18 - 35 were characterized as being male, obese, smokers, and having a family history of ischemic heart disease, though there is also a prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\- 12 \\]</u>. To date, there have been no reports of STEMI in a young man with no previous clinical history of angina nor hereditary disease; therefore, we report the first such case, together with a brief review of literature.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】A 22-year-old Japanese man was transferred to our emergency department (ED) due to anterior chest pain. This symptom suddenly occurred at rest in the afternoon, and it was degree 10/10 (0: no pain, 10: worst pain imaginable), oppressive, persistent, and without cold sweat. He had never experienced this symptom, and it persisted at our ED for 50 min after the onset of symptoms. On the other hand, it was not accompanied by cold sweat, nor respiratory fluctuation. Furthermore, he had not caught a cold in the days before.\n\n【6】The patient’s medical history included an operation for a left inguinal hernia when he was 5 years old, essential hypertension, and grade 1 right hydronephrosis when he was 22 years old. He was given 80 mg of nifedipine and 4 mg of doxazosin mesylate for essential hypertension on a regular basis, and his blood pressure was well controlled.\n\n【7】The patient had no history of smoking nor drinking alcohol. No abnormal findings had been found on his regular medical exams. The patient worked part-time at a coffee shop, three times a week, and was allergic to dust and cedar pollen. He did not need any assistance for everyday life activities. His older brother, father, and grandfather all suffered from hypertension, and they took antihypertensive drugs. On the other hand, the patient had no family history of malignant disease. None of his family members had been diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).\n\n【8】The patient was 173 cm tall and weighed 77 kg (body mass index (BMI): 25.7). At our ED, his vital signs were normal other than hypertension, with blood pressure of 147/87 mm Hg, heart rate of 69 regular beats/min, body temperature of 36.5 °C, oxygen saturation of 100% in ambient air, and respiratory rate of 16/min; his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 points (E4V5M6). A 3 cm surgical scar was confirmed in the left inguinal region, but nothing else abnormal was detected upon physical examination, including skin and neurological findings.\n\n【9】Diagnosis\n\n【10】A routine laboratory examination, taken 60 min after the onset of symptoms, revealed increased values of alkaline phosphatase, urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, C-reactive protein, LDL-C, plasma glucose, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity troponin T, and deceased values of potassium and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). On the other hand, other values, including complete blood count and biochemistry, were normal .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Routine Emergency Department Laboratory Examination of the Patient |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【12】An electrocardiogram (ECG) taken 60 min after the onset of symptoms revealed ST elevation in anteroseptal leads (V1-V4), together with reciprocal ST depression in inferior leads (II, III, and aVF), and these findings were new compared to a previous ECG at the time of medical checkup taken a month ago . A transthoracic echocardiography confirmed severe hypokinesis of anteroseptal motion, and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was about 20-30%; however, other findings were normal. A plain computed tomography (CT) of the chest had normal results, with no evidence of a pulmonary embolism.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Electrocardiogram findings.

Normal findings. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【14】At this point, the patient was referred to cardiologists, with a suspected diagnosis of STEMI in the anteroseptal region. An emergency coronary angiogram (CAG) was carried out, using the left radial artery approach with a 6 French sheath, and it revealed an occlusion in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD): 100% occlusion at segment 6 . In addition, no abnormal findings, such as coronary artery aneurysm, were confirmed through the CAG. An intravascular ultrasound confirmed rich unstable plaque at the lesion. Raman spectroscopy revealed that the coronary plaque consisted of particularly lipid and calcium. On the other hand, the patient did not meet the criteria for FH. In addition, secondary hypertension was excluded by laboratory and imaging test including CT and magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

PCI: percutaneous coronary intervention. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【16】We established a diagnosis of STEMI in the anteroseptal region (100% occlusion at segment 6).\n\n【17】Treatment\n\n【18】The lesion was expanded to 0% stenosis through plain old balloon angioplasty , after which a third-generation drug-eluting stent (the Ultimaster <sup>® </sup> 3.5 mm diameter/24 mm length sirolimus eluting coronary stent) was installed there. The duration from arrival at our ED to coronary artery recanalization, or “door to balloon time”, was 2 h, and the duration from the onset of symptoms to coronary artery recanalization was 2 h and 50 min. The patient was stable after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and started a routine of 100 mg of aspirin, 75 mg of clopidogrel, 40 mg of telmisartan, 2.5 mg of bisoprolol fumarate, 4 mg of pitavastatin calcium, and 10 mg of ezetimibe, 1 day after PCI.\n\n【19】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【20】The maximum value of creatine kinase was 5,815 U/L, at 4 h and 30 min after PCI, and it gradually decreased after that point. The patient was discharged from the intensive care unit on the third hospital day without post ventricular arrhythmia or heart failure, and was stable afterward during his hospitalization. He was discharged on day 17. Afterwards, we confirmed that his post-PCI progress was satisfactory 14 days later. At that time, we performed ECG and it did not reveal atrial fibrillation. Therefore, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that may cause coronary embolic obstruction might have been ruled out. The clinical course of the patient is shown in Figure 3 .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3. Clinical course of the patient. The patient was transported to our hospital and diagnosed as STEMI, afterwards he was performed PCI and admitted on day 1. Afterwards, he was stable during his hospitalization.

PCI: percutaneous coronary intervention; CK: creatine kinase; ECG: electrocardiogram. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】We present the first known case of STEMI in a young man with no previous clinical history of angina, who did not have hereditary disease. The most important discussion point is why this 22-year-old man with well-controlled hypertension had an STEMI. STEMI cases in young population are very rare and the patients were all female 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Furthermore, this patient suffered from neither hereditary diseases, including FH, nor cardiovascular diseases, including previous anginal attack or Kawasaki diseases. In this case, suspected STEMI risk factors include obesity, hypertension, renal dysfunction, hyperuricemia, dyslipidemia, and abnormal glucose tolerance. In addition, he had a family history of hypertension and it also may be a risk factor of STEMI. We cannot declare mention clear reason why he had STEMI, but suspected reason is as follows. Though these were all mild, a combination of these six risk factors plus family history of hypertension might lead to this type of event. On the other hand, thrombogenesity examination using routine blood sample before heparinization was normal, therefore it could not lead to this atypical event. We suspect it is unique among young age and there is value in reporting this event.\n\n【24】Among these risk factors, patients with FH have a tendency to develop AMI at earlier ages, and patients with FH have double risk of cardiovascular events compared to non-FH patients, even for patients undergoing high-intensity lipid-lowering therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. High LDL-C levels since birth are known to have a correlation with early atherosclerotic disease onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Approximately one subject in 250 carries a genetic mutation that determines FH; there should be more representation of FH among subjects who have a documented CAD diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Therefore, identifying these subjects earlier could lead to improved management of their high cardiovascular risk, and identify possible FH relatives through cascade screening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. On the other hand, despite broad warnings and public information campaigns, smoking is still the most common modifiable risk factor in young adult STEMI patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. A significant decrease was seen in age-standardized AMI hospitalizations after a smoking ban was introduced, in a long-term follow-up in both younger and older patients, both male and female, though with differences regarding place of residence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. In addition, young patients have a low proportion of hypertension and diabetes, but these patients have high levels of LDL-C, uric acid, and homocysteine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. There was a 3-4‰ postnatal risk of Kawasaki disease, increasing with every birth year; patients with the disease face a significant risk of major cardiac events during childhood, such as AMI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. There was more frequent recurrence in younger patients, with a 1.9% probability of a major cardiac event (infarction, undergoing PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting, or death) by the time patients reach adolescence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. In addition, in younger women, spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has come to be increasingly recognized as a cause of myocardial infarction (MI), but treatment is often conservative because of revascularization risks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 \\]</u>. STEMI-SCAD is an important subset of STEMI, particularly among younger women, and generally brings a significantly higher frequency of left main or LAD culprit and cardiogenic shock compared to STEMI atherosclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Long-term exposure to air pollution and traffic noise has also been variably associated with the incidence of acute vascular events, including AMI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Notably, in this case, emergency service workers did not suspect AMI, despite the symptoms, due to the young age of the patient. In consideration of this, clinicians should include AMI as a differential diagnosis when they see patients suffering from chest pain, regardless of risk factors and age.\n\n【25】Similarly, even when traditional risk factors are not present, it is crucial to test aggressively for procoagulant markers in young patients who present with chest pain at high altitudes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. Introducing various highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays, as a part of clinical practice, has provided a new tool to help clinicians diagnose AMI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. In addition, compared to older age groups, young ACS patients had higher rates of STEMI, less extensive CAD, and more favorable prognoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 , 27 \\]</u>. However, implementing sex-specific cutoffs for ACS diagnosis and management still has unclear clinical utility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. On the other hand, a study from China of young STEMI patients (< 35 years old) found that coronary artery stenosis was common, with stenosis more likely to occur in the LAD branch 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In another report on young MI (< 35 years old), patients were found to have increased whole blood viscosity compared to the healthy control group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>. When comparing the ECG characteristics of men versus women (≤ 55 years old) with AMI, it was found that women did not have a different frequency of sinus rhythm from men, but that women did have shorter PR and QRS intervals and longer QTc intervals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. There was no difference between genders in intraventricular conduction disturbances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. Women showed a greater tendency to have abnormal anterior lead Q waves, and lower Q wave frequency in other territories, compared to men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. Among STEMI patients, women had lesser magnitude and extent of ST-segment elevation than men, causing STEMI diagnosis to be less common in women than in men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. In summary, significant differences were found among young patients by gender in ECG presentations of AMI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】The readmission risk trends with age vary by specific cause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. Age-targeted initiatives are therefore warranted in order to reduce the incidence of preventable readmissions in AMI patients who are undergoing PCI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. While younger patients (18 - 54 years old) had the lowest readmission rate (7.27%), younger patients had a greater risk of readmission than patients aged 55 - 64, both for all causes and for specific causes, such as AMI or chest pain (both cardiac and non-specific) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 , 31 \\]</u>. Among young patients with AMI, the likelihood of readmission was higher for women and for patients who had a prior AMI, increased depressive symptoms, longer inpatient length of stay, or diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. Patients aged 65 - 74 had a lower risk of readmission for all causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. Older patients (≥ 75 years old) had a lower risk of readmission for chest pain, but a greater risk of readmission caused by heart failure or infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. On the other hand, notably, in young AMI patients, several readmission predictors were psychosocial characteristics, rather than AMI severity markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】The clinical outcomes of patients with plaque erosion may be affected by the distinct variance, by age, in demographic, clinical, angiographic, and plaque phenotypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. Worldwide cardiovascular disease mortality is increasing, and onset age is gradually dropping 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. STEMI is associated with significant mortality, which leads to a loss of productive years of life, particularly in younger patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In younger patients with STEMI, the mortality rate is lower, but not negligible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Young patients also experience higher rates of cardiogenic shock, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and STEMI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. The risk factors associated with worse outcomes need to be investigated as soon as possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. Shock, contrast-induced nephropathy, HF with Killip class 2, and decreased LVEF served as particularly potent predictors of both adverse outcomes and long-term mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. STEMI patients were found to have larger infarct sizes, correlating to higher peak high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, and to have worse Killip scores 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. Unsurprisingly, patients who had normal coronary angiography were found to have better prognoses than those with stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Furthermore, a high BMI value was found to be an independent predictor of all-cause AMI mortality in the younger age group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. For these reasons, public health efforts are necessary, with the goal of reducing prevalence of these risk factors among the segments of the population that are constitutionally susceptible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Short-term mortality outcomes favored younger women over older women, though in-hospital management was similar for both groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>. Compared to younger men, younger women (≤ 65 years old) with STEMI were less likely to receive guideline-recommended pharmacotherapy and revascularization during hospitalization, and these younger women also had greater 1-year and in-hospital mortality rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 13 , 29 , 34 \\- 37 \\]</u>. Among adults with AMI, there was a higher risk of in-hospital mortality for younger adults with BMIs of 35.0 - 39.9 or ≥ 40, compared to non-obese patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. Existing work suggests that the differences in outcome are likely multifactorial in cause, but they may be at least partially explained by factors such as atypical presentation, delayed presentation, under-recognition of STEMI at initial medical contact, and underuse of medications due to concern regarding increased bleeding risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>. A stepwise increase was seen in long-term mortality from young to middle-age and older; compared to older age groups, young patients (< 45 years old) with STEMI have a more favorable prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 , 26 , 27 , 39 \\- 40 \\]</u>. More specifically, patients aged ≥ 65 have an in-hospital mortality that is three times higher 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 39 \\]</u>. There has been a more pronounced and persistent decline in emergent condition ED visits among older adults compared to younger patients, with fewer ED deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. This is cause for concern, given that this age group faces a greater prevalence and risk of poor outcomes for emergent conditions that are amenable to time-sensitive ED diagnosis and treatment; this may explain, in part, the excess mortality seen among older adults during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) era 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. It is additionally clear that there is great potential for improvements to AMI care without serious sequelae among the younger patient age group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 39 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】One important strategy for preventing CAD in the younger population is preventing or treating modifiable risk factors to reduce cardiovascular risk, such as smoking cessation, and aggressive lipid and weight control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 26 , 33 \\]</u>. For smoking in particular, it is very important to better understand the harms of smoking, and there is a need to enhance tobacco control education and guidance for quitting smoking, targeting young women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Additionally, studies in many countries have documented correlations between reduced AMI hospitalizations and anti-smoking policies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 \\]</u>. Specifically, cigarette tax policy and anti-smoking laws were associated with reductions in young adult hospitalizations for AMI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 \\]</u>. To ensure the effectiveness of these policies, anti-smoking laws need to be strictly enforced, and tobacco taxes need to be high enough to increase cigarette prices above and beyond the rate of inflation, to discourage cigarette purchases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 \\]</u>. On the other hand, particularly among the youngest age group, AMI survivors remain a high-risk group, reinforcing the need for both primary and secondary prevention, including effective patient education, to help improve long-term AMI patient prognoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 40 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】When comparing STEMI and non-STEMI (NSTEMI) among younger patients, the young STEMI group had, as its most prominent young-population risk factors: male sex, smoking, dyslipidemia with lower HDL-C level and hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, and a positive family history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 , 27 \\]</u>. On the other hand, in young adults, particularly the NSTEMI group, diabetes mellitus and hypertension remain potent CAD contributors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. In addition, across the whole group, and in both the STEMI and NSTEMI patient subgroups, no correlation was found between LVEF and protein carbonyl 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 42 \\]</u>. Both the STEMI and NSTEMI groups had significantly higher plasma-soluble extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer levels, compared to both the stable CAD and healthy control groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 43 \\]</u>. Furthermore, another study confirmed a hemorheological pattern impairment in young MI patients, which was partially influenced by infarction type (STEMI or NSTEMI); whole blood viscosity was higher in STEMI patients than NSTEMI patients, and persisted for long term 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>. In NSTEMI patients, the frequency, magnitude, and extent of ST-segment depression were consistent across genders, but women were less likely to have anterior ST-segment depression and more likely to have anterior negative T waves than men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. Prognoses were worse for younger patients presenting with STEMI than for those presenting with NSTEMI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. In addition, younger-age hospitalization was reported to have no differences by gender between STEMI; on the other hand, the similar result was not reported between NSTEMI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 \\]</u>. There was also no long-term mortality difference between STEMI and NSTEMI, though short-term mortality and morbidity were greater in STEMI than NSTEMI patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 , 27 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】This case study has a limitation: it only reviews a single case report and case series of STEMI in young person with no previous clinical history of angina nor hereditary disease. Therefore, the actual situation and nature of the disease may differ from the results of the literature review, as a result of reporting bias. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate the impact of gender on clinical presentation, treatment patterns, and outcomes of AMI in young patients. In addition, to better understand this rare case, a biopsy of the occlusion would help; however, it was not performed. The measured level of LDL-C was relatively high for his age and we should have ruled out sitostorolemia.\n\n【31】In conclusion, we present the first case of STEMI in a young man with no previous clinical history of angina nor hereditary disease. Like our case, STEMI could occur in a young man who has risk factors.\n\n【32】Learning points\n\n【33】Physicians should control all coronary risk factors favorably, even if in a young case.

They had slowly growing and varied in size between 0.5 - 1.8 cm. There weren’t no other cutaneous lesions, namely on the feet, neither palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. The muscle strength examination was normal and he practiced sport in a regular basis (football) without any limitation. Personal and familiar antecedents were unremarkable, with no history of hearing loss. Initially, the diagnosis of Gottron’s papules was considered and an analytical evaluation was performed, revealing normal whole blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (9 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (5.4 mg/L) and mildly elevated creatine phosphokinase (223 U/L, normal 38 - 174 U/L). The adolescent was referred to a Pediatric Rheumatologist who, in collaboration with a Dermatologist, concluded for the diagnosis of Knuckle pads. When questioned about repetitive trauma of the fingers, he confessed having the habit of chewing the lesions on a regular basis, especially when anxious. He wasńt concerned about cosmetic issues.

Aside from the skin, malignant melanoma has been observed in the eyes, gastrointestinal tract, head, and genital regions. The rectal region is the most frequently affected part in gastrointestinal malignant melanoma. These mucosal tumors, unlike the skin, derive their origin from the melanocytes in the non-keratinized squamous epithelium. Malignant melanoma of the rectum is an extremely rare and very aggressive tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It constitutes only 0.5-4% of all anorectal malignancies and less than 1% of all melanomas. Most patients present usually in the fifth or sixth decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Some cases have reported an association between rectal melanoma and Caucasian women; however, due to inadequate population-based studies, this remains inconclusive. The common presenting symptoms are rectal bleeding, anal mass, and changes in bowel habits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. PRM is lethal with a median survival of 24 months and 5-year survival of 10% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】A 72-year-old Caucasian male widower, with a past medical history of an alcohol use disorder, presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of bleeding per rectum, anal mass, and diarrhea for 11 months associated with anal pruritus and tenesmus. He denied any personal or family history of cancer. Significant findings on physical examination included a frail appearing elderly man with a distended abdomen, and a soft, tender, friable mass protruding from the anus. The skin was negative for any abnormal pigmentation or lesion. Significant laboratory findings included hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL (reference range of 14 - 18 g/dL), platelet of 247 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /mm <sup>3 </sup> (150 - 440 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /mm <sup>3 </sup> ), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 75.7 fL (80 - 100 fL), albumin of 2.8 g/dL (3.1 - 4.5 g/dL), aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT) of 28/21 U/L (15 - 37/12 - 78 U/L), serum iron of 18 µg/dL (65 - 175 µg/dL), ferritin of 17.9 ng/mL (22 - 322 ng/mL), and iron saturation of 6.2% (20-55%).\n\n【5】Diagnosis\n\n【6】The patient had a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of abdomen which showed numerous hepatic lesions, with the largest measuring 2.4 cm in diameter, a large soft tissue mass at the anorectal junction with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Colonoscopy revealed a mass at the rectum with friable mucosa, measuring about 3 cm .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Abdominoperineal resection (APR) surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy was discussed with the patient but he opted for palliative care with no intent for surgery or chemotherapy. The patient died 5 months after diagnosis.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】PRM is a type of melanoma arising from melanocytes in the rectal mucosa, more than 4 cm from the anal verge. This constitutes the primary difference from anorectal melanoma, which develops at or near the squamocolumnar junction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. PRM is a rare entity and not well documented in case reports and literature reviews. Most cases are misdiagnosed as hemorrhoids, adenocarcinoma, polyp, and rectal ulcer. Diagnosis is difficult for most clinicians due to its low incidence, non-specific symptoms, lack of melanin pigmentation, and histologic similarities with other cancers like lymphoma and sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Most cases reported a higher incidence of anal melanoma compared to PRM. Goldman et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> reported 49 cases of primary anorectal melanoma among 24,323 patients with anorectal tumors in the total Swedish population between 1970 and 1984. Of these 49 tumors, 45 (91%) were located at or near the anorectal junction, three at the anal verge (6%), and only one in the rectum (3%) approximately 8 cm from the anal orifice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Brady et al reported in another study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> that summarized the largest series of PRM in the literature at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 1929 to 1993. This retrospective review reported 85 patients who were considered to have primary anorectal melanoma. Seven patients (8%) had tumors that were considered primary rectal malignant melanoma, while 78 patients (92%) had tumors that arose in the anal canal or the anal margin. In our case report, our patient had PRM arising 5 cm from the anus with no other cutaneous lesion detected at the time of diagnosis.\n\n【14】The cause of mucosal melanoma remains unidentified. However, some reports have found the Caucasian race to be a predisposing factor. The rate of mucosal melanoma remains twice as higher in Caucasians compared to African Americans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Immunosuppression whether it is due to medications or infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with a high risk of melanoma. In a review of 619 patients who received cardiothoracic transplants, there was a 65-fold increased risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and a threefold increase in the risk of malignant melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Two susceptibility genes, CDKN2A and CDK4 , have been identified to be associated with melanoma. In familial melanomas, a mutation in the CDKN2A gene, on the short arm of chromosome 9, increases the risk of melanoma. This is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes tumor suppressor proteins p16 and p19. Mutations in this gene have been found in 25% of familial melanomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. In addition, BRAF mutations are frequently reported in nevi and malignant melanomas. The frequency of BRAF mutation in mucosal melanomas is low compared to that of primary cutaneous melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. In our patient, there was no family history of melanoma. Genetic testing was not done as he declined it. PRM has a high tendency of spreading with the most common sites for metastases being inguinal lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, hypogastric lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, liver, lung, skin, and brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. About 20% of recently diagnosed PRM patients are positive for lymph node disease in the inguinal region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Distant metastases are identified in about 26-38% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Biopsy through colonoscopy or proctoscopy is the gold standard to establish the diagnosis and staging of tumor extent. CECT and magnetic resonance imaging aid the characterization and extent of the tumor. A positron emission tomography scan can be used for lesions that are indeterminate on CECT. Histology and immunochemistry aid in the confirmation of diagnosis. Useful markers commonly used include S100 protein, Sox10, HMB 45, melan A, and microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 17 \\]</u>. Our patient’s biopsy was positive for Sox10 and S100.\n\n【16】PRM is staged on a clinical basis, focusing on locoregional and distant metastasis. Stage I is a local disease involving two categories (stage IA with a depth of 0.75 mm, stage IB with a depth 0.75 - 1.5 mm), stage II has increased thickness with ulceration and has two substages (stage IIA with a depth of 1.5 - 4 mm, stage IIB > 4 mm), stage III involves regional lymph nodes, and stage IV shows distant metastatic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】There is no consensus at this moment on which surgical approach is preferred in the treatment of malignant melanoma of the rectum. Traditionally, APR was recommended due to its ability to control lymphatic spread predominantly to mesenteric nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Most recent studies however suggest a less aggressive wide local excision (WLE). Combining radiation therapy with WLE has shown a decreased risk of local recurrence associated with this procedure. In a study carried out at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 54 patients who had WLE with radiotherapy between 1990 and 2008 had an excellent 5-year rate of local control with no significant improvement in survival rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. APR is usually indicated for bulky tumors especially those with > 4 mm thickness, extensive tumors involving the anal sphincter that is not amenable to local excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Some studies have shown that APR is associated with increased mortality, especially in those with lymph node-positive disease. Nusrath et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u> conducted a study on 30 patients with anorectal malignant melanoma, 15 had APR with a median survival of 13 months while five patients who had a WLE had a median survival of about 36 months. This was attributed to larger tumor size (3.5 cm) and positive nodal disease in the APR group compared to WLE. A retrospective study by Pessaux et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u> showed no significant difference in survival between those that had APR versus WLE. This was attributed to the small sample size. WLE however was recommended for patients with easily achievable negative surgical margin and APR, for those with extensive disease involving the anal sphincter. In a meta-analysis study conducted by Smith et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>, no oncological benefit was found between APR and WLE but recommended WLE with regular surveillance in most patients because of increased morbidity associated with APR. In some cases, surgical procedure is combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy in metastatic disease to achieve a good response. Chemotherapeutic agents used include cisplatin (CDDP), vinblastine (VB), dacarbazine (DTIC), interferon B (IFN), and interleukins (ILs)-2-8. According to a retrospective study by Kim et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>, the majority of patients who received combination therapy with CDDP/DTIC/VB/IFN showed a major response with a median survival of 12.2 months, and only one with a complete response had survival duration of about 43 months. Our patient had a tumor size of 3 cm with distant metastasis to the liver, reflecting stage IV disease. The benefit of APR with chemotherapy was discussed with him but he declined further treatment and opted for palliative care.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】The rarity of PRM and the limited number of patients who present early have prevented definitive trials examining the optimal treatment of curable rectal melanoma. Most patients however die irrespective of the therapy chosen due to the rapid tumor progression. Clinicians are therefore advised to carry out an appropriate investigation of any rectal mass encountered in practice.\n\n【20】Learning points\n\n【21】The takeaway point from this case is to make clinicians aware of primary rectal malignant melanoma and to consider it a differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with rectal bleeding with or without visible anal mass. PRM is an uncommon and aggressive disease that carries a poor prognosis. To enlighten readers about treatment modalities for PRM.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to acknowledge our library clerk Mr. Frederick Price for supplying us with articles to complete this manuscript.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This project was not supported by any grant or funding agency.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient described in the case report had given informed consent for the case report to be published.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Each author has individually been involved and participated in drafting the manuscript and revising it critically for important intellectual content and has given final approval of the version to be published.

We report the third case of metastatic breast from primary anorectal melanoma.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 59-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital in March 2007 with a 6-month history of rectal bleeding, tenesmus and weight loss. Physical examination revealed an ulcerative mass about 4 cm above the anal sphincter, without evidence of invasion in the sphincter. Proctosigmoidoscopy, with multiple biopsies, confirmed digital findings and concluded on anorectal melanoma. Pre-operative CT scan of the chest and abdomen showed no distant metastasis. Serum levels of tumor markers including carcinoembryonic antigen (ACE) and Ca 19-9 were within normal ranges. A typical abdominoperineal resection (APR) was performed. The pathologic stage was III Α according to the AJCC TNM classification. No adjuvant treatment was performed. Eighteen months later, the patient presented with 1-month history of a rapidly growing mass in the upper quadrant of the right breast. Physical examination confirmed a 3-cm diameter, firm and not fixed lump. There was no evidence of axillary lymphadenopathy. Mammograms showed a well-defined mass lesion, not obviously malignant . Core biopsies showed poorly differentiated carcinoma.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Lateral view mammography showing breast metastasis from anorectal melanoma. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【5】Immunohistological control proved to be negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER-2, and revealed positive HMB-45 and EMA. CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed no metastatic disease. The patient underwent mastectomy without axillary lymp-node dissection. After surgery, she received Six cycles of dacarbazine chemotherapy regimens. One year after the mastectomy, she is well with no evidence of recurrence.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Anorectal malignant melanoma is an aggressive malignant tumor. Most patients with such melanomas complain for bleeding, pain, or an anal mass.\n\n【8】Metastases occur via lymphatic and hematogenous routes and it has been reported that 38% of patients have already metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Lymphatic spread to mesenteric nodes is more common than to inguinal nodes while lungs, liver and bones are the most frequent sites of distant metastases. Metastases in the breast is very unusual and very rare localization of metastasis in anorectal melanoma. There are only two cases reported in the literature.\n\n【10】Breast metastases from extramammary primary tumors are uncommon, accounting for approximately 1.3-6.6% of all malignant mammary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Apart from hematopoietic neoplasms, cutaneous malignant melanoma is one of the most common neoplasms with which secondary involvement of the mammary parenchyma is known 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Clinical and radiological features mean it is often quite difficult to differentiate between a primary and a metastatic mammary neoplasm. Mammography shows an irregular mass with no calcifications. Correct management of metastatic disease to the breast can prevent unnecessary mutilation.\n\n【12】This rare incidence of metastases to the breast from tumors without any anatomical connection to the breast raises questions about the possible underlying mechanisms for such events.\n\n【13】It seems that breast metastases from malignant melanoma probably occur more frequently in younger than in older women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The predilection for metastatic spread to the breast in premenopausal women may be due to hormonal influences in the translocation of melanoma cells to the breast parenchyma. However, our patient, and also the two cases which were be reported on 1999, concern a post menopausal women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The finding of anorectal melanoma that has metastasized to the breast requires complete evaluation for diffuse metastatic disease, because in most cases it is associated with wide dissemination, in particular to the brain, lung, and liver.\n\n【15】It is essential to recognize that malignant tumors in the breast might be metastatic melanomas, so as to avoid unnecessary surgery. It is widely accepted that wide excision is sufficient to control all metastatic tumors of the breast.\n\n【16】It is very important for both surgeon and pathologist to consider the diagnosis of metastatic malignant melanoma. The treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma in the breast is excision of the lesion with clear margins, followed by systemic therapy for the primary disease, obviously after comprehensive evaluation of the staging.\n\n【17】Despite sporadic promising reports, regardless of surgical approach, metastatic anorectal melanoma remains a highly lethal malignancy with five-year survival less than 20% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】To our knowledge, only two cases of anorectal melanomas which have metastasized to the breast were reported in the literature. Our case is unusual not only in that the primary site is the anorectum, but also it was very succefully managed with one year free survival.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Competing Interest</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no competing of interest.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:52:34", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:52:39", "cost": 5.672}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:52:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:52:22"}

Of relevance to this unusual case, the requirement for surgical intervention is even scarcer with previous reviews demonstrating surgical management in less than one-third of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\- 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】An otherwise healthy 43-year-old lady was admitted to our hospital with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, fevers and vomiting. Her blood tests revealed raised inflammatory markers and a raised bilirubin of 87 µmol/L (reference range < 20 µmol/L). She was admitted under the gastroenterologists and treated for ascending cholangitis with intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis without signs of cholecystitis.\n\n【6】On day 1 of her admission, she underwent an ERCP. Her common bile duct (CBD) was cannulated with a guidewire and her CBD was swept via balloon with multiple stones extracted. A sphincterotomy was performed and a CBD stent was placed in an acceptable position and bile flowed freely through the stent. The ERCP recovery was uneventful and after convalescence with antibiotics, the patient was referred to the general surgeons. One week after ERCP, she proceeded to have a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Surgery was uneventful and upon discharge she was booked to have a repeat ERCP and removal of CBD stents under the gastroenterology team. Unfortunately due to the coronavirus pandemic, her appointment was postponed by several months.\n\n【7】After 5 months, the patient was admitted for elective ERCP with stent removal. During the procedure, her CBD stent was removed, a guidewire was again passed in to the biliary tree and a balloon sweep was undertaken, which removed further CBD stones. Post-procedure in the recovery department, the patient complained of right shoulder tip pain and worsening RUQ pain. This settled with analgesia and she was discharged home from the endoscopy suite. She re-presented the following day with severe RUQ pain and was found to be tachycardic. Computed tomography (CT) of her abdomen and pelvis with oral and IV contrast showed a large subcapsular hepatic hematoma affecting most of the right liver lobe with some mass effect on the inferior vena cava .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Progress CT scans showed a stable subcapsular hematoma without peritoneal extension. The patient’s pain improved and after remaining stable she was discharged on day 7 of the admission. Five days later, she re-presented to emergency department with a return of RUQ pain. Additionally, she also complained of shortness of breath, new fevers, malaise and lethargy. On assessment, she showed signs of sepsis and had a new oxygen requirement. Repeat CT imaging showed the continued presence of the large subcapsular hepatic hematoma and a new right-sided small pleural effusion.\n\n【11】She was admitted under the gastroenterology team and required admission to the intensive care department for on-going hemodynamic support. The patient was treated for an infected subcapsular hematoma and underwent interventional radiology (IR) guided drainage of the collection. Unfortunately, the drain did not facilitate resolution of the collection and the patient did not improve from a sepsis point of view.\n\n【12】The upper gastrointestinal (UGI) surgery team was consulted and after discussion with the treating gastroenterology team, the patient underwent laparoscopic washout of the infected collection. It was reported that the right lobe of the liver was densely adherent to the right hemidiaphragm with a necrotic capsule present. This was partially de-roofed and drainage of purulent liquid, necrotic debris and old blood was suctioned. Despite the laparoscopic washout, the patient required a further take back to theater 7 days later due to on-going fevers, raised inflammatory markers and a repeat CT which showed an on-going septated subcapsular collection. The surgical approach for the second operation included a partial necrosectomy of the collection and liver capsule and the cavity was thoroughly irrigated. No bile leak was seen and intra-operatively it was decided to leave a large caliber silicone double lumen sump drain in situ in the cavity, and to have continued irrigation of the sump drain post-operatively. In addition to the sump drain, two 28f Blake <sup>® </sup> drains were placed and kept in situ for several days.\n\n【13】Continued irrigation and drainage of the sump tube with normal saline was performed for 7 days. In addition to this, the patient had 40 days of IV antibiotics after Klebsiella oxytoca and Escherichia coli growth from the collection. This management was successful and the patient did not require any further surgical interventions. Continued monitoring of the drain output did not show any evidence of a bile leak during her recovery. Progress CT imaging several weeks after surgical intervention demonstrated significant reduction of the collection .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

This occurred due to a supratherapeutic antibiotic level causing a direct acute tubular necrosis. After the patient’s AKI resolved, she was discharged with her sump drain in situ and seen regularly by community nurses. She was reviewed regularly in outpatient clinic after discharge and the drain was systematically partially removed and shortened in size until eventually being completely removed without issue. She has been reviewed since drain removal and does not demonstrate any long-term complications from the admission.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Subcapsular hepatic hematomas are a rare phenomena and potentially life-threatening complication of ERCP. Fewer than 55 cases worldwide have been published in regards to this 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 \\]</u>. Whilst hemorrhage is a known side effect from ERCP, it is usually related to sphincterotomy. Bleeding from other areas such as spleen, liver and bowel are exceptionally rare. Whilst not proven, authors have reflected that the likely pathological mechanism for subcapsular hemorrhage is the ERCP guidewire causing a laceration to one or more intrahepatic vessels. Interestingly, in contrast to this hypothesis, there are cases of subcapsular hematomas where no guidewires have been used. The pathophysiology proposed in these cases is thought to be related to extractor balloon traction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】A commonality in presentation of affected patients is the complaint of abdominal pain post-procedure. Pain may not be localized to the RUQ and all abdominal pain complaints should be taken seriously and investigated appropriately. In most cases, patients developed pain within 24 h as with this case. As such any patient with post-ERCP abdominal pain should be investigated appropriately for subcapsular hematoma. However, there are reported cases with a delay in the development of pain of several days and thus any patient re-presenting to hospital after ERCP should be investigated appropriately 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In cases without pain, cardiovascular instability, fevers and drops in hemoglobin are documented as the primary symptoms or signs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Radiological modalities for diagnosis include abdominal ultrasound, CT and magnetic resonance imaging. However due to its relative ease of access, CT should potentially be proposed as the first-line imaging investigation. As well as imaging, serum tests such as hemoglobin, hematocrit and inflammatory markers are useful adjuncts for diagnosis but importantly do not exclude the diagnosis.\n\n【21】Management is largely supportive with most cases utilizing a non-operative approach. In combination with this, many cases reduce the risk of infected hematoma with IV antibiotics prophylactically. However, this case highlights that non-operative management is not always successful and percutaneous drainage or operative management has to be considered in unstable or septic patients already on IV antibiotics. The original treating team had opted for IR drainage but when this did not result in source control, the UGI surgeons were consulted.\n\n【22】Invasive treatment options should be considered for patients with cardiovascular instability, failure to improve, worsening sepsis, or evidence of on-going hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In this case, on-going sepsis and pain necessitated operative management. Interestingly, laparoscopic washout with necrosectomy of the subcapsular hematoma is not widely reported. Due to the extensive necrotic tissue and purulent material in the cavity found intraoperatively, decision was made to leave large abdominal drains in situ and commence continuous irrigation for several days.\n\n【23】Post-operatively, the patient made a swift clinical improvement. Undertaking necrosectomy and post-operative irrigation removed and controlled the significant septic foci. This, along with the prolonged course of IV antibiotics, allowed convalescence from the iatrogenic complication. In conclusion, this case highlights the necessary pragmatism required when managing a rare pathology and the flexibility needed to gain a successful outcome.\n\n【24】Learning points\n\n【25】Whilst extremely rare, subcapsular hepatic hematomas post-ERCP must be considered in patients with any post-procedural abdominal pain, cardiovascular instability, hemoglobin drop or fevers. Most resolve with non-operative management but IR and surgical intervention should be explored if patients become unstable or have worsening sepsis despite antibiotic therapy. Finally, we offer necrosectomy and continued irrigation as a potential safe treatment option for patients failing conventional treatments.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was gained prior to completing the case report.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RP contributed to the conception, writing and editing of the case report.

Infectious complications remain a leading cause of death after lung transplantation, accounting for 35% of deaths in the first year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a complication that has been increasingly reported in the recent years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u> and CI have been implicated in most cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. We report a case of TMA in a lung transplant recipient receiving tacrolimus, with concomitant infection.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 65-year-old Caucasian woman had received a bi-pulmonary transplant 6 months before the recent admission. The postoperative period was complicated with acute lung rejection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia and pulmonary thromboembolism (treated with high dose glucocorticoids, antibiotics and anticoagulation). She developed chronic renal failure in relation to CI nephrotoxicity. Her maintenance immunosuppression included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. Her prophylaxis included inhaled amphotericin B lipid complex, colistimethate and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. In March 2014, she was admitted for gastroenteritis and treated with ciprofloxacin and fluids. No lesions were found in endoscopic study and colonic biopsies were unremarkable. The CMV load blood assay revealed 36,000 copies/mL. Valganciclovir was added and mycophenolate mofetil was switched to mycophenolic acid with clinical improvement. In a follow-up visit in May 2014, spirometry showed decline in lung volumes and a bronchofibroscopy was performed. The patient missed next visits and stopped anticoagulation on her own. On July 2014, she was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea, cough, sputum and malaise for the last 2 weeks. On examination, she was tachypneic, and had BP of 105/63 mm Hg and HR of 97 bpm; lung auscultation showed crackles on the lower half of the right lung and rhonchi bilaterally. The remaining physical examination was unremarkable. Blood gas analysis showed hypoxemia with PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> ratio 210 and chest X-Ray showed a right lung hypodensity . Blood sample analysis revealed Hb 11.5 g/dL, leucocytes 10 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, 9.2 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L neutrophils, 0.3 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L lymphocytes, 249 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L platelets, urea/creatinine 126/2.59 mg/dL, Na <sup>+ </sup> 126 mEq/L, K <sup>+ </sup> 5.6 mEq/L, lactate dehydrogenase 338 U/L, and C-reactive protein 176 mg/L. A diagnosis of pneumonia was made. Reviewing the patient previous medical records, on routine bronchial lavage performed on May, Aspergillus fumigatus was identified on mycologic sample and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for A. fumigatus and CMV were positive. Transbronchial biopsy was not suggestive of rejection. She was admitted to intensive care unit and treated with piperacillin/tazobactam and voriconazol. The mycophenolic acid was suspended. A thoracic tomography scan (CT) revealed moderate loculated pleural effusion , and several areas of consolidation. Thoracentesis was performed and an exudative pleural fluid, rich in neutrophils with pH 7.3 was drained. On the second day, tacrolimus level was 68 ng/mL (range 5 - 20 mg/dL), probably in relation to interaction with voriconazol, and it was suspended. In the next days, the patient evolved with multiple organ dysfunctions: neurologic (normal brain CT), respiratory (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation was started) and electrical, with two episodes of atrial fibrillation. Due to clinical deterioration, high dose intravenous methylprednisolone was started for a possible acute rejection beyond infection. Renal failure progressed and patient started hemodialysis on the third day. At that moment, all the blood cultures were negative as well as the mycologic and bacteriologic cultures of pleural effusion. The PCR assay to A. fumigatus was negative but the PCR for CMV was positive in different pleural fluid samples. Blood CMV PCR showed 42,000 copies/mL. Ganciclovir was associated.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Chest X-ray showing right hypodensity. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. Thoracic tomography scan revealing a moderate volume pleural effusion. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【6】On the fifth day, patient developed progressive anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, schistocytes were present on peripheral smear and Coombs test was negative. A TMA, probably related to tacrolimus high levels, was identified and plasma exchange was initiated on the eighth day. Tacrolimus levels remained over therapeutic range until the ninth day. On the 11th day, due to unresponsiveness, plasma exchange was intensified to twice daily, without success, and on the 14th day, the patient died.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】The two main complications of lung transplant are rejection and infection. Differential diagnosis can be difficult, particularly in the cases when both entities coexist. This patient was initially treated for pneumonia and later, received high dose corticosteroids to a possible acute rejection. When the immunophenotyping of pleural effusion became available, it was not suggestive of rejection and the patient had no conditions for transbronchial biopsy.\n\n【9】At 6 months of transplant, opportunistic pathogens, as well as community and hospital acquired organisms have to be considered. In our patient, microbiologic results prior to admission suggested pulmonary aspergillosis and so voriconazol was started.\n\n【10】The CIs are essential components of maintenance immunosuppression following lung transplantation. They are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A and a variety of drug interactions can occur, namely with voriconazol, increasing the tacrolimus levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. There may be multiple mechanisms for toxic drug-mediated kidney injury. The CI (such as tacrolimus) can cause endothelial dysfunction and increased platelet aggregation possibly through the inhibition of prostacyclin. They also inhibit the VEGF function in renal endothelial cells and podocytes and cause gradual development of glomerular TMA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. This toxicity seems to be dose- and time-dependent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Tacrolimus-associated TMA is a rare, but potentially fatal, complication in solid organ transplantation, with an estimated incidence of 1-4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 10 \\]</u>. In lung transplant, the estimated incidence is 2.3%, but only four case series and 11 cases have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 , 8 \\]</u>. Fifty percent of cases occurred during concurrent disease as in our report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In a recent review, a survival rate of 38.9% was described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>; however, in the majority of case reports, TMA is associated with a favorable prognosis and managed with suspension or only dose reduction of CI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 10 , 11 \\]</u>. In our case, tacrolimus was stopped, plasma exchange was started and intensified but still without success. Prolonged toxic levels and severe concurrent disease may had been contributing factors for the adverse outcome in our patient.\n\n【12】Conclusions\n\n【13】As lung transplant is a growing reality, physicians should be alert to potential complications. TMA is a rare complication of CI, which in our case was more severe than the previously described in literature. Prolonged tacrolimus toxic levels and concomitant infection might have contributed.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:03:53", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:04:29", "cost": 35.653}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:04:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:03:52"}

It is a progressive degenerative disease of the joint that may lead to severe deformity and dysfunction. Bilateral knee neuropathic arthropathy is an exceedingly rare condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Given the rarity of Charcot arthropathy of the knee in general treatment is still controversial, with the trend nowadays toward total knee arthroplasty (TKA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Pathomechanism of the disease is still unknown. However, it is believed that the diminution or absence of nociception, results in poor joint protection and undetected microtrauma may lead to development of bone destruction and attenuation of ligaments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Furthermore, according to neurovascular theory, neurally stimulated vascular reflexes may provoke bone resorption. In the first half of the 20th century syphilis was the main cause of Charcot arthropathy. As syphilis declined due to antibiotic evolution, diabetes mellitus became the primary etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Diagnosis of Charcot arthropathy should include detailed history taking, and a complete physical examination, including neurologic tests. It is based on clinical findings such as warm and swollen painless joint and later radiographic evaluation, which may reveal joint dislocation, fractures, or deformities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】We report a case of Charcot arthropathy affecting both knees after a fifth lumbar vertebral (O5) fracture 35 years ago, which led to cauda equine syndrome and treated with bilateral total knee arthroplasty.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 65-year-old woman presented to the orthopaedic office on a wheelchair. The patient had suffered an O5 fracture 35 years ago which was treated conservatively, and produced a cauda equine syndrome. The symptoms of urinary incontinence, diminished sensation in both legs distally to the middle of both thighs and deep tendon reflexes were remaining. Furthermore, she presented with muscular weakness (2+/5) of both feet, and she used feet orthoses. The quadriceps strength was uneventful. The patient had no notable medical history concerning diabetes mellitus, syphilis, lacunar infarcts, rheumatologic disease and osteoarthritis, and she denied tobacco and alcohol use. She had suffered a right middle tibia fracture 5 years ago, which was treated with intramedullary nailing and fused uneventfully. After a period of 2 months she regained her prior walking ability and was able to walk using a walker. The last 2 years she gradually lost her walking ability due to gross instability of both knees.\n\n【7】The main complaints were progressively swollen knees with mild pain and increasingly instability with valgus deformity and crepitus for the last 2 years. Since then the patient was unable to weight bear due to gross instability, and she used a wheelchair. During her admission to the orthopaedic office both knees had similar clinical deterioration and radiological abnormalities. Gross abnormal mobility was present on clinical examination in both sagittal and coronal planes. Anterior and posterior drawer test were positive. Varus and valgus instability test were also positive.\n\n【8】The diagnosis of Charcot arthropathy was established using knee X-rays, which showed marked destructive changes, sclerosis, dislocation, and subchondral fractures of the knee joints .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Destructive changes are apparent. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【11】Due to the progressive inability to ambulate the patient decided to be treated with total knee arthroplasty (TKA). She underwent removal of the intramedullary nail first. Two months later she was operated on her right knee using cemented rotating hinged knee prosthesis, in order to accommodate bone loss and ligamentous insufficiency. On postoperative day 2, the patient could partially weight bear. Wound healing was uneventful, and on postoperative day 20 knee range of motion (ROM) was 115°/0°/0° (flexion/extension/hyperextension). Knee stability was restored, and she was allowed to weight bear. Three months later the patient underwent TKA at her left knee using identical technique. Postoperative course was uncomplicated, and on day 20, ROM was 120°/0°/0°. Six weeks later she was able to walk with the aid of a walker and was satisfied with the result.\n\n【12】We assessed the clinical outcome using the Knee Society Score (KSS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, which was calculated preoperatively and at the final evaluation 12 years postoperatively. There was an improvement from 25 to 90 points in knee score and from 0 to 30 points in function score, although she was continued to use walker due to her muscular weakness of both feet. Radiological evaluation also took place at the final follow-up, using radiographs. The position of components was evaluated for proper placement and loosening, with no apparent sings of malposition and progressive loose lines .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3. Twelve years postoperative X-ray, showing good component alignment, without loosening. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Neuropathic arthropathy was described by Jean Martin Charcot in 1868 as the progressive destruction of bone and soft tissue in patients with peripheral neuropathy. Almost 100 years later, Eichenholtz stated that the knee was the most common site of neuroarthropathy, and all these patients had tabes dorsalis. Since then and due to antibiotic evolution, the incidence of neurosyphilis has been declining, with diabetes mellitus constituting the most common reason for neuroarthropathy of joints in the lower extremity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Diabetic neuropathy most commonly involves the tarsal, tarsometatarsal and ankle joints 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Other causes are leprosy, meningomyelocele, syringomyelia and spinal cord injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Our case is the only one in the literature that followed vertebral fracture and cauda equine syndrome.\n\n【16】The pathophysiology of Charcot arthropathy is not fully understood. The current accepted theory states that in susceptible individuals with peripheral neuropathy, an unregulated inflammatory process is triggered which leads to an increase expression of the polypeptide receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-b ligand (RANKL). RANKL triggers the synthesis of nuclear transcription factor, nuclear factor-κβ (NF-κβ), and this in terms stimulates the maturation of osteoclasts from osteoclast precursor cells. Furthermore NF-κβ stimulates the production of the glycopeptide osteoprotegerin (OPG) from osteoblasts. All these events lead to continuing local osteolysis. The damaged nervous endings may also decrease the secretion of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). This peptide works as an antagonist of the RANKL synthesis and at the same time is responsible for the normal integrity of the joint capsule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The diagnosis is based on patient’s history, clinical examination, and imaging methods. Risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, syphilis, leprosy, alcoholism, syringomyelia, lacunar infarcts etc. which can lead to loss of deep sensation and proprioception, should be identified.\n\n【18】Typical symptoms in clinical examination of active neuropathic arthropathy are edema, erythema, warmth, and more than 2 °C difference in local temperature in comparison to the contralateral extremity. Pain occurs in about 50% of neuropathy cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Furthermore, the degree of pain does not correlate with the degree of joint destruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Differential diagnosis in acute stage of disease should be done especially between septic arthritis, osteomyelitis and microcrystalline arthritis. Our case presented with mild pain due to loss of sensitivity, despite the gross instability of both knees.\n\n【19】Radiograph is the preferred examination method concerning the imaging methods. The Eichenholtz classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> is still in use and it consists of three stages. Stage of development, which is an early stage of the disease, shows evidence of debris formation, fragmentation, disruption and dislocation of the articular margins. Stage of coalescence is characterized by absorption of much or all of the fine debris, sclerosis, and fusion of most large fragments. Finally, stage of reconstruction presents decrease sclerosis, rounding of major fragments, and some kind of reformation of joint architecture. Recently magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been broadly used to detect this condition early, as changes on X-ray are typically delayed and have low sensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Bone marrow edema as a finding in a patient with risk factors may depict neuropathic arthropathy in early stages.\n\n【20】The treatment of neuropathic arthropathy is conservative at the early stages of the disease prior to radiographic abnormalities. It is based on immobilization and complete absence of weight bearing for the affected extremity in the active stage. To support healing bisphosphonates, intranasal calcitonin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u> and teriparatide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u> have been used, but their efficacy is yet to be fully demonstrated. When the knee joint is affected, and radiological abnormalities are apparent, conservative treatment is insufficient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Arthrodesis has been the mainstay of operative treatment in the late stages of neuroarthropathy, despite a high incidence of failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Knee arthroplasty has been considered to be an absolute contraindication because of the high incidence of serious complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. However in recent years some authors have shown satisfactory results after knee arthroplasty in patients with neuropathic arthropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 \\]</u>. High incidence of serious complications, such as periprosthetic infection, aseptic loosening, and periprosthetic fracture, in these patients are related to significant bone loss, poor bone quality and ligamentous laxity. Recommendations for successful total knee arthroplasty include bone grafting or custom-augmented prosthesis to repair bony defects, correct ligamentous balancing, total synovectomy, and a complete armamentarium of the new implants.

There is still a lack of consensus regarding the optimal treatment when operative management is indicated. Although knee arthroplasty recently provides promising results, it is associated with high complication rates, is technically demanding, and needs a complete armamentarium of the new implants.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent has been received.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Athanasios Karageorgos: substantial contribution of the conception and design of the work; Andreas X.

His physical exam and initial venous studies of the left lower extremity suggested proximal obstruction. Further investigations included venography and intravascular ultrasound of the left iliac vein and inferior vena cava (IVC). These imaging studies revealed an area of compression from the adjacent right iliac artery causing narrowing of the lumen to 9 mm. This was deemed hemodynamically significant and correlated with the patient’s symptoms. Two self-expandable 14 × 40 mm Bard Luminexx stents (C.R. Bard, Murray Hill, NJ, USA) were deployed in the left common iliac vein at the area of stenosis. During the deployment of the second stent, the stent migrated into the IVC. It stayed on the guidewire and was recaptured with the balloon and repositioned in the desired location proximal to the first stent. Following deployment, an angiogram showed the two stents overlapping with the second proximal stent covering the targeted stenosis.

Therefore, a migrated iliac vein stent was presumed to be the source of this foreign body. A Bard IVC filter was placed to prevent mobilization of the remaining iliac stent to the heart. A percutaneous endovascular approach with a 10 mm straight snare was initially attempted to retrieve the migrated stent. The stent’s position near the tricuspid valve was concerning for papillary muscle and chordae tendineae damage and therefore the percutaneous attempt was aborted. The patient was referred for an operative extraction and underwent median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. The stent which was adherent to the anterior and posterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve was removed and the patient required tricuspid valvuloplasty, as well as annuloplasty due to a densely scarred valve using a Carpentier-Edwards annuloplasty ring (Edwards Life-sciences, Irvine, CA, USA). Post-operative echocardiogram demonstrated no tricuspid regurgitation. The IVC filter was left in place as a preventative measure.\n\n|  Figure 1.

Past medical history was significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Patient had a 20 pack-year smoking history. He denied alcohol or recreational drugs. Family history was unremarkable. On physical exam, he was afebrile with a blood pressure of 119/83 mm Hg, pulse rate of 80/min and a respiratory rate of 18/min. Complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were unremarkable. Initial troponin value was 0.369 ng/mL which peaked at 0.630 ng/mL. There were no acute ischemic signs on electrocardiogram. Two-dimensional echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction with no wall motion abnormalities. Cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed a patent left circumflex artery and a patent dominant right coronary artery, 50% ostial lesion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and severe myocardial bridging of the mid-LAD with near total occlusion during systole . After discussion with the patient, he was discharged on medical management with antianginals. Patient persisted to experience exertional chest pain during follow-up in the next 6 months. In light of the refractory nature of his symptoms, he was advised a surgical intervention which he refused. Hence, he was scheduled for a PCI.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

A 2.5 × 12 mm Emerge balloon was placed across the myocardial bridging segment and inflated up to 6 atm for 15 s, thereafter, a 3 × 20 mm Promus Promier stent was placed across the mid-LAD and deployed at 11 atm for 15 s resulting in resolution of myocardial bridging and a significant improvement of the distal flow . Post-stenting dilation was carried out up to 19 atm for 10 s. The patient immediately started complaining of chest pain after the dilation. Post-intervention angiogram revealed a focal free perforation in the distal part of the stented segment with extravasation of contrast freely into the left ventricular cavity . A decision was made to immediately stent the perforation with a 2.8 × 16 mm Graftmaster coronary stent graft. Post-stent dilatation was carried out up to 19 atm for 10 s.

Nevertheless, computed tomography (CT) angiography showed superiority over angiography in revealing this anomaly. In a recent study, Teofilovski et al examined 96 cadaver hearts from adult individuals of both genders in Serbia, and it was found that MB is not rare in the examined sample and often associated with other congenital anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Affected individuals are usually asymptomatic. Symptomatic presentations can range from exertional angina to rare acute coronary syndrome or even sudden death due to arrhythmias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Conservative medical management using antianginals is the initial preferred approach with special consideration to avoid nitroglycerin as it may aggravate the symptoms by intensifying the systolic compression of the bridged segment and enhances the retrograde flow in the proximal segments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. However, in refractory cases, a percutaneous or surgical approach may be required. Interventional cardiologists are often apprehensive about a percutaneous approach due to high restenosis arte 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u> besides the risk of potential life-threatening perforation which can be tricky to manage. The implement of the intravascular ultrasound helps to scrutinize the coronary anatomy and carefully select the appropriate balloon size to avoid the perforation risk to some extent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Traditionally, when perforations do occur, prolonged balloon dilation proximal to the site of perforation to prevent tamponade is the preferred approach, along with reversal of anticoagulation. However, with improving stent prosthesis, management of these perforations has been shown feasible with the help of covered stents. In our case, we successfully repaired the perforation with the help of Graftmaster coronary stent graft system (Abbott Vascular). The Graftmaster stent graft is indicated in repair of coronary artery perforation and is contraindicated in cases where treatment area is limited to allow full balloon dilation or placement of the stent graft. Previous cases have reported perforation of the bridged segment of coronary artery into the right ventricle and the pericardial space . We here report the first case of perforation of a tunneled coronary artery into the left ventricle. A repair of perforation was performed using a stent graft with good results.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1.

Symptomatic myocardial bridging can often be refractory to medical management requiring intervention. Perforation is a rare complication if the bridged segment is percutaneously intervened and yet can be successfully repaired using a stent graft.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:41:17", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:41:28", "cost": 10.541}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:59", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:41:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:41:07"}

He underwent endotracheal intubation for airway protection. CT of head was done on admission showing acute left occipital stroke. MRI of brain showed multiple areas of stroke in acute ischemia in the left occipital lobe, right anterior midbrain, pons, left side of the medulla, right superior cerebellar hemisphere and left centrum semiovale . Lumbar puncture results were consistent with S. pneumoniae meningitis. Further workup revealed pneumococcal bacteremia and pneumonia. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a mobile 10 mm vegetation on the mitral valve. His HIV results and urine toxicology screen on admission were negative. He remained hemodynamically stable and received empiric antibiotics and steroids but showed no improvement in mental status. He was evaluated by cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery but no plans for surgical intervention were made since he remained hemodynamically stable. His course got complicated by sudden massive subarachnoid hemorrhage leading to immediate brain herniation and death.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Austrian syndrome is a rare manifestation of invasive disseminated pneumococcal infection comprised of the triad of pneumonia, endocarditis and meningitis. First published in 1957 by Dr. Robert Austrian, it is a rare complication in today’s antibiotic era but carries a high mortality around 60% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Austrian’s syndrome remains rarely reported in the literature.\n\n【9】Aronin et al mentioned that 116 or 59% of the 197 reviewed cases of pneumococcal endocarditis had concurrent meningitis and that 29 of those had Austrian’s triad 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. A review by Gonzalez-Juanatey et al identified two cases of Austrian’s syndrome over a 15-year period at their institution in Lugo, Spain and reviewed an additional 16 well-defined cases from the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Their review confirmed that alcoholism and liver cirrhosis are significant risk factors for invasive pneumococcal disease, occurring in eight out of 16 patients. The aortic valve was involved in 12 out of 16 patients and valve replacement was required in eight out of 12 patients. Other significant risk factors include sinus infection, immunosuppression, splenectomy and IV drug abuse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Patients typically are chronically ill males in their fifth to sixth decade. Complications include heart failure, suppurative pericarditis, tamponade and septic emboli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Endocarditis is usually left-sided and involves aortic valve more commonly. Embolic events occur in 22-50% of cases of endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Given high mortality and complications, early valve replacement should be considered.\n\n【11】Our patient had mitral valve involvement on echocardiogram and did not undergo surgery since he remained hemodynamically stable. His ICU course got complicated by sudden massive subarachnoid hemorrhage, brain herniation and death. Subarachnoid hemorrhage has not been described in the literature as a possible complication of this syndrome. The pathophysiologic mechanism includes either rupture of mycotic aneurysm or septic embolic infarction.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】Austrian’s syndrome should be considered early in patients with S. pneumoniae bacteremia and altered mental status in patients with risk factors. Patients are usually very sick and need ICU admission. It carries a high complication and mortality rate, despite early antibiotics. If surgery is indicated, early valve repair may decrease mortality. Pneumococcal vaccination does provide protection from invasive pneumococcal disease.

We describe a case of amelanotic malignant melanoma mimicking a neuropathic ulcer in a non-diabetic patient.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】This 85-year-old non diabetic patient presented to our vascular clinic with a 6-month history of a painless, hypergranulated 5 cm ulcer on the planter aspect of his left foot overlying the fifth metatarsal head . Initial community based management with antibiotics and regular dressings showed no improvement to the ulceration. Further investigations from clinic showed no evidence of infection or underlying osteomyelitis raising the clinical suspicion of an amelanotic melanoma. Punch biopsy of the lesion revealed malignant melanoma with Computerised Tomography (CT) staging showing no evidence of distal metastases. The patient was referred to the Plastic Surgeons who excised the lesion, which involved an amputation of his fifth toe at the level of the metatarsal joint and reconstruction with a split skin graft. The pathology report confirmed the presence of acral-lentiginous melanoma of 17 mm Breslow depth. The lateral margin of clearance was 12 mm and the deep 2.5 mm . After further discussion at a multidisciplinary team meeting no further resection was needed or adjuvant treatment required. Less than one year later the patient was re-referred to the oncology service with local disease recurrence with nodular lesions to his left foot, lower limb and groin. Further imaging with CT and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning confirmed left foot, leg and nodal metastasis to groin. A 6-week course of palliative radiotherapy was commenced with good symptomatic improvement. Review three months later showed rapidly progressive local recurrence with further radiotherapy having only a limited impact.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Despite its relative rarity this form of melanoma represents an aggressive lesion with a predilection for the plantar surface of the feet, palms of the hand and digits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\- 9 \\]</u>. Melanoma presenting on plantar and subungal sites are associated with a higher rate of misdiagnosis and subsequent delay to management and intervention, relative to other anatomical sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The propensity for plantar surfaces along with the amelanotic nature of our patients melanoma were important factors in delaying his referral to a tertiary center.

This case highlights the importance of a raised index of clinical suspicion when presented with a non progressing foot ulcer despite appropriate medical management. Despite a normal CT scan at initial diagnosis the case discussed went on to have rapidly progressive disease with metastatic involvement further illustrating the importance for greater awareness and need for an aggressive management strategy in such cases.\n\n【9】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:57:17", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:57:27", "cost": 9.342}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:58", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:57:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:57:16"}

It is characterized by excessive and prolonged bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction with increased platelet size and deformability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Patients with BSS have a defect in or complete lack of the key glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex, normally found on the surface of platelets. The GPIb-IX-V is important in initiating platelet aggregation and thrombosis after vascular injury by facilitating the adhesion of platelets to von Willebrand Factor (vWF), which is exposed on the vascular subendothelium after blood vessel injury. The binding of GPIb-IX-V to vWF results in a decrease in velocity of platelets as they move past damaged vessel walls and is critical in the process of initiating thrombosis to repair damaged vasculature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. In addition to mediating adhesion of platelets to the blood vessel wall at sites of vascular injury by binding vWF, the complex facilitates platelet activation at low concentrations of thrombin, which may have roles in the platelet formation and turnover given that BSS is associated with decreased number and abnormal size. The lack of or defect in the functioning of GPIb-IX-V results in a compromised ability to initiate platelet adhesion and aggregation resulting in a bleeding diathesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Diagnosis is confirmed by platelet function testing with lack of platelet aggregation in response to ristocetin. We present a 17-year-old adolescent with BSS who presented for posterior spinal fusion for idiopathic scoliosis. Previous reports of perioperative care of patients with BSS are reviewed and options for anesthetic care including correction of the coagulation defect are presented.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Institutional Review Board approval is not required at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH, USA) for the presentation of single case reports. The patient was a 17-year-old, 70.9 kg girl who presented for posterior spinal fusion to treat adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Her past medical history was positive for BSS, diagnosed at 3 years of age on platelet function testing for presentation of easy bruising and excessive bleeding. She also had been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, diagnosed at age of 9 years with genetic testing and idiopathic scoliosis. Due to the BSS, she has macrothrombocytopenia with a baseline platelet count in the 50,000 - 70,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Her past surgical history was positive for one orthodontic procedure that did not involve anesthesia and resulted in no complications. Although prior platelet transfusions had resulted in an inadequate increase in her platelet count, work-up for platelet specific antibiotics was negative. Her medications at the time of surgery included tranexamic acid (1,300 mg PO TID) to control menstrual bleeding, celecoxib (100 mg PO BID) for menses-associated pain, an oral probiotic and a benzoyl peroxide 10% topical wash. Physical examination revealed a well-nourished and well-developed young woman in the 85th percentile for weight and 89th percentile for height. She denied any recent health concerns and her vital signs were unremarkable. Her airway examination revealed a Mallampati class I airway with a thyromental distance greater than three fingerbreadths. Her cardiorespiratory examination was unremarkable. She was eager to proceed as prior posterior spinal fusion (PSF) surgery, scheduled 3 months earlier, and was cancelled due to inadequate response to two platelet transfusions, resulting in a platelet count of 74,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> , which did not meet the desired threshold of 100,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Given the inadequate response to previous platelet transfusions, after hematology consultation, a plan was devised to further address these issues perioperatively and her surgical procedure was rescheduled. The platelet count the day prior to surgery was 72,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> and she received one unit of pheresed platelets, which increased her platelet count to 78,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Other coagulation parameters including prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and international normalized ration (INR) were within normal limits. Due to previous issues with a limited response to platelet transfusions, it was decided to monitor in vivo coagulation function using the rotational thromboelastogram (ROTEM®). The values were within normal limits except for a prolongation of the clot formation time (CFT). The patient was kept nil per os for 6 h before being transported to the operating room following premedication with intravenous midazolam (2 mg). Routine American Society of Anesthesiologists monitors were placed followed by anesthetic induction with propofol (200 mg), lidocaine (100 mg) and sufentanil (20 ìg). Endotracheal intubation was facilitated by the administration of rocuronium (65 mg). Following anesthetic induction, two large bore peripheral intravenous cannulas and an arterial cannula were placed. To facilitate neurophysiological monitoring per our usual protocol, maintenance anesthesia included desflurane titrated to maintain the bispetral index at 50 - 60 and a sufentanil infusion adjusted from 0.1 - 0.3 ìg/kg/h to maintain the mean arterial pressure at 55 - 65 mm Hg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Maintenance anesthesia was supplemented by continuous infusions of lidocaine and esmolol. Prior to the start of the surgical procedure, a second unit of pheresed platelets was infused along with a single dose of recombinant factor VIIa (1 mg). The dosing of rFVIIa was repeated every 2 - 3 h intraoperatively. Tranexamic acid was administered intraoperatively (loading dose of 50 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 5 mg/kg/h during the procedure). The ROTEM® was followed during the perioperative course and remained at baseline except for a persistent mild elevation of the CFT. Intraoperatively, surgical hemostasis was adequate as judged by the surgical team. No allogeneic packed red blood cells were administered. Intraoperative cell savage was used with the return of 350 mL of salvaged and washed blood. The surgical procedure was accomplished in 4 h 25 min with an estimated blood loss of 900 mL. At the completion of the procedure, the patient’s trachea was extubated and she was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit and then to the pediatric ICU for 24 h. Her postoperative hemoglobin remained stable at 9 - 10 gm/dL. On postoperative day 1, she received one unit of pheresed platelets for a platelet count of 56,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Postoperatively, å-amino caproic acid (Amicar) was administered intravenously and then by mouth for a total of 10 days. No other allogeneic blood products were administered during the postoperative course and although her platelet count decreased to a nadir of 39,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> , there was no clinically concerning bleeding and her ROTEM® values remained stable. Her postoperative course was unremarkable and she was discharged to the inpatient ward on postoperative day 1 and home on postoperative day 5.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】BSS is a rare inherited disorder affecting platelet function with decreased aggregation, decreased numbers and decreased function. As such, excessive bleeding may occur spontaneously, following trauma or during surgical procedures. Although the glycoprotein defect results in the ineffective interaction of vWf with the vascular endothelium, the disorder cannot be corrected by the administration of vWf and other strategies are needed. Our case was unique in two respects including our patient’s refractory state to the administration of allogeneic platelets with minimal increase in the platelet count. Despite this, work-up did not reveal platelet antibodies or other issues that might be amenable to corticosteroid therapy or plasmapheresis.\n\n【6】While the mainstay remains the administration of allogeneic platelets, adjunctive strategies have included the administration of antifibrinolytic agents (ε-amino caproic acid or tranexamic acid), recombinant factor VIIa and 1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP). To date, there are a limited number of reports in the literature regarding the perioperative care of pediatric patients with BSS  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 6 \\- 15 \\]</u>. While the mainstay of therapy includes platelet transfusions, adjunctive therapies have included desmopressin, anti-fibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid or ε-aminocaproic acid) or recombinant factor VIIa. Given our patient’s inadequate response to platelet transfusions, we chose to use adjunctive agents to augment platelet and coagulation function including tranexamic acid and recombinant VIIa.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Reports of Perioperative Care of Patients With Bernard-Soulier Syndrome |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【8】Tranexamic acid is a synthetic, lysine-derived antifibrinolytic agent used to slow the breakdown of thrombin and fibrin, thereby limiting blood loss in various surgical procedures and in trauma patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. By reversibly blocking the five lysine binding sites on plasminogen, tranexamic acid prevents the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and the degradation of fibrin. Tranexamic acid has been shown to effectively limit blood loss during orthopedic procedures on the spine even in patients with normal preoperative coagulation function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. In addition to its effects on the fibrinolytic process, tranexamic acid also improves platelet function through poorly understood and controversial mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Clinical studies have demonstrated that tranexamic acid attenuates platelet aggregation defects created by antiplatelet treatment or by uremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 21 \\]</u>. These effects may explain its anecdotal success in patients with BSS and other platelet defects.\n\n【9】In addition, we chose to use recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa), a synthetic hemostatic agent originally used to treat bleeding in hemophilia A patients who had developed inhibitors to factor VIII 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 23 \\]</u>. Given its integral effect of coagulation function, rFVIIa has also been used to treat bleeding of various other etiologies in many clinical scenarios. Following disruption of the endothelial barrier of blood vessels, tissue factor (TF) is exposed and binds factor VIIa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. The complex of TF and VIIa initiates the extrinsic coagulation cascade with the activation of factor X to Xa, which in association with cofactor Va, leads to the formation of thrombin from prothrombin. The conversion of prothrombin to thrombin occurs on the surface of activated platelets, resulting in the cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin, which is crosslinked and further recruits platelets to propagate the thrombus. Though not well understood, rFVIIa, by directly activating factor X, is thought to help compensate for low or dysfunctional platelets by increasing the generation of thrombin and the subsequent activation of platelets are activated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 , 26 \\]</u>. In addition to these proposed cellular mechanisms, rFVIIa has been shown to anecdotally be a valuable adjunct in preventing or the treatment of bleeding in patients with qualitative and quantitative platelet disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Given that the routine laboratory parameters of coagulation function (PT and PTT) do not demonstrate the clinical interaction of the various components of the coagulation cascade or adequately demonstrate platelet function, we used the ROTEM® to evaluate and follow in vivo coagulation function in our patient. Despite the presence of persistent thrombocytopenia following platelet transfusions, coagulation function was clinically adequate to allow for completion of the surgical procedure. The ROTEM® is a modification of the thromboelastogram that identifies clot formation and strength by using an electromechanical transduction system that measures the amount of rotational force transmitted by the developing clot 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 29 \\]</u>. The system involves the suspension of ball from a rod in a rotational device. The rotation of the ball is impeded as the clot develops, thereby characterizing the patient’s hemostatic ability. Clot development in vivo is dependent on the interaction of platelets with coagulation factors which can be evaluated by the pattern seen on the ROTEM®. The propagation of clot and the pattern can also be followed to evaluate for clot lysis (fibrinolysis), hence evaluating the efficacy of agents. We utilized the coagulation profile provided by ROTEM® to assess our patient’s qualitative response to platelet transfusions, response to adjunctive agents (tranexamic acid and rFVIIa), the risk for perioperative bleeding and transfusion needs in the perioperative period.\n\n【11】In summary, we present the perioperative care of an adolescent with BSS for PSF. Although platelet transfusions remain the mainstay of therapy to prevent or treat bleeding, adjunction agents including anti-fibrinolytic agents or rFVIIa have been shown to be useful. Our anecdotal experience adds to the literature suggesting the demonstration of utility of bedside point-of-care coagulation function monitoring using the ROTEM®. With such care, even invasive surgical procedures can be accomplished with minimal sequelae related to the primary bleeding disorder.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:55:20", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:55:26", "cost": 5.961}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:58", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:55:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:55:11"}

The disorder was first reported in 2005 in a cohort of four young women who presented with psychiatry symptoms, altered mental status, hypoventilation, and memory deficits with coincidental ovarian teratomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is postulated that the pathogenesis is the result of the effects of autoantibodies against NMDA receptors throughout the body. These auto-antibodies are formed in response to the neuronal tissue in the ovarian teratomas. The disorder has been most commonly reported in young African-American women between 18 and 35 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It is the second most common cause of immune-mediated encephalitis, after acute disseminated encephalomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Patients typically evolve into a state of unresponsiveness with disturbances in motor and respiratory function after an initial presentation with psychosis, memory deficits, seizures, and language disintegration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Prior to the identification of the exact pathogenesis of this immune-mediated process, many of these patients were erroneously diagnosed with schizophrenia and other mental health issues. The diagnosis is suggested by the clinical symptomatology, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytosis, and delta or theta activity on the electroencephalogram (EEG). Confirmation of the diagnosis is now possible by the demonstration of specific antibodies in the CSF against the NMDA receptor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Treatment typically involves plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, as well as chemotherapy and surgery if a tumor is present.\n\n【3】Given the associated changes in central nervous system function and its association with abdominal teratomas, anesthesia is frequently required for radiological imaging or surgery. We present an adolescent with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis who required anesthetic care for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging. End-organ involvement and its impact on perioperative care is discussed. The interaction of the anesthetic agents that target the NMDA receptor and its potential impact on anesthetic care are reviewed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Institutional Review Board approval is not required for retrospective review, and publication of a single patient case report is not required by the Institutional Review Board at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, Ohio). At the time of the procedure, the patient was an 8-year-old, 28 kg male, scheduled for an MRI of the brain due to fatigue, altered mental status, abnormal shaking movements, and seizure-like activity along with fever and vomiting. His current medical history included seizures, chronic pain, and anxiety, along with a recent diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis with confirmation by the identification of antibodies in the CSF against the NMDA receptor. The patient had been previously treated with immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab. There was no past surgical history. The patient had no known drug allergies. Current medications included cyproheptadine and oral nystatin.\n\n【6】General physical examination revealed a normal thyromental distance and a Mallampati Class I airway. The physical examination and preoperative vital signs were unremarkable. The anesthetic plan, risks, benefits and alternatives to general anesthesia were discussed with the parent and informed consent for general anesthesia was obtained. The patient was held nil per os for 8 h, was transported to the MRI suite, and standard American Society of Anesthesiologists’ (ASA) monitors were placed. Anesthesia included the administration of a bolus dose of propofol (1 mg/kg) through an indwelling peripheral intravenous access followed by a propofol infusion at 150 µg/kg/min. Additional medications included ondansetron (3 mg). Intraoperative fluids included 200 mL of lactated ringers. The MRI, which lasted approximately 60 min, was completed with minimal blood loss and no intraoperative complications. Following completion of the MRI, the patient was transported to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). His postoperative course was unremarkable. He was discharged to the inpatient ward from the PACU.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】The NMDA receptor is a ligand-gated cation channel responsible for synaptic transmission and plasticity. In anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, there are antibodies against the NR1-NR2 heteromers of the NMDA receptor, which bind glycine and glutamate, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 6 \\]</u>. The auto-immune process leads to accelerated destruction of the NMDA receptor and a decrease in their surface density. This ultimately leads to decreased synaptic NMDA-R-mediated currents and decreased glutamatergic synaptic function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. This reversible loss of the current and synaptic dysfunction is the pathogenesis of the central nervous system effects including memory loss, behavior irregularity, psychosis, and cardiorespiratory changes including arrhythmias and hypoventilation.\n\n【9】As with any anesthetic care, appropriate preoperative preparation begins with a thorough preoperative examination and identification of end-organ effects of the disease process. Of primary concern is the potential for cardiovascular and respiratory involvement. Cardiovascular involvement may include cardiac dysrhythmias (most commonly tachycardia) and blood pressure instability (most commonly hypertension), as a result of autonomic dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. These episodes have been labeled “paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity or PSH” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Autonomic dysfunction may also manifest as abrupt episodes of bradycardia or asystole and hypotension. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be indicated for patients who are manifesting these clinical signs. Postoperative hemodynamic and continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring may be indicated based on the intraoperative course. Medications to treat hemodynamic instability and PSH should be readily available including beta adrenergic antagonists, antihypertensive agents, anticholinergic agents, epinephrine, and vasopressors (phenylephrine).\n\n【10】Also of concern is the significant central nervous system (CNS) involvement including psychosis, agitation, memory deficits, seizures, and language disintegration. This may limit patient cooperation and mandate sedation or general anesthesia for non-invasive procedures including radiologic imaging as was required in our patient. Preoperative management strategies to limit the potential for perioperative seizures include optimizing and confirming therapeutic anticonvulsant levels prior to the surgical procedure. Routine anticonvulsant medications should be administered the morning of the procedure despite concerns of the patient’s nil per os status with subsequent intraoperative dosing as needed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Alternative routes of delivery (intravenous or rectal) may be required when enteral administration is not feasible. Consultation with the neurology or pharmacology service may be helpful to determine dosing conversion from enteral to intravenous administration or to guide intraoperative redosing. Another intraoperative issue is the potential for intraoperative hyperthermia related to the autonomic instability of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. During general anesthesia, blunting of the normal thermoregulatory mechanisms and peripheral vasodilatation with increased heat loss place pediatric patients at a greater risk of hypothermia than adult patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. This concern generally holds true even during MR imaging when radiofrequency radiation emitted by MRI scanners can be absorbed by the patient as heat energy, creating an increase in body temperature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. However, given the potential for alterations in body temperature (both hypothermia and hyperthermia), intraoperative temperature monitoring, in accordance with ASA guidelines, is suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Significant intraoperative hyperthermia may require investigation and differentiation from more serious conditions such as malignant hyperthermia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】CNS involvement may also impact upper airway control and the patient’s ability to clear upper airway secretions thereby placing these patients at risk for aspiration. Based on the patient’s CNS involvement and nil per os status, techniques to limit the risk of aspiration during anesthetic induction including rapid sequence intubation, and airway control with endotracheal intubation may be indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. Given the limited upper airway involvement of our patient, we chose to provide deep sedation with a propofol infusion without airway instrumentation for MR imaging.\n\n【12】Postoperative respiratory failure related to upper airway control, altered central control of ventilation, and impaired clearance of pulmonary secretions may also occur, leading to postoperative respiratory insufficiency. These problems may be exacerbated by the residual effects of anesthetic agents, the surgical procedure, poor cough effort, and the use of postoperative opioids for pain management. These effects may be minimized by the use of short acting agents for sedation and general anesthesia such as propofol, desflurane or remifentanil. As the patient’s cognitive state allows, incentive spirometry may improve postoperative respiratory function. Non-invasive techniques of respiratory support such as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) may be used to facilitate postoperative tracheal extubation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Depending on the severity of the patient’s end-organ involvement, postoperative monitoring of respiratory function may be required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】The NMDA receptor, along with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are the two main receptors postulated to be involved with the mechanisms of general anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>. Given the involvement of the NMDA pathway, avoidance of medications that act directly through these receptors is suggested  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Ketamine binds to the phencyclidine binding site of the NMDA receptor and inhibits glutamate triggered calcium influx. The mechanism of action of ketamine is similar to the pathogenesis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis thereby explaining the similarity of ketamine’s clinical features with the clinical features of the disease itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 \\]</u>. Volatile anesthetic agents such as isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane result in a 50% depression of NMDA receptor-mediated currents when used at levels close to the minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration. Although these agents enhance transmission through the GABA transmission, they also inhibit both NMDA-gated currents and NMDA-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Similar effects are noted with propofol thereby leading to indirect effects on the NMDA system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 24 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Medications With Direct and Indirect Effects on the NMDA Pathway |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【15】To date, there are a limited number of reports regarding the anesthetic care of patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 25 \\- 27 \\]</u>. The majority of these reports have noted the safe and effective use of the general anesthetic agents including propofol and desflurane, neuromuscular blocking agents including vecuronium and rocuronium, and opioids including fentanyl, remifentanil, and hydromorphone. However, Lapebie et al noted the anecdotal and temporal association of sevoflurane and propofol with worsening of the neurologic status including seizures in a 24-year-old woman with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis related to an ovarian teratoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. Anecdotal experiences by two separate groups of investigators have suggested the potential for an exaggerated effect of propofol on blood pressure with hypotension in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 28 \\]</u>. It has been suggested that there may be decreased anesthetic requirements related to the effects of the disease process on the NMDA system. Other factors that may impact perioperative care include the treatment paradigms including use of immunosuppressive agents, long-term administration of corticosteroids, and plasmapheresis. We would suggest avoidance of agents that have significant and direct effects on the NMDA system . In severe cases, the use of benzodiazepines and opioids which have no known effects on the NMDA pathway may be preferred. Additionally, dexmedetomidine with its novel mechanism of action may offer an additional option for sedation during MR imaging, although its potential to cause hemodynamic effects including bradycardia must be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\- 31 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no financial conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflicts of interest to report.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Institutional Review Board approval is not required for the retrospective review, and publication of a single patient case report is not required by the Institutional Review Board at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A.K. designed and wrote the initial manuscript; M.H. wrote and revised the case report; J.U. and J.T. conceived of the case report, participated in its design and coordination, and helped to draft the final manuscript.

It is identified by the tunneled major epicardial coronary artery, which courses intramurally and proceeds beneath the muscular bridge. This pathology was first recognized in 1737 by Reyman during autopsy, whereas it was first defined angiographically in 1960 by Portman and Iwing.\n\n【2】Myocardial bridge is usually limited to the mid segment of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. The main angiographic sign is the systolic press including epicardial coronary artery. Moreover, intracoronary Doppler studies demonstrated characteristic impairment in diastolic flow. The degree of press on coronary artery caused by myocardial bridge depends on the level of cardiac contractility, as well as length, thickness and localization of muscular bridge.\n\n【3】Although it is traditionally considered as a benign condition, the literature reveals complications such as ischemia, acute coronary syndrome, coronary spasm, ventricular septal laceration, arrhythmia, atrioventricular block, stunning, transient ventricular dysfunction, sudden death, and premature death following cardiac transplantation, which have been associated with myocardial bridge.\n\n【4】The case, which presented with the clinical picture of acute coronary syndrome and had atherosclerosis and thrombotic obstruction that accompany muscular bridge, which caused critical stenosis in LAD following coronary angiography, is first case in literature. The present case has been introduced with the literature owing to its clinical findings and the difficulties encountered at treatment phase.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 35-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency room with chest pain that started at rest in the morning and has been extremely severe in the last 30 min. He has had squeezing and burning-like chest pain during effort, or sometimes at rest, for approximately 1 month. He is receiving no medication. He has no family history of coronary artery disease. He has no hypertension, diabetes or hyperlipidemia, but smoking history of 1 package/day. On his physical examination, body temperature is 36.6 °C, blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, respiratory rate is 14/min, pulse rate is 75/min, and saturation by pulse oximeter is 98%. Cardiac sounds are rhythmic, S1-S2 normal, and there is no extra heart sound or murmur. Both hemithoraces are equally involved in breathing and there is no rale or rhonchi. Abdomen is loose with no distension, rebound or tenderness. Peripheral pulses are palpable. On laboratory analyses, the only pathological finding was troponin-I, which was found to be 0.174 ng/mL (normal range: 0 - 0.033 ng/mL). Electrocardiography revealed ST elevation in the anterior leads . The patient was immediately admitted to the coronary angiography (CAG) laboratory for percutaneous intervention. The CAG demonstrated normal left main coronary artery; muscular bridge that caused stenosis over 95% in the mid segment of the LAD during systole and thrombotic obstruction that caused stenosis by 70% in the same segment during diastole ; normal circumflex artery; and normal right coronary artery. Three flows were detected in the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) in distal LAD. At this point, antithrombotic and antiaggregant treatment was commenced including enoxaparin sodium (8000 anti-Xa IU, 2 × 1/day via subcutaneous route), acetyl salicylic acid (300 mg tablet, 1 × 1/day via oral route), clopidogrel (75 mg 1 × 1 via oral route ), metoprolol (50 mg tablet, 2 × 1/day via oral route), and tirofiban hydrochloride monohydrate infusion (10 µg/kg as 3-min bolus injection followed by 0.15 µg/kg/min maintenance dose). After 30 min, it was observed that chest pain relieved and ST elevation on the ECG regressed , and angiographic improvement was determined. The patient underwent angiography again after being treated for 24 h and it was observed that the lesion in LAD has persisted . Therefore, we wavered between percutaneous intervention to the lesion and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery; however, it was decided to perform surgical intervention to the coronary artery as the literature revealed that complications due to the stents implanted in the places where muscular bridges exist are more frequent.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Until now, many studies have been published that associate the infarctions in young patients, who had muscular bridge without coronary atherosclerosis and in whom acute myocardial infarction has been identified, to myocardial bridges 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】This anatomic configuration has pathophysiological structure. Studies demonstrated that these muscular bands are present since birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Incidence rates show variations. The incidence of myocardial bridge determined by CAG is reported between 1.5% and 16%, whereas it is reported to reach 80% in autopsy series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The LAD coronary artery is the most important artery influenced by muscular bridges. Anatomical studies demonstrate that muscular bridges exist between proximal one-third and middle one-third segments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Some scientists have tried to classify muscular bridges. Geiringer divided the muscular bridges into two groups. In the first type, it is surrounded by muscular structure and courses along the deep of interventricular sulcus, whereas in the second type, muscular bridge originates from trigonum fibrosum and surrounds the LAD up to the apex of the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The relation between ischemia and myocardial bridges is well defined and symptoms are removed by surgical excision of myocardial bridges 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Hill et al demonstrated that distortion may develop during systole and relaxation would be delayed during diastole when LAD artery coursed beneath muscular bridge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, some individuals with muscular bridge are asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Ishimori et al reported that giving glycerol nitrate while using vasoactive medication in the patients with myocardial bridge did not musk LAD stenosis and resulted in ischemia in some cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Therapeutic approach includes beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, stents, minimal invasive CABG surgery, and surgical myotomy. Nitrate administration is not recommended since it enhances systolic stenosis and worsens symptoms. Although there is no study demonstrating that myocardial perfusion defect has been normalized before stent implantation, Klues et al expressed that stent implantation may remove hemodynamic abnormalities and may improve symptoms. Haager et al followed 11 patients without any lesion except for symptomatic muscular bridge in central position and had stent implanted in this region. They observed minimal increase in mean lumen diameter after stent implantation. They demonstrated that this increase is significant with IVUS. However, 50% of the patients developed mild-to-severe stenosis during 7-week follow-up period and two patients underwent PTCI, whereas two patients underwent CABG. Two-year clinical follow-up showed no abnormality. Haager et al emphasized that the stent they had used has modified modular structure with flexible sulcus.\n\n【18】Myocardial bridge in the LAD and coronary atherosclerotic lesion in the same localization accompanied by thrombus is not a common condition. In conclusion, it was difficult to make a therapeutic decision in the present case because of his age and presence of atherosclerotic thrombotic lesion, which caused diastolic stenosis and persisted despite optimal medical therapy.

Eight weeks earlier he had developed bradycardia and dizziness, and he underwent pacing generator replacement.\n\n【6】His past medical history includes two myocardial infarctions (30 and 15 years ago). A dual chamber rate adaptive (DDDR) pacemaker was implanted 11 years ago to manage his grade 3 atrioventricular (AV) block. He had been hypertensive for more than 30 years. Mild myocardial hypertrophy with inferior wall hypokinesia but normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) were seen on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) 1.5 years before along with left atrial (LA) dilatation and moderate mitral and aortic sclerosis with trivial regurgitation without stenosis and normal right-sided cavities.\n\n【7】Initial workup on admission included an electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrated regular atrial driven ventricular pacing.

There was no significant enhancement in the arterial phase, and the mass was slightly hypodense in the portal phase . The main trunk of the pulmonary artery (PA) and the right PA were dilated at 4 cm and 3.5 cm respectively. There was a large filling defect representing a thrombus in the upper lobe branch of the right PA and smaller filling defects in the lower lobe subsegmental branches of the right PA . A pulmonary nodule measuring 1 cm in diameter was detected in the upper lobe of the left lung, which was thought to be benign due to low CT density. No other pulmonary nodules or enlarged lymph nodes were found . Incidentally, a significant filling defect in the right atrium (RA) of the heart with subtotal obliteration of the appendage was found.

The mass seemed to be attached to the lateral wall of the RA and surrounded the pacemaker electrode fixed in the RAA. Part of the mass was moving through the tricuspid valve orifice into the right ventricle (RV) during diastole but did not cause any obstruction . The function of both ventricles was normal. There was mild hypertrophy of the left ventricle, and both atria were slightly dilated. There were no signs of pulmonary hypertension or pericardial effusion.

Cefuroxime 4.5 g/day was given intravenously (IV). Due to marked thrombocytopenia (66 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) enoxaparin was administrated in a reduced dose (6,000 U/day). The patient was clinically stable, and his blood cultures were negative. Notwithstanding this, fever, WBC, and CRP remained at the same level as on admission. Therefore, antibacterial treatment was switched on the fifth day (ampicillin + sulbactam 4.5 g/day IV and gentamicin 240 mg/day IV). Fondaparinux (2.5 - 7.5 mg) was injected subcutaneously instead of enoxaparin due to a suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Despite these changes in treatment, he remained febrile for the next 5 days the temperature was between 38.2 and 38.5 °C. He also complained of pain in the whole body.\n\n【14】In the purpose of follow-up of the dynamics another TTE and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed 9 days after the first TTE. In the RA we found a multilocular mass with several interconnected immobile and mobile structures with soft tissue echogenicity attached to the lateral wall. The dimensions had increased up to 6.0 × 2.6 cm, and it was partly moving into the RV during diastole without obstructing the inflow to the tricuspid orifice . Besides, an immobile part of the mass of 5.5 × 3.0 cm was seen in the RAA, which extended to the ostium of the superior vena cava (SVC) not obstructing the blood flow. The immobile mass in the RAA surrounded the pacing electrode without infiltrating the atrial wall or causing pericardial effusion. Furthermore, no vegetations were suspected on the cusps of the tricuspid valve and the pacemaker electrodes.\n\n【15】ECG-gated contrast-enhanced CT of the thorax was performed 10 days after the first whole-body CT to depict the mass in more detail. A large irregularly shaped soft tissue mass with signs of contrast enhancement in the portal phase, measuring 5.8 × 4.4 × 5.6 cm was found extending into the RAA. Compared to the previous CT scan, the structure had grown in size, partially surrounding the atrial pacing lead. The second 5.0 × 2.2 cm mass was mobile, moving between the RA and RV.\n\n【16】The ventricular pacing lead was separated from the mass. Malignant looking upper lobe nodule of the left lung had enlarged, and a small area of subpleural right lung consolidation had developed there as well. There was still a sizeable inhomogeneous density thrombus filling the upper lobe branch of the right PA, which raised the possibility of a tumor thrombus. The expansion in the right lobe of the liver also raised suspicion of a malignant process. Taking into account the potential metastatic nodule in the left lung, potentially malignant mass in the liver and enhancing mass in the RA of the heart, there was strong suspicion for metastatic disease with the potential primary tumor being in the liver. There were neither signs of infection in the area of the implanted pacemaker nor deep vein thrombosis on ultrasound.\n\n【17】Although the patient’s high fever subsided only temporarily, SatO <sub>2 </sub> was 88% (with O <sub>2 </sub> 2 L/min), platelets (PLTs) dropped to 25 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (it was thought to be associated with the increased consumption), WBC and CRP did not decrease, and the patient remained clinically stable. Repeated blood cultures were negative. We could not exclude infection of the pacing electrodes. Therefore, we suspected that the structures could still be covered by thrombotic mass, which can result in an endocarditis-like clinical picture. Since the patient refused all invasive diagnostic procedures (including a biopsy), his conservative management was based on clinical symptoms. Piperacillin with tazobactam 4 g/0.5 g/day IV was replaced after 4 days with imipenem and cilastatin 0.5 g/0.5 g/day IV, and also vancomycin 2 - 3 g/day was given IV. Subcutaneous antithrombotic treatment was administered as well.\n\n【18】Four days later magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen was performed in purpose to characterise the hepatic lesion in detail. It was T1 isointense and T2 hyperintense with signs of marked diffusion restriction. We could not acquire contrast-enhanced series due to his inability to hold the breath. The mass showed a slight late enhancement in the delayed phase series. Additionally, a capsule-like peripheral enhancement was detected with characteristics not typical for a primary liver tumor. It was unclassifiable, possibly an atypical hemangioma. The differential diagnosis also included a hypovascular metastasis.\n\n【19】Three days later the patient’s general condition destabilised, he complained of dyspnea, tachypnea, weakness, and melena developed. His Hb decreased to 95 g/L, PLT to 10 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, WBC increased (37 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). On gastroscopy at the large curvature, an ulcer (0.7 cm) covered with fibrin and surrounded with petechiae and a polyp (0.3 cm) were found. Despite the reduction of the dose of fondaparinux (2.5 mg, subcutaneously) and infusion of red blood cells, PLTs and freshly frozen plasma the patient deceased 21 days after his admission.\n\n【20】Post mortem examination of the heart revealed a large white-greyish nodal mass in the RA with a diameter of 6.5 cm, which was tightly fixed to the lateral wall. Tumor mass extended into the RAA and extended partially through the ostium of the tricuspid valve into the ventricle, not obstructing it. In the ostium of the SVC, a non-occlusive tumor (2.0 × 5.0 cm) was found of the same consistency and color, covered with thrombotic mass. The RA pacing electrode, which was fixed to the appendage, was surrounded by a tumor and thrombotic masses. The ventricular pacing electrode was fixed in the apical septal area of the RV. Both electrodes were covered with thrombotic masses. Macroscopically and histologically there were no findings for endocarditis or vegetations. The LV was moderately hypertrophic, and the mitral annulus was calcified. Two post-infarct scars measuring up to 2.0 cm were found in the septal and posterolateral walls of the LV. Coronary tree revealed diffuse non-occlusive atherosclerotic plaque disease.\n\n【21】In the apical area of the left lung, there was a roundish grey nodule measuring 1.5 cm. In the small branches of the pulmonary arteries, many small emboli (histologically confirmed as osteosarcomas) were found bilaterally. In the lower lobes of both lungs, there was partial atelectasis with 900 and 1,100 mL of pleural fluid respectively.\n\n【22】In the central part of the right hepatic lobe, a roundish pinkish-white tumor was found in subcapsular location consisting of some small nodes and measuring 3.5 cm.\n\n【23】The prostate revealed a 4.5 cm yellow-pink honeycomb-like lobulated nodule. The sigmoid colon demonstrated moderate diverticulitis. The abdominal or thoracic cavities were free of enlarged lymph nodes.\n\n【24】Histology was performed in the Departments of Pathology of North Estonia Medical Centre and the Hospital Graz II. The tumors in the heart  and the lungs  had a myxoid appearance and consisted of the spindle and pleomorphic rhabdoid and sometimes signet-ring cells, which were immunohistochemically negative for cytokeratins (AE1/AE3), desmin and smooth muscle actin, but at least partially positive for osteonectin. Focally, osteoid-like material could be seen. In the sections from the heart, the tumor was found within the lumen, but it did not infiltrate the myocardium. The hepatic tumor revealed a solid and papillary architecture and consisted of polygonal cells with eosinophilic and clear cytoplasm and marked nuclear pleomorphism. Immunohistochemistry was positive for hepatocyte antigen and cytokeratins but negative for osteonectin . The histological diagnosis of a poorly differentiated (high-grade) sarcoma with osteogenic differentiation in the heart with metastasis to both lungs was established. The hepatic tumor was considered a poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Sections from the prostate demonstrated a moderately differentiated acinar adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 6 (3 + 3) .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

Also, hepatocellular carcinoma and prostatic adenocarcinoma were detected.\n\n【29】Usually, diagnostic problems arise in the case of a previously undiagnosed tumor in the heart. Primary cardiac tumors are rare. Both primary and metastatic cardiac osteosarcomas are extremely rare, and less than 100 cases of antemortem diagnosis have been described altogether 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 \\- 12 \\]</u>. Diagnosis can be more complicated in a patient with a cardiac pacemaker with a variety of diagnostic possibilities such as a thrombus, a caseous calcification of the valvular annulus, primary or metastatic tumor, abscess or endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】In our case the fast and exact path to the diagnosis was complicated due to contradictions in history: recently changed pacing generator, the unusual clinical course of the disease simulating inflammation, tumor or thrombus surrounding the electrodes in the right heart, liver mass, nodules in the lung and filling defects in the pulmonary arteries. Since the clinical course was simulating pacemaker-endocarditis or a thrombus on the electrode, antibacterial treatment was initiated. Diagnostic alternatives considered were a primary malignant tumor in the liver with metastasis into the right side of the heart and to the lungs and a primary heart tumor with metastases to the lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 17 , 18 \\]</u>. Since antibacterial treatment with different and combined antibiotics was ineffective, a strong suspicion of a malignant tumor (above all in liver) arose, with a concept based on earlier clinical observations that most of the metastases located in the right chambers of the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u> and up to 3% of patients with carcinomas have cardiac metastases identified at autopsy. Liver malignancies are one of the most frequent tumors to spread directly through inferior vena cava 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Our patient did not complain of aching bones; clinically a tumor was not suspected, and a bone scan was not performed. Nevertheless, metastatic skeletal tumor thrombi most often from femur and humerus extending to the heart have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\- 22 \\]</u>. In rare cases, extra-skeletal osteosarcoma may spread via the hematogenous route to an unusual cardiac localisation such as the LA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Primary cardiac osteosarcoma of the right side of the heart is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 24 \\]</u>. The clinical manifestations, regions of metastases (more than 50% to the lungs), imaging features, and laboratory tests are similar to other types of primary cardiac tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 25 \\]</u>. Calcifications on imaging (CT) are crucial for differentiating osteosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>, but we encountered a case that was difficult to diagnose because imaging revealed no calcifications. The pathogenesis of primary cardiac osteosarcoma is not clear. It could develop through metaplasia of connective tissue or by malignant degeneration of embryonic somatic residues, which arise from undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells in the myocardium and transform into active osteoblasts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 27 \\]</u>. Proposed etiological factors are a mechanical injury by causative agents and radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Furthermore, the heart is known to have a skeleton. Namely, fibrous trigone and annulus are the essential parts of it. Histologically the annulus has fibrotic and elastic fibres, and this structure is also in continuity with valvular leaflet tissue, the atrium and the ventricles. The hypothesis of the pathogenesis of cardiac osteosarcoma could be based on malignant metaplasia and transformation of fibrotic and elastic fibres, which makes up the trigone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】We also considered the opportunity that the undifferentiated cardiac tumor developed from metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma by dedifferentiation. We very carefully investigated both tumors histologically and by several immunohistochemical markers and did not find any similarity based on histomorphological and immunohistochemical features. Therefore, we concluded that it is more likely that the tumors in the heart and the liver are independent neoplasms, the former with pulmonary metastases. However, we did not perform molecular analyses to rule out a metastatic disease in the heart completely. Acinar adenocarcinomas of the prostate are common in advanced age and therefore, not an unexpected finding.\n\n【34】Multiple primary malignancies are common only in 3-5% of tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. Despite its low incidence, the association of two malignancies in a single patient has been widely reported in the literature, while only a relatively small number (0.5%) of three malignancies have been described including primary cardiac sarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\- 32 \\]</u>. Some cases of cardiac sarcomas (pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma, angiosarcoma) in pacemaker patients are described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 33 \\]</u>. At the same time, there are no clinical reports of patients (with or without a cardiac pacemaker) with primary osteosarcoma of the heart after double carcinomas of the liver and prostate. Only immunological studies have demonstrated that novel cytokine interleukin-32 (IL-32) could be involved in cancer development, including prostate, liver and heart (adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and osteosarcoma) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】Conclusions\n\n【36】We conclude that there is most likely a collision of two carcinomas: hepatocellular carcinoma and osteogenic sarcoma of the heart. The prostatic adenocarcinoma is a common finding in senior men. From the provided histology it is more likely that the tumors of the heart and the liver are independent. However, without molecular analysis (which was not performed) de-differentiation in a metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cannot be excluded entirely. Injury of an electrode as a mechanical factor in the pathogenesis of cardiac osteosarcoma is not yet confirmed.\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TL, KK and LK were involved in patient care and writing the manuscript.

The dimensions had increased up to 6.0 × 2.6 cm, and it was partly moving into the RV during diastole without obstructing the inflow to the tricuspid orifice . Besides, an immobile part of the mass of 5.5 × 3.0 cm was seen in the RAA, which extended to the ostium of the superior vena cava (SVC) not obstructing the blood flow. The immobile mass in the RAA surrounded the pacing electrode without infiltrating the atrial wall or causing pericardial effusion. Furthermore, no vegetations were suspected on the cusps of the tricuspid valve and the pacemaker electrodes.\n\n【15】ECG-gated contrast-enhanced CT of the thorax was performed 10 days after the first whole-body CT to depict the mass in more detail. A large irregularly shaped soft tissue mass with signs of contrast enhancement in the portal phase, measuring 5.8 × 4.4 × 5.6 cm was found extending into the RAA. Compared to the previous CT scan, the structure had grown in size, partially surrounding the atrial pacing lead. The second 5.0 × 2.2 cm mass was mobile, moving between the RA and RV.\n\n【16】The ventricular pacing lead was separated from the mass. Malignant looking upper lobe nodule of the left lung had enlarged, and a small area of subpleural right lung consolidation had developed there as well. There was still a sizeable inhomogeneous density thrombus filling the upper lobe branch of the right PA, which raised the possibility of a tumor thrombus. The expansion in the right lobe of the liver also raised suspicion of a malignant process. Taking into account the potential metastatic nodule in the left lung, potentially malignant mass in the liver and enhancing mass in the RA of the heart, there was strong suspicion for metastatic disease with the potential primary tumor being in the liver. There were neither signs of infection in the area of the implanted pacemaker nor deep vein thrombosis on ultrasound.\n\n【17】Although the patient’s high fever subsided only temporarily, SatO <sub>2 </sub> was 88% (with O <sub>2 </sub> 2 L/min), platelets (PLTs) dropped to 25 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (it was thought to be associated with the increased consumption), WBC and CRP did not decrease, and the patient remained clinically stable. Repeated blood cultures were negative. We could not exclude infection of the pacing electrodes. Therefore, we suspected that the structures could still be covered by thrombotic mass, which can result in an endocarditis-like clinical picture. Since the patient refused all invasive diagnostic procedures (including a biopsy), his conservative management was based on clinical symptoms. Piperacillin with tazobactam 4 g/0.5 g/day IV was replaced after 4 days with imipenem and cilastatin 0.5 g/0.5 g/day IV, and also vancomycin 2 - 3 g/day was given IV. Subcutaneous antithrombotic treatment was administered as well.\n\n【18】Four days later magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen was performed in purpose to characterise the hepatic lesion in detail. It was T1 isointense and T2 hyperintense with signs of marked diffusion restriction. We could not acquire contrast-enhanced series due to his inability to hold the breath. The mass showed a slight late enhancement in the delayed phase series. Additionally, a capsule-like peripheral enhancement was detected with characteristics not typical for a primary liver tumor. It was unclassifiable, possibly an atypical hemangioma. The differential diagnosis also included a hypovascular metastasis.\n\n【19】Three days later the patient’s general condition destabilised, he complained of dyspnea, tachypnea, weakness, and melena developed. His Hb decreased to 95 g/L, PLT to 10 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, WBC increased (37 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). On gastroscopy at the large curvature, an ulcer (0.7 cm) covered with fibrin and surrounded with petechiae and a polyp (0.3 cm) were found. Despite the reduction of the dose of fondaparinux (2.5 mg, subcutaneously) and infusion of red blood cells, PLTs and freshly frozen plasma the patient deceased 21 days after his admission.\n\n【20】Post mortem examination of the heart revealed a large white-greyish nodal mass in the RA with a diameter of 6.5 cm, which was tightly fixed to the lateral wall. Tumor mass extended into the RAA and extended partially through the ostium of the tricuspid valve into the ventricle, not obstructing it. In the ostium of the SVC, a non-occlusive tumor (2.0 × 5.0 cm) was found of the same consistency and color, covered with thrombotic mass. The RA pacing electrode, which was fixed to the appendage, was surrounded by a tumor and thrombotic masses. The ventricular pacing electrode was fixed in the apical septal area of the RV. Both electrodes were covered with thrombotic masses. Macroscopically and histologically there were no findings for endocarditis or vegetations. The LV was moderately hypertrophic, and the mitral annulus was calcified. Two post-infarct scars measuring up to 2.0 cm were found in the septal and posterolateral walls of the LV. Coronary tree revealed diffuse non-occlusive atherosclerotic plaque disease.\n\n【21】In the apical area of the left lung, there was a roundish grey nodule measuring 1.5 cm. In the small branches of the pulmonary arteries, many small emboli (histologically confirmed as osteosarcomas) were found bilaterally. In the lower lobes of both lungs, there was partial atelectasis with 900 and 1,100 mL of pleural fluid respectively.\n\n【22】In the central part of the right hepatic lobe, a roundish pinkish-white tumor was found in subcapsular location consisting of some small nodes and measuring 3.5 cm.\n\n【23】The prostate revealed a 4.5 cm yellow-pink honeycomb-like lobulated nodule. The sigmoid colon demonstrated moderate diverticulitis. The abdominal or thoracic cavities were free of enlarged lymph nodes.\n\n【24】Histology was performed in the Departments of Pathology of North Estonia Medical Centre and the Hospital Graz II. The tumors in the heart  and the lungs  had a myxoid appearance and consisted of the spindle and pleomorphic rhabdoid and sometimes signet-ring cells, which were immunohistochemically negative for cytokeratins (AE1/AE3), desmin and smooth muscle actin, but at least partially positive for osteonectin. Focally, osteoid-like material could be seen. In the sections from the heart, the tumor was found within the lumen, but it did not infiltrate the myocardium. The hepatic tumor revealed a solid and papillary architecture and consisted of polygonal cells with eosinophilic and clear cytoplasm and marked nuclear pleomorphism. Immunohistochemistry was positive for hepatocyte antigen and cytokeratins but negative for osteonectin . The histological diagnosis of a poorly differentiated (high-grade) sarcoma with osteogenic differentiation in the heart with metastasis to both lungs was established. The hepatic tumor was considered a poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Sections from the prostate demonstrated a moderately differentiated acinar adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 6 (3 + 3) .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

Also, hepatocellular carcinoma and prostatic adenocarcinoma were detected.\n\n【29】Usually, diagnostic problems arise in the case of a previously undiagnosed tumor in the heart. Primary cardiac tumors are rare. Both primary and metastatic cardiac osteosarcomas are extremely rare, and less than 100 cases of antemortem diagnosis have been described altogether 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 \\- 12 \\]</u>. Diagnosis can be more complicated in a patient with a cardiac pacemaker with a variety of diagnostic possibilities such as a thrombus, a caseous calcification of the valvular annulus, primary or metastatic tumor, abscess or endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】In our case the fast and exact path to the diagnosis was complicated due to contradictions in history: recently changed pacing generator, the unusual clinical course of the disease simulating inflammation, tumor or thrombus surrounding the electrodes in the right heart, liver mass, nodules in the lung and filling defects in the pulmonary arteries. Since the clinical course was simulating pacemaker-endocarditis or a thrombus on the electrode, antibacterial treatment was initiated. Diagnostic alternatives considered were a primary malignant tumor in the liver with metastasis into the right side of the heart and to the lungs and a primary heart tumor with metastases to the lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 17 , 18 \\]</u>. Since antibacterial treatment with different and combined antibiotics was ineffective, a strong suspicion of a malignant tumor (above all in liver) arose, with a concept based on earlier clinical observations that most of the metastases located in the right chambers of the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u> and up to 3% of patients with carcinomas have cardiac metastases identified at autopsy. Liver malignancies are one of the most frequent tumors to spread directly through inferior vena cava 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Our patient did not complain of aching bones; clinically a tumor was not suspected, and a bone scan was not performed. Nevertheless, metastatic skeletal tumor thrombi most often from femur and humerus extending to the heart have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\- 22 \\]</u>. In rare cases, extra-skeletal osteosarcoma may spread via the hematogenous route to an unusual cardiac localisation such as the LA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Primary cardiac osteosarcoma of the right side of the heart is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 24 \\]</u>. The clinical manifestations, regions of metastases (more than 50% to the lungs), imaging features, and laboratory tests are similar to other types of primary cardiac tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 25 \\]</u>. Calcifications on imaging (CT) are crucial for differentiating osteosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>, but we encountered a case that was difficult to diagnose because imaging revealed no calcifications. The pathogenesis of primary cardiac osteosarcoma is not clear. It could develop through metaplasia of connective tissue or by malignant degeneration of embryonic somatic residues, which arise from undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells in the myocardium and transform into active osteoblasts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 27 \\]</u>. Proposed etiological factors are a mechanical injury by causative agents and radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Furthermore, the heart is known to have a skeleton. Namely, fibrous trigone and annulus are the essential parts of it. Histologically the annulus has fibrotic and elastic fibres, and this structure is also in continuity with valvular leaflet tissue, the atrium and the ventricles. The hypothesis of the pathogenesis of cardiac osteosarcoma could be based on malignant metaplasia and transformation of fibrotic and elastic fibres, which makes up the trigone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】We also considered the opportunity that the undifferentiated cardiac tumor developed from metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma by dedifferentiation. We very carefully investigated both tumors histologically and by several immunohistochemical markers and did not find any similarity based on histomorphological and immunohistochemical features. Therefore, we concluded that it is more likely that the tumors in the heart and the liver are independent neoplasms, the former with pulmonary metastases. However, we did not perform molecular analyses to rule out a metastatic disease in the heart completely. Acinar adenocarcinomas of the prostate are common in advanced age and therefore, not an unexpected finding.\n\n【34】Multiple primary malignancies are common only in 3-5% of tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. Despite its low incidence, the association of two malignancies in a single patient has been widely reported in the literature, while only a relatively small number (0.5%) of three malignancies have been described including primary cardiac sarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\- 32 \\]</u>. Some cases of cardiac sarcomas (pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma, angiosarcoma) in pacemaker patients are described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 33 \\]</u>. At the same time, there are no clinical reports of patients (with or without a cardiac pacemaker) with primary osteosarcoma of the heart after double carcinomas of the liver and prostate. Only immunological studies have demonstrated that novel cytokine interleukin-32 (IL-32) could be involved in cancer development, including prostate, liver and heart (adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and osteosarcoma) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】Conclusions\n\n【36】We conclude that there is most likely a collision of two carcinomas: hepatocellular carcinoma and osteogenic sarcoma of the heart. The prostatic adenocarcinoma is a common finding in senior men. From the provided histology it is more likely that the tumors of the heart and the liver are independent. However, without molecular analysis (which was not performed) de-differentiation in a metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cannot be excluded entirely. Injury of an electrode as a mechanical factor in the pathogenesis of cardiac osteosarcoma is not yet confirmed.\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TL, KK and LK were involved in patient care and writing the manuscript.

Lymphoproliferative disorders are often caused by the suppression of T-cell activity by immunosuppressants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It is extremely unusual for antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine to cause lymphoproliferative disorders except after transplantation.\n\n【2】In the case reported here, we present a lymphoproliferative disorder in the lungs caused by ATG and cyclosporine that were administered for the treatment of aplastic anemia. To our knowledge, case report of pulmonary lymphoma caused by ATG and cyclosporine outside of the post-transplantation setting is very rare.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 70-year-old woman with aplastic anemia treated with ATG (8 months ago, 2.5 mg/kg for 5 days), prednisolone (started on 15 mg 8 months ago, with dose tapered to 7.5 mg) and cyclosporine (started 6 years ago, with trough levels maintained between 150 and 200 ng/mL) visited our hospital complaining of fever and general fatigue for a week.

We diagnosed immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorder resulting from treatment with ATG and cyclosporine. The serum EBV DNA load was 6.7 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> copies/10 <sup>6 </sup> cells. A whole-body trunk CT scan with contrast enhancement showed no other region of lymphadenopathy or nodule. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed bone marrow involvement of lymphoma. After the diagnosis, we discontinued cyclosporine and antibiotics therapy.

Histological investigation showed EBV-positive DLBCL, and we administered ATG, cyclosporine and prednisolone, although not for transplantation. Primary pulmonary lymphoma of the lungs is a rare disorder; the incidence of primary pulmonary lymphoma is 0.3% of all primary lung neoplasms and less than 0.5% of all lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The most common type of primary pulmonary lymphoma, accounting for approximately 70%, is marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, but it is reported that most human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients have high-grade, EBV-positive DLBCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients with EBV-positive immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorder in the lung may tend to have DLBCL. Moreover, iatrogenic lymphoproliferative disorder, except in the post-transplantation setting, is extremely rare. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the English literature about immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative lung disorder in relation to EBV outside of a post-transplantation setting.\n\n【13】It is known that ATG use in a preparative regimen of bone marrow transplantation confers a high risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, especially EBV-related B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This case was not a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, but ATG may have contributed to the development of the lymphoproliferative disorder because EBV proliferation was observed in this case. According to previous studies, the time between ATG administration (combined with cyclosporine in most cases) and the onset of the lymphoproliferative disorder was 1 - 20 months, indicating the contribution of ATG in these cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Because the chest radiograph showed resolution of the consolidation of the lungs and soluble interleukin-2 receptor decreased after discontinuation of cyclosporine, cyclosporine may also play some role in the development of lymphoproliferative disorder.\n\n【15】We should consider the possibility of malignant lymphoma when CT scan showed multiple patchy consolidations with random pattern in both lungs as septic pulmonary emboli in patients with immunosuppressive treatment.\n\n【16】In conclusion, after treatment of aplastic anemia with ATG, cyclosporine and prednisolone, EBV-related lymphoproliferative disorder may develop, although rarely. We should be aware of this rare disorder as well as infectious disease in immunosuppressive patients.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:50:56", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:51:09", "cost": 13.15}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:58", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:51:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:50:55"}

In 1948, Stewart and Treves first described the development of angiosarcoma in women following radical mastectomy for breast cancer complicated by edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. STS is typically found in an ipsilateral upper extremity post radical mastectomy complicated by lymphedema. In this case report, our patient who had STS in the right lower extremity in the presence of obesity-associated lymphedema is atypical. The average life expectancy of cutaneous angiosarcoma is 2.5 years with most patients dying within the first 2 years from metastatic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Untreated patients, on average, live 5 - 8 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. These factors make early detection of STS paramount as the treatment before metastasis via wide excision tissue removal is the best option in improving outcomes.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】The patient was a 63-year-old woman with a past medical history of lymphedema of the right lower extremity for the past 2 years and diagnosis of angiosarcoma of the right lower extremity status post right above knee amputation. The patient also had surgical re-vision of the right knee stump due to recurrent disease. Ultimately there was metastasis to lymph nodes, bone, lung, and adrenal glands status post radiation and chemotherapy. Other history included recent right lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism and bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis treated with rivaroxaban, recent resolution of a large right-sided pneumothorax, morbid obesity for her entire recorded adult life with body mass index (BMI) of 41.6, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and no other surgical history. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from an inpatient rehabilitation facility for worsening shortness of breath. She was found to be in atrial fibrillation and respiratory distress. A review of systems was unable to be obtained due to the patient’s mental status.\n\n【5】Of note, the patient had an extensive history of radiation and chemotherapy for metastatic angiosarcoma of the right lower extremity and was being followed by a vascular surgeon for lymphedema for the last 10 years. She could not tolerate paclitaxel or doxorubicin due to acute hypersensitivity reaction. She was initiated on monotherapy treatment with gemcitabine approximately 4 months before the presentation and completed six rounds of treatment. The patient remained on monthly denosumab, a RANK ligand inhibitor, for osseous metastasis. The histomorphologic features and immunohistochemistry profile of the right anterior leg soft tissue were consistent with the diagnosis of angiosarcoma with a high Ki-67 mitotic index (45%) and with cells positive for CD34, CD31, and factor VIII (pictures not shown). The positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed metastatic disease to lymph nodes, bone, lung, and adrenal glands .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Whole-body positron emission tomography and computer tomography imaging were performed with multi-planar imaging without oral or intravenous contrast material, revealing metastatic disease to lymph node (right external iliac lymph node measuring 2.5 × 4.2 cm), bone (medial aspect of the left clavicle, the posterior lateral aspect of the head of the left humerus, the posterior aspect of the T2 vertebral body, and the right iliac wing), lung (there are approximately 15 solid noncalcified pulmonary nodules in each lung, ranging between 2 and 10 mm), and bilateral adrenal glands. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【7】On presentation, the patient had a blood pressure of 86/53 mm Hg, a pulse of 132 beats/min, temperature of 36.6 °C, respiratory rate of 15 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 98% on bilevel positive airway pressure (Bi-PAP) with FiO <sub>2 </sub> of 60%, and BMI of 41.6. On the physical exam, she was non-alert and lethargic. Rhonchi were auscultated over the lung fields bilaterally. There was minimal +1 left lower limb edema in contrast to the worse 3+ edema of the right lower stump with serous discharge from the surgical incision consistent with wound dehiscence. There were no signs of purulence, erythema, or cellulitis associated with the wound. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n【8】Diagnosis\n\n【9】The complete blood count showed an elevated white blood cell count of 16.5 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL and low hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL .

She was also found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. She was subsequently given cardizem bolus and infusion and was intubated due to persistent respiratory distress. She was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam. She continued to require ventilation support for oxygenation.\n\n【17】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【18】The hematology-oncology service was consulted, and the patient was found to have significant progressive decompensation of underlying metastatic pulmonary disease from angiosarcoma of the right lower extremity, likely causing respiratory failure and cardiac instability. She was not a candidate for any additional therapy options for the underlying metastatic disease. The prognosis and goals of care were discussed with the patient’s family and the decision was made to transition to hospice care. The patient was made comfortable and ultimately passed away in the ICU.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Classically, STS presents after radical mastectomy in the upper extremities but can present in other areas like the lower extremities about 10% of the time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The lesions are small and typically purple at onset and then develop into a nodule. Due to these lesions’ innocuous appearance, the diagnosis and treatment can be delayed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Approximately 90% of angiosarcomas associated with lymphedema occur following mastectomy. Lymphedema is a chronic, incurable condition. It is classified as primary lymphedema resulting from anomalous development of the lymphatic system or secondary lymphedema resulting from injury to the lymphatic vasculature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Distant metastasis is seen in 27-42% of patients with angiosarcoma. Metastasis occurs hematogenously, most commonly to the liver, bones, soft tissues, and lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. STS development in patients following radical mastectomy that survived at least 5 years is 0.07-0.45%. The mechanism to which STS occurs is unknown, but it is theorized that angiogenesis in edematous regions could lead to neoplasm as collateral circulation becomes established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Another theory is that chronic edema leads to localized immunodeficiency, permitting oncogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The incidence of chronic edema associated with obesity, called massive localized lymphedema, as seen in this patient, is trending upward with the increase in obesity in westernized societies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. This being said, there is a logical concern for a rise in STS incidence in these populations. Obesity-associated lymphedema in the lower extremities typically occurs once a patient’s BMI reaches 50 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Obesity-associated lymphedema results from the proliferation and hypertrophy of adipocytes. This hypertrophy causes lymphatic fibrosis and stasis, allowing for the accumulation of inflammatory macrophages and lymphocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Macrophages, in particular, are known to be involved in lymphangiogenesis, producing lymphangiogenic cytokines and differentiating into lymphatic endothelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. These macrophages encircle dead adipocytes in crown-like inflammatory foci, which release inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines are associated with increased risk for, and more aggressive behavior of, various malignancies in obese patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】The overall incidence of STS has decreased with the introduction of breast-conserving therapy that removes less of the lymphatic drainage structure than radical mastectomy. Due to its rarity, the exact decrease in incidence is difficult to approximate, but since the introduction of breast-conserving therapy, the incidence of chronic lymphedema after breast cancer treatment has decreased from 40% to 4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Before starting treatment, a biopsy is required for the diagnosis of STS. On histology, angiosarcoma of STS shows a proliferation of anastomotic vascular channels that dissect collagen within the dermis. The malignant endothelial cells are commonly hyperchromatic, pleomorphic with macronuclei, and show signs of frequent mitosis. Another common feature is the presence of “hobnailing”, where the endothelial cells project into the vessel lumen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Staining for common endothelial cell markers such as factor VIII, anti-CD31, and anti-CD34 antibodies can be useful in identifying angiosarcoma as well, with anti-CD31 being the most sensitive and specific of the three 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】After biopsy and identification, the first-line treatment is wide tissue excision and removal of the mass. Standard adjuvant therapy is local radiation of the excision site or medical management with chemotherapy. The chemotherapeutic drugs used as the standard of care are methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, or a combination of vincristine, doxorubicin, dacarbazine, cyclophosphamide, and actinomycin D 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. There is no significant difference in survival between chemotherapy and radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Following treatment, recurrence and metastasis are common. On initial presentation, it is thought that metastatic disease is present 16-44% of the time, and the 5-year average survival is 40% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Therefore, it is crucial to have a low biopsy threshold in patients with a newly developed skin lesion in a limb with chronic lymphedema due to the poor prognosis of STS and the benefits of early detection and treatment.\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\n【26】STS is a rare syndrome in which angiosarcoma develops on the skin in the presence of long-standing lymphedema. Although uncommon, the danger angiosarcoma poses is significant and warrants knowledge of the disease and screening in patients with chronic edema. In addition, early detection should be seen as the best way to optimize outcomes for these patients as the prognosis for metastatic angiosarcoma is poor.\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We acknowledge Dr. Ward Wendy MD, Pathologist at Northwestern Hospital McHenry for the help with providing histopathology slides for the case and associated detailed description.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent has been obtained from the patient’s family.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MC wrote the majority of the manuscript.

The pericardial space normally contains approximately 50 mL of serous fluid. However, additional fluid may collect in the pericardial space due to various etiologies including infectious/inflammatory, traumatic, neoplastic, and/or cardiovascular causes among others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The most common causes are reported to be viral pericarditis in the developed world such as the United States, and infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in developing areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The development of tamponade depends on the amount of fluid, the rate of the filling in the pericardial space, and the compliance of the pericardium. As little as 100 mL of rapidly accumulating fluid can cause cardiac tamponade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The management of cardiac tamponade is to evacuate the fluid in the pericardial space, as well as treating the underlying condition.\n\n【2】Pericardial tamponade is a rare complication in patients receiving a pneumonectomy, the surgical removal of a lung most commonly for an advanced malignancy or inflammatory lung disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Pneumonectomy is also indicated for unstable trauma patients with significant parenchymal destruction, central hilar vascular destruction, and/or extensive bronchial injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The incidence of post-traumatic pneumonectomy is 0.01% with a mortality rate exceeding 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Complications of pneumonectomy are generally divided into early and late complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Examples of early complications include cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopleural fistulas, and cardiac herniation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Late complications include the post-pneumonectomy syndrome, pulmonary artery stump thrombosis, bronchopleural fistula, and empyema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Patients also experience physiologic changes, as the space previously occupied by the lung becomes filled with air, which over time gets absorbed and replaced with fluid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】The current case report describes an adult patient with a history of right lung pneumonectomy 25 years prior secondary to a gunshot wound who presented with multifactorial obstructive shock. After his right hemithorax was drained, the patient clinically deteriorated with serial ultrasound examinations demonstrating the development of cardiac tamponade. Based on his clinical course, the authors suspect that the postoperative physiologic fluid accumulation within the right hemithorax caused initial compression of the expanding pericardial effusion, thereby effectively “tamponading the tamponade.”\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Investigations\n\n【6】A 54-year-old male with a history of hypertension and post-traumatic right lung pneumonectomy 25 years prior due to a gunshot wound presented to the emergency department (ED) via Emergency Medical Services complaining of worsening shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient was found to be hypoxic in the field and was placed on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The patient was unable to carry a conversation without significant dyspnea. His daughter reported the patient had been experiencing dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and bilateral lower extremity swelling with gradual exacerbation for about 3 to 4 weeks prior to presentation. His primary doctor had recently initiated an outpatient evaluation for his symptoms with a presumptive diagnosis of congestive heart failure and started him on a diuretic. He denied any other medical or surgical history and was not taking any other medications. He denied any recent fever, illness, travel, or trauma. He also denied the use of illicit drugs, tobacco, or alcohol.\n\n【7】His vital signs upon arrival to the ED were a blood pressure of 125/83 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) of 111 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100% while on CPAP, and temporal temperature of 36.1 °C. His physical examination was notable for an increased work of breathing, jugular venous distention bilaterally, absent breath sounds on the right side, distant heart sounds, and 3+ pitting edema of bilateral lower extremities extending to the knees.\n\n【8】Diagnosis\n\n【9】His initial workup included an electrocardiogram (ECG) which revealed sinus tachycardia with a normal axis, and low voltages throughout all leads . Pertinent laboratory studies included hyponatremia of 119 mEq/L (reference range 135 - 145 mEq/L), hypochloremia of 79 mEq/L (reference range 95 - 105 mEq/L). An arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed acidemia with a pH of 7.21 (reference range 7.35 - 7.45), pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 73 mm Hg (reference range 35 - 45 mm Hg), pO <sub>2 </sub> of 191 mm Hg (reference range 75 - 100 mm Hg), and bicarbonate of 29 mmol/L (reference range 22 - 26 mmol/L) after 1 h on high flow nasal cannula with the initial settings at 60 L/min on 60% fraction of inspired oxygen. His N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level was only mildly elevated to 266 pg/mL (reference range < 125 pg/mL). His troponin, creatinine, lactate, complete blood count, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and liver function tests were within the normal ranges. He had an unremarkable urinalysis, a negative urine drug screen, and a negative BioMerieux BioFire polymerase chain reaction viral swab which included coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

A point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) revealed a large pericardial effusion on the parasternal short axis view . In addition, early evidence of right ventricular (RV) diastolic collapse was noted on the parasternal long axis view on M-mode  as well as a dilated inferior vena cava (IVC). In addition, there was some mass effect from an opacity most likely a large fluid collection in the right hemithorax without significant respiratory variation, which raised concern for obstructive shock from both mass effect of the right lung fluid collection as well as early tamponade. Cardiology was consulted and performed an emergent bedside echocardiogram, which again demonstrated the findings of the initial POCUS, including a large pericardial effusion and RV dilatation with a dilated IVC. However, they did not note evidence of RV diastolic collapse or any other signs of tamponade. Cardiology recommended monitoring the patient and scheduling a non-emergent pericardiocentesis in the cardiac lab unless the patient’s status changes.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

However, while in the ED, the patient gradually became hypotensive with worsening tachycardia and dyspnea. A repeat bedside echocardiogram revealed an increase in size of the pericardial effusion. He was given 1 L of normal saline intravenously and started on a norepinephrine drip peripherally with a starting rate of 8 µg/min to support his blood pressure. The patient developed worsening respiratory distress despite noninvasive airway management. Consequently, a delayed sequence intubation with ketamine 200 mg (intravenous (IV)) and rocuronium 100 mg (IV) was performed for airway protection. A left subclavian central IV line and a left radial arterial were placed for administration of vasoactive medications and close hemodynamic monitoring. The patient was given on fentanyl and midazolam drips for pain control and sedation.\n\n【15】The patient underwent computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with IV contrast which revealed mild cardiomegaly with leftward mediastinal shift secondary to a large amount of fluid occupying the right hemithorax . A right-sided thoracentesis was performed with initial drainage of 1 L of dark fluid, resulting in a transient improvement in his hemodynamics. However, shortly afterwards, the patient exhibited severe hypotension requiring an increase in the norepinephrine rate and the addition of a vasopressin drip. An additional 1 L of lactated Ringer’s solution was administered. A repeat POCUS by the ED team revealed an increase in size of the pericardial effusion. An emergent ultrasound-guided pericardial drain was inserted with an initial return of approximately 700 mL of dark blood, and gradual improvement of the patient’s hemodynamics. The pericardial drain was left in place to drain to gravity.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

A repeat chest radiograph demonstrated improvement in his left lung volume. The pericardial drain had minimal output the following day and was removed after 2 days . A bronchoscopy was ordered by the inpatient team revealing normal left upper and lower lobes, a terminal right main-stem bronchus, and was negative for any bronchopleural fistula on the right side. Repeat echocardiogram by the cardiology team revealed an absence of pericardial effusion and was otherwise unremarkable. The patient was extubated after 7 days. He remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the telemetry unit. The right chest tube drained a total of 5 L of fluid over the course of 12 days and was then discontinued 5 days after extubation. He was discharged home after 18 total days of hospitalization with outpatient follow-up.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Pericardial effusion is a rare complication of post-pneumonectomy, and the literature is scant. Tomimaru et al reported an incidence of 0.0034% of pericardial effusion following pulmonary resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. They also noted that patients who underwent left pneumonectomy returned within 30 days postoperatively with pericardial effusions requiring drainage, while patients who had undergone right pneumonectomy thoracotomies generally did well with diuretic medications alone and required no further surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Case reports describe development of pericardial effusions secondary to development of chylous fistulas in patients who underwent right upper lung lobectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Development of a pericardial effusion has been more frequently described as a complication of cardiac surgery such as heart transplant, though the reported incidence varies widely between 1% and 77%. Risk factors including hypertension, larger body surface area, immunosuppression, pulmonary thromboembolism, and renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. While pericardial effusions may be visualized on CT scans or magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound via either transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography is the diagnostic modality of choice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Evidence in the literature suggests that in a post-pneumonectomy patient, fluid will accumulate in the hemithorax at a variable rate following pneumonectomy and the hemithorax will be completely obliterated within weeks to months postoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The patient in this case appeared to have presented in multifactorial obstructive shock. Given the result of the POCUS findings and other radiographic evidence, it appeared that the mediastinal shift secondary to the large amount of fluid within the right hemithorax was the initial culprit behind the obstructive shock, as it appeared to have been compressing the inferior vena cava resulting in decreased preload. This was further complicated by a pericardial effusion which had not yet progressed to cardiac tamponade upon presentation to the ED.\n\n【22】This case presents a unique challenge since the patient underwent pneumonectomy 25 years prior to the ED visit. The continued accumulation of intra-thoracic fluid over such a long period of time has not been reported in the literature. Given that the patient did not present in cardiac tamponade on initial presentation, it was reasonable to evacuate the right hemithorax to alleviate the leftward mediastinal shift and relieve the obstruction of the inferior vena cava. Immediately after the thoracentesis, the patient’s clinical condition and his overall hemodynamic parameters improved for a brief period, however his status deteriorated shortly thereafter.\n\n【23】Serial POCUS studies revealed expansion of the pericardial effusion which led into pericardial tamponade. The etiology of this patient’s pericardial effusion remains uncertain. The leading differentials include a transudative effusion secondary to congestive heart failure, injury to pericardial vessels secondary to mass effect from the large fluid collection of the right hemithorax, post-myocardial infarction, and idiopathic. There was no clinical evidence of a primary cardiac tumor, lung cancer, aortic vascular injury, chronic hepatic or renal disease, and the patient denied other medical history, recent illness, drug use, or recent trauma, making these other etiologies less likely.\n\n【24】It is generally accepted that the development of cardiac tamponade depends on both the rate of accumulation of pericardial fluid as well as the compliance of the pericardium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In this case, the rapid accumulation of further fluid within the pericardial space following the removal of fluid from the right hemithorax may have been the cause for the patient’s rapid development of cardiac tamponade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Effectively, the large amount of fluid in the right hemithorax was most likely “tamponading the tamponade”.\n\n【25】Learning points\n\n【26】This case report highlights the importance of a detailed evaluation of patients with a history of pneumonectomy and maintaining a broad differential diagnosis for the presentation of shock, as well as the utility of POCUS in the emergent management of critical patients.\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We appreciate Dr. Louis Tran, MD, for proofreading the revision of this case report.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study did not receive funding.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The Institutional Review Board at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center (ARMC) approved this study as exempt study with approval number 21-20.

It is rarely found as an isolated valvular defect, but rather is a common sequela of rheumatic heart disease and is generally associated with mitral stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Other less frequent causes of TS include carcinoid syndrome, vegetations due to infective endocarditis, systemic conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, metastatic tumors, radiation therapy and congenital abnormalities such as atresia or stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 3 \\]</u>. TS leads to an elevated right atrial pressure due to a pressure gradient between the right atrium and ventricle. Due to elevated right sided pressures, patients with TS frequently present with signs of right heart failure, including fatigue and exertional syncope. Hepatic congestion and ascites causing abdominal discomfort, and lower extremity edema can also be seen in severe cases of TS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】The passage of permanent pacemaker lead through the tricuspid valve has been known to be associated with tricuspid regurgitation and stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Initially, it was observed in the setting of endocarditis associated with permanent pacemaker lead 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The presence of vegetation due to endocarditis would lead to tricuspid regurgitation, and rarely to TS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. This was known as “functional tricuspid stenosis” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, since the 1980s, authors have described pacemaker lead-induced TS in the absence of endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\- 9 \\]</u>. The likely underlying mechanism is adherence between the lead and the sub-valvular tissue causing mechanical irritation or fibrosis secondary to leaflet perforation and/or laceration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Occasionally the permanent pacemaker lead forms a loop in the right ventricle which predisposes to adhesions and reactive fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 \\- 14 \\]</u>. However, cases have been reported of TS with no discernible lead looping or leaflet perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】During pregnancy, an increase in cardiac output occurs secondary to an increased preload due to a rise in blood volume, reduced afterload due to decline in systemic vascular resistance, and an increased maternal heart rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. This increase in cardiac output during pregnancy can result in cardiac decompensation if concomitant valvular heart disease is present. Presence of TS may lead to overt heart failure and other grave complications including recurrent miscarriages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. A patient with multivalvular heart disease having recurrent miscarriages that were solely attributed to presence of TS has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. The proposed mechanism was that TS causes low cardiac output which leads to decreased uterine blood flow and impaired venous drainage which ultimately leads to decreased viability of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. However, the specific impact of isolated TS on pregnancy is still undetermined.\n\n【4】The management of TS is primarily based on observational data and expert opinion due to limited literature. No specific recommendations are available regarding the management of TS in the presence of permanent pacemaker leads. The available options for management of TS secondary to permanent pacemaker lead include medical management, balloon valvuloplasty (with or without removal of pacemaker lead), or tricuspid valve replacement. The common practice includes pre-pregnancy counseling and close monitoring by expert physicians during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Here we describe the management and outcomes of a 33-year-old female with pacemaker lead-induced TS, prior to and post pregnancy.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】Investigations\n\n【7】A 33-year-old female presented to the office for prepregnancy counseling. She was complaining of intermittent palpitations associated with dyspnea on exertion. Her past medical history was remarkable for symptomatic congenital complete heart block for which a dual-chamber permanent pacemaker was implanted at the age of 15 years, as well as essential hypertension and asthma. On presentation, she was 100% atrial-sensed ventricular-paced, dual-chamber pacing (DDD) mode. Her vital signs were within normal limits. Her physical exam was significant for grade 3/6 diastolic murmur along the left sternal border. Physical examination was negative for rales/crackles on lung auscultation, peripheral edema, or ascites.\n\n【8】Diagnosis\n\n【9】On transthoracic echocardiogram, the patient had a normal left ventricular function, moderate to severe TS with mild regurgitation, and a tricuspid valve area of 0.88 cm <sup>2 </sup> . The mean gradient across the tricuspid valve was 19.4 mm Hg . The anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve seemed to be tethered down by pacing lead. Due to physiological increase in cardiac output during pregnancy, there was concern about severe TS leading to overt failure. Hence, an intervention was deemed necessary prior to conception.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Continuous-wave Doppler showed the mean gradient pressure was 19.4 mm Hg with tricuspid valve pressure half-time 214.29 ms and tricuspid valve area 0.88 cm 2 . |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【12】Treatment\n\n【13】The patient underwent a successful tricuspid balloon valvuloplasty, and the mean gradient across the tricuspid valve decreased from 19.4 to 5 - 7 mm Hg. There was no change in lead impedances or pacing thresholds after the procedure. Subsequently, patient achieved an uneventful pregnancy with close surveillance. Follow-up echocardiographic findings were stable throughout pregnancy, and she had a normal vaginal delivery at term with no complications.\n\n【14】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【15】She presented for a routine follow-up 2 years after her valvuloplasty and was found to have elevated impedance and threshold but adequate sensitivity in the right atrial lead. The device was switched from DDD mode to ventricular pacing (VDD) mode which resulted in 100% atrial sensing and 100% ventricular pacing. She presented again 2 more years later with worsening dyspnea on exertion and intermittent palpitations. Repeat echocardiogram showed restenosis of the tricuspid valve with a mean gradient of 14 mm Hg along with a valve area of 0.72 cm <sup>2 </sup> . She wanted to conceive again so a repeat balloon valvuloplasty was planned. She underwent balloon valvuloplasty with an 1.8 × 6 cm balloon dilation catheter followed by a 25 mm balloon. However, there was still no change in degree of TS and the mean gradient remained high after the procedure. The case was discussed with cardiothoracic surgery and a tricuspid valve replacement was planned. She underwent successful tricuspid valve replacement with 33 mm Epic valve. During the procedure the right atrial lead was repositioned due to elevated impedance. The right ventricular lead was disconnected, retained, and sewn over and an epicardial ventricular lead was placed. She was able to conceive again and delivered at term with no complications. Repeat echocardiogram 2 years later showed a mean gradient of 5.5 mm Hg across the bioprosthetic tricuspid valve and the patient denied any symptoms of dyspnea or palpitations.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3. Repeat echocardiogram after 2 more years follow-up showed the mean gradient pressure was 14 mm Hg with tricuspid valve pressure half-time 264 ms and tricuspid valve area 0.72 cm 2 . |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Our patient had moderate to severe TS secondary to adhesion of the pacemaker lead to the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, and wanted to conceive. She underwent balloon valvotomy prior to pregnancy to reduce the risk of complications during pregnancy. The patient attained pregnancy with no complications. However, in the planning of her second pregnancy, the patient underwent balloon valvuloplasty again for tricuspid restenosis that was unsuccessful. It was later followed by tricuspid valve replacement with repositioning of the right atrial and right ventricular leads. We suspect that the presence of permanent pacemaker lead contributed to the development of early restenosis after the first procedure.\n\n【19】Severe TS is classified as a mean pressure gradient of 5 mm Hg or more, inflow time-velocity integral of greater than 60 cm, a pressure half-time (T <sub>1/2 </sub> ) of 190 ms or more, and a valve area by continuity equation of 1 cm <sup>2 </sup> or less 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. As per European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease, intervention on the tricuspid valve is usually carried out at the time of intervention on other valves in patients who are symptomatic despite being on medical therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Percutaneous balloon tricuspid dilatation has been performed in a few cases but frequently induces significant regurgitation. The choice between valve repair or valve replacement depends on valve anatomy and surgical expertise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. For individuals with symptomatic TS and with low to moderate surgical risk, tricuspid valve surgery is recommended over balloon valvotomy alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Overall, there is a scarcity of data on long-term outcomes of either procedure.\n\n【20】The management of TS secondary to permanent pacemaker lead is primarily based on observational data and expert opinion. Medically, patients with symptomatic TS, including those with lower extremity edema and hepatic congestion can be treated with loop diuretics but efficacy is limited in the long term 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Cases have been described where TS was successfully treated with percutaneous tricuspid valvuloplasty without the removal of the permanent pacemaker lead 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Other options for management include permanent pacemaker lead removal with tricuspid valve replacement or permanent pacemaker lead removal with valvuloplasty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Data regarding tricuspid balloon valvotomy outcomes and studies comparing balloon valvotomy with valve surg­ery in the presence of permanent pacemaker lead is limited. A recent meta-analysis describes the management of mitral stenosis in pregnancy guided by the Wilkins score and the severity of sub-valvular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. However, no similar score or studies are available to help in the management of TS. Overall, there is a lack of data on long-term results on any form of medical or surgical interventions for management isolated TS, especially when permanent pacemaker is present.\n\n【21】To our knowledge, we presented the only case highlighting the management of pacemaker lead-induced TS prior to pregnancy. The limitation to our case is that the management may not be generalizable. More studies are needed to help further guide TS management especially in this patient population. In our opinion, patients with moderate to severe TS secondary to pacemaker leads would likely benefit from tricuspid valve replacement compared to balloon valvuloplasty as the possibility of later restenosis of the valve is very high. Leaving the permanent pacemaker lead in place further increases the possibility of restenosis in case of balloon valvuloplasty. We conclude that more data is needed in this regard especially considering the increased use of permanent pacemakers.\n\n【22】Learning points\n\n【23】Clinicians may consider that patients with moderate to severe TS secondary to pacemaker leads may likely benefit more, prior to conceiving, from a tricuspid valve replacement compared to balloon valvuloplasty. Balloon valvuloplasty alone while leaving the PPM lead in place may lead to high possibility of restenosis.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no acknowledgments to declare.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no financial disclosures to declare.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest was reported among authors.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ahmad Mustafa and Asif Khan drafted the case report and conducted the necessary supportive literature review.

Associated clinical signs and symptoms of the condition include intrauterine growth restriction, severe psychomotor retardation, failure to thrive, characteristic facial features, profound developmental delays, seizures and various congenital midline fusion anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-6 \\]</u>. The latter may include cleft lip or palate, congenital heart disease (atrial or ventricular septal defects), hypospadias and midline scalp defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-6 \\]</u>. Given the associated congenital anomalies, anesthetic care is often required for various surgical interventions. We report a 3-month-old girl with WH syndrome scheduled for gastrostomy tube placement. Previous reports of anesthetic care for such patients are reviewed and potential perioperative concerns are discussed.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Institutional Review Board approval is not required by Nationwide Children’s Hospital for presentation of single case reports. A 3-month-old, 3 kg girl presented for gastrostomy tube placement. The patient was diagnosed with WH syndrome based on intrauterine ultrasound reports and subsequent genetic testing. Chromosomal microarray showed results consistent with the diagnosis of WH syndrome. On physical examination, the child was noted to be small for her age, quiet, and hypotonic. Dysmorphic features included wide-spaced eyes, microcephaly, microstomia, a prominent glabella, low set ears, and micrognathia. Her preoperative vital signs included a resting respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min, an oxygen saturation of 99% by pulse oximetry while receiving 0.5 L/min oxygen via nasal cannula, a heart rate of 134 beats/min, and a blood pressure (BP) of 83/62 mm Hg. Preoperative echocardiography revealed an atrial septal defect. No sedative pre-medication was required. The patient had a pre-existing 24-gauge intravenous (IV) cannula in the right saphenous vein with maintenance IV fluids infusing. The patient was held nil per os for 6 h and transported to the operating room where routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were applied. General anesthesia was induced by the administration of IV ketamine (5 mg) and atropine (0.1 mg). Sevoflurane was administered and incrementally increased to 5%. A shoulder roll was placed beneath the patient, prior to anesthetic induction, to facilitate optimal alignment of airway structures. Because of the patient’s non-reassuring airway examination, spontaneous ventilation was maintained throughout induction and endotracheal intubation. Light cricoid pressure was applied, which brought the vocal cords into view (Cormack-Lehane score of I vs. IIa). Endotracheal intubation was easily achieved using a Miller 1 blade and a cuffed, styleted 3.0 endotracheal tube. The patient tolerated anesthetic induction and endotracheal intubation without adverse hemodynamic effects. Mechanical ventilation was initiated for the case. The surgery lasted approximately 30 min. Mild hypotension occurred during the maintenance phase of anesthesia using sevoflurane (inspired concentration 2-3%), despite the administration of a 20 mL/kg fluid bolus of 0.9% NS. Therefore, the inspired concentration of sevoflurane was decreased and neuromuscular blockade was provided by the administration of rocuronium 3 mg (1 mg/kg). Fentanyl (2.5 µg/kg) was also administered. The expired concentration of sevoflurane was decreased to 1.2% in a mixture of 50% air and 50% oxygen. After completion of the surgical procedure, residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. The patient’s trachea was extubated in the operating room and she was transported to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). The patient was discharged from the PACU back to the neonatal ICU. The remainder of the postoperative course was uneventful. Tube feedings were started the next day based on the surgical team’s recommendations.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Patients with known genetic syndromes pose a variety of challenges to the anesthesia provider 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. WH syndrome is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder caused by partial deletion (monosomy) of the short arm of chromosome 4. It was first described in 1961 by Hirschhorn and Cooper and subsequently published in Humangenetik by both Hirschhorn and Cooper as well as Wolf et al in 1965 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8-10 \\]</u>. Current estimates place the prevalence at about 1:50,000 with a 2:1 female/male ratio.\n\n【6】WH syndrome is characterized by a spectrum of observable abnormalities, the most important of which for the anesthesia provider include congenital heart disease and facial structural abnormalities, which may lead to difficulties with airway management. Congenital heart disease includes primarily atrial and ventricular defects. Phenotypic features include ocular hypertolerism (wide-set eyes), low-set malformed ears, micrognathia (small, recessed mandible), microcephaly (small head), prominent glabella (a “Greek helmet” appearance), broad or beaked nose, cleft lip or palate, small down turned “fish like” mouth, hypotonia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) with a subsequent failure to thrive. Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome is now grouped together with WH syndrome, since both are the result of deletions on the same portion of chromosome 4, although “Pitt” syndrome generally results in milder physical and congenital abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】To date, there are a limited number of reports in the literature regarding the anesthetic care of patients with WH syndrome  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11-18 \\]</u>. As with all anesthetic care, appropriate preoperative preparation begins with a thorough history and physical examination. Of primary concern to the anesthesia provider is the potential for difficulties with airway management and endotracheal intubation related to micrognathia, microstomia, and associate cleft lip/palate. The appropriate equipment for dealing with the difficult airway should be readily available prior to anesthetic induction, as recommended by Engelhardt and Weiss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. General anesthesia can be induced by the incremental inhalation of sevoflurane in 100% oxygen with the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation until the airway is secured. In our patient, we administered a small dose of ketamine to induce anesthesia and maintain spontaneous ventilation followed by the administration of incremental concentrations of sevoflurane until adequate bag-valve-mask ventilation was demonstrated. Endotracheal intubation was accomplished without the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Airway management may be further compromised by the risk of aspiration as noted in some of the case reports which have led some to use rapid sequence intubation (RSI). However, the use of RSI must be weighed against the risks of potential difficulties with airway management and endotracheal intubation.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Previous Reports of Anesthetic Care in Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【9】While the early reports in the anesthesia literature suggested a correlation between the administration of inhaled anesthetics and the development of malignant hyperthermia (MH), more recent articles have questioned this association as there are several published reports showing that volatile agents have been used safely and without complications. Both of the patients in the two previous reports of potential MH-like symptoms had current upper respiratory infections and received high doses of atropine, muddying the picture as to whether or not it was MH, anticholinergic crisis, or active infection. When we questioned the MH hotline regarding a possible correlation between WH syndrome and the development of MH, we were told: “Although there is one report alleging an association, that has not been proven, nor do we consider that disorder a risk for MH.”\n\n【10】Given the associated hypotonia, another perioperative concerns is the choice of neuromuscular blocking (NMBA), especially with regard to the safety of using succinylcholine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Anecdotal reports have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of succinylcholine while other reports have failed to demonstrate significant perioperative issues such as prolonged duration of action following non-depolarizing agents including vecuronium, rocuronium, and cis-atracurium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Alternatively, endotracheal intubation can also be accomplished without the use of an NMBA using a combination of propofol and remifentanil or as noted in one case report, midazolam and remifentanil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Seizures may be a comorbid condition in patients with WH syndrome. Preoperative management strategies to limit the potential for perioperative seizures include optimizing and confirming therapeutic anticonvulsant levels prior to the surgical procedure. Routine anticonvulsant medications should be administered the morning of the procedure despite concerns of the patient’s nil per os status with subsequent intraoperative dosing as needed. Alternative routes of delivery (IV or rectal) may be required when enteral administration is not feasible. Consultation with the neurology or pharmacology service may be helpful to determine dosing conversion from enteral to IV administration or to guide intraoperative redosing.\n\n【12】In summary, WH syndrome is a rare chromosomal abnormality with deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4. The potential perioperative implications of WH syndrome are summarized in Table 2 . While initial reports suggested a predisposition to the development of MH, subsequent reports have failed to confirm this association. Other comorbid conditions which may impact perioperative care include facial anomalies which lead to difficult airway management, associated congenital heart disease, central nervous system involvement including hypotonia and underlying seizure disorder, and the potential for chronic aspiration and perioperative respiratory problems.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 2.

He was medicated firstly with amoxicillin/clavulanate plus azithromycin, with clinical remission. He also presented with an atrial fibrillation (AF) of recent onset. Anticoagulation was started and cardiac rhythm was controlled. After 3 weeks he had recurrence of mild fever and mild cough, and he received doxycycline, without remission of fever. He had no other cardiac events and chest X-ray did not show pulmonary findings.\n\n【5】After 1 month of fever history the patient had a third admission to urgency department, presenting with high fever. Additionally, he presented with respiratory deterioration, with shortness of breath, dry cough and left thoracic pleuritic pain. He never had gastrointestinal symptoms. He had a past medical history of Ann Arbor stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma, in remission for 34 years. He was submitted to chemotherapy with mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone (MOPP) protocol, followed by splenectomy. He also reported a recent trip to Portugal north coast, where he had consumed a large quantity of fresh fish.\n\n【6】On physical examination, the patient presented with subfebrile temperature and mild hypotension, but was eupneic (peripheral oxygen saturation of 97%). He had irregular cardiac sounds, bilateral pulmonary rales and mild hepatomegaly. He presented with mild bilateral pitting edema up to the knees. There were no meningeal signs.

He received antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam, followed by meropenem and vancomycin, analgesics, low dose of diuretics and anticoagulation. Transesophageal echocardiography showed a small volume (< 1 cm) of circumferential pericardial effusion, maintaining a good left ventricular systolic function. There were no signs of ischemia or vegetations, and no signs of hematological disease on blood investigations.

Biopsy of pericardium showed features of acute inflammatory pericarditis, revealed by perivascular inflammatory infiltrate and pericardium infiltration by neutrophils, probably of bacterial etiology .

Pericardium was also normalized on CT scan imaging.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】The incidence of listeriosis is still uncertain worldwide. This is mostly because of under diagnosis, the lack of notification and variable food security policies. In our country, it is not a notifiable infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.

This is higher than the reported mortality of purulent pericarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. In these reported cases, patients were 54 years old or older. They mostly presented with fever, dyspnea, chest pain and peripheral edema. The presence of weak immune system (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, cirrhosis, neoplasia, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants) and iron overload states (hemochromatosis, hemodialysis) were noticed. Our patient was in the same age group and splenectomized. All the other causes of immunosuppression and iron overload reported on previous case reports were excluded.\n\n【16】Usually, the diagnosis was made by pericarditis and Listeria monocytogenes bacteremia confirmation. The isolation of Listeria monocytogenes in a pericardium culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it is often difficult to achieve. Its isolation in cultures is unlikely after the prior antibiotic regimens. On the other hand, we had high serologies for serotypes 1/2a and 4b, strongly suggestive of infection. Additionally, listeria subpopulations with cardiotropic activity have been shown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The patient completely recovered under amoxicillin, supporting this diagnosis. Fatal outcomes in previous reports were seen more commonly in severe infections or even septic shock.

This is higher than the reported mortality of purulent pericarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. In these reported cases, patients were 54 years old or older. They mostly presented with fever, dyspnea, chest pain and peripheral edema. The presence of weak immune system (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, cirrhosis, neoplasia, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants) and iron overload states (hemochromatosis, hemodialysis) were noticed. Our patient was in the same age group and splenectomized. All the other causes of immunosuppression and iron overload reported on previous case reports were excluded.\n\n【16】Usually, the diagnosis was made by pericarditis and Listeria monocytogenes bacteremia confirmation. The isolation of Listeria monocytogenes in a pericardium culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it is often difficult to achieve. Its isolation in cultures is unlikely after the prior antibiotic regimens. On the other hand, we had high serologies for serotypes 1/2a and 4b, strongly suggestive of infection.

Fatal outcomes in previous reports were seen more commonly in severe infections or even septic shock.

Most of the cases are diagnosed in patients over the age of 40 and these are more commonly seen in males than females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3-5 \\]</u>. Oral lipomas have been reported to occur in a variety of locations including the salivary glands, buccal mucosa, gingiva, lip, tongue and floor of the mouth. It appears as a single or lobulated long-standing painless lesion with either a sessile or a pedunculated base. Different histopathological variants have been recognized, such as fibrolipomas, angiolipomas, myolipomas, spindle cell lipomas, chondroid lipomas, chondrolipomas and osteolipomas. Among the histopathological variants, lipomas with cartilaginous metaplasia, called chondrolipomas, are uncommon in the oral cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\]</u>. The appearance of chondrolipomas in a child is very unusual. Here, we describe a case of chondrolipoma of the tongue in a 16-year-old boy.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 16-year-old boy presented with a painless mass on the middle of the right lateral border of tongue . The lesion was first noticed about 15 years earlier which was a hazelnut-sized mass by his family and had not grown remarkably so far. He noticed an increase in the size of the mass over the past 1 year. At the time of presentation it was causing problems with speech and eating, and was subject to repeated trauma due to accidental biting. Intraoral clinical examination revealed a medium hard, multilobuler, irregular mass, consistency measuring approximately 6 × 4 cm in its major diamater, which was located along the midline of the right lateral border of the tongue with no evidence of submandibular and cervical lymphadenopathy. No ulceration was noted. A detailed systemic examination and laboratory investigations were within the normal limits. His family history was unremarkable. Radiological investigations showed a well-circumscribed fatty mass in the right side of the tongue . Histological examination of biopsy revealed it was composed of mature adipose tissue arranged in lobules that are seperated by fibrous tissue septa. Under general anesthesia, the lesion was removed totally with following dropped 1 cm strong border . Microscopic examination revealed a benign neoplasm characterized by the proliferation of mature adipocytes that were seperated by fibrous connective tissue and presence of a central area of mature cartilaginous tissue that exhibited lacune filled with chondrocytes . No evidence of malignant change was found and chondrolipoma of the tongue was diagnosed. A follow-up period of 2 years shows complete healing with no recurrence.

They are predominantly benign and congenital. Available data show that lesions are usually small (0.5 - 2.5 cm) and duration of disease before diagnosis ranges from 2 months to 2 years. Therefore, the present case is peculiar due to its long duration (approximately 16 years) and its size (approximately 6 × 4 cm). The peak incidence of lipomas is during the fifth and sixth decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 \\]</u>. Our case is a 16-year-old boy. Bures and Barnes reported that a benign mesenchymoma may represent a hamartoma if the lesion occurs in an individual younger than 25 years, associated with other congenital anomalies or hamartomatous lesions or with a phacomatosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In our case, detailed systemic examination and laboratory investigations were within the normal limits.\n\n【11】The pathogenesis of chondrolipomas is uncertain. Although the exact origin of the fat cells, chondroblasts remains controversial, it is generally accepted that they develop from different types of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. The main mechanisms is differantiation of pluripotent mesenchymal cells into adipose tissue and cartilage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 , 8 \\]</u>. Hietanen and Makinen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> and Maes and Eulderink 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> also suggest that the tumor is essentially a lipoma or chondroma and the accompanying cartilage or fat is a form of metaplastic stromal reaction. Mesenchymal cells can be modified by local or systemic factors such as local trauma and prolonged ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 , 8 , 10 \\]</u>. In our case, the lesion was first noticed about 15 years earlier which was a hazelnut-sized mass by his family and he noticed an increase in the size of the mass over the past 1 year. Nakano et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> suggest that the expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), latent TGF-β binding protein-1 (LTBP-1) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) might be impotant in the pathogenesis of chondrolipoma.\n\n【12】Lipomas are occasionally altered by metaplastic elements that form an intrinsic part of the tumor, the commonest variant being fibrolipoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 10 \\]</u>. There is not any cartilage tissue in tongue normally. It is possible that the present case started out as either lipoma or chondroma. Exceptionally in lipomas of large size and long duration, cartilaginous metaplasia may ocur. Lingual chondrolipoma or lipochondroma was first described in 1989 in a 47-year-old male who presented with a firm mass less than 1 cm in diamater at the lateral border of tongue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Chondrolipomas are characterized by the proliferation of mature adipocytes associated with the deposition of mature cartilaginous tissue on hystopathological examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\]</u>. Despite the similar nomenclature, chondrolipomas are different from chondroid lipomas. Chondroid lipomas are characterized by the proliferation of mature adipocytes arranged in the extracellular matrix with chondroid, myxoid and hyalinized areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>. In contrast to chondroid lipomas, chondrolipomas do not contain lipoblast-like cells and are easily identified as benign tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 10 \\]</u>. In addition, chondroid lipomas can be differentiated from myxoid liposarcomas and extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas by the lack of nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, characteristic vascular patern, and the presence of both chondroid and fat cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 12 \\]</u>. The treatment of these tumors consists of surgical excision, with no cases of recurrence having been reported. Chondrolipomas are well-demarcated tumors and can therefore be easily removed. Chondrolipoma shows a clear separation between the cartilaginous component and the fatty component, which makes the appearance of this lesion more benign.\n\n【14】Other differantial diagnosis of chondrolipomas includes osteocartilaginous choristomas and malign tumors. Osteocartilaginous choristomas differ from chondrolipomas by the formation of abundant bone or cartilage, despite poor fat tissue, upon microscopic examination. Chondroid lipomas can be differantiated from chondrolipomas by the lack of lipoblast-like features. Malignant tumors can be distinguished from chondrolipomas because they usually present cytologic features of malignancy such as mitotic activity and nuclear atypia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 8 , 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The treatment of choice for these tumors consists of surgical excision. They are well-demarcated tumors and can therefore be easily removed. After complete surgical excision no recurrence was described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 7 , 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】In conclusion, chondrolipoma was rarely seen in tongue especially in childhood. The pathogenesis is inconclusive. Although it is a benign tumor, a complete surgical excision must be done because of its localization and potential complications.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are not any potential conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:13:28", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:13:56", "cost": 27.905}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:58", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:13:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:13:27"}

Routine blood tests were done and they were within normal limits. Neck, thorax and abdominal computed tomography (CT) and neck, thorax CT angiography were performed.

Clinical manifestations such as neck pain with or without a tender swelling in the neck can be misleading. Without a particular previous history of some predisposing factors of IJV trombosis, such as drug abuse, venous catheterization or trauma, a clinician has to be suspicious to diagnose IJV thrombosis.\n\n【8】SRCAC is a unique subtype of mucin-producing adenocarcinoma that usually develops in the gastrointestinal tract. However, it is infrequently seen in other organs such as the lung, thyroid and prostate. In general, the prognosis is poor for patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, and it is difficult to select the optimal type of chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\- 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Several cases of IJV thrombosis associated with malignancy have been also reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This case illustrated an unusual presentation of a rare condition. After several diagnostic tests, and eliminating the other probable causes we came to the conclusion that the cause of IJV trombosis was malignancy according to histopathological findings of abdominal lymph nodes. Malignant neoplasms can be associated with IJV trombosis through two mechanisms. This may occur from a primary or metastatic local tumor mass obstructing the jugular blood flow by compression to result in stasis and thrombosis or even direct invasion into the vein. In our case, ultrasonography revealed multiple lymph nodes around the IJV showing no sign of compression to the vein. This apperance could also result from a migratory thrombophlebitis known to occur in association with various malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.

The plate and screws became dislodged and eroded through the posterior wall of the esophagus, then traversed the limit of the gastrointestinal tract. But this is related to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】In the literature, missing screws were described rarely. However, only one symptomatic missing plate was described. This is first case in literature with asymptomatic, missing plate and screws. We concluded that plate and screws had been eliminated thought the intestinal tract without any significant notice. Seemingly, the plate penetrates into esophagus at one side and healing process of esophagus continues on the other side. As a result of this mechanism, the plate and screws left the body without any significant defect in esophagus.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】It can be concluded that in surgery of the cervical spine, anterior instrumentation is useful and relatively safe. Each case with displacement of plate and screws, neurosurgeons must be alert for esophageal perforation or other tissue injuries.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Disclosure</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that the article content was composed in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:17:58", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:18:20", "cost": 22.571}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:58", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:18:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:17:57"}

It is characterized by a reduced ejection fraction (EF). Although its frequency is not high, clinicians have to keep in mind this condition because of high mortality rate in its severe cases. PPCM, even with a normal heart beat, may sometimes develop ventricular thrombus due to reduced EF and hypercoagulable status during the perinatal period. We here present a case of PPCM that was affected by a left ventricular (LV) thrombus.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 25-year-old female without any medical history visited our emergency department with upper abdominal pain. She recollected suffering from a leg edema at 36 weeks of gestation due to pregnancy hypertension as diagnosed by an obstetrician. A month after she gave birth to her first child, she presented with worsening leg edema and exertional dyspnea. Simultaneously, she also had mild upper abdominal pain. She denied any use of tobacco or alcohol.\n\n【4】On admission, her blood pressure was 127/99 mm Hg, heart rate was 130 beats/min, body temperature was 36.4 °C, and oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. Initial clinical examination revealed a weight of 55 kg, and height of 165 cm. Inspection of the palpebral conjunctiva revealed no evidence of anemia. Auscultation of the heart revealed diastolic and systolic heart murmurs (third and fourth heart sounds) in the cardiac apex. Auscultation of the lungs revealed no rale or other lung sounds. Physical examination of the patient revealed pitting edema in both legs but no cyanosis.\n\n【5】Blood chemistry analyses revealed the following: mildly elevated white blood cell counts (9,220 cells/μL), mild anemia (red blood cell count, 431 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> cells/μL; hemoglobin, 11.2 g/dL), mild hypoproteinemia (5.5 g/dL), mild hypoalbuminemia (3.4 g/dL), mildly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (245 IU/L), slightly elevated serum creatinine levels (0.84 mg/dL), and remarkably elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels (2,000 pg/mL). There was no evidence of coagulation dysfunction (prothrombin time, 71%; activated partial thromboplastin time, 26.2 s).\n\n【6】Ultrasonography and non-contrast computed tomography were performed and revealed an edematous gall bladder and dilated hepatic and inferior jugular veins . Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly with a cardio-thoracic ratio of 58%; moreover, there was evidence of pulmonary congestion and pleural effusion . Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm, heart rate of 130 beats/min, poor R progression in leads V1-V3, and inverted T wave in leads V4-V6. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a dilated left ventricle of 63 mm in diastolic phase and 58 mm in systolic phase with a reduced EF of 17% . Color Doppler revealed moderate mitral regurgitation. At this time, she was diagnosed with congestive heart failure resulting from dilated cardiomyopathy, which was consistent with PPCM.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

These improved her heart failure with sufficient diuretic effects. On day 6, X-ray revealed disappearance of heart congestion and cardiomegaly . However, thromboses of 16 × 8 and 29 × 11 mm in her left ventricle were revealed via TTE on day 10 . Heparin sodium and warfarin potassium were initiated, reducing the thromboses. While her symptoms improved, EF was not restored to normal function. She was discharged on day 40 and an outpatient clinic follow-up was planned.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

In a US survey conducted between 2004 and 2011, the incidence of PPCM was 1 in 968 births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, more than the Japanese rate of 1 in 20,000 births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The definition of PPCM includes the following criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>: 1) onset of new congestive heart failure between 1 month before and up to 5 months after; 2) history of cardiac condition, 3) no other causes of heart failure; and 4) LVEF < 45-50%, LV fractional shortening of < 30%, and LV end-diastolic dimension/body mass index of > 27 mm/m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n【14】Etiology of PPCM is generally unrecognized; however, there are several presumable causes for PPCM, including viral infection, abnormal reactions in the immunology system, circulatory overload accompanied by pregnancy, and endocrine disorders. Considering the difference of incidence between the US and Japan, etiology of PPCM may chiefly depend on ethnicity. With the growing awareness of this disease, the number of cases diagnosed as PPCM is expected to increase. PPCM is also associated with the occurrence of myocarditis or potential dilated cardiomyopathy caused by cardiac overload in prenatal and postnatal period. Recent animal experiments focused on the association with prolactin or angiogenic growth factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The risk factors of PPCM include a multiple pregnancy, advanced age pregnancy, prolific childbirth, people of African descent, gestational hypertension, history of hypertension, smoking, obesity, and use of tocolytic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Among these factors, pregnancy hypertension is the biggest risk factor; approximately 57% of patients with PPCM are reported to have associated pregnancy hypertension, with no difference between races 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In 50% of patients with PPCM, cardiac function is restored, whereas 50% of patients have reduced cardiac function. In our case, the patient’s cardiac function did not improve, as observed on the 6-month follow-up. A small number of patients deteriorate and require heart transplant or risk death.\n\n【16】Treatment for PPCM in its acute phase is a standardized strategy for heart failure, including diuretic drugs, beta blockers, catecholamine, and mechanical circulatory support devices (intra-aortic balloon pumping and percutaneous cardiopulmonary support). In its chronic phase, oral drugs, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, and diuretic drugs, are generally used. In patients with severe and refractory heart failure, heart transplant is required. In some patients with PPCM, immunosuppressive agents and anti-prolactin drugs are attempted. There is no established consensus or guideline on the cessation of medical treatment in the chronic phase.\n\n【17】Seventeen percent of PPCM cases are reported to have associated ventricle thrombus. This may be caused by the hypercoagulable status during the perinatal period or congestive blood flow with reduced cardiac function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Immediate anti-coagulant therapy is effective in reducing the ventricle thrombus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. It is unclear whether anti-coagulant therapy is necessary in congestive heart failure patients with a normal sinus rhythm because of hemorrhagic risks; anti-coagulant therapy is recommended for congestive heart failure patients in atrial fibrillation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In patients with PPCM, administration of anti-coagulant agents should be considered to prevent thromboembolic complications due to the hypercoagulable status.\n\n【18】In our case, coagulation test was studied on day 10 when the left ventricle thromboses were evident, revealing elevated levels of plasmin-α2 plasmin inhibitor complex 1.9 μg/mL (normal levels < 0.8 μg/mL) and thrombin-antithrombin complex 3.6 μg/mL (normal levels < 3.0 μg/mL). This result might suggest that the overexpression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Hence, reduction in thromboses in this patient was expected.\n\n【19】In our patient, upper abdominal pain at admission was due to congestive cholestasis. The mechanism of upper abdominal pain in patients with congestive heart failure is to occur mainly from the expansion of hepatic cells by elevated sinusoidal pressure caused by cholestasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. An additional mechanism of congestive heart failure due to gallbladder edema and infection may cause decreased blood flow in cystic artery, leading to acalculous cholecystitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Not only with imaging modalities but also with clinical symptoms and manifestation, it was crucial to recognize the presence of congestive heart failure in this patient.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】PPCM is one of the differential diagnoses in cardiomyopathy that occurs in perinatal or postnatal women. Clinicians should remember that PPCM may be associated with ventricle thrombus caused by the hypercoagulable state in the perinatal period or vascular congestion in reduced cardiac function. They should also remember that PPCM may present gastrointestinal symptoms due to liver congestion.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:25:56", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:26:09", "cost": 13.392}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:58", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:26:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:25:47"}

An isolated osteochondral fracture of metatarsal head is extremely rare and a few numbers of cases have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-6 \\]</u>. The treatment of these fractures is controversial.

In this paper, authors present a case of an osteochondral fracture of second metatarsal head that was treated by open reduction and internal fixation with a headless compression screw.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 19-year-old female patient was admitted to the polyclinic with a history of right foot injury that occurred while she stepped down from a high ground. On landing, she hyperextended the toes and felt severe pain in her second metatarsophalangeal joint. On physical examination, swelling and ecchymosis on the forefoot was evident and the patient complained of severe pain over the second metatarsophalangeal joint. Palpation revealed tenderness, crepitation and painful motion of second metatarsophalangeal joint. Neurovascular examination was normal.\n\n【4】Radiographic examination of the foot showed a dorsally displaced osteochondral fragment and a bony defect on the second metatarsal head .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Closed reduction was not attempted in order to protect osteochondral fragment from additional trauma.\n\n【7】Under spinal anesthesia, tourniquet was applied, extremity was prepared and draped. Dorsal longitudinal skin incision was made over the second metatarsophalangeal joint. Extensor tendon was retracted and the fracture was exposed with longitudinal capsulotomy. The osteochondral fragment was found to be completely separated and minimal dorsal capsular soft tissue attachment was seen. Metatarsal head was evaluated in terms of underlying bone pathology such as Frieberg disease and no evidence has found regarding such a condition. Fracture has been reduced anatomically under direct vision and provisional fixation was performed via 1 mm Kirschner wire. During the reduction, maximum effort was performed to protect the soft tissue attachment of fracture fragment. Reduction quality was checked and permanent fixation was obtained with an 18 mm headless compression screw . After the evaluation of joint stability and range of motion, wound was closed. A plaster cast was not applied and early active range of motion and partially weight-bearing were allowed. The patient has been followed up at regular intervals and the postoperative course was uneventful. Serial radiographs performed during follow-up visits demonstrated good screw position and progress of fracture healing. At the 12 months follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic with full range of motion of the second metatarsophalangeal joint and there was no radiographic evidence of avascular necrosis .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

These fractures are usually seen at the second metatarsal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-7 \\]</u>. The second metatarsal is the longest and is subjected to the greatest reactive ground forces during ambulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. However, osteochondral fractures of the third and fourth metatarsal head have been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】This type of fracture can occur as a result of direct trauma or shear force on metatarsal head 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-6 \\]</u>. Some authors stated that direct trauma is the primary mechanism of injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 \\]</u>. However, it has been reported that shear force on metatarsal head can be the main factor rather than direct trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2-5 \\]</u>. During the toe-off phase, the base of the proximal phalanges creates compressive and shearing forces along the dorsal articular surface of the metatarsal head 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In our case, we think that fracture occurred as a result of shear force when her second toe was in hyperextension at the metatarsophalangeal joint.\n\n【13】Treatment of osteochondral fracture of the metatarsal head is controversial. Heckman 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> reported an isolated osteochondral fracture of the fourth metatarsal head which was not diagnosed initially and was not treated. This patient did well despite persistent dislocation of the metatarsal articular surface because of remodeling of the remaining metatarsal head. Dutkowsky and Freeman 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> reported a case of an osteochondral fracture of the third metatarsal head. They performed closed reduction and walking cast for 6 weeks. However, their patient had a loss of 10° active flexion of third metatarsophalangeal joint. The final conclusion of this paper was that if closed reduction is unsuccessful, open reduction and internal fixation appears to be good alternative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Liddle and Rosenfild 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> reported a case of isolated second metatarsal head fracture. Initially, conservative treatment with buddy taping and AirCast boot was attempted. After 5 months of conservative treatment, surgery was performed because of continued symptoms of unremitting pain over the second toe. The authors reported good results clinically and radiographically after surgical treatment. For this reason, they advised that early operative intervention should be performed when there is significant displacement or rotation in this type of fracture. Tanaka et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, Mereddy et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> and Atik et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> reported good clinical results regarding surgically treated osteochondral metatarsal head fractures. These authors initially attempted closed reduction but failed because of the small size of the displaced fracture fragment. We did not try closed reduction initially because of the prevention of osteochondral fragment from additional trauma and further fragmentation. When considering our clinical and radiologic results and aforementioned cases in the literature, it can be said that open reduction and internal fixation may be the best option for treatment of osteochondral metatarsal head fractures.\n\n【14】Various fixation techniques and implants have been utilized for treatment of this type of fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-5 \\]</u>. Atik et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> fixed a second metatarsal head fracture via two cross K-wires and they reported excellent clinical and radiologic results. Tanaka et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> performed internal fixation with one Herbert screw for treatment of second metatarsal head fracture and reported good clinical and radiological results. Mereddy et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> used a twist-off screw for fixation of fourth metatarsal head fracture. They reported that patient was asymptomatic and there was no radiographic evidence of avascular necrosis at the end of the 12 months follow-up period. Liddle and Rosenfeld 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> also selected a 2 mm screw for fixation of the fracture. When considering the principles of intraarticular fracture management, we though that a headless compression screw is a good option to obtain interfragmentary compression at the fracture site.\n\n【15】As a conclusion, open reduction and internal fixation allow restoration of joint anatomy, and thus best chance of achieving normal function. However, we think that gentle handling and protection of soft tissue attachment of fracture fragment are important aspects during the operation. Because the fracture is intraarticular, rigid compressive fixation and early active postoperative motion may be the best option for treatment of this type of fracture.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:50:31", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:50:53", "cost": 21.82}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:58", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:50:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:50:30"}

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on an aneurismal dilation of portal vein due to left liver lobe aplasia. Portal vein aneurysms (PVAs) are commonly observed as saccular pseudo aneurysms. Portal vein diameter greater than 20 mm is accepted as an aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Usually, this condition is observed secondary to portal hypertension in patients with chronic hepatic disease. True aneurysms which all wall layers prevented in the absence of chronic hepatic disease and portal hypertension are extremely rare. In this paper, clinical and radiologic findings of incidentally found left liver lobe aplasia and PVA in a 27-week pregnant woman presented with acute abdomen and operated for a right side ovarian torsion are discussed.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 36-year-old pregnant woman was admitted to our clinic with nausea, bilious vomiting and acute abdomen. Her medical history revealed that her complaints begun 3 days before and she was followed up in another clinic for a preliminary diagnosis of acute appendicitis. In abdominal examination, abdomen was distended and rebound tenderness was present in the right para median region. Obstetric ultrasound revealed a pregnancy of 26 weeks and 6 days, consistent with the last menstrual period. Ultrasound examination was performed with LOGIQ 9 (GE Healthcare Technologies, Ultrasound, Milwaukee, USA) convex (2 - 5 MHz) transducer. Obstetric ultrasound revealed a single live intrauterine fetus of 27 weeks with a fetal weight of about 969 g with cephalic presentation and normal fetal growth. A 78 × 50 mm cyst and solid structures compatible with adnex above the cyst were defined on right side ovary. There were no arterial signals detected by a color Doppler sonography (CDS) on solid tissues around the cyst. In abdominal ultrasound, portal vein was larger than normal and its largest diameter was measured as 24 mm in the distal site adjacent to liver and 21 mm in the middle site. Hepatic and splenic parenchyma echoes and sizes were in normal ranges. There was no free fluid in abdomen. Splenic vein diameter was measured as 8 mm.\n\n【4】A lower abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a 1.5 T MRI tool (General Electric Signa Excita, GE Health Care System, Milwaukee, USA) revealed a smooth edged cystic lesion on right ovary sized 80 × 33 mm, which was hypointense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted series. A solid structure was detected on superior aspect of the cyst which was compatible with at least two times twisted salpinx. Left liver lobe and left portal vein were aplastic and were not visualized. In hepatic hilum, portal vein was divided into two main branches both advancing to the right lobe. Portal vein seemed dilated and its diameter was 24 mm just before bifurcation, 21 mm in the middle part and 20 mm in proximal portion . Contrast was not used as the patient was pregnant.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Coronal T2-weighted images (A, B) show a smooth edged hyperintense cystic lesion on right ovary and twisted salpinx  was seen on superior aspect of the cyst. The left liver lobe was aplasic (big white arrow). Portal vein was dilated and diameters were measured 24 mm on distal portion, (C) 21 mm in the middle part and 20 mm in proximal portion. (D) Axial fat sat T2-weighted gradient echo image from mid level of liver shows right portal vein (RPV), gall bladder (GB) and caudat lobe (CL). (E) Axial gradient echo fat sat image from upper level of liver shows left liver lob was aplasic  and spleen sizes were in normal ranges. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【6】These findings suggested an ovarian torsion and patient was taken to operation room with ritodrine treatment for tocolysis. Abdomen was explored through a 4 cm sized right oblique paramedian incision and a cystic mass of 7 × 7 cm in size was found. Macroscopic view of the mass was compatible with a hemorrhagic infarct . With a careful inspection, the mass was observed to be a four-time anti-clockwise twisted ovary and tuba. Salpinx was stuck to ovary and twisted with it. Thus, the tissues were necrotic, and a salphingo-ooferectomy and an appendectomy were performed. Histopathological examination revealed hemorrhagic infarct of the ovarian and tubal tissue . Postoperative course was uneventful both for the mother and the fetus.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. (A) Four-time anti-clockwise twisted ovary and tuba.

There were no esophageal varices on endoscopic examination. There were no laboratory findings consistent with chronic viral hepatitis or chronic liver failure. Patient was discharged on second postoperative day as no findings of portal hypertension have been found as well.\n\n【9】The CDS examination performed after operation, in the 31st week of gestation revealed no decrease in portal vein diameter. About one month later, the labor, CDS and MRI were repeated. Portal venous diameter was measured as 21 mm on distal part near the liver, 19 mm on middle part and 16 mm on proximal portion . Partial decrease on portal venous diameter suggested that pregnancy had some effect on portal vein dilation.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

(B) Axial T1-weighted gradient echo and (C) gradient echo fat sat MR images show decreased portal vein diameters. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Ovarian torsion is a rare cause of acute abdomen and its incidence is 0.05% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In pregnancy, its incidence is higher than normal population due to ligamentous laxity caused by increased levels of some hormones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Ovarian mass is regarded as a risk factor for ovarian torsion. While the most common cause of ovarian torsion in pregnancy is the corpus luteum, all of the ovarian masses may lead to this condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In our case, pregnancy and cystic mass were considered as risk factors for the ovarian torsion. The pathologic evaluation of the resected cystic lesion was reported as “persistent corpus luteum”.\n\n【13】Generally, PVAs occur secondary to portal hypertension. Portal vein diameter may increase up to 19 mm in cirrhotic patients. Portal vein diameter size greater than 20 mm at maximum is regarded as PVA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Regardless of whether left liver lobe aplasia causes gastric malpositioning and volvulus, these are generally asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report about PVA associated with left liver lobe aplasia.\n\n【14】In our case, the most important mechanism in the pathogenesis of the PVA development in the absence of chronic hepatic disease is increased retrograde flow due to increased resistance caused by left liver lobe and left portal vein aplasia. Also, decrease in portal vein diameter after labor suggests some gestational effect on this dilation. In a normal gestation, volume of plasma increases by 10% in the 12th week and up to 40% in the middle of the third trimester 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Splanchnic blood flow and portal vein blood will naturally increase as well. There are reports showing increased portal vein blood flow in pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In pregnant women, it is known that some hormones like relaxin (RLX) affect vascular smooth muscles to make dilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. RLX is an insulin-like hormone produced by corpus luteum, placenta and decidua in pregnant women. It converts endothelin (ET) big molecule to ET 1-32 by increasing the gelatinase activity. Produced ET 1-32 provokes endothelial receptor B to produce NO and make vasodilatation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. There are many reports about the effects of RLX on vascular bed and kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report about its effects on portal venous system and liver. Pregnancy does not cause significant portal vein dilation in an individual with a healthy liver. In our case, left liver lobe aplasia caused an increase in the portal vein blood flow and this situation contributed the vein dilation.\n\n【15】As a result, this case shows that patients with left liver lobe aplasia may develop aneurismal portal vein dilation even in the absence of chronic hepatic disease and for these patients portal vein diameter may increase in the course of gestation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:54:39", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:54:48", "cost": 8.484}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:58", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:54:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:54:30"}

Kuster defined urological components in MRKH in 1910, and defined differentiation from testicular feminization syndrome in 1961. External genitalia appearance and the development of secondary sex characteristics are normal in adolescence in MRKH syndrome cases. Therefore, the majority of cases are admitted with complaints of primary amenorrhea in adolescent period. Patients who are diagnosed before puberty are generally diagnosed incidentally and these patients are admitted to hospital with other health problems in birth or childhood. Mean age at diagnosis was ranged from 15 to 18 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The aim of this case report is to present the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), clinical features, treatment methods and assisted reproductive techniques in patients with MRKH syndrome.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 24-year-old patient was admitted to our clinic with complaint of primary amenorrhea. According to the patient’s medical history, patient was admitted to the doctor many times and each time oral contraceptive pills have been started or been told that you should wait a little more. It was learned from the patient’s family history that patient’s parents have a consanguineous marriages and there is no other known cases of primary amenorrhea in entire family members. Patient’s mother did not use any medications during pregnancy. Pubertal development had begun at 11 years old and thelarche had begun at 13 years old in patient. The patient did not have any pain. Height was measured 155 cm, and body weight was measured 48 kg in physical examination. Secondary sex characteristics such as breast development and axillary and pubic hair were normal. External genitalia, urethra and vaginal orifice were normal in gynecological examination. Imperforate hymen could not be ruled out because patient did not accept vaginal examination.\n\n【4】Total blood count and biochemistry laboratory values were within normal limits. Estradiol: 82 pg/mL 通用删除7(英):<u>(20-160)</u> pg/L, FSH: 5.48 mIU/mL (2.8-11.3), LH: 4.69 (1.1-11.6) mIU/mL, prolactin: 21.94 ng/mL (1.9-25) and androgen levels (free testosterone: 1.81 pg/mL (0.06-2.57) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone: 0.3 ng/mL (0.10-1.0); androstenedione: 1.8 ng/mL (0 from 0.21 to 3, 08), DHEA-S: 145 g/dL 通用删除7(英):<u>(65-380)</u>) were normal in hormonal evaluation.\n\n【5】Hypoechoic structure which is approximately 18 × 15 × 10 mm in size, behind the bladder and midline in position, and maybe the rudimentary uterus was observed in pelvic ultrasonography. Both ovaries could not be visualized. The left kidney could not be visualized in abdominal ultrasound. There was an ectopic kidney variation on the right side and right kidney was seen in the right half of the pelvis. Pelvic MRI was planned in order to evaluate both ovaries and hypoechoic structure behind the bladder.\n\n【6】Pelvic MRI was performed at 1.5 T (Sonata; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) MR device by using pelvic phased-array coil. Pelvic MR images were obtained by sagittal T2 turbo spin echo (TSE), axial T2 TSE TRA fat sat, axial pre- and post-contrast T1 TSE TRA fat sat sequence. Approximately 15 × 5 mm in diameter hypointense viewed uterine remnant in retrovesical area was seen in MRI . Cervix uteri and upper 2/3 of the vagina were not observed. Right ovary could not be visualized. Left ovary was measured 17 × 15 mm in diameter and it was observed above the normal localization secondary to incomplete descent .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

This result supported the diagnosis of MRKH syndrome. Patient was informed about this situation and psychological support was provided. In addition, patient was informed about the methods of assisted reproduction that can be applied in the future.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】MRKH syndrome is the second most common cause of primary amenorrhea and it is observed in approximately 15% of primary amenorrhea patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The incidence of the syndrome has been reported as 1:4,000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Although the reason of MRKH syndrome is not fully understood, it is implicated that polygenic and environmental factors are responsible in etiology. In our case, there were no history about gestational diabetes in mother, and thalidomide or diethylstilbestrol using during pregnancy. There was no other MRKH syndrome in sisters and the other female family members. The first finding that suggests the diagnosis of MRKH syndrome is failure to monitor menarche during puberty in spite of normal development of secondary sex characteristics. Diagnosis would be clear after using radiologic modalities and karyotype analysis.\n\n【12】The female internal genital tract (fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and 2/3 upper vagina) develops from Mullerian duct during embryogenesis. MRKH syndrome is thought to arise from pausing of the development and differentiation of the Mullerian duct after 7 weeks of embryogenesis.\n\n【13】Urinary tract anomalies can be accompanied with MRKH syndrome because embryologically urinary system and genital system develop together. MRKH syndrome is classified into type I and II according to accompanying urinary and other system abnormalities. Bilateral ovaries, fallopian tubes and renal systems development are normal in type I MRKH syndrome. Complete uterine aplasia or two rudimentary horn associated with peritoneal folds are found. Lower 1/3 portion of vagina can be complete in its development, may be terminated with a blind pouch or may be atresic because it is originated from ectodermal cells. Type II MRKH syndrome may accompany with Mullerian duct aplasia, renal dysplasia and cervical somites anomaly with unilateral renal agenesis, renal ectopia and horseshoe kidney variation, skeletal system anomalies especially vertebral anomalies and scoliosis, hearing problems, heart defects, syndactyly and polydactyly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In our case, there were pelvic kidney variation on the right side and renal agenesis on the left side . Other systems were normal.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3. Ectopic kidney localized in the pelvic region. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【15】Isolated vaginal atresia, WNT4 syndrome, transverse vaginal septum, imperforate hymen and testicular feminization should be considered for the differential diagnosis of MRKH syndrome. In isolated vaginal atresia, the presence of the top 2/3 of vagina is variable, but uterus and ovaries are normally observed. In transverse vaginal septum and imperforate hymen, 2/3 portion of top of the vagina and uterus are normally observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Ectopic testis tissue is observed instead of ovaries in testicular feminization cases. Therefore, bilateral superficial inguinal USG should be done in order to determine ectopic testis tissue.\n\n【16】Pelvic ultrasonography is the first method of choice in the diagnosis of MRKH because it is simple, inexpensive and non-invasive. It is not always so easy to detect atresic or malformated internal genital organs on ultrasound. Therefore, the experience of the radiologist who performed ultrasonography is very important. In our case, a thin hypoechoic septa was observed in the localization of the uterus. Both ovaries could not be visualized. Because of the inadequacy of ultrasound findings, pelvic MRI was ordered.\n\n【17】MRI which is free of radiation, non-invasive and multiplanar imaging method, has a high soft tissue resolution. Therefore, pelvic anatomy and possible pathological conditions can be shown more clearly. It is quite important to detect rudimentary uterus between bladder and rectum in sagittal T2-weighted sequences, and to detect vaginal atresia with not visualizing normal vagina between rectum and urethra in the axial plane. MRI is also important to detect accompanying other urinary tract and anorectal malformation.\n\n【18】Uterine tissue and the upper 2/3 of the vagina are not clearly indistinguishable while the lower 1/3 of the vagina that developed from different embryonic structure is always observed in MRKH syndrome. Hematometra in various degrees can be observed as a secondary to uterine development and the presence of endometrial glands in approximately 6-10% of patients with MRKH syndrome. This situation can cause cyclic abdominal pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】All information that can be provided from ultrasound, intravenous pyelography and diagnostic laparoscopy, can be obtained with MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. MRI’s sensitivity and specificity were found 100% compared with laparoscopic findings in terms of diagnosing MRKH syndrome in a study conducted on 56 patients with MRI findings diagnosed with MRKH syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. There is no specific MRI protocol for MRKH syndrome. Every center uses different MRI sequences and shot plans in order to evaluate pelvic organs with detail and high resolution.\n\n【20】T1- and T2-weighted sequences must be obtained in the axial, coronal and sagittal plans in pelvic MRI. T2-weighted sequences are very important to determine zonal anatomy of the uterus in female pelvic MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Sagittal T2-weighted spin-echo and fast spin-echo sequences are very important in determining uterovaginal anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of uterine hypoplasia and aplasia can be best diagnosed in the sagittal T2-weighted images. The axial images are quite helpful for vaginal hypoplasia and aplasia. The normal vagina has an intermediate signal intensity. The bladder and urethra are located at the anterior of the vagina, anal canal is at the posterior of the vagina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. We can not see any structure in this location in vaginal agenesis. In the present study, we used sagittal T2-weighted TSE images for uterovaginal anomalies and rudimantary uterus and also axial fat sat T2 TSE sequences for visualization of the ovarian follicules. The abdominal organs can easily evaluate and the diagnosis of accompanying urinary tract abnormalities can be made by wide field of view sequences in coronal plane. Sagittal T2-weighted sequences are very useful in the diagnosis of hematometrocolpos which develops after transverse vaginal septum and imperforate hymen and are important for the differential diagnosis of MRKH syndrome. It is a very important imaging method to visualize rudimentary ectopic testis in order to distinguish testicular feminization from MRKH syndrome. Failures to observe uterus, upper 2/3 of the vagina and ovarian tissue are highly specific for the diagnosis of MRKH syndrome. Because ovaries are not always in the normal localization, the detection of functional follicles in MRI is an important marker. In our case, right ovary could not be visualized and left ovary was observed above the normal localization secondary to incomplete descent.\n\n【21】There are many surgical methods for treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Vaginoplasty surgery can be performed open or closed surgical technique in many ways after recovery of sexual function and emotional development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Today, MRKH syndrome cases cannot have children without surrogate mother. Ovaries respond well to gonadotropin in IVF treatment. Embryo transfer can be made to surrogate mother after combining the father’s sperm and mother’s oocytes. However, this situation can create many legal status and procedure.\n\n【22】As a result, MRI is a useful, easy and non-invasive imaging method and can be used by itself instead of many invasive or non-invasive diagnosing methods in order to diagnose MRKH syndrome and other accompanying system abnormalities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:48:08", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:48:39", "cost": 30.604}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:58", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:48:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:48:08"}

The patients with SS clinically have the slow progression of sensorineural hearing loss, cerebellar ataxia, and dementia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Causes of SS include dural defect, head or back injury, nerve root injury or brachial plexus, tumors, vascular disease such as arteriovenous malformation/fistula, and prior intradural surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is capable of detecting hemosiderin deposits at the surface of brain and spinal cord with high sensitivity, and it can also detect accumulated fluid in the spinal canal.\n\n【2】Previous studies have been focused on the relationship between SS and dural defects with fluid collection in the spinal canal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. They described the importance of imaging examinations for detecting dural defects.\n\n【3】We report the surgical treatment of a case of SS in which a dural defect with verrucous vegetation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection were detectable by intraoperative ultrasonography (US). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of SS with verrucous vegetation in the spinal canal.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 75-year-old woman had an 18-year history of headache, progression of gait disturbance, dysarthria and auditory disorder. At the time of admission, she was alert and oriented. Neurological examination revealed right-dominant severe hearing loss, dysarthria, and urinary disturbance. The finger-nose tests showed her incoordination. The patient also had cerebellar ataxia and mild motor loss in her lower extremities. Analysis of CSF indicated an increased red blood cell count and a low opening pressure. MRI showed low intensity areas on T2-weighted images on the superficial brain and spinal cord by hemosiderin deposition. Furthermore, MRI and computed tomography (CT) myelography confirmed fluid collection in the anterior spinal canal at T1 to T4 . The constructive interference in steady state (CISS) magnetic resonance (MR) images detected a dural defect at the T1/T2 level . Surgical intervention was determined to be necessary. The spinal cord appeared discolored and yellow after laminectomy from T1 to T4 level. Verrucous vegetation and epidural fluid collection around the ventral dural defect were confirmed by intraoperative US imaging before incision of the posterior dura matter . Intraoperative US also detected ventral dural defect on the right side of spinal cord . Therefore, to allow the spinal cord to be moved forward, the operating table was rotated slightly to the left. Then, the posterior dural incision was made in a manner that was slightly more right lateral than standard midline. Some dentate ligaments were separated from spinal cord side as needed. With space between the spinal cord and defect, a 5-mm ventral dural defect with verrucous vegetation was confirmed on the right side near the midline at the T1/T2 level . The ventral dural hole was identified after removal of vegetation . A secure working space was maintained by rotation of the operating table. The dural closure was carefully performed without retraction of the spinal cord. The anterior dural tear was repaired by four direct sutures using synthetic non-absorbable monofilament surgical suture (7-0 polypropylene suture thread) and a thin needle carrier . Because the tip of the needle was narrow, it was able to operate without contacting the spinal cord. After dural closure, removal of vegetation and resolution of the fluid collection were confirmed by intraoperative US images . Epidural fluid collection was not evident on postoperative MRI, and this status was stable during the 2-year follow-up. After the successful dural closure, the patient reported improvement in headaches, despite the long history of SS. However, the patient’s ataxia, hearing loss, dysarthria, walking ability, and urinary disturbance were unchanged. The neurological symptoms were stable without deterioration.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Toxic, unbound ferric ions accumulate when the protective mechanisms are exhausted because of the chronic, recurrent hemorrhage. The subsequent free radical damage, membrane dysfunction and lipid peroxidation causing neuronal injury are suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Currently, a relationship between repetitive hemorrhage in SS and dural abnormality in the spine has been demonstrated. Sometimes, MRI observed a longitudinal extensive fluid-filled collection in the spinal canal in SS patients. This fluid collection is associated with CSF leakage arising from dural defects in the spine. CISS MR imaging can also be used to detect defects, and the images clearly show discontinuity of the dura mater. However, it is difficult to figure out the actual location of a small dural tear even by CT myelography or thin-slice MRI in the patients with SS.\n\n【11】In our case, US imaging intraoperatively showed epidural collected fluid around the ventral dural defect with verrucous vegetation before incision of the posterior dura mater. By clearly showing the small dural hole, intraoperative US could help surgeon in decision making about precise dural incision before repairment. It is important to maintain a secure working space by rotating the operating table. Moderate rotation is also beneficial because the surgeon can operate on the ventral site of the spinal cord without putting a burden on it.\n\n【12】A repairment of dural defect has been shown to stabilize CSF leakage and subarachnoid hemorrhage regardless of the closing method. These examination findings do not dramatically improve the symptoms of SS. The successful repairment of a dural defect can halt the neurological symptom progression and might improve symptom related to CSF hypovolemia. Recently, surgical closure for the defect is the most responsible method useful to halt the progression of SS symptoms related to dural defect. In our case, the ventral fluid collection disappeared postoperatively, suggesting that the dural defect was successfully repaired. The continuous exposure of neural tissue to toxic hemosiderin deposits and free radical damage might result in irreversible and even progressive neurological disturbances. Consistent with previous studies, surgical closure of the dural defect in our case halted disease progression. Although closure might improve some symptoms related to CSF hypovolemia, its effect might be reduced in patients with longer history of SS. Thereby, earlier diagnosis, detection of the dural defect level, and surgical closure are important for keeping to minimum neurological disorder in SS patients.\n\n【13】Conclusions\n\n【14】The progression of neurological impairment in SS related to dural defect can be stopped by surgical closure. US is intraoperatively informative for detection of the dural defect site and verrucous vegetation before repairment and identifying the dural defect closure, successful removal of vegetation and resolution of fluid collection after repair.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient agreed to provide her information for the publication of this case report.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MM and SI participated in the literature search and drafted the manuscript.

In the present study, we report a case of multiple hospital admissions on account of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and angina-like symptoms. Following an extensive workup, the patient was found to have multiple coronary artery ectasias (CAE) and aneurysms together with multiple intracranial arterial dolichoectasias (IADEs) and aneurysms. The complexity of this case and the challenge in management rendered reporting of this case essential.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 60-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department on account of left anterior chest pain that radiated to the left arm. The pain was non-exertional, had been present for a while (not specific), and was mild and intermittent but suddenly grew worse that afternoon. At presentation, she claimed that the pain was no longer present. A review of the systems was negative for any related symptoms. The physical exam was unremarkable, and the vital signs were within the normal range. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm (NSR), with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute (bpm) and T-wave inversion in V4 and V5. The troponin level was mildly elevated (0.082, 0.084, 0.089, 0.083 ng/mL). Echocardiology showed no left ventricular (LV) wall motion abnormalities and normal overall LV systolic function; the LV ejection fraction was 60%, and the LV diastolic function was indeterminate. The nuclear stress test showed abnormal dipyridamole stress myocardial perfusion imaging, representing moderate inferior and inferolateral ischemia with partial scarring, borderline LV size, and mild LV dysfunction. The patient was a poor candidate for invasive cardiac workup in terms of an angiogram due to severe anemia and was treated medically with aspirin, isosorbide mononitrate, nifedipine, and atorvastatin. The patient’s symptoms disappeared during her stay in the hospital, and she was discharged with a plan to repeat the ECG in 6 - 8 weeks and follow-up with a cardiologist as an outpatient. One month later, the patient was brought to the hospital for evaluation of further chest pain with the same physical and ECG characteristics as the previous episode and minimal elevation of troponin (0.075 - 0.052). Echocardiology showed no differences from the previous. The general condition of the patient was more stable, and the anemia had improved; therefore coronary angiography was performed, the findings of which were: right-side dominance; severe ectasia of the left main coronary artery (LMCA); extreme ectasia of the left anterior descending artery (LAD), with multiple areas of moderate-to-severe distal and apical stenosis; multiple areas of stenosis including the first obtuse marginal artery (OM1), and distal left circumflex artery (LCX); ectopic origin from the left cusp of the right coronary artery (RCA); and total proximal occlusion with the distal vessel receiving collaterals from the left system .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Due to the involvement of numerous arteries, no stent or angioplasty was performed. Ranolazine was started, and the other medications were continued, and the patient was discharged with outpatient follow-up.\n\n【7】Two weeks later, the patient was brought to the hospital on account of dizziness that occurred while doing physical therapy for leg pain. The patient had had multiple episodes of dizziness, but this time she sought medical attention. The patient was alert, oriented for place, person, and times. The neurological exam showed: normal muscle tone; power 5/5; bilateral deep tendon reflex 2+ in the upper and lower limbs; bilateral plantar response; sensory intactness to a light touch; and normal bilateral finger to nose. Orthostatic vitals were negative for orthostatic hypotension. Head computerized tomography (CT) angiography showed: severe IADE involving the vertebrobasilar system, bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries, and bilateral middle cerebral arteries. There were multiple aneurysms in the left supraclinoid internal carotid artery and bilateral cavernous internal carotid arteries. The sagittal 2D reconstructed images demonstrated a moderate mass effect on the ventral medulla. Considering the severe nature of the IADE and the tortuosity of the vertebrobasilar system, this appearance was likely due to a mass effect on the medulla by the dolichoectatic vertebral-basilar arteries .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

The prevalence is estimated at 0.08-6.5% in the general population; however, patients who have had a cerebrovascular accident have a higher occurrence in the range of 3-17% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Complications of IADE may include ischemic stroke and brain stem compression, which are most commonly seen in vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia with a high 5-year risk. Less frequent complications include subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebral bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 \\- 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Moreover, risk factors of CAE and IADE have concurrent risk factors including advanced age, male gender, hypertension, and smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 \\]</u>. A history of myocardial infarction has also been documented as a risk factor for vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Of note, patients with diabetes mellitus have a low incidence of CAE, which may be due to the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) with a negative remodeling in response to atherosclerosis. Smoking also appears to be a more common risk factor in patients with CAE than in those with coronary artery disease (CAD), and cocaine use is an independent predictor of CAE, irrespective of smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】A common pathogenesis has been suggested for CAE and IADE, which implies that dilative arteriopathy may be a systemic process involving several arterial beds simultaneously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This establishes that CAE and IADE are part of a generalized arterial ectasia that is seen in other arteries such as the thoracic and abdominal aorta and the internal carotid arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 9 \\]</u>. Another pathological pattern of affected muscular arteries has been reported, including rarefaction of the elastic tissue of the media with degeneration of the internal elastic lamina, in addition to MMP-3 dysfunction with the same genotype involvement (5A/5A in the promoter region) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】The management of CAE includes drug treatment, angioplasty with a shunt, and surgery. The medical management is contentious, since there is still no sufficient evidence-based approach. Some authors recommend long-term anticoagulation therapy with warfarin based on the significant flow disturbances within ectatic segments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 10 \\]</u>; however, this could not be used with our patient, since she had had multiple falls in the past, secondary to dizziness. This therapy has not been tested prospectively and should only be used as a risk vs. benefit approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It is also suggested that patients (including asymptomatic individuals) be placed on antiplatelet therapy, such as aspirin or adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitors; however, again, this has not yet been evaluated in prospective randomized studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The role of nitrates or calcium channel blockers for angina remains controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. With the strong association between CAE and atherosclerosis, guideline-directed medical therapy for risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia should be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>; medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins may be useful in disrupting disease progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】In patients with coexisting obstructive lesions and symptoms or signs of significant ischemia despite medical therapy, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) could be attempted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This technique is relatively challenging, especially with the existence of a large vessel caliber, thrombus burden within the aneurysm, and the potential requirement for a covered stent. Thrombus aspiration can be attempted if identified within the aneurysm. In cases where residual thrombus remains in the artery despite aspiration, some authors advocate for triple therapy (dual antiplatelet treatment and an anticoagulant). Low-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg once daily) has been suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. There are insufficient data regarding the revascularization of stenotic ectatic coronary arteries. Drug-eluting balloon-expandable stents are used wherever possible. Self-expanding stents (SESs) are advantageous in that they achieve a complete apposition of stent struts as a result of their constant gentle outward force. The newer generation SES STENTYS stent, made from nitinol with nickel-titanium alloy, self-expands, and is confined to the vessel lumen over time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The covered balloon-expandable Jostent has been shown to be capable of treating some coronary aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】In the symptomatic patient who is not suitable for stent insertion, surgical excision, or ligation of the aneurysm with bypass graft of the affected coronary arteries may be the procedure of choice. Coronary artery aneurysm of at least 3 - 4 times the size of the original vessel diameter is considered an absolute indication for surgical intervention by many due to the propensity for complications such as compression, rupture, or thrombosis. Solitary bypass grafting is suggested by some authors as the intervention of choice for non-giant aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Other surgical options include aneurysm ligation, resection, or marsupialization with interposition grafting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】On the other hand, the best protocol for the management of IADE is uncertain. To prevent cerebrovascular accidents, blood pressure control should be prioritized. Antiplatelet therapy may also be indicated for the prevention of recurrent stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Patients presenting with compressive neurological manifestations should likely undergo a surgical evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Standard surgical procedures that may be indicated include ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion for hydrocephalus, microsurgery for trigeminal neuralgia or hemifacial spasms, superficial temporal artery-superior cerebellar artery (STA-SCA) bypass, proximal balloon occlusion, and thrombectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Conclusions\n\n【23】CAE and IADE may occur concurrently in a patient since they have similar risk factors and pathogenesis. These are also thought to arise as part of a generalized arterial ectasia, as noticed in our patient; she had ectasia that involved multiple arteries. The management protocol for such a patient is complicated and requires a multidisciplinary team to optimize the patient’s condition. Moreover, there is a need for a more prospective study to identify the best way to treat such a patient.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr. Richard Grodman in the Cardiology Department and Dr. Joseph Bibawy in the Department of Radiology of our institute for providing us with the test images.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors report no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>H.

It usually spreads in contiguous lymph nodes along the lymphatic system and then infiltrates in organs such as the liver, bone, and lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Thus, hepatic involvement usually occurs late during the disease or at an advanced stage, and hepatic presentation without lymphadenopathy is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The standard treatment regimen consists of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), but pulmonary sequelae due to bleomycin toxicity usually occur after ABVD chemotherapy. Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is monoclonal anti-CD30 antibody conjugated with monomethyl auristatin E. Hodgkin cells and Reed-Sternberg cells usually express CD30, and CD30 is the target antigen for BV. BV in combination with ABVD chemotherapy without bleomycin has recently been reported to show favorable efficacy for CHL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We report here a case of hepatic Hodgkin lymphoma presenting as a solitary hepatic mass following other iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (OII-LPDs) in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our patient received BV combination chemotherapy and achieved complete response. This is the first case of hepatic Hodgkin lymphoma in which complete metabolic response was achieved with BV combination chemotherapy in a patient with RA.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 71-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for the evaluation of multiple hepatic masses in December 2015. She was diagnosed as having RA in 1992 at another hospital and had been taking methotrexate for RA for over 10 years. She had a fever of more than 38 °C for over 2 months, and her laboratory examination showed an elevated level of C-reactive protein (CRP). Computed tomography (CT) showed multiple lymphadenopathies in bilateral supraclavicular and mediastinal regions, and multiple masses in the liver and spleen. Methotrexate was discontinued before her admission to our hospital, and positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) showed no accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose in the whole body after methotrexate discontinuation. Thus, we suspected OII-LPDs, especially methotrexate-associated LPD (MTX-LPD), although a histological diagnosis of OII-LPD was not obtained owing to spontaneous regression. After methotrexate discontinuation, polyarthritis appeared, and etanercept was started for RA in December 2017. However, CT showed a solitary hepatic mass in October 2018. After etanercept was switched to abatacept, the hepatic mass continued to grow. She was readmitted to our hospital after abatacept discontinuation in September 2019. Physical examination revealed no apparent abnormalities of the thorax and abdomen. The hepatic mass was not palpable, and ulnar drift deformities were found in all fingers, but no joint swelling was found. Laboratory examination revealed mild anemia (hemoglobin level: 11.1 g/dL) and increased levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (547 IU/L, normal range: 165 - 320), soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (720 IU/L, normal range: 121 - 613) and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (258.5 ng/mL, normal range: 17.3 - 59.7). The levels of CRP and lactic dehydrogenase were within the normal range. The titers of the rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody increased to 225 IU/mL (normally below 18) and 273 U/ml (normally below 4.5), respectively. CT showed a solitary mass in the right lobe of the liver . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a low-intensity solitary mass on T1-weighted images  and a high-intensity solitary mass on T2-weighted  and diffusion-weighted images in the anterior segment of the right lobe . PET-CT showed abnormal accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose in the solitary hepatic mass . Thus, liver biopsy was performed in October 2019. Histopathological examination showed that large-sized abnormal cells and dense inflammatory cells were found in a biopsied liver sample . Among the dense inflammatory cells, most were CD3-positive T lymphocytes  and a few were CD20-positive B lymphocytes. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the large abnormal cells were positive for CD30  and MUM-1, and negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, CD15, CD20, and CD79. The Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) in situ hybridization was positive for abnormal cells . The Ki-67 labelling index was high . These findings led to the diagnosis of hepatic Hodgkin lymphoma-type OII-LPD in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Chromosomal analysis using G banding was not carried out. Bone marrow examination showed no abnormal cells.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Images of hepatic mass.

Biologics have been used for the treatment of RA, but they pose the risk of infections, especially pneumonia, and bleomycin has been reported to have pulmonary toxicity. Thus, we selected BV instead of bleomycin. BV combination AVD (BV, 50 mg per body; doxorubicin, 30 mg per body; vinblastine, 7.5 mg per body; dacarbazine, 460 mg per body) chemotherapy was administered every 2 weeks. She did not complain of any adverse effects. After two courses of BV combination chemotherapy, interim PET-CT showed no abnormal accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose in the whole body including systemic large joints. She received four courses of BV combination chemotherapy; as a result, she achieved and maintained complete metabolic response (CMR) as shown by PET-CT . She has been alive in CMR with no flare-up of RA without any medical treatment over 1 year.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Here, we report a rare case of hepatic Hodgkin lymphoma following OII-LPD in a patient with RA. The standardized incidence ratio of LPDs is increased in RA patients treated with methotrexate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. MTX-LPDs are complications of methotrexate treatment in patients with RA. The most frequent histological subtype of MTX-LPDs is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma followed by CHL. Momose et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> reported that CHL-type OII-LPDs (CHL-LPDs) account for about 13% of OII-LPDs, among which many showed involvement of lymph nodes or a combination of lymph nodes and other organs, such as the liver and lung. However, to the best of our knowledge, only one case of OII-LPD that involved solely the liver has been reported. Tsukazaki et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> reported the case of an 88-year-old female with RA who developed hepatosplenic Hodgkin lymphoma. She had been taking methotrexate and infliximab for 6 years, and she developed lymph node enlargement and hepatosplenomegaly. Hodgkin lymphoma was diagnosed on the basis of the finding of cervical lymph node biopsy. Spontaneous regression occurred after the withdrawal of methotrexate and infliximab, but after 1 year, her Hodgkin lymphoma relapsed presenting as hepatosplenomegaly without lymphadenopathy. She was treated with four cycles of ABVD chemotherapy and achieved a complete response. In our patient, multiple hepatosplenic mass and lymph nodes enlargement were found on CT scans when she was under methotrexate treatment; and about 3 years later, a solitary haptic mass without lymphadenopathy was found on PET-CT scans when she was under the treatment of biologics such as etanercept and abatacept. She was treated with BV combination chemotherapy and achieved CMR, as shown by PET-CT. This is the second case of a patient with RA with a hepatic presentation of classic Hodgkin lymphoma recurring following OII-LPD.\n\n【9】Patients with primary hepatic lymphoma (PHL) presented with hepatic failure or encephalopathy. Imaging methods such as CT showed hepatomegaly without any mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. This indicated a diffuse infiltration pattern, as in the case reported by Tsukazaki et al. Almost all cases with the diffuse infiltration pattern of PHL showed secondary hepatic involvement in an advanced stage of CHL. Otherwise, patients with PHL presented with no obvious constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and general malaise. Imaging methods showed a solitary mass or multiple masses in the liver without lymphadenopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This indicated the nodular infiltration pattern, as in our case. In the case of primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the liver, Emile et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> showed that the diffuse infiltration pattern indicated a worse prognosis than the nodular infiltration pattern. However, in the case of CHL, there has been no report about whether the diffuse infiltration pattern has a worse prognosis than the nodular infiltration pattern. More cases should be collected to clarify this point.\n\n【10】Patients with RA frequently have pulmonary complications including interstitial pneumonia and are treated with immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or tacrolimus, prednisolone, and biologics. These drugs lead to immunosuppression and complications, especially infectious pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. On the other hand, bleomycin leads to pulmonary fibrosis and fatal pulmonary complications in patients with CHL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Thus, extra care should be taken for patients with RA and CHL for pulmonary complications under treatment with ABVD chemotherapy. Although ABVD chemotherapy is the standard treatment for CHL, Abramson et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u> reported that BV combination chemotherapy without consolidation radiotherapy is effective for nonbulky limited-stage CHL in a multicenter phase 2 study. Thirty-four patients were enrolled, and those who received four cycles of BV combination chemotherapy achieved a high complete response rate. Ichikawa et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u> reported that three patients with methotrexate-associated advanced-stage CHL received six courses of BV combination chemotherapy and achieved CMR without pulmonary toxicity. Our patient received four courses of BV combination chemotherapy and achieved CMR as shown by PET-CT. Thus, this is the first case in which BV combination chemotherapy was effective for limited-stage hepatic CHL-LPD in a patient with RA. Recently, Vachhani et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> and Nakazato et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u> have reported that BV may represent a novel targeted therapy for RA. This point may support the choice of BV combination chemotherapy instead of ABVD chemotherapy for CHL-LPDs in patients with RA.\n\n【11】In conclusion, we report a case of hepatic Hodgkin lymphoma presenting as a solitary hepatic mass following OII-LPD in a patient with RA. Our patient achieved CMR after four courses of BV combination chemotherapy. Our case suggested that the recurrence lesions of LPDs may present at unexpected site, which is not coincide with the primary site. BV combination chemotherapy is a promising regimen for CHL-LPDs in patients with RA owing to its anti-lymphoma effect on CHL-LPDs and a possible targeted therapy for RA.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank for the medical staff at the Nishi-Kobe Medical Center who were involved in the care of this patient.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors have no financial disclosure to declare.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We verbally obtained the informed consent from the patient for the publication of this case report and accompanying images.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>YT designed the study, collected the data and wrote the paper; SA provided all the pathological pictures; AH and IS treated this patient; IS supervised this study.

RTS is a rare disorder characterized by high arched palate, broad thumbs, prominent forehead, high-arched eyebrows, antimongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures, beaked nose with flat bridge, abnormal ears, and mental retardation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-3 \\]</u>. It may be inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder or arise as a spontaneous mutation. Other associated phenotypic features include microcrania, short stature, ocular defects, deviated nasal septum, incompletely descended testes, finger and toe abnormalities, hyperextensible joints, and hyperactive patellar reflexes. Patients frequently have associated respiratory and feeding difficulties as well as associated congenital heart disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The prevalence of RTS is not precisely known, but the incidence is estimated to be approximately 1 in 300,000 in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Discovered 30 years after the initial clinical reports, RTS results from submicroscopic 16p13.3 deletion of the response element-binding protein (CREBBP) gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The CREBBP gene controls production of a protein that regulates the activity of several other genes and therefore plays an important role in regulating cell growth and division which is essential for normal fetal development. We present a 5-year-old boy with RTS that required anesthetic care for an adenotonsillectomy. Previous reports of perioperative care of patients with RTS are reviewed and options for anesthetic care are presented.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Institutional Review Board approval is not required at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH) for the presentation of single case reports. The patient was a 5-year-old, 18.8 kg boy who presented for adenotonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing. His past medical history was significant for RTS diagnosed at 5 years of age, sepsis, plagiocephaly, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, atrial septal defect (ASD), history of tachycardia during the newborn, anemia, unilateral inguinal hernia, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization, and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). His past surgical history included a flexible esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with direct placement of a percutaneous G-tube, upper GI endoscopy, G-J tube removal, circumcision, exploration of undescended testicle, tympanostomy tube placement, and previous adenoidectomy. Associated co-morbid conditions included attention-deficit disorder, scoliosis, lack of normal physiological development, developmental speech or language delay, sleep-disordered breathing, and allergic rhinitis. Current home medications included dextroamphetamine-amphetamine extended release (10 mg by mouth once daily in the morning), polyethylene glycol (8.5 g by mouth once daily, adjusted to give 1 - 2 soft stools daily), daily iron supplement, ibuprofen (150 mg oral suspension by mouth once daily), loratadine (5 mg by mouth once daily), and a multivitamin (1 tab by mouth once daily). Allergies included only seasonal problems. Preoperative physical examination revealed a child in no acute distress with moderate scoliosis, dysmorphic facies, broad toes, and tonsillar hypertrophy. Airway examination revealed a Mallampati grade II view. Perioperative laboratory evaluations including electrolytes, urinalysis, coagulation function, glucose, and hepatic function were normal. The last hemoglobin was 13.4 g/dL. He had a sip of water with his morning medications, but otherwise was nil per os for 6 h. The preoperative room air oxygen saturation was 100%. The patient was transported to the operating room and routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were applied. Anesthesia was induced with the inhalation of sevoflurane in a mixture of nitrous oxide. A 22-gauge peripheral intravenous cannula was placed following anesthetic induction. Bag-valve-mask ventilation was provided without difficulty. Propofol (2 mg/kg) and morphine (0.05 mg/kg) were administered intravenously. Direct laryngoscopy was performed with a Miller 2 blade, which revealed a Cormack-Lehane grade I view. A 4.0 mm cuffed endotracheal tube was placed on the first attempt and a small amount of air added to the cuff to seal the airway at 20 - 25 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O. The patient was positioned supine with a shoulder roll in place and arms tucked to the side. No intraoperative antibiotics were given. The heart rate varied from 130 to 170 beats per minute with a normal sinus rhythm. No bradycardia or arrhythmias were noted. Intraoperative fluids included 250 mL of lactated Ringers solution. Dexamethasone (4 mg) and ondansetron (2 mg) were administered intravenously to provide postoperative inflammation and nausea relief, respectively. Following completion of the surgical procedure, the patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for observation of hemodynamic and respiratory function. Per our usual routine, his trachea was extubated in the PACU when he was awake. Postoperative pain control was provided with hydrocodone-acetaminophen every 6 h as needed. He was admitted to the inpatient ward for 8 h of postoperative observation. The remainder of his postoperative course was uncomplicated and he was discharged home the same day.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】As with the anesthetic care of all patients, the focus of effective perioperative care of patients with RTS begins with the preoperative examination and the identification of end-organ involvement by the primary disease process. Of primary concern to anesthesia providers are problems with airway management which have been previously noted in several anecdotal case reports from the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6-8 \\]</u>. Difficulties with direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation are primarily related to specific craniofacial anatomical features including high-arched palate, hypoplasia of the mandible (micrognathia), and limited mouth opening. Although we were able to successfully accomplish endotracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopy without significant difficulties, the ability to accomplish adequate bag-valve-mask ventilation should be demonstrated prior to the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Additionally, the appropriate equipment for dealing with the difficult airway should be readily available including indirect laryngoscopy tools 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Anecdotal success has been reported with the use of a laryngeal mask airway for elective airway management or as a conduit for endotracheal intubation following failed routine airway management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 11 \\]</u>. The risk-benefit of such a practice must be weighed given high incidence of gastroesophageal reflux in RTS patients. In our patient, inhalational induction with sevoflurane was performed as the most humane way to achieve intravenous access followed by endotracheal intubation with a cuffed endotracheal tube.\n\n【6】Perioperative respiratory and ventilation issues may be further complicated by congenital tracheal stenosis, abnormal pulmonary lobulation, excessive mucous secretion, and gastroesophageal reflux 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>. The potential co-morbid condition of the respiratory system is illustrated by the fact that respiratory infections and congenital heart disease are the leading causes of death during the first year of life. Copious secretions have been noted by other authors which may make inhalation induction problematic or complicate the immediate postoperative period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The perioperative respiratory problems may be further magnified in patients with preoperative symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing as were noted in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>. Whenever feasible, short-acting anesthetic agents are preferable to limit their effect on postoperative respiratory function. The use of regional has been suggested as a means of limiting perioperative opioid needs thereby limiting their effects on respiratory function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Considering the potential co-morbid involvement of the airway and respiratory system, postoperative monitoring is suggested with continuous pulse oximetry or in an ICU setting for more complex surgical procedures.\n\n【7】Associated congenital heart disease occurs in up to 25-30% of patients with RTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. Reported defects have included atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of the aorta, pulmonic stenosis, bicuspid aortic valve, pseudotruncus, aortic stenosis, vascular rings, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. In addition to structural cardiac defects, conduction disturbances have been occasionally reported, many in association with the administration of perioperative medications including succinylcholine or atropine and neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular blockade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>. Stirt reported short runs of supraventricular tachycardia and multifocal premature ventricular and atrial contractions for 5 min following the administration of succinylcholine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. No hemodynamic changes were noted, no treatment was required, and the case proceeded uneventful. Similar problems were noted in the same patient during a prior anesthetic with the administration of atropine and neostigmine. Given the potential for such involvement, preoperative echocardiography and electrocardiography should be obtained based on the clinical examination and history.\n\n【8】Although anecdotal, the use of succinylcholine should generally be avoided. When neuromuscular is required, non-depolarizing agents are suggested. Given the potential pro-arrhythmogenic effects of medications with vagolytic effects, there may be a theoretical advantage to the use of cis-atracurium over rocuronium for non-emergent airway management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Alternatively, endotracheal intubation can be accomplished without neuromuscular blockade as noted in our patient with the combination of sevoflurane and propofol. For intravenous induction, others have reported acceptable conditions for endotracheal intubation using a combination of propofol and remifentanil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 23 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】In summary, we present concerns regarding the anesthetic management of a patient with RTS. Of primary concern are anecdotal reports regarding anatomical features of the syndrome which may make direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation problematic. Associated respiratory disabilities may lead not only to intraoperative, but also postoperative respiratory insufficiency. Potential co-morbid involvement of the cardiac system includes congenital heart disease and the potential for conduction disturbances.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 09:56:30", "endTime": "2024/09/19 09:57:11", "cost": 41.693}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:58", "update_time": "2024-09-18 17:57:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 17:56:28"}

It is one of the main reasons of presentation in the emergency department and one of the most common causes of hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Dyspnea is also a complaint of nearly 4% of patients seeking treatment in the ambulatory care setting, and population samples have determined the prevalence of dyspnea to be between 17% and 38% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Platypnea orthodeoxia syndrome (POS) is traditionally defined as dyspnea or hypoxemia observed when changing from a recumbent to an upright or seated position 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Although there are several potential causes for this phenomenon, POS is classically described as resulting from right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale (PFO) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. The precise mechanism of shunting through a PFO despite normal intracardiac pressures, however, remains obscure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 70-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for further investigation of deteriorating shortness of breath. Her symptoms were present for the last 3 months and were felt to have slowly worsened over time.\n\n【4】The patient had been diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in 2010. Right heart catheterization at that time revealed an elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure of 47 mm Hg and a normal wedge pressure (PAWP or PC) of 12 mm Hg. Cardiac index was reduced (1.77 L/min/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and pulmonary vascular resistance was significantly elevated (12 Wood Units). A rheumatic arthritis with symmetric involvement of multiple joints and positive CCP-antibodies was also known since 2009. For treatment of her arthritis, the patient received methotrexat once a week. As no other etiology for PAH was found, the patient’s disease was classified as Dana Point group 1. She was referred to our PAH clinic for specific therapy. Sildenafil was not tolerated and bosentan led to a drastic elevation of GOT and GPT. Ambrisentan, on the other hand, was well tolerated, improved 6-min walking distance by 35 m (from 180 to 215 m) and decreased NT-proBNP plasma levels. Ambrisentan monotherapy was continued through the years 2010 to 2013 as the patient’s general condition stabilized and dyspnea was reduced.\n\n【5】As a result of the PAH, the right ventricle was dilated and the right ventricular systolic function declined. With 17 mm, TAPSE was within the normal range. Regarding echocardiographic parameters, left ventricular systolic and diastolic function showed no abnormalities.\n\n【6】At presentation, the patient revealed no alarming clinical signs: RR 100/60 mm Hg, temperature 36.8 °C, and blood glucose 106 mg/dL. On blood gas analysis, pO <sub>2 </sub> was found to be 59 mm Hg, pCO <sub>2 </sub> 43 mm Hg, BE +6 mmol/L, pH 7.45, and SO <sub>2 </sub> 90%. Blood chemistry provided the following parameters: troponin 15.6 pg/mL, NT-proBNP 126 pg/mL, hemoglobin 11.3 g/dL, creatinine 0.5 mg/dL, potassium 3.5 mmol/L, sodium 140 mmol/L, and CRP < 0.5 mg/dL. The electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm (95 beats per minute) with a known right axis and peaked P waves as a result of the pulmonary hypertension . The chest X-ray had no signs of pulmonary congestion, pleural effusion or pneumonia .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (a) and chest X-ray (b) of the patient. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【8】The patient described increasing shortness of breath while standing with an improvement when changing to a recumbent position. To substantiate this perception, continuous measurements of heart rate and oxygen saturation in lying, sitting and standing positions were obtained. Results are summarized in Table 1 .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Changes in Oxygen Saturation (SO 2 ) and in Heart Rate (HF) in Relation to the Position of the Patient |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【10】For further investigation, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed, combined with continuous registration of heart rate and oxygen saturation. Agitated saline contrast was used to search for intracardiac shunts . As a significant right-to-left shunt would increase left atrial pressure and reduce pulmonary venous flow, the latter was also evaluated by Doppler echocardiography. The goal was to elucidate the potential role of the previously diagnosed PFO in the pathophysiology of the clinical symptoms.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. Presentation of the PFO without evidence of obstruction to the flow in the pulmonary veins. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【12】In lying position, there was no relevant transition of NaCl bubbles from the right to the left atrium. Accordingly, the flow in the pulmonary veins was not compromised. This was in line with the fact that oxygen saturation reached 89% in lying position, compatible with the patient’s pulmonary hypertension and not suspicious of any right-to-left shunt. When moving the patient to an upright position with the TEE probe in place, the oxygen saturation dropped to 81%. Agitated saline contrast was applied once again, but failed to provide any evidence of intracardiac shunting. Furthermore, pulmonary venous flow was unchanged under these conditions as well. Contrary to our expectations, the PFO did not seem to account for the POS. Thus, the diagnostic workup was extended. Pulmonary function testing revealed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Subsequently, inhalative anti-inflammatory/anti-obstructive treatment and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy was initiated. Within 2 weeks, the patient’s symptoms resolved.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】POS is an uncommon condition characterized by dyspnea and arterial desaturation upon assuming an upright position 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. The syndrome was originally described in patients with pulmonary disease without intracardiac shunts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Current knowledge relates POS to intracardiac shunting, intrapulmonary shunting, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, or a combination of these 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】In the case of anatomical interatrial discontinuities (e.g. PFO, atrial septal defects), a functional component modified by positional changes is required as well. Functional components include conditions that increase right atrial pressure, stretch the interatrial septum and/or redirect blood flow through the interatrial communication.\n\n【17】Anatomical as well as functional conditions may lead to intrapulmonary shunting. Arteriovenous anastomoses, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations and grossly distended pulmonary capillaries are potential causes of anatomical shunts. Functional shunts are due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch, that is, hypoventilation of normally perfused segments or hyperperfusion of normally ventilated segments. In either case, insufficiently oxygenated blood mixes with oxygenated blood, thereby resulting in overall desaturation. The mechanisms affecting the degree of intrapulmonary shunting and their relation to positional changes are not fully understood. Clearly, in the upright position, pulmonary perfusion shifts from the apical to the basal parts of the lungs. Right ventricular preload is reduced, and pulmonary artery pressure drops. The effect on pulmonary venous pressure is less predictable, considering the plethora of modifying factors, such as left ventricular function and compliance, left ventricular pre- and afterload, heart rate valvular function. Irrespective of other potential mechanisms, the apico-basal shift of pulmonary perfusion upon standing aggravates the functional significance of any basally located pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. More pronounced anatomical or functional intrapulmonary shunting in the lower parts combined with a reduced potential for compensation in the upper parts of the lungs will then result in significant deoxygenation. In line with these considerations, our patient also revealed a basal predominance with respect to his COPD.\n\n【18】The diagnosis of POS is based on the following criteria: 1) platypnea, 2) orthodeoxia (SpO <sub>2 </sub> < 90%), 3) existence of an interatrial or intrapulmonal communication, and 4) right-to-left shunt. Our patient presented with typical symptoms, and the previously diagnosed PFO seemed to provide the pathophysiologic basis. However, contrary to expectations, we were unable to demonstrate a hemodynamically significant right-to-left shunt across this interatrial discontinuity. As described by Desouza et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, tilt TEE with agitated saline contrast solution is the most effective diagnostic tool for this purpose. In rare cases, a shunt is only seen with Valsalva maneuver, which could not be performed in our patient because of his apparent shortness of breath. However, if this shortness of breath would have been related to an interatrial right-to-left shunt, it would have had to be present under just these conditions. In the absence of an intracardiac shunt, contrast-enhanced echocardiography, perfusion scan (scintigraphy) with macroaggregated albumin or pulmonary arteriography might be used to detect intrapulmonary shunting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Based on the favorable clinical course, we refrained from respective diagnostic procedures in our patient.\n\n【19】If POS is definitely related to intracardiac shunting, closure of the interatrial communication represents definitive treatment. In 2001, Rao and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u> reported on percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects and PFOs in platypnea orthodeoxia patients via femoral approach. A jugular approach is feasible as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Transcatheter closure immediately improves oxygen saturation in upright position. Platypnea resolves completely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16-18 \\]</u>. Symptomatic improvement is seen in > 95% of patients. In light of this effective treatment option, it is tempting to proceed with respective interventions once an interatrial communication has been detected. However, this case clearly demonstrates that a PFO might be an “innocent bystander”, where closure would not affect the underlying pathophysiology. Instead, particularly in patients with pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure, an intervention could even be detrimental by preventing preload reduction through right-to-left shunting.\n\n【20】In patients with intrapulmonary shunting, the underlying pulmonary disease must be treated to reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Closure of small airways or microatelectasis have been suggested as potential causes of ventilation-perfusion mismatch in platypnea orthodeoxia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>, possibly reversible with CPAP ventilation. Both, mechanical ventilation and application of end-expiratory positive airway pressure (PEEP) tend to increase right-to-left shunting with worsening of hypoxemia. Our patient experienced a gradual improvement in oxygenation while on mechanical ventilation with PEEP application and also during non-invasive bi-level ventilation.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】Awareness and careful clinical evaluation are clues to the diagnosis of POS. Although an interatrial communication is frequently involved in the underlying pathophysiology, it might also coexist without any causal relationship. Thus, a functional analysis of all potential components is required before deciding on a specific therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:17:29", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:18:03", "cost": 33.507}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:58", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:18:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:17:29"}

The condition typically presents with severe headaches, often described as a “thunderclap” like, and can be associated with altered mental status and focal neurological deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In some patients, however, these typical clinical manifestations may not be present, and the condition may present more subtly, leading to delays in diagnosis and timely institution of appropriate treatment, the clinical consequences of which can be devastating 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】SAH can sometimes present with symptoms seen with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), such as upper back, shoulder, or neck pains, and although atypical, these symptoms can often be confused for ACS because of the commonly associated electrocardiographic (ECG) changes and elevation in cardiac troponins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]</u>. Herein we present a patient who presented to the emergency department (ED) with upper back and neck pain, diagnosed initially as non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) but was eventually found to have occipital SAH after extensive inpatient workup.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】The patient is a 68-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension and migraine headaches who presented to the ED with neck, left shoulder, and upper back pain for 1 day. The pain started while the patient was resting at home. The pain improved partially with paracetamol tablets. Later in the day, the patient stated she tried to pick up an item from the ground when her severe neck/back pain returned and has since persisted. Her neck pain was not associated with chest pain, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, or limb weakness. She has not reported any recent falls or trauma. The patient initially presented to an urgent care center where ECG demonstrated ST segment depression, and the patient was advised to go to the ED for further evaluation. The patient noticed an improvement in neck pain upon arrival at the ED. However, the pain was somehow worse with movement; she did not report headaches, focal weakness, paresthesia, or bowel or urinary symptoms.\n\n【6】Diagnosis\n\n【7】Given the patient’s clinical presentation and ECG findings, ACS was suspected. ECG in the ED showed ST depression in leads V3-V6 , and high-sensitivity troponin level was significantly elevated to > 4,800 (0 - 20 pg/mL). The patient was started on antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation with heparin. Repeat ECG on the next day showed improvement of the ST deviation noticed on the first day . Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular wall thickness and normal ejection fraction of 60-65% without any regional wall motion abnormalities or other significant structural abnormalities. Cardiology was consulted, and the patient underwent urgent coronary catheterization on the second day of hospitalization; however, coronary angiography  did not reveal any significant coronary artery disease. Given the level of troponin rise, persistent upper back pain, and negative coronary angiography, a workup for aortic dissection was done with computed tomography (CT) angiography , which was again negative. Additionally, CT pulmonary angiography  was negative for pulmonary embolism. On the third day of hospitalization, the patient reported headaches and photophobia. The headaches were initially attributed to migraines which the patient stated typically worsen with stress. However, her headaches worsened, and she reported worsening neck pain and nausea. Her physical examination remained unremarkable throughout this period without any focal neurological deficits or alteration in her mental status. A head CT  was obtained at this point, revealing left occipital SAH with mild cerebral edema and minimal midline shift.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

However, no neurosurgical intervention was recommended. The patient’s neurological status was observed in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 72 h. She remained neurologically intact, but her hospitalization was complicated by moderate hyponatremia due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) in the context of her intracranial hemorrhage. The patient’s hyponatremia resolved with fluid restriction.\n\n【13】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【14】After a week of hospitalization, the patient was discharged home in good condition without neurological deficits. A repeat head CT scan  showed a resolving SAH before discharge. At the follow-up in the neurosurgery clinic 3 weeks later, the patient had no neurological deficits, and the follow-up CT scan  showed a healing SAH with a suspicion of an underlying vascular malformation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain  confirmed a diagnosis of cavernous malformation.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Twenty percent of strokes in adults are due to intracranial hemorrhage, with SAH and intracerebral hemorrhage, each accounting for 10%. Most patients with spontaneous SAH have an underlying intracranial saccular aneurysm. However, about 20% of SAH cases are not due to a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. These are caused by arteriovenous malformations/fistulae, intracranial arterial dissection, amyloid angiopathies, vasculitides, bleeding disorders, and illicit drug use. Among these non-aneurysmal etiologies are cavernous malformations (CMs). CMs are very rare, with an incidence of 0.15 to 0.56 per 100,000 in various populations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The incidence is equal in males and females, with a mean age of 30 to 40. However, females are more likely to present with intracranial hemorrhage and neurological deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\- 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The typical clinical presentation of SAH is severe headache, which is sufficiently characteristic that an immediate non-contrast head CT scan should be performed as part of the evaluation of such patients, even those who are alert and neurologically intact at the time of initial presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. In addition to headache, other common symptoms of SAH include transient loss of consciousness, neck pain or stiffness, and vomiting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In one case series, these were present in 9%, 75%, and 61% of patients, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Meningismus, often accompanied by lower back pain, may develop several hours after the bleed due to aseptic meningitis caused by the breakdown of blood cells within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Head CT scan without contrast is the initial diagnostic test of choice for SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. A lumbar puncture should be performed if the head CT is negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Cardiovascular effects of intracranial hemorrhage are well known and may have some prognostic significance, but they can also present diagnostic challenges in a minority of patients with intracranial hemorrhage. Cardiovascular effects of intracranial hemorrhage were first described in 1903 by Cushing, who noted elevations in blood pressure and cardiac rhythm abnormalities in such patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. In 1947, Byer et al described ECG changes in a patient with SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. ECG changes are expected in almost all patients with SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, and up to 10% are noted to have a potentially lethal arrhythmia, such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, which may account for some of the mortality in patients with SAH. In addition to ECG changes, cardiac troponin I (cTnI) elevations have also been described in case series of patients with SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. In these reports, cTnI elevations correlated with the severity of the neurological injury and cardiovascular complications, including pulmonary edema, LV dysfunction, and hypotension requiring vasopressors. In addition, some metanalyses correlated elevated cardiac troponins with the severity of the stroke, poor neurological outcome, longer ICU stays, and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>. One meta-analysis showed that peak cTnI levels were independent predictors of death or severe disability at discharge. However, this association was insignificant at follow-up in 3 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. These findings suggest that cTnI should be measured in all patients with SAH, especially those with ECG or clinical signs of potential cardiovascular dysfunction, and support the concept that cardiovascular dysfunction in these patients may contribute directly to poor outcomes. Although ECG changes are seen in almost all patients with SAH, and cardiac troponin elevations correlate with the severity of SAH as mentioned above, our patient has a significant elevation of troponins out of proportion to the mild SAH.\n\n【19】Although the above-mentioned cardiovascular effects carry important prognostic significance, they may also present diagnostic challenges in some patients with SAH. Several case reports suggested that some SAH patients can be misdiagnosed with ACS upon initial presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\- 23 \\]</u>. Such patients are more likely to present with clinical features that were not specific enough to suggest SAH as a potential diagnosis and have features suggestive of cardiac origin for their symptoms, including ECG changes, high cardiac troponins, and regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram. Our patient was initially misdiagnosed with NSTEMI in the context of her atypical presentation with neck, shoulder, and upper back pain with ECG changes and significantly elevated cardiac troponins, and the absence of headache at the initial presentation. It was not until the patient developed headaches associated with nausea and vomiting on the third hospital day that a head CT scan was performed, which confirmed SAH. Fortunately, her recovery was uneventful, and she was discharged home without neurological deficits.\n\n【20】Misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis of SAH are common and can result in delays in starting appropriate treatment and worse clinical outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The most common cause of misdiagnosis is the misconception that patients with SAH should always appear sick, have altered mental status, or have focal neurological deficits when in fact, about 40% of patients lack these clinical features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. This misconception is a common reason not to perform CT scans on such patients. A systematic review conducted in 2017 identified three studies published from 1996 to 2007 in ED populations with a pooled misdiagnosis rate of 7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. In that systematic review, initial misdiagnosis was independently associated with small SAH volume, normal mental status at presentation, and right-sided aneurysm location in patients with aneurysmal SAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Failure to order a head CT scan at the initial clinical encounter was the most common error, accounting for 73% of the misdiagnoses. Patients with intact mental status at initial presentation (45%) had the highest misdiagnosis rate, which was associated with a fourfold increase in mortality risk at 12 months and increased morbidity among survivors.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】SAH is a common emergency with high mortality and morbidity. Misdiagnosis and delayed SAH diagnosis are common and associated with poor clinical outcomes. The typical clinical features of SAH include severe headaches, often described as thunderclap-like, altered mental status, and often focal neurological deficits. However, some cases can present subtly or present atypically with symptoms suggestive of other alternative diagnoses such as ACS. These atypical presentations often lead to delay in diagnosis or misdiagnosis and can have profound clinical consequences, especially if anticoagulation and antiplatelets were used for an incorrectly diagnosed ACS.\n\n【23】Learning points\n\n【24】The most common cause of misdiagnosis of SAH is the misconception that patients with SAH should always appear sick, have altered mental status, or have focal neurological deficits. Cardiac effects of SAH, including ECG changes, elevated cardiac troponins, and regional wall motion abnormalities, are common. These cardiac effects have prognostic significance and can be a source of diagnostic confusion in patients with SAH who do not present with the typical severe thunderclap-type headaches. Initiation of antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation in such circumstances can have serious consequences. Clinicians should be aware of the misconceptions surrounding the clinical presentation of SAH and know about the cardiac effects of intracranial hemorrhage to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis in patients who do not have the typical clinical manifestations of SAH.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank the Department of Radiology for providing the images.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received for this case report.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no conflict of interest in this case report from all authors.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient provided consent for publication.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MAN and AK Contributed to conceptualizing and writing the first manuscript.

With a personal history of resecting colon adenocarcinoma in February 2007, we strongly demanded to do通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18 </sup></u> F-FDG-PET/CT examination and rule out metastasis. Evaluation revealed hypermetabolism in the left lung, suprarenal gland, multiple bone (occipita, right scapula, side of right atlas, C3, left side of C5, spinous process of C7, T6, T10 and T11, L3 spinous process, side of the left 2nd rib, side of the right 5th rib, right iliac body and the upper of right femur). Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a soft tissue mass measuring 2.6 × 2.7 cm in the left below lung . To define a clear diagnosis and choose a therapeutic strategy, we suggested pathologic examination by transbronchial biopsy from the left lung mass and radiotherapy as a treatment to relieve bone pain caused by cancer that has spread into the bone. She confused for transbronchial biopsy, surgery and chemotherapy due to serious side effects. The therapy with gefitinib was chosen because of favorable predictive factors such as Asian, female gender and nonsmoking status. At this point, written informed consent was obtained from the patient, and treatment with gefitinib was initiated as the 1st-line treatment. The patient was treated with oral gefitinib at 150 mg/day. At the same time, complementary radiotherapy, delivered to the left lung soft tissue mass region, was initiated to a dose of 36Gy in 12 fractions over 2.5 weeks. Complementary radiotherapy, delivered to occipita, side of right atlas, C3, left side of C5, T10 and the upper of right femur, was initiated to a dose of 36Gy in 12 fractions over 2.5 weeks. Radiotherapy relieved bone pain completely. After 3 months of treatment, the patient showed a good clinical response. Hypermetabolism shadowing in the all last bone metastatic regions (including hypermetabolism regions received no radiotherapy) were not detected on PET/CT. But new hypermetabolism regions (sternum, T10, T11, L3 and the upper of both of femur) were detected . We thought gefitinib was effective. Treatment with gefitinib was continuing in the outpatient clinic. After 6 months of treatment with gefitinib, she had been without evidence of disease progression . After 16 months of treatment with gefitinib, C7, T12 and right side of the 7th rib hypermetabolism regions were detected. IMRT, delivered to C7, T12 and right side of the 7th rib metastatic regions, was initiated to a dose of 30Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week. After 30 months of treatment with gefitinib, the left chest wall pain. Occipita, C7, T10, T11, right side of the 4th, 8th rib and left side of 2nd rib and left ilium hypermetabolism regions were detected on PET/CT . There were evidences of disease progression. Then, 3DCRT delivered to the left chest wall region, was initiated to a dose of 15Gy/5F +15Gy/3F over 1.5 weeks. We suggested treatment with erlotinib, 150 mg/day administered orally, was then initiated starting in July 2011. The latest whole PET/CT showed no evidence of disease progression . The patient was alive now.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

EGFR is highly expressed on NSCLC cell surfaces. Therefore, it is considered a valuable therapeutic target. The pathways including ras-raf-1-MAPK and PI3K-Akt are involved in downstream EGFR signaling. Activation of these pathways results in a mitogenic signaling cascade responsible for a number of processes crucial to tumor progression, including proliferation, decreased apoptosis, angiogenesis, and invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. EGFR-TKIs are new anticancer agents that act by inhibiting EGFR signaling transduction pathways, thus decreasing tumor growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Two classes of EGFR mutations, in-frame deletion in exon 19 and missense mutation L858R in exon 21, are the most frequent mutations, representing > 85% of EGFR mutations reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 \\]</u>. These EGFR mutations have been associated with response to EGFR-TKI in some studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. The rate of exon-19 mutations, female gender, and nonsmoking status were identified as additional predictors of outcome at meta-regression analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Anti-EGFR therapy is largely ineffective in NSCLC with activating KRAS mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The EGFR mutation is rare in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. Gefitinib may not be effective in treating SCLC patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】Radiotherapy is often used to control pain. Radiotherapy for cancer that has spread to bones can also help to prevent new painful areas developing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Having this treatment may slow down the cancer and give patients a better quality of life for a longer time.\n\n【8】Here, we report the case of a woman with diffuse bone metastases from lung cancer. Although there was no pathologic examination, the efficacy NSCLC therapy confirmed pathologic lung cancer. She experienced total regression of the metastases under gefitinib treatment for 30 months. The rate of exon-19 or exon-21 mutations, Asian female gender, adenocarcinoma, and nonsmoking status were identified as predictors of outcome after the treatment of EGFR-TKI at meta-regression analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 12 \\]</u>. The patient showed a good clinical response with EGFR-TKI because of favorable predictive factors such as Asian female gender and nonsmoking status. There should be other favorable factors such as adenocarcinoma and EGFR mutations. Treatment of EGFR-TKI should be the first choice in the previously untreated NSCLC patients with activated EGFR mutation. Gefitinib could be used as a single agent in select subsets of patients with advanced NSCLC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The patient's condition was exacerbated during gefitinib treatment but treatment with another EGFR-TKI, erlotinib, may be effective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 14 , 15 \\]</u>. Moreover, addition of standard-dose gefitinib to radiotherapy was feasible and without evidence of increased toxicities.\n\n【9】Targeted molecules are valuable weapons in the management of certain cancers. Gefitinib provided clinically significant antitumor activity, clinically significant improvements in disease-related symptoms, and improvements in quality of life. To our knowledge, this is the longest-term survive case report of NSCLC associated with the EGFR-TKI gefitinib. No evidence severe adverse events have been observed. Before patients can be offered first-line treatment with gefitinib, deletion of exon 19 or exon 21 mutation of EGFR gene should be detected in carcinoma cells. These results suggest that there is the superiority of first-line gefitinib therapy in a clinically selected population consisting of Asian female patients with adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutation, and no smoking history.\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study was supported by grants from Science and Technology Commission projects of Guangdong Province (2010B031600245) and Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province 通用删除7(英):<u>(8451051501001344)</u>.</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 09:52:02", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:01:50", "cost": 587.564}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:58", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:01:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 17:51:53"}

Anomalies of the pancreas could involve the pancreatic ductal (major pancreatic duct: Wirsung duct, and minor pancreatic duct: Santorini duct) as well as the extra-ductal system. These anomalies are very uncommon, and its precise incidence rate is yet to be known. Usually, patients with congenital anomalies of the pancreas are asymptomatic, hence the most common presentation is an incidental radiological finding during adulthood period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. On the contrary, sometimes, these anomalies can cause recurrent episodes of upper abdominal pain and acute pancreatitis. Therefore, these anomalies should be included in the differential diagnosis as a cause of adult patients with recurrent episodes of idiopathic acute pancreatitis. To a lesser extent, it can present as an unexplained minor gastrointestinal symptom such as recurrent mild upper abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Due to the high number of radiological imaging tests that had been used during the last two decades, the incidence rate of pancreas anomalies has increased exponentially. This in turn makes physicians, especially radiologists, to become more familiar with such anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The used imaging tests nowadays are highly sensitive for the recognition of these anomalies and include mainly abdomino-pelvic high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) of the abdomen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Although being regarded as a good diagnostic and therapeutic tool for bile and pancreatic ducts diseases, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an invasive procedure which carries a complications risk such as post-ERCP pancreatitis (the most common complication), cholangitis, bleeding, and perforation, with the latter being the least common. Thus, its use for the diagnosis of pancreatic duct anomalies is far less common than the previously mentioned tests.\n\n【3】Pancreatic ductal anatomy can be subjected to multiple variations in course and in configuration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In addition, duplication anomalies, mainly of the main pancreatic duct, as well as cystic dilation of the terminal portion of the Wirsung and Santorini ducts are well known. Combination anomalies of the aforementioned variations are even rarer and up to date are regarded as unknown and never reported.\n\n【4】Herein, a case of 47-year-old male patient, suffered from recurrent episodes of upper abdominal pain due to severe idiopathic pancreatitis is presented. Radiological exams including abdominopelvic CT scan and MRCP revealed an unknown combination anomaly of the pancreatic ducts, with dominant duct of Santorini without divisum and proximal cystic dilation of the Santorini duct. These findings were never reported in the English literature and newly introduced anomaly as “Kluri” anomaly after the names of the authors Kluger and Khuri.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】Investigations\n\n【7】A 47-year-old healthy male patient, presented to our emergency department complaining of severe upper abdominal pain. The pain lasted for 6 h, started instantly and was described as diffuse and radiating to the back. He also suffered from general weakness, nausea, recurrent vomiting, and reduced appetite. The patient denied fever, rigors, or another symptom. His past medical history included diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2, treated by subcutaneous insulin injections and his surgical history was relevant for status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis at age 40 years.\n\n【8】The patient’s background included a history of two admissions during the last year to different peripheral hospitals, due to severe idiopathic necrotizing pancreatitis. During his admissions, patient suffered from severe pancreatitis with multiorgan failure, which necessitates admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for several weeks of conservative management. Between the two episodes, the patient complained of continuous upper abdominal pain treated by different narcotics. Few months following the second episode, the patient underwent abdominal MRCP which was consistent with pancreas divisum and 17-mm cystic lesion at the pancreatic head. Moreover, an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) showed cystic dilation of the duct at the pancreatic head up to 17 mm, and a suspicion for main duct intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) was raised. Cyst aspiration and cystic fluid analysis for amylase and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was not done for unknown reasons.\n\n【9】Diagnosis\n\n【10】Vital signs, upon his admission were within normal limits: blood pressure (BP) 123/86 mm Hg, pulse (P) 76 beats/min, respiratory rate (RR) 11/min, temperature (T): 36.8 °C. Abdominal examination was consistent for diffuse upper abdominal tenderness without guarding, as well as without palpable masses. Digital rectal examination was normal. A complete blood count showed increased white blood cells of 12,000 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, with 12% band neutrophils. Serum amylase (608 U/L), as well as urine amylase (15,596 U/L) levels were highly elevated. Liver function tests (LFTs), kidney function tests (KFTs) and arterial blood gases (ABGs) were within normal limits. An abdominal ultrasonography (US) showed cystic lesion at the pancreatic head without bile duct dilation or choledocholithiasis. The patient was diagnosed with a recurrent episode of acute pancreatitis and admitted to the General Surgery ward for conservative management by nil per os (NPO), rigorous intravenous (IV) fluids and IV painkillers. Following the initiation of conservative management, the patient felt well and resumed oral intake. Revision of the abdominal MRCP revealed unknown combination anomaly of the pancreatic ducts, with Santorini duct dominance without divisum and cystic dilation of the proximal part of the Santorini duct .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. An abdominal MRCP showing dominant duct of Santorini without divisum (short arrow) and proximal cystic dilation of the proximal part of Santorini duct (long arrow). MRCP: magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【12】A recent (during current admission) abdomino-pelvic CT scan  revealed findings identical to what have been seen by the abdominal MRCP; dilation in the form of cyst at the proximal Santorini duct along with dominant duct of Santorini without divisum. In addition, Atrophy of the pancreatic body and tail were demonstrated. Other known pancreatitis causes were excluded: the patient negated alcohol consumption or recent abdomino-thorax trauma. Serum triglycerides (following overnight fasting) and calcium levels were within normal limits. Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG)4 levels (IgG4-related pancreatitis) were as well within normal levels. As there was no clinical suspicion for an infectious agent (hepatitis A, mumps and others) as a causative agent for acute pancreatitis in our patient, no specific laboratory tests were done. As part of our department protocol, tumor markers, mainly CEA and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) are routine serum tests to be made during the workup program. Serum levels for these tumor markers were within normal limits.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. An abdominopelvic CT scan reveals cystic dilation of the proximal part of Santorini duct (arrow). CT: computed tomography. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【14】Treatment\n\n【15】In light of the aforementioned findings, the patient was presented at a multidisciplinary team meeting (MDTM), including pancreatic surgeons, gastroenterologists and abdominal radiologists. It was decided, that due to the recurrent episodes of severe acute pancreatitis (necessitating admissions to the ICU) in young patient with radiological proven pancreatic duct anomaly and pancreatic body and tail atrophy, surgical resection with total pancreatectomy would be the best approach. Surgical resection in the form of pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) was discussed. Due to the fact that the patient is already known to suffer from DM type 2 treated by insulin injections, and if Whipple procedure to be done, most probably the procedure will be without pancreato-jejunostomy anastomosis due to high risk for postoperative pancreatic fistula (atrophy of the pancreatic texture and non-dilated main pancreatic duct), it was decided to resect the whole pancreas organ.\n\n【16】Six weeks after his discharge, the patient was admitted electively to our surgical ward for operative management. On his admission, the patient denied any complaint and was in stable condition. His physical exam was unremarkable. During the patient’s hospitalization he underwent total pancreatectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction of the gastrointestinal tract by an open approach surgery. His perioperative and postoperative periods were uneventful. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 9, and prescribed Creon (pancreatic enzyme supplements) and subcutaneous insulin injections.\n\n【17】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【18】The patient was followed on our outpatient clinic once per 2 weeks (initially) followed by once/month up to 3 months following discharge. During his follow-up, the patient was doing well with no gastrointestinal or other complaints. The histopathological report was consistent with dilated pancreatic duct at the head, with foci of low-grade Pancreatic Intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). Body and tail of the pancreas showed atrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation. No evidence of malignancy was reported.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Pancreatic duct anomalies are uncommon gastrointestinal congenital diseases, yet a forgotten cause of recurrent idiopathic pancreatitis. Multiple variations of the duct of the pancreas exist and can be at the level of the duct course, duct configuration, duplication anomaly or cystic dilation of the terminal part of the ducts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Combination anomalies of the previously mentioned variations are even rarer.\n\n【21】Although pancreatic duct course can be sigmoidal, vertical or loop, the most common course is the descending one (50%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Pancreas divisum is known as the most common pancreatic duct anomaly. The pathogenesis for pancreas divisum is as follow: during the initial weeks of gestation, mainly at the seventh gestational week, the dorsal pancreatic bud (which contribute to the formation of the body, tail and minor part of the head of the pancreas, as well as Santorini duct) fails to fuse with ventral pancreatic bud (forms the majority of the pancreatic head and uncinate process) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The exact incidence rate is unknown yet reported rates of 3-8% and almost 9% found on ERCP and MRCP tests, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Ductal configuration anomalies are uncommon. The most common form of pancreatic duct configuration is the bifid configuration with Wirsung dominant duct (60%), followed by absent duct of Santorini (30%), ansa pancreatica and dominant duct of Santorini without pancreas divisum (1%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Ansa pancreatica is an extremely rare pancreatic duct anomaly and is characterized by reversed S-shaped of the Santorini duct which usually connects the Wirsung duct by a side branch.\n\n【22】A rare pancreatic duct anomalies can also include cystic dilation of the ultimate parts of the different pancreatic ducts. These anomalies are known as Wirsungocele, when it involves the last portion of the Wirsung duct, and Santorinicele, when the terminal Santorini duct is dilated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Cystic dilation of the proximal part of the pancreatic ducts, as well as combination anomalies have never been reported in the English literature. Herein, we present a new and non-reported combination anomaly of the pancreatic duct; proximal cystic dilation of the Santorini duct with dominant Santorini duct without pancreas divisum. As already mentioned before, these findings were never reported in the English literature and are introduced as “Kluri” anomaly after the names of the authors Kluger and Khuri.\n\n【23】Currently, there is not an established scientific-based consensus regarding the best therapeutic strategy to be followed in treating this unique and uncommon pancreatic anomalies. This is largely due to the fact that pancreatic duct anomalies are very rare. Asymptomatic patients found incidentally do not require usually further therapeutic management. On the other hand, the choice of therapy in symptomatic patients depends usually on several parameters such as frequency, severity and duration of symptoms and the presence/absence of complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Therapeutic intervention (either endoscopic or surgical) is usually indicated for patients with recurrent mild attacks of pancreatitis or following single attack of severe pancreatitis. The importance of multidisciplinary team approach for such cases should be highly appreciated and routinely advocated. Since our patient is young and suffered recurrent episodes of severe acute pancreatitis, MDTM decision was surgical resection in the form of total pancreatectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【24】In conclusion, congenital pancreatic duct anomalies are rare, yet becoming more familiar medical phenomenon among physicians. In the presence of ductal anomaly along with recurrent episodes of severe pancreatitis, MDTM is highly advisable. Authors are encouraged to report such rare cases to gain knowledge of the different characteristics, presentations, and management of such anomalies.\n\n【25】Learning points\n\n【26】The main take away points from this case report are to know that pancreatic duct anomalies are rare anomalies, and usually forgotten cause of recurrent idiopathic pancreatitis. In addition, due to the recent rise in the use of the highly sensitive abdominal imaging studies for different purposes, physicians are familiar more with these anomalies. In the setting of recurrent idiopathic pancreatitis and proven radiological pancreatic duct anomaly, a MDTM is highly recommended. Herein, we introduce a never reported pancreatic duct anomaly, known as “Kluri” anomaly as a cause of recurrent severe pancreatitis.\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding sources.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interest.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SK contributed to writing as well as for the design of the manuscript.

To date, genes located at six chromosomal loci associated with MH have been described: 1) Ryanodine receptor type 1 ( RyR1 ) gene, ryanodine receptor found in skeletal muscle (chromosomal locus 19q13.1.); 2) CACNA1S gene, which encodes for the alpha-1S subunit of dihydropyridine (chromosomal locus 1q32); 3) A variant of the STAC3 gene, which encodes an important protein for excitation-contraction coupling via trafficking the voltage sensor into the correct T-tubular location (chromosomal locus 7q21-q22); 4) SCN4A gene (possible), related to voltage-dependent sodium channel of skeletal muscle (chromosomal locus 17q11.2-q24); and, not yet identified genes for 5) chromosomal loci 3q13.1 and 6) 5p 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 , 7 \\- 10 \\]</u>. However, these genes associated with MH show incomplete penetrance and variable expression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】MH is related to muscle function and calcium levels. A muscle contraction starts when the action potential arrives at the neuromuscular junction, starting a muscle depolarization and causing a conformational change in the T-tubular L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (dihydropyridine calcium channel receptor, DHPR). This conformational change activates the RyR1 leading to a rapid release of Ca <sup>2+ </sup> , from sarcoplasmic reticulum, increasing the intracytoplasmic Ca <sup>2+ </sup> concentration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 11 \\- 13 \\]</u>. Muscle relaxation occurs when stimulation of the motor nerve stops and the intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent Ca <sup>2+ </sup> pump transports intracytoplasmic Ca <sup>2+ </sup> into the sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 , 13 , 14 \\]</u>. MH is a calcium channelopathy of skeletal muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> in which a constant increase of intracytoplasmic Ca <sup>2+ </sup> concentration occurs causing a change in cellular metabolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 \\- 9 , 13 \\]</u>. A hypermetabolic state develops when susceptible patients are exposed to halogenated volatile inhalational anesthetic agents (halothane, isoflurane, enflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane and methoxyflurane), depolarizing muscle relaxants (e.g. succinylcholine), and/or extreme physical activity in hot environments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 , 8 , 16 \\- 18 \\]</u>. The MH clinical incidence is estimated to be from 1 in 10,000 - 30,000 to 1 in 100,000 - 250,000 in patients undergoing anesthesia, depending on geographic localization and age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 9 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, the prevalence of genetic variants or mutations of an individual susceptible to MH is estimated to be 1 in 2,000 - 3,000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 10 \\]</u>. MH affects all ethnic groups and both sexes, although there is a greater predisposition for men and children, and it is atypical in the elderly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\- 7 \\]</u>. The MH episode can occur both in the first exposure to the substances that triggers the crisis and in subsequent contacts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 19 , 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】MH presents variable clinical expression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>. During an episode of MH, the patient may present clinical signs and laboratory findings including masseter muscle spasm, tachycardia, rise in end-tidal CO <sub>2 </sub> concentration (EtCO <sub>2 </sub> ), tachypnea, hyperthermia, cyanosis, metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, myoglobinuria, hyperlactacidemia and acute renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 , 7 , 8 , 17 , 21 \\]</u>. When the pathology is diagnosed, the exposure to the triggering agents should be discontinued followed by immediate intravenous administration of dantrolene sodium, a hydantoin-derived skeletal muscle relaxant drug 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 11 , 17 , 22 , 23 \\]</u>. Dantrolene remains the drug of choice for MH prophylaxis and treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 11 , 22 \\]</u>. In addition, protocols must be established to control or prevent complications associated with the clinical condition of the disease. These include external (if necessary, internal) cooling of the patient’s body, hyperventilation with 100% oxygen, correction of metabolic acidosis, adjustment of cardiac arrhythmias, dialysis to remove anesthetic residues and aid in blood filtration to revert metabolites to normal levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Several tests have been proposed or are being investigated as less invasive diagnostic tests to determinate MH susceptible patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>, including: 1) Evaluation of creatine kinase concentrations; 2) In vitro measurement for the concentrations of ATP, phosphocreatine or other phosphomonoesters, along with pH, in muscle and other tissue by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; 3) Evaluation of calcium flow at RYR1 receptors on B lymphocytes; 4) Assessment of the enhanced intracellular calcium from cultured muscle tissue; and 5) Molecular genetic tests to look for mutations in the genes associated with MH susceptibility. However, the caffeine-halothane contracture test (CHCT) remains the standard method used in Brazil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 12 , 24 , 25 \\]</u>. CHCT must be performed on a biopsy of approximately 2 g of muscle from the vastus lateralis or vastus medialis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 12 , 24 \\]</u>. The muscle fragment is longitudinally dissected into strips and the level of muscle contraction is assessed before and after exposure to caffeine and halothane ( RYR1 agonists) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 24 \\]</u>. Individuals who are susceptible to MH have a CHCT positive result when abnormally high levels of contractile force are detected after the caffeine and/or halothane exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 12 , 24 , 26 \\]</u>. The aim of this case report is to describe an episode of MH associated with the use of halogenated anesthetic during bariatric surgery. The case study is intended to serve as inclusive knowledge and a reference tool for healthcare professionals and academic-scientific area with respect to clinical, pathophysiological, biochemical, and biophysical correlations.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】Informed consent was obtained from the patient’s family as well as authorization to use and disclose protected health information. L.R.M.S was a 29-year-old man, born in Jau, Sao Paulo, Brazil but with European ascendance. He was admitted to the Hospital Santa Casa de Jahu to undergo a bariatric surgery, vertical gastroplasty to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass without a ring, using the conventional technique (not performed by laparoscopy).\n\n【7】The patient’s relevant medical history included morbid obesity grade III, allergy to sulfa-based drugs and severe obstructive sleep apnea (i.e. apnea and hypopnea index greater than 30 hypopneas and apneas per hour). The patient complained of episodes of gastroesophageal reflux and the repeated occurrences of calf cramps. In addition, due to the obesity condition, the patient possessed a lack of energy, impaired mobility, episodes of peak hypertension, and mood changes. The patient was using antidepressant medications to treat anxiety. Preoperative evaluations with cardiopulmonary exercise testing, echocardiogram with color Doppler and electrocardiogram showed no anatomical and functional changes of the patient’s heart. However, some signs of hepatic steatosis were detected from a total abdominal ultrasound and spirometry test showed a mild obstructive ventilatory defect. On pre-anesthetic evaluation, the patient reported that he had never undergone general anesthesia. Furthermore, none of his family members had presented complications in surgical procedures with general anesthesia.\n\n【8】Upon arriving at the operating room, the patient’s preoperative blood pressure was 200/130 mm Hg with an oxygen saturation of 94%. Although the patient’s oxygen saturation showed normal in the preoperative exams, while lying down a significant drop in this saturation was observed. Surgical procedures started at approximately 8 am on February 14, 2011 and ended at 12:50 pm, without complications. General anesthesia was induced and maintained with the following agents as described in Table 1 .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Anesthetics, Analgesic and Muscle Relaxant Agents Used During the Intraoperative Period |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【10】After the end of the surgical procedures, the patient remained in the operating room for another hour until he responded to stimuli. Then, the patient was taken to the recovery room, where he stayed until 2 pm. According to medical reports, the evolution of the patient’s condition indicated oliguria and acute breathing insufficiency. Therefore, the patient was placed under mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n【11】Five hours after the patient arrived at the ICU, he started to present clinical signs of hypermetabolic state, with tremors, excessive sweating, and rapid body temperature increases. In early postoperative, the temperature was being adjusted with an antipyretic (dipyrone) administration. On postoperative days 0 (02/14), 1 (02/15), 2 (02/16) and 3 (02/17), nursing reports described an unstable blood pressure, tachycardia and persistent hyperthermia, as shown in Table 2 .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 2. Postoperative Vitals Control According to the Nursing Reports |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【13】In the early postoperative, a chest X-ray was performed, which indicated an elevation of diaphragmatic domes. In addition, the routine tracheal aspiration for intubated patients was carried out and the patient had serosanguinolent secretion.\n\n【14】Some laboratory tests and arterial-blood gas analyses were performed to monitor the patient’s clinical conditions . The blood sugar levels were measured in the pre- and post-operative periods and hyperglycemia was observed in postoperative tests. Postoperative changes in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) concentration were also observed. The first CPK test was carried out on February 15 at 08:26 am, indicating a high CPK concentration, more than 2,380 U/L. After 5 h, a new CPK evaluation was done showing an increase of 164%. The level of serum calcium was normal in the preoperative evaluation; however, the calcium test performed on postoperative day 1 (morning) showed hypocalcemia, whereas in the following postoperative tests the concentration of this ion was returned to the normal level. Serum sodium levels increased from postoperative day 2, while hyperkalemia was observed in the afternoon of postoperative day 1. Serum levels of urea and creatinine were evaluated in the pre- and post-operative periods. Urea and creatinine concentrations were normal in the preoperative tests; however, on postoperative day 1, urea was 78% higher and creatinine increased more than 350%. On the following postoperative days, both urea and creatinine concentrations kept increasing. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzymes were evaluated in the pre- and postoperative periods. In the preoperative test, the AST and ALT levels were normal. On postoperative day 1 (morning) the AST and ALT levels were approximately 22 and 15 times higher, respectively. A new AST and ALT test were carried out after 5 h and the values almost doubled.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 3. Follow-Up Labs and Arterial-Blood Gas Results |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【16】Two arterial-blood gas analyses were performed on postoperative day 1. The first arterial-blood gas analysis (08:26 am) showed normal rates, although the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO <sub>2 </sub> ) increased due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation with pure oxygen. The second arterial-blood gas analysis (01:18 pm) indicated acidification of the blood pH and significant changes in both the concentration of base excess and in arterial-blood distribution of gases. In addition, the bicarbonate concentration remained in a normal range and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO <sub>2 </sub> ) increased in both arterial-blood gas analyses .\n\n【17】Preoperative and postoperative blood counts were performed. In the preoperative blood counts, the absolute number of leukocytes was 7,900 mm <sup>3 </sup> (level range: 4,000 - 10,000 mm <sup>3 </sup> ). On postoperative day 1, two blood counts were carried out; the first one showed a significant increase of leukocytes (14,700 mm <sup>3 </sup> ), characterizing a leukocytosis. After 2 h, a new leukocyte count was performed and the absolute number decreased to 12,000 mm <sup>3 </sup> . On postoperative day 2, the absolute number of leukocytes was 13,800 mm <sup>3 </sup> , while the last blood count performed on postoperative day 3 showed 13,000 leukocytes per mm <sup>3 </sup> .\n\n【18】On the postoperative day 1, an echocardiogram was performed and showed mild symmetric hypertrophy. On the same day, a new chest X-ray was carried out and indicated little pulmonary inspiration, bilateral basal interstitial infiltrate, veiled left diaphragmatic dome, and globose cardiac area.\n\n【19】On the postoperative day 2, an abdominal ultrasound was carried out and did not indicate any anatomical alteration of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, and bladder. In addition, it did not indicate signs of ascites or pleural effusion. A third chest X-ray was performed revealing a veiling of the base of the right lung, cardiomegaly, aortic stretching, permeable costophrenic sinuses and free diaphragmatic domes.\n\n【20】On the postoperative day 3 (08:15 am), an urinalysis was accomplished and showed traces of proteinuria, presence of ketones, leukocytes (17,600/mL), red blood cells (12,000/mL), and urobilinogen (0.2 UE). On the same day (3:50 pm), the medical records reported the establishment of multifactorial acute respiratory and renal failures, rhabdomyolysis, systemic inflammatory process and, for the first time, MH crisis was assumed. At night, nursing reports recorded edema formation of lower limbs, cold and cyanotic extremities, distended abdomen, paleness, and septic shock a few hours before the death of the patient.\n\n【21】The MH diagnosis of L.R.M.S. was conducted less than 5 h before his death, and the administration of dantrolene sodium was not performed. The patient’s exposure to the substances that triggered the crisis was completed when the surgical procedures were over. External body cooling and hyperventilation with pure oxygen were administered in the following postoperative days. Dialysis was done a few hours before the patient’s death; however, according to medical reports this procedure caused decompensation of several of the patient’s clinical and laboratory parameters. The patient died at 9:20 pm on February 17, 2011 in the Hospital Santa Casa de Jahu.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】In MH crises, there is a persistent increase in the intracytoplasmic calcium concentration. The initial manifestations of a hypermetabolic state induce fast depletion of ATP causing increased carbon dioxide production, increased oxygen demands, respiratory acidosis, and increased temperature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 13 , 14 \\]</u>. The constant rise in oxygen consumption will lead to a hypoxia and progressive lactic acidosis, while depletion of ATP due to hypermetabolism of skeletal muscle cells will result in metabolic acidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 13 \\]</u>. Based on the clinical and lab findings, a late diagnosis of MH crisis was established for patient L.R.M.S. According to Litman et al 通用删除7(英):<u>(2008)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>, a MH crisis may occur at any time during anesthesia as well as in the early postoperative period, although not usually 1 h after discontinuation of volatile agents. However, in our case the patient displayed initial symptoms of MH after 11 h of isoflurane administration, a late postoperative crisis.\n\n【24】Hyperthermia is a key indicator of MH, since the rapid increase in body temperature occurs due to the process of sustained muscle contraction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 , 8 \\]</u>. In the initial postoperative period, the patient’s temperature increase was being controlled with the administration of antipyretic. Thereafter, hyperthermia no longer responded with the antipyretic administration, and the patient’s body was cooled externally. However, even with measures taken to control the temperature, it continued to increase. Tachycardia is another clinical sign characteristic of MH and it has been registered since the early postoperative period, as described in Table 2 .\n\n【25】Constant muscle contraction causes a decrease in ATP levels and consequent difficulty in muscle relaxation, which explains the masseter rigidity presented by patients during the MH crisis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 13 , 28 \\]</u>. The patient L.R.M.S. was placed on spontaneous ventilation after the surgical procedure but was maintained with Montgomery T-tube due to his morbid obesity. After being transferred to the ICU, the patient presented a drop in oxygen saturation and needed to be placed on a mechanical respirator, in which he remained until his death. However, it was not observed whether the patient showed masseter rigidity as described in other MH case reports.\n\n【26】High temperatures (at times over 42 degrees) achieved during MH crisis, together with the toxins released due to rapid and severe catabolism. It causes profound and acute inflammatory and functional changes of internal organs, leading to changes in the information contained in the blood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 , 29 \\- 31 \\]</u>. If diagnosed late, MH causes multiple organ dysfunction (e.g. kidneys, pancreas and liver), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), cardiac dysrhythmias (cardiac arrest), and can progress to multiple organ failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 , 6 , 17 , 32 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】The pre- and early post-operative patient’s blood sugar tests were normal. After the afternoon of postoperative day 1, the glucose concentration increased. The hyperglycemia presented by the patient could be due to both a dysfunction of the pancreas caused by the hypermetabolic state and the need of the body to try to supply glucose for the ATP production and, consequently, muscle relaxation.\n\n【28】Creatine phosphokinase is one of the most sensitive indicators of muscular damage. High serum levels of CPK observed after general anesthesia is a strong indicator of an MH crisis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Expressively high values in the serum CPK concentration indicate damage to contractile cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 , 33 \\]</u>, since this enzyme plays an important role in regulation of muscle contraction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>. Although serum CPK levels were not evaluated during the intraoperative period, our patient presented high levels in all dosages performed in the postoperative period. The increase in serum CPK concentration occurs due to cell lysis, as this enzyme is not able to naturally cross the sarcoplasmic membrane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 , 31 , 33 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Calcium is essential for the integrity and structure of cell membranes, proper conduction of electrical stimuli (cardiac and muscular) blood clotting, and bone formation growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>. When serum calcium levels decrease, excitability of nerve and muscle cells increases significantly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. Given the abundance of calcium in the body, hypocalcemia always means failure in the regulatory mechanisms and can have several causes such as rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and incessant muscle contractions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 , 36 \\]</u>. The patient’s hypocalcemia detected on postoperative day 1 could be directly related to the renal failure and with increased muscle cell excitability presented.\n\n【30】Sodium is a cation found in high concentration in extracellular fluids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 , 37 \\]</u>. Hypernatremia is always associated with plasma hyperosmolarity and is usually caused by a water deficit (low intake or abnormal losses) or excessive sodium intake 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 , 36 \\]</u>. The patient’s hypernatremia observed from postoperative day 2 may be related to renal failure, elevated temperature and hyperventilation.\n\n【31】Potassium is the main intracellular cation and it is critical in many physiological functions, such as in the regulation of neuromuscular excitability and muscle contraction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 , 38 \\]</u>. Acid-base balance can affect the balance between cellular and extracellular potassium concentration. Metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, cell lysis, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure increase the plasma potassium concentration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 36 , 38 , 39 \\]</u>. Hyperkalemia was noted in our patient on the afternoon of postoperative day 1. Although the literature describes case reports with contradictory serum potassium concentration, reviews of MH specify that hyperkalemia is indicative of MH crisis triggering 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 , 7 , 8 , 12 , 17 \\]</u>. According to Mahmood 通用删除7(英):<u>(2018)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 40 \\]</u>, hyperkalemia can induce fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. The patient’s hyperkalemia contributed to the pertinent tachycardia observed from the postoperative period until his death.\n\n【32】Urea is the main nitrogen metabolite derived from the breakdown of proteins by the body, 90% of which is excreted by the kidneys. Urea is freely filtered by the glomerulus and 40-70% returns to the plasma through a passive diffusion process, dependent on the urinary flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 \\]</u>. Creatinine is a residual product of creatine. The transformation of creatine into creatinine takes place in muscle tissue, in which 1-2% of free creatine is spontaneously and irreversibly converted to creatinine every day. The amount of creatinine produced is dependent on muscle mass. Creatinine is freely filtered in the glomerulus, too. Unlike urea, 7-10% of creatinine is actively secreted in the urine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 42 , 43 \\]</u>. However, decreased renal function causes increased concentrations of urea and serum creatinine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 \\]</u>. Lab test results showed a progressive increase in serum levels of urea and creatinine in our patient during the postoperative period, indicating the inability of the kidneys to clear these metabolites and, consequently, the decrease in renal function.\n\n【33】Although our patient’s serum myoglobin was not evaluated, the darkening of urine was described in medical reports during the postoperative period. Dark tea or cola-colored urine is caused by an excessive amount of myoglobin in the urine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 , 33 \\]</u>. In addition, a rhabdomyolysis characterized by high levels of CPK 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 , 31 \\]</u> resulted in myoglobinuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 , 45 \\]</u> observed during the patient’s urinalysis.\n\n【34】The leukocytosis observed in the blood test and the presence of leukocytes in the urine analysis are indicative of an infection. The presence of leukocytes in urine reinforced the suspicion of acute renal injury due to myoglobinuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 46 \\]</u>. As a result of rhabdomyolysis (generalized inflammatory process), there was an increase in circulating leukocytes. Kidney damage caused leukocyte migration to combat this inflammatory response. In addition, the intestinal bacterial proliferation significantly increased due to the high and persistent temperature. This bacterial growth caused distension of the intestine and the intra-intestinal pressure became markedly high and triggered a phenomenon called bacterial translation. However, a large amount of bacteria was pushed into blood circulation and triggered a defensive rise in leukocytosis.\n\n【35】AST enzyme is present inside several tissues of the body; the highest concentrations are in the heart and kidneys, but the enzyme is also produced in the liver and skeletal muscles. ALT is found almost exclusively in liver cells and is responsible for the metabolism of some proteins such as L-aspartate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and alanine. Quantification of AST and ALT serum levels is performed to evaluate potential liver damage. High AST level indicates trauma or muscle damage and is a quite common finding in rhabdomyolysis. The significant increase in serum AST and ALT concentrations observed in the postoperative exams of our patient may be related to skeletal muscle injuries due to exhaustive muscle contraction.\n\n【36】The patient’s hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis contributed to the blood pH reduction recorded by arterial-blood gas analysis.\n\n【37】Respiratory acidosis is characterized by an elevation of PaCO <sub>2 </sub> , with or without compensatory increase in bicarbonate ions (HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>- </sup> ), plus pH acidification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 47 \\]</u>. The causes are associated with decreased respiratory rate, inspired volume (hypoventilation) and blood oxygen saturation due to muscle diseases, respiratory or neurological conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 37 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】Specific situations such as those that occur during the MH crisis cause an increase in temperature, and blood pH acidification with a decrease in the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. Although there is an increase in both PaO <sub>2 </sub> and oxygen supply as a result of mechanical ventilation with pure oxygen, the affinity of oxygen for hemoglobin is reduced. The increase in carbon dioxide production due to continuous muscle contraction causes an increase in carbon dioxide concentration and, consequently, the PaCO <sub>2 </sub> . In addition, the increase in carbon dioxide concentration increases the association between carbon dioxide and water, forming carbonic acid (H <sub>2 </sub> CO <sub>3 </sub> ). Carbonic acid, by the action of carbonic anhydrase, dissociates into bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions, further decreasing blood pH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 , 37 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】Throughout the postoperative period, even with constant oxygen supply, the patient’s blood O <sub>2 </sub> saturation was low . The high temperature, acidification of blood pH, and the increased PaCO <sub>2 </sub> contributed to decrease the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. During the MH crisis, although the decrease in hemoglobin affinity for oxygen caused the incorporation of hydrogen ions in hemoglobin, the blood pH acidification occurred both by metabolic acidosis and by increasing the carbon dioxide concentration.\n\n【40】The patient’s arterial-blood gas analysis showed blood pH acidification and increase in PaO <sub>2 </sub> and in PaCO <sub>2 </sub> . The patient’s bicarbonate ion concentration was in normal range, but the base excess concentration indicated a deficit of bases dissolved in his blood during the postoperative period.\n\n【41】The increase in the occurrence of dyspnea in obese patients is evident and its intensity is directly proportional to the body mass index 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 48 \\]</u>. The patient’s medical history included obesity grade III and severe obstructive sleep apnea. During the postoperative period, the patient remained lying down, in high decubitus, with a distended abdomen, making breathing difficult. The patient had low blood O <sub>2 </sub> saturation even under mechanical ventilation with hyperventilation of pure oxygen. However, chest X-rays and ultrasound ruled out a possible pleural effusion or pneumothorax due to mechanical ventilation. In addition, atelectasis due to intubation, one of the most common respiratory complications after surgery, was discarded.\n\n【42】Zutt et al 通用删除7(英):<u>(2014)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u> suggest that complementary cardiac assessments should be performed when the patient has electrolyte disturbances during the MH crisis. On postoperative days 2 and 3, chest X-rays were carried out and indicated globose cardiac area and cardiomegaly, respectively. On the postoperative day 1, an echocardiogram was performed to evaluate anatomical and functional aspects of our patient’s heart. The echocardiogram indicated mild symmetrical hypertrophy as an adaptive response of the heart to arterial hypertension presented by the patient during the postoperative period, as described in Table 2 .\n\n【43】As soon as the MH crisis is diagnosed, the patient’s exposure to the substances that triggered the crisis must be stopped and the administration of dantrolene sodium must be initiated immediately 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 , 11 , 17 , 22 \\]</u>. Dantrolene sodium is the only clinically available drug for the specific MH treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Several case reports have different descriptions with or without the dantrolene addition. In some cases, dantrolene was administered immediately after the MH crisis triggering, both during the intraoperative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 13 , 40 , 49 , 50 \\]</u> and postoperative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 , 51 , 52 \\]</u> periods and all patients were discharged from the hospital in stable conditions. Late addition of dantrolene is also reported in intra- and postoperative MH cases with different results, and some were fatal, while others had no additional complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 45 , 53 , 54 \\]</u>. On the other hand, there were related intra- 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 55 \\]</u> and postoperative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 54 \\]</u> MH cases in which dantrolene was not administrated due to non-availability of the drug in the hospital. Iqbal et al 通用删除7(英):<u>(2017)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u> reported the clinical signs and laboratory parameters altered by the MH crisis were reversed with internal (ice cold saline intravenously) and external (ice packs and cold towels over the body) cooling, and the patient had full recovery before being discharged. Pan et al 通用删除7(英):<u>(2016)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 54 \\]</u>, in the case report III, described that the inhalation anesthetic was not used in the operation, but the body temperature rose slowly during the postoperative period and, after 2 days, the patient was in critical condition. Meanwhile, Lazraq et al 通用删除7(英):<u>(2019)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 55 \\]</u> and Pan et al 通用删除7(英):<u>(2016)</u> (case report I) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 54 \\]</u> reported that patients had persistent high fever and died despite all the resuscitation procedures administered. Unfortunately, in our case, dantrolene could not be used because it was not available at the hospital or in other hospitals in nearby cities and the patient died. In Sao Paulo, the Law 10.781, published on March 9, 2001, provides for the state policy for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of MH and the second Article describes that all public or private health services in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil must have appropriate medications to fight the disease, especially dantrolene sodium.\n\n【44】Larach et al 通用删除7(英):<u>(1994)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 56 \\]</u> proposed a clinical grading scale (CGS) to predict MH susceptibility and help to confirm the MH diagnosis after halogenated volatile inhalational anesthetic administration. Based on the Larach scale, our patient had the almost certain probability to developed MH. He was rated grade 6, the highest grade with a score higher than 50.\n\n【45】In 1998, Richthofen et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 57 \\]</u> compared the results obtained with the use of the CGS with the results obtained in carrying out the in vitro contracture test (IVCT) and concluded that the CGS cannot replace IVCT. However, the indication of prediction for MH susceptibility through CGS can guide the patient and/or their family members in IVCT carried out to confirm the MH diagnosis/susceptibility.\n\n【46】The CHCT was carried out on the patient’s brother to confirm the MH diagnosis. G.H.M.S, 21-year-old, born in Jau, SP, Brazil and never underwent halogenated anesthesia, was performed the CHCT at the Malignant Hyperthermia Diagnostic Center of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, in August 2011. The CHCT indicated a contracture of 1.27 g in a muscle strip exposed to caffeine at 2 mM and the results were considered positive indicating MH susceptibility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. Almeida da Silva et al 通用删除7(英):<u>(2019)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> evaluated the profile of MH susceptibility reports confirmed with muscle contracture test in Brazil. In the period 1997 - 2010, approximately 80% of the individuals submitted to CHCT presented positive results for MH susceptibility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【47】The patient’s sister underwent the same surgical procedure, with the same doctor and in the same hospital 2 years earlier and did not present any complications during the intraoperative and postoperative periods. In addition, she had undergone three other surgical procedures with halogenated anesthesia without complications. The literature findings described that the MH crisis can occur during the first or even after the exposure to a triggering agent due to incomplete penetrance and variable expression of the genes encoding the MH disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 19 , 20 , 58 , 59 \\]</u>.\n\n【48】The delayed diagnosis of MH crisis reported here could be associated with the onset of clinical symptoms and changes in laboratory parameters observed in the late postoperative period, and with the low clinical incidence of MH. For instance, L.R.M.S. was the first patient diagnosed with MH at Hospital Santa Casa de Jahu (and in Jau city, SP). However, this MH episode and the patient’s brother CHCT results should be reported on pre-anesthetic evaluations of the patient’s family members before undergoing procedures under general anesthesia to prevent MH crisis.\n\n【49】Conclusions\n\n【50】The detailed report of the development of the MH episode triggered by halogenated anesthetic during bariatric surgery allowed us to describe the severity and lethality of this hypermetabolic syndrome. The dissemination and accessibility of data on MH are of high relevance for the medical, academic and scientific communities. The need to understand in detail the clinical and the pathophysiological, biochemical and biophysical mechanisms associated with MH is of fundamental practical importance in preventing and reversing an MH crisis.\n\n【51】Knowledge of the carrier’s situation allows patients and family members to alert the medical team if there is a need to perform any surgical procedure, thus avoiding the use of halogenated anesthetics. In addition, it is essential that dantrolene sodium be included in emergency medications that are mandatory in all operating rooms. However, knowledge of the symptoms, an early diagnosis and an adequate treatment can prevent the death of patients in MH crisis.\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank Dr. Itamar Trindade Neves Epifanio and Prof. Dr. Victor L.

Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) is an increasingly recognized muscle disease often linked to statin use and occurs in about two to three patients for every 100,000 individuals exposed to statins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, in certain populations, statin-induced IMNM is now the most commonly observed form (> 50% of all cases) of inflammatory muscle disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Unlike toxic myopathy commonly associated with statin use, statin-induced IMNM is associated with a much worse prognosis and requires timely diagnosis and institution of immunosuppressive therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]</u>. The pathogenesis of this entity is not fully understood. However, many studies have linked the disease to the induction of anti-hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase antibodies by statin use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, and these antibodies are used as a diagnostic test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In addition to positive anti-HMG-CoA reductase antibodies, the diagnosis of statin-induced IMNM is also made by demonstrating the unique microscopic features on muscle biopsy, namely, myofiber degeneration and necrosis out of proportion to the inflammatory infiltrate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Treatment of this entity requires prolonged, often escalating courses of immunosuppressive therapy. In this communication, the authors present two cases of statin-induced IMNM, describing the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and outcome of immunosuppressive therapy.\n\n【3】Case Reports\n\n【4】Case 1\n\n【5】Investigations\n\n【6】A 54-year-old female presented with progressive bilateral leg pain and weakness for 2 months. She reported difficulty climbing stairs, getting out of bed, or low seats without assistance.\n\n【7】Her past medical history includes diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. She takes metformin, glimepiride, and lisinopril. She has also been taking atorvastatin 20 mg daily for 2 years prior to her presentation. Her vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination was notable for muscle tenderness and proximal muscle weakness, with muscle power of 3/5 of bilateral deltoids, hip flexors, and has weak neck flexors. Physical examination was otherwise non-contributory.\n\n【8】Diagnosis\n\n【9】Initial investigations include aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 91(13 - 39 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase ALT: 224 (7 - 52 IU/L), creatine phosphokinase (CPK): 6,523 IU/L (30.0 - 223.0 IU/L), aldolase: 49.5 U/L (1.2 - 7.6 U/L) erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): 73 (0 - 30 mm/h) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): 2.85 (0.27 - 4.20 µIU/mL) and hemoglobin A1C: 6.4 (< 5.7%). Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) were negative. Anti-HMG-CoA reductase antibodies immunoglobulin G (IgG) were elevated > 200 (0 - 19 U). Myositis extended panel was negative . Electromyography (EMG) of the left leg was consistent with electrodiagnostic evidence of mild proximal myopathy.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Myositis Extended Panel for Case 1 |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【11】Muscle biopsy  demonstrated the presence of scattered regenerating and necrotic muscle fibers without significant chronic lymphoid inflammation, consistent with a diagnosis of IMNM. In the context of statin use and positive HMG-CoA reductase antibodies, it was concluded that atorvastatin was the likely culprit.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The patient was started on oral prednisone 60 mg daily, and methotrexate 10 mg weekly.\n\n【15】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【16】The patient experienced an improvement in her muscle pain after stopping atorvastatin, but her muscle weakness continues to worsen. However, she experienced a notable improvement in her symptoms a few weeks after the start of her immunosuppressive treatment with prednisone and methotrexate with no significant side effects at her first follow-up visit. She is scheduled for regular follow-up with her rheumatologist.\n\n【17】Case 2\n\n【18】Investigations\n\n【19】A 59-year-old male presented with 3 weeks of progressive muscle weakness involving his arms associated with difficulty lifting things above his head and reported some muscle stiffness that improves with physical activity. A few weeks later, the weakness extended to the lower extremities, with difficulty standing up from a sitting position. His medical history was significant for hyperlipidemia, type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity. His long-term medications include insulin, lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin 80 mg daily. The patient was initially taking simvastatin for 6 years for hyperlipidemia, then was switched to atorvastatin 80 mg daily 5 years prior to this presentation. On physical examination, he had a symmetrical proximal muscle weakness with muscle power of 4/5, in both upper and lower extremities. His deep tendon reflexes were normal and symmetrical, and he did not have tremors or pronator drift. Physical examination was otherwise non-contributory.\n\n【20】Diagnosis\n\n【21】He was initially diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis considering a high creatine kinase (CK) of 18,315 (30.0 - 223.0 IU/L). His atorvastatin was held and treated with intravenous fluids with a gradual decrease in his CK level, which plateaued at 6,000. His initial labs were remarkable for AST: 378 (13 - 39 IU/L), ALT: 531 (7 - 52 IU/L), aldolase: 157 U/L (1.2 - 7.6 U/L), ESR: 12 (0 - 30 mm/h) and TSH: 1.897 (0.27 - 4.20 µIU/mL), lactate dehydrogenase 1,415 (140 - 271 U/L), and hemoglobin A1C 6.9% (< 5.7%). His urine was positive for blood without red blood cells (RBCs). Autoimmune screens, including ANA, RF, JO1 antibody, extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) SSA (RO) and ENA SSB (LA) antibodies, scleroderma SCL-70, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies IgG were all negative. Anti-hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) IgG antibody was elevated to more than 200 (0 - 19 U). Myositis extended panel was reported as negative . The patient had EMG examination, which showed primary muscle disease without large fiber neuropathy. A muscle biopsy  demonstrated necrotic muscle fibers with only sparse focal lymphoid inflammation consistent with a diagnosis of IMNM, likely induced by statin treatment.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 2.

He however had persistent difficulty standing up from a sitting position. He was then treated with three doses of pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone 1,000 mg with some improvement in muscle strength but still was unable to get out of bed unassisted. He was started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), with significant improvement in muscle strength. He then resumed oral prednisone with a reduced dose along with weekly methotrexate and remained on IVIG. His muscle weakness resolved, and he was back to baseline; he was able to return to work and remained almost fully functional 2 years after diagnosis.\n\n【28】Discussion\n\n【29】The increasing use of statins as first-line lipid-lowering agents has led to increasing reports of statin-associated muscle symptoms and unmasking a peculiar form of myopathy with an autoimmune nature associated with their use. Unlike patients with the commonly described statin-induced toxic myopathy, who typically improve after discontinuation of the offending medication, most patients with IMNM develop persistent muscle weakness and elevation of markers of muscle injury, namely CK, long after discontinuation of statins. Most of these patients require immunosuppressive therapies to show some clinical improvement. Thus, this distinct clinical entity, known as statin-associated autoimmune necrotizing myopathy, has become increasingly recognized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】The pathogenesis of statin-induced IMNM is not fully understood. The condition, typically positive for anti-HMGCR antibodies, is strongly associated with class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allele DRB1\\11:01 and exposure to statins, suggesting a role for statin exposure in upregulating HMGCR in genetically susceptible patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Expression of HMGCR is upregulated not only in muscle tissue exposed to statins but also in regenerating muscle cells compared to resting myocytes which is felt to initiate an autoimmune response to muscle tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The immune response is perpetuated through persistently increased HMGCR expression in regenerating muscle fibers long after cessation of statin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. This autoimmune etiopathogenesis is further supported by the finding of MHC class I upregulation on the surface of non-necrotic muscle fibers in many of the reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In one case series, there was evidence of MHC class I antigen upregulation in 87.5% of the anti-HMGCR cases associated with the deposition of membrane attack complex (MAC), supporting a potentially complement-mediated immunopathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Both of our patients tested positive for HMGCR antibodies. Interestingly, a recent study suggested that among different statins, atorvastatin was most strongly associated with the development of anti-HMG-CoA reductase myopathy when compared to simvastatin or rosuvastatin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Both of our patients have been on long-term therapy with atorvastatin.\n\n【31】Anti-HMGCR IMNM presents clinically as a subacute or chronic progressive symmetrical proximal muscle weakness. Myalgia and dysphagia may occur in approximately one-third of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>. The condition may not be initially clinically distinguishable from common statin-induced muscle symptoms at presentation. However, unlike toxic myopathy commonly associated with statin use, IMNM muscle weakness and myalgia do not typically improve and may even worsen after the withdrawal of statin therapy. Typical statin-induced muscle symptoms significantly improve or even resolve within weeks of cessation of statin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In addition, statin-induced necrotizing myopathy is often associated with significantly increased levels of CK, which typically persists after the withdrawal of statins, as seen in both of our cases.\n\n【32】Statin-induced necrotizing myopathy is associated with significantly increased levels of CK, a nonspecific marker of muscle injury. CK levels may also be linked to muscle strength and can be used as a surrogate marker for disease activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Anti-HMGCR autoantibodies directed at the pharmacologic target of statins are a highly specific biomarker for the diagnosis of statin-induced IMNM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. In some studies, detecting these autoantibodies has shown sensitivity and specificity for the disease as high as 94.4% and 99.3%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 16 , 17 \\]</u>. Many studies demonstrated a clear association between statin exposure and positive anti-HMGCR antibodies; one study showed that 67% of patients with positive HMGCR antibodies had a prior prescription for statins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, and higher rates of statin exposure have been reported by other investigators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Both of our patients had high titers of HMGCR antibodies.\n\n【33】Histologically, muscle biopsy in statin-induced IMNM is characterized by myofiber degeneration and necrosis out of proportion to the minimal lymphocytic infiltration, suggesting a lesser role of lymphocytes in the pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The inflammatory infiltrate consists primarily of macrophages in almost 100% of anti-HMGCR-associated myopathy biopsies. Most of these macrophages were typically positive for CD163 M2, indicating regeneration/repair, whereas a few cases (18%) had CD11c M1-positive macrophages characterized by phagocytic activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In contrast to dermatomyositis, where macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells were typically located in the perimysium and perifascicular areas, these cells were characteristically distributed throughout the endomysium in HMGCR-associated myopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】There is no good literature about the use of immunosuppressants in IMNM as the disease entity is relatively new, described for the first time in 2004. Corticosteroids, oral prednisone, or pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone are the first-line therapy. Despite being a significant component of treatment, glucocorticoids are insufficient when used alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>. Some experts recommend intravenous immunoglobulin as a first line, especially in pregnant patients and young patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. According to the 224th ENMC International Workshop recommendations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>, initial treatment for IMNM should include intravenous or oral steroids, along with the addition of another agent at the same time or within 1 month, depending on disease severity and the initial response to treatment. Methotrexate is considered a reasonable option. IVIG could be added instead of, or in severe cases, along with methotrexate. IVIG should always be added within 6 months if other strategies are ineffective. Some experts recommended that IVIG be considered monotherapy in patients who cannot take high-dose steroids. In critically ill patients and patients with refractory disease, some experts recommended using plasma exchange, cyclophosphamide, and/or cyclosporine. Rituximab is increasingly used for severe or recalcitrant statin-induced autoimmune necrotizing myopathy, usually employing the rheumatoid arthritis protocol, and appears to be very effective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 23 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】After achieving maximum benefit from treatment, steroids should be tapered as tolerated. Only after at least 2 years of well-controlled disease with minimal or no steroids should other agents be stopped or tapered as tolerated. Many patients, however, may require chronic IVIG.\n\n【36】In some studies, early IVIG was associated with clinical improvement in the short-term follow-up in IMNM as measured by gains in muscle strength during follow-up. The clinical effect was especially significant in those with moderate to severe muscle weakness. Some factors, including female gender, older age, and initial oral or intravenous steroids, were associated with better biochemical improvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】Learning points\n\n【38】Statin-induced IMNM is an uncommon form of myopathy that requires a high index of clinical suspicion, especially in patients treated with statins who develop muscle symptoms and fail to improve or progress after cessation of statin therapy. Although the condition can mimic other inflammatory myopathies, it has different pathophysiologic, morphologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic characteristics. Early recognition is vital to prevent progressive muscle damage and disability, and treatment requires immunosuppressive therapy. Despite treatment, many patients develop clinical relapses upon weaning from immunosuppressive therapy. Moreover, many patients require escalation of immunosuppressive therapy to different classes of drugs with the associated risks of immunosuppression. Further research into therapeutic options is required.\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank the Department of Pathology at Ascension Saint Francis Hospital for their input and support.</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received for this case report.</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no conflict of interest in this case report from all authors.</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Both patients provided consent for publication.</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MSA prepared the discussion part, reviewed the literature, provided relevant referencing, and obtained copy of the biopsy slides.

Hypercalcemia, as a manifestation of sarcoidosis, frequently resolves with glucocorticoids, but to our knowledge, this is only the third case report of steroid treatment for hypercalcemia secondary to TB.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 25-year-old Filipino male with a history of developmental delay and chronic renal disease with proteinuria presented to his nephrologist for a routine appointment. The patient had no subjective complaints, but record review confirmed a weight loss of 10 kg compared to the prior year. He had a dry cough but denied hemoptysis or shortness of breath. On examination, he was under-nourished with a body mass index of 18.4 in addition to bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. A serum chemistry panel obtained on the day of evaluation revealed hypercalcemia (15.4 mg/dL, normal 8.9 - 10.4 mg/dL).\n\n【5】The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for intravenous hydration and diuretic therapy. A chest radiograph demonstrated hilar lymphadenopathy with a lingular airspace opacity; a contrast-enhanced computed tomogram (CT) of the chest and neck demonstrated additional tree-and-bud opacities  with diffuse cervical and mediastinal lymphadenopathy . Diagnostic studies were significant for a positive interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculous antigen, multiple negative sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and a negative serum human immunodeficiency virus enzyme immunoassay. His PTH was appropriately low at 2.91 pg/mL (normal 15 - 65 pg/mL) with a normal PTHrP of 20 pg/mL (normal 14 - 27 pg/mL). However, he was noted to have an elevated level of 1,25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (84 nmol/L, normal 18 - 72 nmol/L) and a low level of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (12 nmol/L, normal 35 - 80 nmol/L). A lymph node biopsy revealed granulomatous inflammation, without evidence of AFB by Ziehl-Niessen staining.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Seven weeks after presentation, cultures of sputum and the lymph node grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis with isolated resistance to INH. Moxifloxacin was subsequently added to his regimen and INH discontinued. His serum calcium levels normalized at discharge to 8.1 mg/dL following rehydration with furosemide diuresis. He remained asymptomatic and was afebrile without cough and achieved a 3-kg weight gain over the first 2 months of treatment. Surveillance sputum AFB cultures after 8 weeks of therapy revealed no growth.\n\n【9】Despite his apparent improvement, his cervical lymphadenopathy persisted, and his calcium levels increased to 10.3 mg/dL despite use of oral furosemide. After 6 months of therapy, he was treated with prednisone 20 mg/day × 21 days followed by a 7-day taper which resolved his calcium issue to 8.8 mg/dL and his follow on calcitriol had reduced to 16 nmol/L. His calcium levels remained within normal limits over the next several months of treatment, he regained 15 kg and his lymph nodes ultimately regressed.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Our patient had chronic and asymptomatic hypercalcemia with adenopathy that persisted despite antituberculous therapy and loop diuretics, with an excellent clinical response to prednisone. Data regarding the use of glucocorticoids as a therapy for TB-related hypercalcemia are limited. Previous case reports have described pulmonary TB with symptomatic, refractory hypercalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> and skeletal TB with hypercalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> successfully treated with glucocorticoids. Although not routine practice outside of specific syndromes such as meningitis or pericarditis, there are increasing data regarding the use of glucocorticoids as adjunctive therapy in TB. A recent meta-analysis reported an overall reduction in TB mortality of 17% (RR: 0.83) with the use of adjunctive glucocorticoids, including a statistically significant mortality benefit with meningitis and pericarditis. These conclusions are limited by the inclusion of both randomized and non-randomized trials and a lack of overall statistical significance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.

Hypercalcemia, as a manifestation of sarcoidosis, frequently resolves with glucocorticoids, but to our knowledge, this is only the third case report of steroid treatment for hypercalcemia secondary to TB.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 25-year-old Filipino male with a history of developmental delay and chronic renal disease with proteinuria presented to his nephrologist for a routine appointment. The patient had no subjective complaints, but record review confirmed a weight loss of 10 kg compared to the prior year. He had a dry cough but denied hemoptysis or shortness of breath. On examination, he was under-nourished with a body mass index of 18.4 in addition to bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. A serum chemistry panel obtained on the day of evaluation revealed hypercalcemia (15.4 mg/dL, normal 8.9 - 10.4 mg/dL).\n\n【5】The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for intravenous hydration and diuretic therapy. A chest radiograph demonstrated hilar lymphadenopathy with a lingular airspace opacity; a contrast-enhanced computed tomogram (CT) of the chest and neck demonstrated additional tree-and-bud opacities  with diffuse cervical and mediastinal lymphadenopathy . Diagnostic studies were significant for a positive interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculous antigen, multiple negative sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and a negative serum human immunodeficiency virus enzyme immunoassay. His PTH was appropriately low at 2.91 pg/mL (normal 15 - 65 pg/mL) with a normal PTHrP of 20 pg/mL (normal 14 - 27 pg/mL). However, he was noted to have an elevated level of 1,25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (84 nmol/L, normal 18 - 72 nmol/L) and a low level of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (12 nmol/L, normal 35 - 80 nmol/L). A lymph node biopsy revealed granulomatous inflammation, without evidence of AFB by Ziehl-Niessen staining.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Seven weeks after presentation, cultures of sputum and the lymph node grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis with isolated resistance to INH. Moxifloxacin was subsequently added to his regimen and INH discontinued. His serum calcium levels normalized at discharge to 8.1 mg/dL following rehydration with furosemide diuresis. He remained asymptomatic and was afebrile without cough and achieved a 3-kg weight gain over the first 2 months of treatment. Surveillance sputum AFB cultures after 8 weeks of therapy revealed no growth.\n\n【9】Despite his apparent improvement, his cervical lymphadenopathy persisted, and his calcium levels increased to 10.3 mg/dL despite use of oral furosemide. After 6 months of therapy, he was treated with prednisone 20 mg/day × 21 days followed by a 7-day taper which resolved his calcium issue to 8.8 mg/dL and his follow on calcitriol had reduced to 16 nmol/L. His calcium levels remained within normal limits over the next several months of treatment, he regained 15 kg and his lymph nodes ultimately regressed.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Our patient had chronic and asymptomatic hypercalcemia with adenopathy that persisted despite antituberculous therapy and loop diuretics, with an excellent clinical response to prednisone. Data regarding the use of glucocorticoids as a therapy for TB-related hypercalcemia are limited. Previous case reports have described pulmonary TB with symptomatic, refractory hypercalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> and skeletal TB with hypercalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> successfully treated with glucocorticoids. Although not routine practice outside of specific syndromes such as meningitis or pericarditis, there are increasing data regarding the use of glucocorticoids as adjunctive therapy in TB. A recent meta-analysis reported an overall reduction in TB mortality of 17% (RR: 0.83) with the use of adjunctive glucocorticoids, including a statistically significant mortality benefit with meningitis and pericarditis. These conclusions are limited by the inclusion of both randomized and non-randomized trials and a lack of overall statistical significance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Additionally, the randomized trials utilized older regimens which are not consistent with today’s standard of care and no study specifically identified either TB adenopathy or hypercalcemia. This case displays the potential utility of glucocorticoids as a treatment option in refractory TB adenopathy with hypercalcemia.

RGNT is a grade 1 glioneuronal tumor which consisted of neurocytic rosette and pilocytic components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In our study, we analyzed a 33-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with RGNT and had no recurrence in his 6-year follow-up.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 33-year-old male patient, who only had a complaint of dizziness and occasional headache for 3 years, applied to our hospital Istanbul Medeniyet University Goztepe Training and Research Hospital with the complaint of a left-shoulder pain and did not respond to the treatment prescribed by an orthopedist. After the massive appearance on the posterior fossa on the cervical MRI, he was consulted to neurosurgery department and an operation was decided upon. Except a slight dizziness, neurological examination was normal. On the cranial MR, a 4.5 × 4 × 4 cm mainly cystic mass lesion on the midline of the cerebellar hemisphere was monitored and it had solid components at the center. The lesion was slightly compressing the fourth ventricle from the posterolateral side. Minimal edema was observed in the lesion periphery. After the intravenous contrast material injection, the solid component of the lesion showed a heterogenic enhancement on the T1-weighted image . Then it was decided to operate on the patient. In the operation, the mass lesion, which looks like hemangioblastoma, was found in the cerebellum cortex. The lesion was totally excised.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Histologically, the tumor had reasonable cellularity. It was formed by round cells. No apparent pleomorphic and mitotic activity was determined . On the cells that formed the tumor, there were perinuclear halos and small rosettes composed by the cells which were lined up around the granular neuropil. On the other sides of the tumor, on the fibrillary stroma, there were astrocytic fusiform cells. There was a focal vascular proliferation but no necrosis. Rosenthal fibrillary or eosinophilic granular corpuscle was not seen. Neuropil amids rosettes and the cells palisaded around it showed immune reactivity with synaptophysin. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was positive in the fibrillary component of the tumor . Negative immune reactivity epithelial membrane antigen was seen. Ki-67 index was low. With the histopathological and immunhistochemical findings, the case was diagnosed as RGNT, WHO grade 1.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

They grow up slowly and their recurrence rate is low 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Although it is stated that they are seen in the different locations of the brain, they are mostly seen in the fourth ventricle. They occur in the cerebellum, cerebellopontine angle, pineal gland, tectum, thalamus, third ventricle, optic chiasm and spinal cord 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 \\- 8 \\]</u>. Moreover, RGNT is especially seen in young women. However, some cases that are between 70 and 79 years old have been presented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Female to male ratio is 1.57:1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The most common symptoms are headache (59%), dizziness (13%), ataxia (26%), visual defect (17%) and vomiting (7%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The solid areas of RGNT show iso-hypointense signals on T1-weighted sequence and hyperintense signals on T2-weighted sequence on the MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Calcification is reported on 25% of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Histologically, biphasic development pattern which consisted of two different cells is observed. These cells are glial cells which are pilocytic astrocytic cells that create neurocytic rosette and perivascular rosette. The synaptophysin of neurocytic cells is positive; S-100 and GFAP are negative. NeuN is immunonegative or focal positive in rosette-forming cells. Glial cells are immunohistochemically GFAP and S-100 is positive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 11 \\]</u>. RGNT is a benign course tumor and when it is completely removed, the treatment is ensured. In addition, total resection may not be possible in the areas like cerebellum and brain stem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In the literature, four cases with recurrence have been presented and all of them were surgically treated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Total resection on three cases, and subtotal resection on one case were done. All cases were located at the fourth ventricle. The shortest recurrence was seen 9 months later while the longest recurrence was seen 120 months later 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. On the half of the patients, a postoperative neurological deficit was presented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Our patient was a 33-year-old male with a long-lasting headache complaint. On the MR examination, there was a solid and cystic tumoral mass located on the midline in the cerebellar hemisphere. In the first operation, the whole mass was removed and it was histopathologically diagnosed with RGNT, but no recurrence was observed 6 years postoperatively. In 6 - 8 months intervals, MRI screening was performed for controlling the patient’s treatment.\n\n【11】In conclusion, in differential diagnosis, RGNT must be taken into consideration in posterior fossa tumors of adults. Although it is a low-grade tumor, there are some cases with recurrence in the English-written literature so the follow-up of the patients is suggested. As the number of RGNT cases with long clinical follow-up increases, the treatment and clinical follow-up approaches may change.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:16:09", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:16:21", "cost": 12.129}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:58", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:16:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:16:08"}

It is an effective minimally invasive way to examine and sample tissue from the gastrointestinal tract. It has a low rate of complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>, with hemorrhage (1.8 - 2.5 percent) and perforation (0.34 - 2.14 percent) being the most common. These are more prevalent with therapeutic procedures such as polypectomy or dilatation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Extra-colonic or visceral complications include pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, mesenteric injury and colonic volvulus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Splenic rupture is an uncommon but potentially lethal complication. Not much documentation is found in the medical literature. For this publication a PubMed search was performed. It was reported by Wherry and Zhener in 1974 and so far less than 100 cases have been published 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. However, with the increasing use of colonoscopy endoscopists, surgeons and radiologist will more often encounter this complication.\n\n【3】The most likely mechanism of injury is that of traction on the spleen by way of pre-existing adhesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. This occurs during manipulation of the colon at the time of colonoscopy. Excessive spleno-colic adhesions, splenomegaly and other splenic pathology are therefore regarded as predisposing factors. Patients with a history of recent abdominal trauma are also at risk, as will be discussed below.\n\n【4】A delay in diagnosis has been noted in the literature, the main reason being the ignorance of many physicians regarding this potential negative outcome. Splenic rupture should be considered in all presentations of abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability after colonoscopy, especially with a history of past surgical interventions and therefore potential spleno-colic adhesions. Patients with recent abdominal trauma should be screened with appropriate investigation beforehand.\n\n【5】We present two cases of splenic injury secondary to colonoscopy. The first is a 61-year-old male that was involved in a high speed motor vehicle accident one month prior to colonoscopy. The second is a 45-year-old female with no significant past medical history. Both presented with abdominal pain and hypovolemic shock, a few hours after colonoscopy. Both warranted splenectomy as a lifesaving procedure.\n\n【6】Case Reports\n\n【7】Case 1\n\n【8】A fit 61-year-old male without significant medical history underwent colonoscopy as regular surveillance for a family history of bowel cancer. He had been involved in a high speed motor vehicle accident one month earlier, when his car had skid off the road into a tree. He self extricated, and did not suffer any major injuries. Paramedical staff attended to him and discharged him home in a stable condition. Persistent left sided chest pain was treated with simple analgesics.\n\n【9】The colonoscopy was uneventful, without difficulty, well tolerated and he was discharged home two hours post-procedure. Four hours post colonoscopy he developed abdominal pain, felt light headed and collapsed at home.\n\n【10】On admission to emergency department he was hypotensive (blood pressure 92/62, Hemoglobin 106 g/L). He complained of pain in the left shoulder (Kehr’s sign), had generalized abdominal pain and was acidotic (serum pH 7.2, lactate 3.43 mmol/L). Digital rectal examination and chest X-ray were normal . Resuscitation commenced with intravenous fluids and four units of packed red blood cells transfused. CT scan of the abdomen revealed a Grade III splenic hematoma with associated hemoperitoneum .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Unremarkable chest X ray. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. Hemoperitoneum with splenic hematoma. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【13】The patient underwent emergency laparotomy, at which 4.5 Litres of blood was removed from the abdominal cavity. A ruptured subscapular hematoma was present at the lower pole of the spleen. A splenectomy was performed, delivering a 91 gram spleen with histologically confirmed rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The patient made an uneventful recovery.\n\n【14】Case 2\n\n【15】A healthy 46-year-old female presented with left upper quadrant abdominal pain, radiating to the left shoulder. Six hours earlier, she had a colonoscopy for investigation of rectal bleeding and had a sigmoid polypectomy. On presentation the patient was hemodynamically unstable with pallor, diaphoresis, hypotension (blood pressure 84/58) and anaemia (Hemoglobin 107 g/L). Examination further revealed significant generalized abdominal tenderness with guarding in the left upper quadrant and a positive Kehr’s sign. A chest X-ray was normal without evidence of free intra-peritoneal air .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3. CXR showing no free air under the diaphragms. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【17】Despite active resuscitation with 2 litres of saline, the patient remained hypotensive and developed tachycardia (pulse 120 per minute). Due to her unstable condition and inability to lie supine due to severe pain, CT abdomen was deferred. The patient had a diagnostic laparoscopy with follow on exploratory laparotomy, all of these performed within 3 hours of her initial presentation. An hemoperitoneum with clot formation in the left upper quadrant was encountered; this was due to a laceration of the lower half of the spleen leading to eventual splenectomy. Apart from 2 litres of blood loss, no other significant findings were encountered. She required 5 units of packed red blood cells to maintain end organ and tissue perfusion. She was discharged home seven days post-operative with a stable hemoglobin. The histology revealed a full thickness 4.5 cm laceration in an 88.8 gram spleen, consistent with a Grade III splenic injury .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 4. Full thickness splenic laceration with capsule stripping. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】No definitive pathophysiology has been established to explain the reason for splenic injury following colonoscopy. One proposed mechanism referred to traction on the splenocolic ligament (or previously formed splenocolic adhesions) leading to an avulsion related injury of the spleen. Another mechanism could be direct contact splenic trauma due to colonoscopic manipulation within the bowel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 11 \\]</u>. The splenocolic adhesions are mostly found between the splenic angle of the colon and the spleen. It is suspected that these adhesions are stretched by the manipulation of the colon. Such can be “looping of the colonoscope” in the colon, a simple rotational manoeuvre to guide the colonoscope past the splenic and hepatic flexure, followed by gentle straightening of the scope. A forceful straightening may increase the tension on the splenocolic ligament, leading to tearing of blood vessels in the vicinity of inferior polar artery, without necessarily the ligament itself .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 5. Excessive downward stretching of the splenocolic ligament can induce a tear in the splenic capsule and severe hemorrhage (courtesy of Dr Drago Popovic, Hervey Bay Hospital, Australia). |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【22】Patients with previous abdominal surgery are at a proposed increased risk for splenic injury due to the possibility of splenocolic adhesions. This is more commonly encountered in females. A review by Saad et al gives the risk ratio for females to males as 3.2:1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Another important consideration is the past history of trauma in patients due for colonoscopy. In our first case report, citing a patient with abdominal trauma a short while before the procedure, subacute subcapsular splenic hematoma could have been present, thus leading to splenic capsular rupture with minimal colonoscopic manipulation. A history of recent trauma should hence be considered a contributing factor to splenic rupture in post-colonoscopy patients and needs to be elicited from the history.\n\n【24】The presence of Kehr’s sign in a hemodynamically unstable patient is a very important indicator of splenic rupture. Nausea, vomiting with hypovolemia and sudden onset of anaemia post-colonoscopy is often associated with splenic ruptures. With these clinical signs and in the absence of visible hemorrhage per rectum, a splenic injury should be suspected and therefore treated as an emergency. Review of the literature indicates that most of these signs do appear within the first 24 hours following the procedure.\n\n【25】A contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen is the test of choice for the evaluation of splenic injury and most frequently reported (in 60 percent of cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The sensitivity and specificity of the CT scan exceeded 95% in several reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Ultrasonography is used less frequently (in 10.9 percent). It is an excellent tool and should be considered in all patients with hemodynamic instability. It is also a part of the ATLS protocol of investigation. A few cases of angiography have been reported (1.8 percent).\n\n【27】Diagnostic laparoscopy has been used in 23.6 percent of patient. This is especially significant in an hemodynamically unstable patient that requires a surgical exploration rather than a CT scan.\n\n【28】In the literature reviewed, splenectomy was the most commonly performed (67.9 percent), followed by conservative treatment (28.30 percent). One publication reported spleen rupture treated with arterial embolisation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】Spleen rupture is a rare complication of the colonoscopy. Mild discomfort is common even hours after colonoscopy, but significant abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability following the intervention should warrant a high index of suspicion for splenic injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.This is especially true for patients with previous surgical interventions causing potential splenocolic adhesions and for patients with previous history of abdominal trauma.\n\n【31】The significant sign of referred pain to the left shoulder tip as a result of diaphragmatic irritation can be present in up to 88 percent of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Although sensitive, it not very specific, as gas distension alone may cause this in 50 percent of patients post uncomplicated colonoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. The presence of hemodynamic compromise however, makes it very specific for splenic injury.\n\n【32】CT scan is regarded as the best diagnostic modality and an appreciable help for choosing the best treatment option. The severity of injury will determine whether management should be non operative or splenectomy.\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Competing Interests</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors’ Contributions</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DP initiated the case series.

Here, we report a case of Listeria brain abscess with intraventricular rupture causing ventriculitis and hydrocephalus in a 61-year-old man with crescentic glomerulonephritis that progressed to chronic kidney disease.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 61-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital because of intermittent fever, shaking chills, and progressive lethargy since the past 4 days. He had developed bloody stools 4 days before admission owing to consumption of a substantial amount of refrigerated foods several days before disease onset. Two years ago, he had biopsy-proven crescentic glomerulonephritis that progressed to chronic kidney disease stage V, requiring hemodialysis. The patient discontinued dialysis after 8 months because his renal function improved with methylprednisolone pulse therapy and maintenance therapy with 20 mg prednisolone/day. Approximately 12 h after arrival, the patient developed shaking chills and high fever (38.7 °C) again. Two sets of blood samples were collected. Initial physical examination was noncontributory. His initial laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell (WBC) count, 13,400/mm <sup>3 </sup> ) with neutrophil predominance (neutrophils, 93%; lymphocytes, 4%; and monocytes, 3%), low hemoglobin level (8.7 g/dL), and impaired renal function (blood urea nitrogen, 147 mg/dL and creatinine, 5.0 mg/dL). His chest radiograph was unremarkable. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed superficial gastritis with no signs of recent bleeding. Sigmoidoscopy up to 15 cm was normal. The fever subsided after the administration of an antipyretic, and the patient was referred to the Gastroenterology clinic from the emergency department on the same day.\n\n【6】Three days later, he was re-admitted to the emergency department because of fever (38.3 °C), chills, and lethargy. Because L. monocytogenes was isolated from the 2 sets of blood cultures collected during his first visit, ampicillin with renal dose adjustment (2 g every 12 h) plus gentamicin (60 mg every 24 h) were administered parenterally, and the patient was then admitted to the medical ward.\n\n【7】On arrival, his blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature were 183/90 mmHg, 100 beats/min, 20 breaths/min, and 37.8 °C, respectively. His conjunctivae were pale with anicteric sclera. His neck was supple without jugular venous engorgement, bruits, or lymphadenopathy. He had a regular heart rate without murmur. Lung auscultation revealed no wheezing or rales. His abdomen was soft with normal active bowel sounds, while the liver and spleen were not palpable. On neurological examination, he was alert and well oriented. His higher cortical function and cranial nerve and motor system examination were normal. Deep tendon reflexes were equal and plantar reflexes were flexor. Sensory examination and coordination were normal as well.\n\n【8】The next morning, however, our patient went into a coma. Brain computed tomography (CT) without contrast revealed a hypodensity with perifocal edema in the left frontal lobe, a communicating hydrocephalus with pressure, and fluid-fluid levels in the dependent portion of the occipital horns . Brain abscess with intraventricular rupture causing ventriculitis and hydrocephalus was highly suspected. Urgent external ventricular drainage was recommended by emergent neurosurgery consultation, owing to a rapid decline in the patient’s mental status. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was found to be slightly turbid in appearance and under high pressure during surgery. Ventricular CSF analysis revealed pleocytosis (WBC count, 115 cells/mL) with neutrophil predominance (neutrophils, 78%; lymphocytes, 22%) and red blood cells (622 cells/mL). The CSF protein concentration was elevated (321 mg/dL; reference range 10 - 45 mg/dL), and the CSF glucose concentration was 55 mg/dL (simultaneous blood glucose level was 204 mg/dL). CSF gram staining and cultures were negative. On day 3 after admission, our patient’s blood pressure dropped and despite management, his condition continued to deteriorate and he eventually died on day 4.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

However, his electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation and the chest X-ray revealed a right lower lung field shadow. A transthoracic echocardiogram was arranged and a large tumor was pictured in the left atrium (39.7 × 36.4 mm diameter), attached to its posterior wall . Transesophageal echocardiograph confirmed a dilated left atrium with an immobile mass in the cavity, without any signs of left atrial outflow obstruction .

Impairment of cardiac function occurs in approximately 30% of patients and is usually attributable to pericardial effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In literature a highly variable incidence of cardiac metastases is reported, ranging from 2.3% and 18.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 12 \\]</u>. Shortness of breath is prominent in the clinical presentation, often out of proportion to the radiographic findings, and may be attributed to a pericardial effusion or an associated pleural effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Presenting complaints also include cough, anterior thoracic pain, pleuritic chest pain, or peripheral edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. Arrhythmias in patients with cardiac metastases is usually the result of concomitant factors such as hypoxemia, electrolyte imbalance, or anemia; however, arrhythmia can be secondary to tumors involving autonomic fibers or encroaching on the coronary arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Overall, arrhythmia is the most prevalent manifestation of myocardial involvement by metastatic tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 18 \\]</u>. The occurrence of arrhythmia without an obvious trigger in a patient with known malignancy suggests the possibility of metastatic myocardial involvement. The type of arrhythmia depends on the size of the tumor and its location relative to the conduction system of the heart. In our patient, palpitation revealed persistent atrial fibrillation, while transthoracic, transesophageal echocardiograph, CT scanning and bronchoscopic study confirmed the diagnosis of a primary lung squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n【9】Lung carcinoma is postulated to metastasize to the heart most often by direct invasion, followed by lymphatic and hematogenous spread. The right side of the heart is more frequently involved by metastatic lesions than the left side. In this case, the most likely culprit is hematogenous spread as cancer cells had direct access through the right lower pulmonary vein to the left atrium.\n\n【10】Differential diagnosis of intracavitary mass lesions includes benign and malignant primary cardiac tumors like myxoma, and various other space occupying lesions in the form of thrombus, vegetations and foreign bodies. Infectious and non-bacterial thrombotic or marantic endocarditis can also present with similar findings. It is important for admitting physicians to bear in mind that intramural metastases should be considered in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction and pericardial metastases in the differential diagnosis of pericardial effusion.\n\n【11】Imaging studies valuable to establish the diagnosis include (2D, 3D) transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>, CT scan, MR imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> and angiography. Still, metastatic cardiac lesions, most of which are clinically silent, are often only found post-mortem. Other possible complications include peripheral embolism and sudden outflow tract obstruction. Sadly, the prognosis is poor if the patient is unresponsive to chemotherapy.\n\n【12】Conclusions\n\n【13】Real time 2D and 3D transthoraric echocardiography is a low cost, readily accessible, reproducible, non ionizing radiation and non-invasive technique that provides an indispensable tool for the diagnosis of cardiac tumors. In addition, 2D and 3D transesophageal echocardiography can frequently provide essential supplementary information, obviating the need for further expensive and time consuming imaging tests.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There was no financial relationship between the authors and the subject matter.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 09:37:25", "endTime": "2024/09/19 09:38:34", "cost": 68.499}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:58", "update_time": "2024-09-18 17:38:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 17:37:23"}

Most patients with GIST develop secondary resistance mutations in KIT leading to progressive disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In addition, the TKI therapy may be able to work more effectively given a reduction in the tumor burden, and it is recommended that these patients undergoing resection of metastatic disease should resume TKI therapy indefinitely.\n\n【5】Described in this case is a malignant GIST with peritoneal carcinomatosis refractory to imatinib and sunitinib that was treated with a therapeutic debulking procedure. This is reported to show a survival rate of a patient with stage IV malignant GIST after a therapeutic debulking procedure.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 52-year-old African American male with a past medical history of anemia of chronic disease and GIST diagnosed 2 years prior presented to the emergency department complaining of progressive diffuse sharp abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea, increasing weakness and fatigue for 1 week. He had a debulking partial gastrectomy 2 years prior to presentation. He was taking imatinib, which was recently switched to sunitinib. On clinical examination his abdomen had a midline abdominal scar, soft, moderate abdominal distention, moderately diffuse tenderness in all four quadrants, and mild ascites.\n\n【8】The abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) with contrast was compared to a recent test performed 1 month prior, which found severe metastatic disease to the liver with carcinomatosis and hepatomegaly showing mass effect on the intrahepatic vasculature and the left hepatic lobe. In addition, multiple dilated loops of small bowel without a discrete transition point suggested an ileus or early/partial small bowel obstruction .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Computed tomography (CT) scan showing extensive carcinomatosis with multiple bulky necrotic masses. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【11】The patient was admitted, and his symptoms continued to progress, including firm abdominal distension, and guarding on physical exam. The patient’s cancer pathology confirmed the diagnosis as ultra-high-risk disease in the setting of c-kit positive, (PDGFRA) negative, DOG 1+ and high mitotic activity with six mitoses per high-power field.\n\n【12】During the admission, the patient’s symptoms worsened. Progressive mass effect due to growing tumor caused restrictive lung disease and a small bowel obstruction. Intractable pain, diffuse GIST, failure to thrive and a severely distended abdomen led to an exploratory laparotomy on day 15.\n\n【13】The exploratory laparotomy displayed a tumor that was adhered to multiple viscera. The tumor had grown in the liver, stomach, duodenum and the center of the abdominal cavity over the small bowel. There were multiple nodules palpated within the liver and the mesentery at its root. In total a resection of three intra-abdominal masses (colon, abdominal wall, and mesentery), a subtotal colectomy, an appendectomy, and an end ileostomy was performed. The resected tumor specimens were well-circumscribed and well vascularized.\n\n【14】On postoperative day (POD) 16 regorafinib (Stivarga) 160 mg was initiated. At this point the patient’s abdominal girth had significantly decreased. He was able to tolerate an oral diet without nausea, vomiting or significant abdominal pain. The patient had a functioning ostomy postoperative and was no longer obstructed. He was able to walk around, sit up and lay in bed comfortably with a less distended abdomen. He was discharged to subacute rehab on enteral diet.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Imatinib was discovered in the mid-1990s to inhibit tyrosine kinase receptors C-KIT and PDGFR. It was originally used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia, and it was not used for GIST until 1998, when Hirota et al discovered that GIST could be caused by C-KIT mutation in tyrosine kinase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Today imatinib is still used as the first line treatment for GIST. If the patient is resistant and has progressive disease, sunitinib can be used. If the disease continues to progress, as it did for our patient, regorafenib can be used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Regorafinib inhibits kinase receptors involved in neoplastic angiogenesis (VEGFR1-3, TEK) and neoplastic stroma (PDGFR and FGFR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Surgery is another treatment option for GIST that has been found to be successful in several cases. A study performed at Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital evaluated 200 patients with GIST who underwent resection. The overall survival rate was 35% at 5 years in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, it is important to note that 93 patients had primary disease and 86% of them underwent a complete resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The results in this report were comparable to a study performed by Ng et al, which evaluated 191 patients and found a 28% survival at 5 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. A surgical goal of partial resection should only be used to relieve palliative symptoms such as bleeding, pain or mass effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In our patient, the GIST had metastasized throughout the abdomen and progressed to peritoneal carcinomatosis. Therefore, a debulking procedure was performed for palliative therapy secondary to mass effect.\n\n【18】Other research reports found a significant difference in overall survival between patients with partial response, stable disease and progressive disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients with partial response and stable disease both had significantly longer overall survival than that of the group with progressive disease, with a 2-year survival of 100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. However, overall, the data provided in this study showed evidence that resection of metastatic GIST after TKI therapy is associated with a longer median overall survival compared with the nonsurgical cohort 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients with advanced GIST who have a response to treatment had benefited from a debulking palliative surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In the case presented, the patient was more responsive to pharmacological therapy after the debulking procedure. This could have been due to the post-surgical reduction in the tumor burden.\n\n【19】Raut et al looked at patients with advanced GIST and noted that there was a prolonged overall survival after debulking procedures in these patients with stable disease or limited progression on kinase inhibitor therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. This report evaluated patients presenting with generalized progression of their disease and recorded that all patients died within 12 months of the debulking procedure. Patients with limited disease progression and generalized disease progression had a median time to death of 29.8 months and 5.6 months, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. This study found that debulking procedures prolonged overall survival in certain patients depending on their disease progression.\n\n【20】Other studies found similar data supporting a debulking procedure in cases of advanced GIST. Rubio-Casadevall et al found a longer median survival in patients with advanced GIST who were responsive to imatinib therapy and underwent surgical excision of residual lesions compared to patients who received imatinib therapy alone (87.6 months versus 59.9 months) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】Overall, a debulking procedure can be effective in prolonging overall survival rate for patients with GIST who have limited progression or advanced GIST that shows response to treatment. These surgeries may also be helpful for cases of advanced GIST when used as palliative therapy, similar to our patient.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The manuscript has been de-identified.

Malignant transformation of adenomyosis has been recognized similar pathway of them. Type I, characterized by ER-positiveness, accounts for the majority of endometrial cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Type II, consisting of rare cases and negative for ER and PR, is characterized by poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. We report here an autopsy case of type II endometrial carcinoma arising from adenomyosis.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 36-year-old premenopausal woman with a 4-year history of adenomyosis, gravida 0, para 0, presenting with continued low abdominal pain, visited a local clinic. Ultrasound scans revealed multiple tumors in the pelvic cavity. On referral to our hospital, biopsy of endometrium was done, which revealed almost normal glandular cells (negative). MRI revealed multiple tumors in uterine myometrium and omentum. The tumors were enhanced on T1-weighted imaging, and uterine sarcoma was suspected. The endometrium, without enhancement, was 6 mm in thickness. Liver and bone metastasis was confirmed by CT . Serum levels of CEA and CA125 were elevated to 695.3 U/mL and 300.0 U/mL, respectively. The patient underwent hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and pelvic lymphadenectomy. The uterus was child-head sized and multiple disseminations in omentum, peritoneal cavity, and adnexa were seen . The cut surface of the uterus was white to yellow-white in color. Necrosis and hemorrhage were observed. Histopathological examination revealed grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation. But the lesion was located only in the muscle layer of the uterus and the endometrium was no tumorous change. Cancer nests adjacent to the adenomyotic foci were observed. Tumor cells stained positively for p53, but did not express either ER or PR . We diagnosed the case as a stage 4B endometrioid adenocarcinoma originating from adenomyosis, following the staging of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics  2008. Its postoperative classification was pT3aN1M1.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. CT revealed multiple lung (a) and liver metastasis (b). MRI of the pelvis before admission.

Immunohistochemical examination: tumor cells stained positively for p53 (g), but did not express either ER (e) or PR (f). |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【7】Opting against adjuvant therapy, the patient died 16 days later from rapid enlargement and rupture of the metastasized liver and respiratory failure. An autopsy confirmed the mass lesions in the pelvic cavity and also compressed small intestines, which caused ileus. Bone metastasis, multiple lymph node metastases including para-aortic, and lung metastases were also diagnosed. Multiple liver metastases caused biliary obstruction and hepatic failure. Multiple thromboses and hemorrhaging in both lungs with the hypercoagulable condition led to respiratory failure. Histology of the pelvic mass lesion revealed mainly poorly differentiated carcinoma. The tumor cells contained bizarre nuclei and exhibited high mitotic activity. Benign endometriosis lesions were not present in pelvic cavity.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Adenomyosis is a common gynecological disease, which is characterized by the presence of ectopic endometrial glands and stroma located within the myometrium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Several pathological theories have been proposed: epithelial-mesenchymal transition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>, metaplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, Mullerian rests 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, reaction (injury and regeneration of tissue) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>, and multipotential perivascular theory 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. The etiology and pathogenesis of adenomyosis remain undecided. There have been 44 reported cases of adenocarcinoma developing within adenomyosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Most of the patients were postmenopausal. Malignant transformation of adenomyosis in premenopausal women with normal endometrium is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Sampson’s or Colman’s criteria for the diagnosis of carcinoma arising from adenomyosis are as follows: 1) the carcinoma must not be situated in the endometrium or elsewhere in the pelvis; 2) the carcinoma must be seen to arise from the epithelium of adenomyosis and not to have invaded from other source; and 3) endometrial (adenomyotic) stromal cells should be surrounding the aberrant glands to support the diagnosis of adenomyosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Histological subtypes of the tumors are endometrioid and, to a lesser degree, serous, clear cell and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 15 \\]</u>. Two types of endometrial carcinoma, type I and type II, have been described on the basis of clinicopathological and genetic studies. In most cases with malignant transformation of adenomyosis, different stages of atypical or hyperplastic changes are simultaneously identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This observation points to a similar pathway of carcinogenesis in adenomyosis as is known in estrogen-responsive endometrial cancer type I 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】In general, malignant transformation of adenomyosis is positive for ER, PR, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), CA125 and focally weak-positive for aromatase. Hormonal receptor expression is associated with low-grade and early-stage tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Kucera et al, having researched the clinical data of 219 patients with the diagnosis of early endometrial cancer, reported that adenomyosis was found in 88 of them and malignant changes in adenomyosis were present in six (6.8%) of those 88 patients. All those six cases were with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, of which five were well or moderately differentiated. They suggested that there is a similar pathway of carcinogenesis in adenomyosis in that it is positive for ER (type I endometrial cancer) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. By contrast, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells stained positively for p53 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, but did not express either ER or PR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 10 \\]</u>. This has led to the proposal that some cases with malignant transformation of adenomyosis develop de novo . Koshiyama et al reported only four cases of type II carcinomas in 564 patients (0.74%) operated on between 1981 and 2001 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Three of the four cases reported (grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, clear-cell adenocarcinoma, and serous adenocarcinoma) were of histologically unfavorable subtype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】It is usually difficult to make a diagnosis of type II endometrioid adenocarcinoma; a delay is often caused because of the absence of lesion in nomotopic endometrium. According to the review of Boes et al, in almost all the cases where endometrial cytology was performed, the result was negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. It is usually until after the tumor has grown so much as to involve the endometrium, causing abnormal uterine bleeding or spreading outside of the uterus, a correct diagnosis is made 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. The management of this clinical entity consists of surgery and chemotherapy.\n\n【13】In our own case, there was a past history of adenomyosis for 4 years. The tumor must have originated from adenomyosis because the carcinoma located only in the muscle layer of the uterus and apart from the endometrium. The endometrium was intact and cancer nests adjacent to the adenomyotic foci were observed. There is no hyperplastic or atypical changes between cancer nests and adenomyotic foci. The tumor had rapidly grown and affected many organs, killing the patient at 3 months after the appearance of a symptom.\n\n【14】Conclusions\n\n【15】Malignant transformation of adenomyosis in premenopausal women is extremely rare, and the details remain unclear including the convalescence. The case we encountered was a high-potential malignant tumor: the tumor rapidly grew and infiltrated multiple organs in a short period, suggesting it was a type II carcinoma with biologically aggressive behavior.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgement</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Kensuke Tokaichi for the editorial language.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:21:59", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:22:14", "cost": 15.134}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:58", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:22:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:21:59"}

Rudimentary horn pregnancy usually ruptured in 90% of cases during the second trimester with fetal demise, and cases of pregnancy progressing to the third trimester resulted in a live birth after cesarean section has been documented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】The 26-year-old lady, gravida 2, para 1, one male living, known to have hypothyroidism on L-thyroxine 100 mg daily, presented to our outpatient clinic referred from district hospital after failure to terminate her missed miscarriage which was estimated to be 22 weeks of gestation. She was booked at that hospital with ultrasound scans which showed healthy pregnancy till the time of loosing fetal heart activity, she was unknown to have a unicornuate uterus although she underwent previously a c-section because of breech presentation, and it was not mentioned to be seen during the current pregnancy scans that she had any uterine abnormality. They used in total 20 T-misoprostol 50 μg in addition to intra-uterine Foleys catheter. At presentation, she looked well, and her vital signs were stable, BP 115/75, PR 85 bpm, afebrile. She was admitted to the ward after being scanned and confirmed that she had missed miscarriage, and the measurement of fetal BPD and FL showed 19 weeks gestation. It was missed that she had a pregnancy in a rudimentary horn. Trial of termination using misoprostol 50 μg in addition to intrauterine Foleys catheter was done, the other day, patient had mild lower abdominal pain, an ultrasound scan by a consultant raised the suspicion of extrauterine pregnancy with presence of some free fluid and clot free in the abdominal cavity, but the patient was still clinically stable with drop in her Hb by 1 g/dL, so laparotomy was decided upon her, as with stable clinical condition confirmatory MRI was done before surgery . During laparotomy there was clot free blood in the abdominal cavity, intact pregnancy of rudimentary horn with perforated corneal side of unicornuate uterus resulting from the intrauterine catheter , surrounded by hematoma at the site of perforation but no active bleeding. Evacuation of the clots and blood, incision was made in rudimentary horn and fetus was taken out , then excision of rudimentary horn with its contents and finally suturing of the ruptured unicornuate uterus was performed, free drain was inserted.

The estimated incidence of pregnancy in the rudimentary horn is estimated at 1 per 100,000 to 140,000 pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Transperitoneal migration of the sperm or the fertilized ovum resulted in the pregnancy in a non-communicating rudimentary horn 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Poor distensibility of the myometrium, dysfunctional endometrium and the variability in the thickness of the musculature of the rudimentary horn lead to rupture which is usually seen in the second trimester and can lead to life threatening condition for the mother resulting from hemoperitonium and shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Maternal mortality rate was reported to be 47.6% before 1900. Although rupture of the horn is still common, there is no reported maternal death since 1960 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Decreased blood supply and defective endometrium lead to missed miscarriage or intrauterine death in some cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, same as happened with our case.\n\n【12】The key to successful management of rudimentary horn pregnancy is the early diagnosis. The following criteria for ultrasonographic diagnosis were proposed by Tsafrir et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>: a pseudo pattern of an asymmetrical bicornuate uterus, absent visual continuity tissue surrounding the gestational sac and the uterine cervix, and the presence of myometrial tissue surrounding the gestational sac. The sensitivity of ultrasound is only 26% and decreases as the pregnancy advances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and can be missed in inexperienced hands as in our patient. An MRI examination has proven to be a useful tool for the diagnosis as well as for the choice of surgical approaches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Unfortunately, our case was misdiagnosed initially as an intrauterine missed miscarriage, ultrasound by experienced consultant raised the suspicion of the diagnosis in addition to MRI, but definitive findings were revealed after exploration. Occasional cases (gynecologic and obstetric) that required further evaluation because of confusion in the diagnosis have been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. Intrauterine fetal demise was a diagnosis of rudimentary horn pregnancy reported by Buntungu et al where induction with misoprostol failed leading to the suspicion of ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Surgical removal of rudimentary horn is the primary strategy of management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Dicker et al made early diagnosis and removed a small rudimentary horn through the suprapubic laparoscopic port 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Successful medical management by methotrexate at an early gestation was reported by Edelman et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Rudimentary horn pregnancy should be considered as a differential diagnosis to bicornuate intrauterine pregnancy, and early detection and management should be done. Ultrasound examination should include renal system due to strong association between uterine anomalies with renal anomalies.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:52:55", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:53:10", "cost": 14.807}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:58", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:53:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:52:54"}

The impacted teeth are known as the teeth which cease to erupt before emergence to the oral cavity. Insufficient space, early loss of primary teeth with eventual closure of space, crowding of arches and rotation of tooth buds are the common and important reasons attributed to delayed eruption. Excessive fibrous tissue over an erupting tooth is also one of the most common causes, with eruption cysts being relatively rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Complete lack of eruptive force can be the reason for unerupted tooth when the normal number of teeth is present radiographically, although this is debatable, since few workers have debunked this claim 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.

The patient had multiple impacted permanent teeth with only the permanent maxillary central and lateral incisors, mandibular central and lateral incisors, right maxillary second molar and second premolar, left maxillary second premolar, and mandibular first molars are present. The incisal length of the maxillary central incisors appeared reduced, reduced vertical dimension of occlusion, pseudo class III malocclusion and the patient had a deep palatal vault.

Multiple impactions are seen rarely and are usually associated with systemic conditions. Guided eruption of many teeth with the help of coordinated multidisciplinary management is needed for patients with multiple impactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】There are numerous eruption-regulating molecules having similar and overlapping functions, which ensure that even the absence of a single factor does not interrupt the event of eruption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. But defect in some genes may be responsible for this condition. EGF, EGF-R, CSF-1, CSF-1R, IL-1, IL-1R, c-Fos, NFB, MCP-1, TGF-β1, PTHrP, Cbfa-l (now called Runx2), OPG, and RANK/RANKL are the major tooth eruption molecules. Stellate reticulum is the site for few molecules with the majority of the eruption molecules residing in the dental follicle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】While most eruption defects are part of a genetic syndrome, they can also be non-familial, as in the case in primary failure of eruption (PFE). In PFE localized failure of eruption of permanent teeth exists with no other systemic involvement.\n\n【15】Hence, it is likely that genes like CSF-1, NFB, and c-fos are the genes responsible for the eruption defect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The causes of tooth impaction are divided into generalized and localized. Cleidocranial dysplasia is the most common syndromal cause of tooth impaction. Common reasons like lack of space, prolonged retention or early loss of deciduous tooth, abnormal position of tooth bud, presence of alveolar cleft, ankylosis, cystic or neoplastic formation, alveolar or dental trauma, and dilacerations of teeth falling into the localized category 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Multiple impacted teeth are usually present in syndromes. The differential diagnoses in case of syndromes are cleidocranial dysostosis, Gardner’s syndrome, Gorlin-Sedano syndrome, and Yunis-Varon Syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】In the case of cleidocranial dysplasia the patients usually exhibit high-arched palate with prolonged retention of the deciduous teeth leading to subsequent delay in eruption of the permanent teeth. Though both the intraoral features were present in our case, the abnormalities of skull and shoulder girdle along with multiple supernumerary impacted teeth were absent. Gardner’s syndrome that also presents with multiple impacted teeth was ruled out as associated signs like multiple epidermoid cysts and other lesions were absent. Gorlin-Sedano syndrome represents as short hands, foot bones with short and straight collar bone along with multiple impacted teeth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Features of Yunis-Varon syndrome are agenesis or hypoplasia of clavicle, severe micrognathia, digital anomalies, hypodontia, spinal defects, and impacted teeth. Both the syndromes presented with multiple impacted teeth but were ruled out from our case as other symptoms were not present.\n\n【19】In the case of hormonal disorders, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, and pseudohypoparathyroidism are to be considered.\n\n【20】Estimation of T3, T4, and TSH is required for diagnosing hypothyroidism where there is low serum T4 and elevated TSH. Evaluation of total serum calcium concentration and serum parathyroid hormone is required for hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism. There is decrease of serum calcium in both and elevation of parathyroid hormone in pseudohypoparathyroidism and decrease of hormone in hypoparathyroidism.\n\n【21】Metabolic disorders like Vitamin D deficiency rickets are also associated with impacted teeth. In our case, further investigations were needed to rule out metabolic and hormonal disorders. Failure of eruption could also be due to crowding of supernumerary teeth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, but that was not observed in our case.\n\n【22】Dental history and radiographic examination in this case ruled out partial anodontia. The medical and family histories along with extraoral examination were not suggestive of any syndrome or metabolic disorder.\n\n【23】Only a few cases of non-syndrome multiple impacted teeth were reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 13 \\]</u>. In those studies the predominant explanation was that some physical barrier led to impaction and non-eruption of teeth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Duration and results of treatment in less frequent cases of multiple impactions is a major concern when compared to more frequent single tooth impaction cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Multidisciplinary approach would be the appropriate choice as treatment involves aesthetics, functional, and oral health problems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. In case of multiple impacted teeth, orthodontic extrusion may be attempted. In view of the pathological potential of the impacted teeth, surgical removal is recommended. Rehabilitation of the patient with fixed dentures needs to be planned with the help of a prosthodontist and implantologist. Obtaining stable results along with enhanced esthetics, oral health, and function would be the objective of the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank King Saud Medical City, for providing us with the necessary tools and methods to succeed in documenting the case fully with no restrictions.

Intestinal BD, which is a specific subtype of BD with gastrointestinal (GI) involvement, accounts for approximately 3-16% of BD cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. BD that is associated with bone marrow failure, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and anaplastic anemia, frequently has GI involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Moreover, concomitant trisomy 8 reportedly accounted for 54-86% of cases with BD with bone marrow failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Conventionally, the pharmacological treatments of BD include 5-aminosalicylic acid, systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, such as thiopurines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\- 9 \\]</u>. However, many patients fail to respond to these treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Patients with intestinal BD have been demonstrated to respond effectively and safely to adalimumab and infliximab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>, but most of them who associated MDS and concomitant trisomy 8 have experienced refractoriness to conventional treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. For these intractable cases, adalimumab and azacytidine were reportedly effective as treatment for the MDS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>. However, no information is currently available regarding the achievement of complete remission with mesalazine for intestinal BD associated with MDS and concomitant trisomy 8. Herein we reported a case of intestinal BD achieving complete remission with mesalazine. Differentiating MDS with positivity for trisomy 8 from drug-induced MDS by examination of the bone marrow and the cytogenetic changes is indispensable. Intestinal BD patients who develop pancytopenia would probably need sufficient doses of mesalazine for treatment.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】The patient was a 39-year-old man who was referred to our hospital because of ileocecal ulcer, moderate right lower abdominal pain and pancytopenia. He was diagnosed as psoriatic arthritis 2 years ago because of pain, stiffness and, swelling of a few joints including the knees and ankles. Combination therapy with adalimumab and methotrexate was started, but it had to be discontinued because of the emergence of pancytopenia after 1 year; at that time, he was also diagnosed as acne vulgaris. The patient had no history of genital ulceration and uveitis. Physical findings revealed recurrent oral ulcerations and acneiform eruptions on his body with slight pallor but without fever. Laboratory investigations showed: white blood cell count, 1,700/μL; red blood cell count, 339 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> /μL; hemoglobin, 10.0 g/dL; platelet count, 3.3 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> /μL; myelocyte, 4%; metamyelocyte, 2%; total protein, 7.1 g/dL; albumin, 4.0 mg/dL; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 272 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 12 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 9 IU/L; immunoglobulin (Ig) G, 1,208 mg/dL; IgA, 155 mg/dL; IgM, 125 mg/dL; CH 50, 75 U/L; and C-reactive protein, 5.8 mg/dL. Pancytopenia with a left shift was seen. Human leukocyte antigens B51 and B27 were positive. Negative results were obtained from tests for -β-D-glucan, QuantiFERON and cytomegalovirus antigenemia C-7HRP . Colonoscopy and pathologic examination of biopsy specimen from the ulcer  showed the moderate inflammatory infiltrates composed of neutrophils and mononuclear cells and necrosis in the submucosa and regenerative epithelia. According to diagnostic criteria defined by the BD Research Committee of Japan, the patient was diagnosed as intestinal BD, incomplete-type, based on the presence of two major features of recurrent oral ulceration and typical skin lesions, and two minor features of arthritis without deformity and ileocecal ulcer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. For the treatment of the ileocecal ulcer from intestinal BD, mesalazine at 3,000 mg daily was immediately started. Four months later, colonoscopy showed an ulcer scar at the ileocecal valve.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1.

Cytogenetic analysis exhibited 47,XY,dup通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>(q21q32), idem+8 . Based on these findings, a definite diagnosis of intestinal BD, incomplete-type, associated with MDS and positivity for trisomy 8, was finally confirmed. After healing of the ileocecal ulcer was achieved, two cycles of azacytidine were administered and, subsequently bone marrow transplantation was performed. The patient has done well with continuous ulcer healing at the ileocecal valve for a year.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. Cytogenetic finding.

Treatment-induced immunosuppression has been suspected to increase the risk of malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. In the present case, the combination therapy of adalimumab and methotrexate for psoriatic arthritis was discontinued when pancytopenia was detected because of the possibility of developing adverse events such as hematological malignancies. Indeed, monotherapy with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α antagonists or methotrexate is known to increase the risk for melanomatous and non-melanomatous skin cancers, but its risk for hematological disorders, such as MDS and lymphoproliferative diseases, is not clear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis on patients who were given immunosuppressive therapy for immuno-mediated diseases after a prior malignancy showed that the incidence rates of new primary cancer (i.e. skin cancer, melanoma, hematological malignancy, breast and solid cancers) were not significantly different among patients who did not receive immunosuppression, those who receive anti-TNF-α antagonists and those who received conventional immunosuppression with thiopurines and methotrexate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. In addition, accumulated data did not show evidence that anti-TNF-α antagonists or conventional immunosuppression induced chromosomal duplications and trisomy. Analysis of 39 cases of BD associated with MDS has demonstrated the presence of the trisomy 8 allele in 6.5-16.3% of patients with primary MDS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 21 \\]</u>. In addition, trisomy 8 in MDS cases complicated with BD is a very common chromosomal abnormality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Interestingly, dup通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>(q21q32) as a sole cytogenetic event was reportedly associated with a leukemic transformation in MDS, and trisomy 8 was likely to be secondary to this chromosomal duplication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. This suggested that the presence of dup通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>(q21q32) may be a triggering factor for trisomy 8. Based on the above, development of MDS upon the emergence of pancytopenia was expected. The GI involvement in patients with intestinal BD associated with MDS with positivity for trisomy 8 is generally refractory to conventional medical therapies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Anti-TNF-α antagonists, azacytidine and bone marrow transplantation have been reported to be effective for these intractable cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\- 15 \\]</u>. However, in the present case, the GI involvement successfully responded to mesalazine at 3,000 mg. To our best knowledge, this was the first case of mesalazine therapy for a patient with intestinal BD associated with MDS and positivity for trisomy 8. Further study on a larger number of patients is necessary to validate the predictive factors of response to treatment, including mesalazine, anti-TNF-α antagonists and azacytidine.\n\n【14】In conclusion, upon the emergence of pancytopenia in patients with intestinal BD, examining the bone marrow and the cytogenetic changes to differentiate episodic MDS with positivity for trisomy 8 from drug-induced MDS is needed; moreover, treatment with sufficient doses of mesalazine might be helpful.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HLA: human leukocyte antigen; BD: Behcet’s disease; MDS: myelodysplastic syndrome; GI: gastrointestinal; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; Ig: immunoglobulin</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:17:49", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:18:08", "cost": 18.482}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:18:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:17:48"}

Since it is a rare condition, it is generally reported as sporadic cases, most of which have been in children. Its significance is that it frequently presents as a case of ‘intestinal obstruction of unknown origin’. We, herewith, reviewed such a case of acutely obstructing interparietal hernia in an adult.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 30-year-old male had applied to another center with complaints of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and constipation, all of which were lasting for three days. The abdominal ultrasound (US) had demonstrated a mass pressing on the urinary bladder, which was thought to be a tumor originating from the bladder itself or from neighboring intra-abdominal structures. However, the cystoscopy had been normal, and revealed no signs of neoplasm or calculus. During his follow-up, the pain had become more intense, and physical examination showed signs of acute abdomen. The patient was referred to our department. At physical examination of the patient after admission, we detected abdominal distension with muscular guarding and rebound tenderness in all quadrants. The bowel sounds were hypoactive. His laboratory tests were as follows: hemoglobin 12.7 g/mm <sup>3 </sup> , hematocrit 36.4%, leukocyte 11,800/mm <sup>3 </sup> , platelets 194,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> , Na 135 mEq/L, K 3.8 mEq/L, Cl 102 mEq/L. His liver function tests were normal. We performed an abdominal US, which demonstrated distended intestinal loops in the abdomen, and a mass of edematous intestines located in the lower right iliac fossa. The computed tomography of the abdomen defined distended jejunal loops, and helical torsion of ileal segments located in the rectovesical fossa. The cecum and the rest of colon were normal in size. The characteristic helical torsion of ileum was interpreted as a sign of internal herniation, however its cause remained unclear .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Preoperative CT of the patient depicted edematous small bowel loops encased in a sac. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【5】The patient undertook emergency operation with a diagnosis of acute abdomen and incarcerated intra-abdominal herniation of unknown origin. Through a lower midline incision we explored the abdominal cavity. We found that a thirty-centimeter loop of ileum, about 80 cm proximal from the ileocecal valve, was incarcerated in a peritoneal recession in the anterior parietal peritoneum. The peritoneal sac enveloping the edematous intestine was located in the retromuscular space posterior to the right rectus muscle. The level of herniation was at about one-third ofthe distance from the symphysis pubis to the umbilicus. We could not determine whether the point of recession had any relation with the semicircular line. However, we did know that it did not pass through the transversalis fascia, and was definitely not a spigelian hernia. We considered that this was a preperitoneal type of interparietal hernia . We reduced the incarcerated segment of ileum, which was inflamed, edematous and patchy with ecchymosed areas . We resected this segment and accomplished an end-to-end anastomose. We pulled back the sac and excised it. We closed the defect with en bloc interrupted polypropylene sutures.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

He was free of any symptoms at his follow-up at six months.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Bartolin first described interparietal hernia in 1661 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Its definition has not changed since then, however, three subtypes have been described recently. The three subtypes are preperitoneal (between peritoneum and transversalis fascia), interstitial (between transversalis fascia and transverse, internal oblique or external oblique muscles), and superficial (between external oblique and skin or within aponeuroses of the inguinal region) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Lower and Hicken 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> reported in their series, which is still the largest published one, that the interparietal hernias among all inguinal hernias should be as frequent as 0.01-1.6%. They also commented that the interstitial subtype comprised of 60% of the cases, while the other two subtypes occurred 29% each. It is reported that the interparietal hernia is predominant in males 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】The interparietal hernias are frequently confused with inguinal hernias. The diagnosis is usually determined during the operation, as it was the case in our patient. Koot 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> discussed whether the interparietal hernias, which frequently presents with small bowel obstruction and appears at a level above inguinal ligament, are a rare variation of inguinal hernias. In the case of closed vaginal process and intact internal ring, the interparietal hernia should be considered as a preperitoneal type. If the hernia has past through the internal ring, it is then an interstitial hernia. However, its high incidence in children and adult males suggests a relationship between the etiopathogenesis of interparietal hernia and the embryological descent of the testis, an issue that is not fully understood.\n\n【12】The biggest problem with the interparietal hernia is that its preoperative diagnosis is seldom, if ever. The preoperative imaging techniques play a significant role in naming of the condition. The computed tomography (CT) is the method of choice in the differential diagnosis, which can exclude the presence of an obstructing tumor. However, it is reported that both CT and herniography are not successful in differentiating the different types of inguinal hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. In our case the CT depicted very well that the mass was not a tumor, however it did not differentiate it as an interparietal hernia. It seems that the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive and specific in differentiating the inguinal anatomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The intraperitoneal scintigraphy has also been utilized in the diagnosis of inguinal conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Although it is generally accepted that US does not yield in a definite diagnosis due to tissue factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, recent studies have reported successful results with the US in differentiating hernia types in the inguinal region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】We conclude that surgeons may sometimes come across with interparietal hernias either in the form of an odd inguinal hernia or as a case of acute intestinal obstruction of an unknown origin. Surgeons may reach to a correct preoperative diagnosis if they consider it when they have a case of unknown origin.

Based on the National Inpatient Sample database, a retrospective longitudinal analysis found one in six patients with a discharge diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis was also diagnosed with thyroid storm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Thyrotoxicosis associated with thyroid storm carries with it a 12-fold higher mortality rate than thyrotoxicosis alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Thyroid storm traditionally has been identified as a clinical syndrome involving thyrotoxicosis, altered mentation, hyperthermia, and a precipitating event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Currently, there are no universally accepted clinical criteria for the diagnosis of thyroid storm. Proposed in 1993, the Burch-Wartofsky score is a scoring metric based on clinical findings used for the identification of thyroid storm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Current treatment modalities revolve around decreasing hormone synthesis, inhibiting the release of thyroid hormone, and blocking peripheral effects of existing systemic thyroid hormone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Amiodarone, a type III antiarrhythmic approved for the use of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, is 37% iodine by molecular weight. Side effects are many, including thyroid dysfunction, both hyper- and hypothyroidism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) results either from increased synthesis of T4 and T3 (AIT type I), or from the destructive thyroiditis resulting in excess hormone release (AIT type II) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In a retrospective analysis, incidence of AIT was found to be associated with a 2.7-fold increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or ventricular arrhythmias compared to euthyroid patients on amiodarone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】We report a case and management of AIT resulting in severe thyroid storm and monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 75-year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic atrial fibrillation on amiodarone, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 25-30%, primary prevention implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD), and non-toxic large left-sided colloid thyroid nodule presented to the emergency department after an episode of syncope after a prodrome of feeling faint while walking. On presentation he had anterograde amnesia following the event but was alert and not altered. He was afebrile and normotensive but tachycardic with heart rate (HR) 140 - 160 beats per minute (bpm). On physical exam he appeared anxious and tachypneic. Neck exam revealed a non-tender 6-cm thyroid nodule and cardiac auscultation revealed I/VI holosystolic murmur. His home medications included amiodarone and digoxin for underlying chronic atrial fibrillation started 4 months prior, metoprolol, dabigatran, and rosuvastatin. Initial electrocardiogram (EKG) demonstrated monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and ICD interrogation reveled that he had been defibrillated eight times during his syncopal episode. During the interview period he continued to receive tachytherapies from his implanted device including three defibrillations. He was treated with intravenous (IV) amiodarone, lidocaine, and ultimately intubated and sedated for unremitting ventricular tachycardia storm.\n\n【6】In the intensive care unit, workup yielded undetectable thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and an elevated free thyroxine of 5.46 ng/dL. Thyroid function tests prior to initiation of amiodarone were reviewed and previously were within normal limits . The patient’s Burch-Wartofsky score was calculated to be 60. Diagnosis of severe thyrotoxicosis with thyroid storm was suspected and the patient was initiated on steroids, cholestyramine, potassium iodide, and esmolol. He was unable to be started on thionamides and lithium due to acute liver and renal failure. Continued workup demonstrated elevated thyroid stimulating immunoglobin M (IgM) antibodies and thyrotropin receptor antibodies while thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Highlights TSH and Free Thyroxine Levels (Free T4) and Laboratory Findings Available at the Time of Admission |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【8】After emergency multi-disciplinary evaluation, his acute thyroid storm was determined to be due to AIT, a diagnosis of exclusion. As a result, amiodarone was ceased. The patient continued to deteriorate and experienced acute decompensated heart failure. Echocardiogram exhibited severe global hypokinesis and an EF of 11%. Plasmapheresis was initiated; however, his condition continued to deteriorate and he developed refractory shock and ultimately expired.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Ventricular tachycardia induced by thyroid storm was first reported by Jao et al in 2004 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, the patient described in that case had a 7-year history of hyperthyroidism with irregular intake of medications. In the case we described above, the patient has no known history of thyroid disease other than a non-toxic thyroid nodule. Treatment of hemodynamically stable ventricular arrythmias includes IV antiarrhythmic medications such as amiodarone or beta-blocking agents. We believe that chronic amiodarone treatment precipitated our patient’s thyroid storm and thus it was not continued and treatment for thyrotoxicosis was initiated. However due to acute liver failure and hypotension, thionamides and beta blockers were also contraindicated. Ultimately, we offered plasmapheresis as an alternative therapy. Simsir et al previously reported 46 patients in thyroid storm and the efficacy of plasmapheresis in decreasing free T3 and T4 levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Muller et al determined that plasmapheresis is capable of clearing amiodarone and its metabolites which are highly bound to plasma proteins, as well as free T3 and T4 molecules by up to 20-60% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Cases have been reported where therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was initiated for type 2 amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Given the dual reported benefits and our patient’s poor candidacy for standard of care, plasmapheresis was offered. Thus, when medical management of thyroid storm is limited, plasmapheresis may be an effective alternative option.\n\n【11】Conclusions\n\n【12】Thyroid storm is a rare endocrine emergency that carries a high mortality and is challenging to treat. Mainstay therapy requires patients to receive agents to decrease hormone synthesis, inhibit hormone release, and block action of existing systemic thyroid hormone. Amiodarone-induced thyroid storm poses its own challenges compounding on an otherwise critical presentation. We pose a case of amiodarone-induced thyroid storm presenting with monomorphic sustained ventricular tachycardia that was treated with plasmapheresis highlighting an alternative, and in this case, unsuccessful therapy in the treatment of this severe condition.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient described in the case report had given informed consent for the case report to be published.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Each author has individually been involved in and has made substantial contributions to case selection, case presentation, discussion, drafting manuscript and revision and final approval.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Data Availability</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All data and information regarding this manuscript are present within the text.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 13:49:05", "endTime": "2024/09/19 13:49:16", "cost": 11.337}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 21:49:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:57:23"}

She had consulted in another hospital prior to her visit where she was diagnosed with a community-acquired pneumonia and was sent home with amoxicillin / clavulanate for a total of 14 days. However, she still felt ill and she wanted a second opinion.\n\n【4】Ms. X is not known for any significant disease and had only had an acute pyelonephritis and a bronchitis in the past. She is also a smoker with 15 packs-year. She had undergone an ovariectomy. She was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and had lived a few years in Belgium before moving to Canada.\n\n【5】Upon her arrival, her vital signs are stable, apart from a tachycardia of 114 beats per minute and a saturation of 95 % with ambient air. She has a non-productive cough and crepitants could be heard at the base of the left lung.\n\n【6】It is noted that she has few signs of CNS involvement: sleepiness, disorganisation and disorientation. She had also visual hallucinations and possibly a paranoid delirium before coming to the emergency according to her son.\n\n【7】She is found to be in an inflammatory state with her sedimentation rate at 137 mm/H (upper limit of normal range 20 mm/H), her C-reactive protein at 21 mg/L (upper limit of normal range 5 mg/L) and her ferritin at 1886 ug/L (upper limit of normal range 90 ug/L for her age and sex). Ms. X’s white blood cells are at 21.2 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (upper limit of normal range 11 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) with neutrophils at 14.4 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (upper limit of normal range 7.7 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) and her platelets at 656 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (maximum of 743 - upper limit of normal range 450 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L).\n\n【8】On the pulmonary X-ray, we can see a bilateral pattern of reticulo-nodularity . Pneumonia is diagnosed and she is switched to daily levofloxacin 500 milligrams.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Ms X’s lung X-ray showing the bilateral pattern of reticulo-nodularity. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【10】A normocytic normochromic anemia is discovered with a hemoglobin level of 78 g/L, rapidly progressing to 61 g/L with a normal iron profile, as her TSH, B12 vitamin and folic acid. A haemolytic anemia is diagnosed with LDH at 720 U/L (upper limit of normal range 205 U/L) and haptoglobin less than 0.07 g/L (lower limit of normal range 0.35 g/L). This anemia is found to be reactive with cold agglutinins anti-I IgM.\n\n【11】Two blood transfusions and a heated room were needed to stabilise the patient.\n\n【12】We can see cold agglutinins hemolytic anemia in Figure 2 .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. Cold agglutinins hemolytic anemia.

She underwent a full work-up for neoplastic or autoimmune disease (cerebral, thoracic and abdominal scans and a mammography) which came back negative. Finally, the M. pneumonia serology came back positive with both IgG at 8.91 (upper limit of normal range 1.10) and IgM at 8.57 (same upper limit as IgG) in this clinical setting of pneumonia with a cold agglutinin haemolytic anemia and CNS involvement. The pulmonary X-ray 8 days post-admission showed an almost resolution of the reticulo-nodular pattern.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】M. pneumonia , hominis and genitalium are the three species of Mycoplasma mostly involved in human infections. They are short rods that cannot be Gram stained (they do not have a cell wall) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. They can grow both in aerobic and anaerobic media. Mycoplasma belongs to the class of Mollicutes , along with Ureaplasma .\n\n【17】M. pneumonia is one of the common atypical germs involved in community-acquired pneumonia. It usually affects children or military recruits, but can also be found in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Clinically, it can vary from almost no symptoms, upper respiratory tract symptoms only, to pneumonia with or without extrapulmonary symptoms, and even empyema.\n\n【18】The involvement of extrapulmonary organs can occur not only by autoimmunity, but also by direct invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Of the extrapulmonary symptoms, the neurological ones are the most frequent with encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Other organ implications can be hematologic (IgM cold agglutinins) through autoantibodies against M. pneumonia’s glycolipid antigens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This cold agglutinin hemolytic anemia is also rarely clinically significant, which makes our patient’s case even more unusual as she had her hemoglobin level dropped down to 61 g/L and necessitated blood transfusions.\n\n【19】Otherwise, the cardio-vascular system can be affected with symptoms of pericarditis and arrhythmia. The renal (glomerulonephritis) and gastrointestinal (hepatitis, pancreatitis) systems may also be affected. Rheumatologic (arthritis, Raynaud) and skin (rash) involvement are possible as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Hence, other clinical and para-clinical investigations would implicate an electrocardiogram, a urine analysis, liver and pancreatic enzymes and a careful exam of skin and joints, so as to eliminate synovitis or an associated rash.\n\n【20】Because transmission of M. pneumonia is by airborne droplets and as of the potential hematologic complication, patients infected with M. pneumonia need to be isolated in a warm room. Treatment is often empirically started with a macrolide (azithromycin, clarithromycin or erythromycin) or a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) or a tetracycline derivative (doxycycline) for a total of 7 to 14 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>. Resistance in North America to these antibiotics is low.\n\n【21】Summary\n\n【22】When a patient presents infectious pulmonary symptoms and central nervous system involvement, it is important to look for Mycoplasma pneumonia with a serologic test. If suspected, treatment involves macrolides, fluoroquinolones or doxycycline. A respiratory isolation in a warm room is necessary in order to prevent the spread of the disease and the apparition or complications of cold-agglutinins hemolytic anemia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:06:00", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:06:14", "cost": 14.021}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:06:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:05:59"}

The patient was scheduled for an elective cesarean section under epidural anesthesia. The surgery was unremarkable and she delivered a healthy baby. However, four hours into the post-operative period the patient noticed complete loss of sensation and power in the left lower extremity. Physical examination revealed stable vital signs and unremarkable cardiopulmonary system. Abdominal examination revealed massive non-tender hepatosplenomegaly. Evaluation of nervous system revealed normal higher functions and cranial nerves. Sensory system showed loss of sensation in all modalities from L1 to L4 and partial involvement of L5 dermatome. Motor system revealed profound weakness in the left lower extremity, sparing anterior half of the foot. Deep tendon reflexes were normal on right side but left knee reflex was absent with preserved left ankle reflex. There was no saddle anesthesia, bowel or bladder incontinence which implied patchy involvement of spinal nerve roots. Laboratory studies revealed an acute drop in hemoglobin concentration from 10 g/dl pre-operatively to 7.1 g/dl after the surgery within a span of about 30 hours. The patient underwent a Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis with contrast to evaluate intra abdominal hematoma, which incidentally revealed diffuse coarse trabeculations of the visualized osseous structures, predominantly in the sacrum, with evidence of mild bony destruction and infiltration by soft tissue suggestive of possible extra-medullary hematopoiesis .The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the thoracic and lumbosacral spine with Gadolinium revealed intraspinal soft tissue deposits from T4 to T9 and L5 to S2 level resulting in significant extra-dural compression. There were also para-spinal nodular soft tissue deposits reported from approximately T7 to T10 and L5 to S2 vertebral levels. The appearance of bone marrow on MRI was suggestive of generalized systemic marrow disorder with a lack of normal fat signal intensity compatible with clinically significant beta-thalassemia . Packed Red Blood Cell transfusions were recommended, however the patient refused. The patient was started on intravenous Dexamethasone at a bolus dose of 10 mg followed by 4 mg every 6 hours for 3 days. The neurological examination improved dramatically with complete resolution of symptoms upon stabilization of the hemoglobin level.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Differential diagnoses of such presentation include 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> epidural hematoma as a complication of epidural anesthesia causing a secondary compression of the nerve roots, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> femoral nerve entrapment, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> vertebral compression fracture and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> a direct compressive effect on the spinal cord from extra-medullary hematopoietic tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 5 , 10 , 15 , 17 , 18 \\]</u>. Imaging studies did not reveal epidural hematoma or a spinal compression fracture. Femoral nerve compression occurs usually secondary to lithotomy position during normal vaginal delivery. The extent of the disease clearly indicates the chronicity of the extra-medullaryhematopoietic process. However the acuity of onset puzzled us. We hypothesize that sudden clinical manifestation of these lesions might have been precipitated by drop in hemoglobin leading to sudden surge in extra-medullary hematopoiesis. The resultant hyperactivity could have further compressed the spinal nerve roots leading to weakness and loss of sensation of left lower extremity. This hypothesis is plausible by rapid improvement in neurological signs upon stabilization of hemoglobin. It might be argued that the administration of steroids might have had a beneficial role. However, the resolution was too rapid to be attributable to steroids alone. It has been shown that hyper-transfusion therapy helps to shrink extra-medullary hematopoietic tumors and alleviate the compressive effect on spinal cord 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 , 6 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】In conclusion, acute neurological complications from extra-medullary hematopoietic tissue are rare but serious complications in patients with extreme dyserythropoiesis as a result of beta-thalassemia that might require blood transfusions and high dose steroids. Acute blood loss may lead to surge in extra-medullary hematopoiesis leading to worsening of compressive effects. Therefore in patients with thalassemia undergoing surgery where significant blood loss is anticipated, prophylactic blood transfusions and close monitoring may be necessary to avoid and manage acute neurological complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 , 9 , 18 \\- 20 \\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:45:57", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:46:56", "cost": 58.761}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:46:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:45:56"}

Traumatic abdominal wall hernias (TAWHs) are some of the most infrequent occurring hernias overall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. TAWH can occur along any segment of the abdomen. A rare subtype is the traumatic abdominal wall flank hernia (TAWFH) along the spigelian fascia, which occurs in less than 1% of all blunt abdominal traumas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The spigelian fascia is located in the anterior abdominal wall adjacent to the semilunar line and lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle and is formed by the fusion of the internal oblique aponeurosis and transversus abdominis aponeurosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Flank hernia injuries in this location are often associated with motor vehicle collision (MVC) with deceleration forces, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and the naturally weaker spigelian fascia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】There are various treatment options for TAWFH; however, no clear standardized surgical approach has been identified. Difficulties in treating these conditions are providing enough exposure to identify the full extent of the damaged structures and ultimately closure of a large abdominal injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Currently, the main recommendation is urgent repair using either an open laparotomy, direct incision over the defect, or laparoscopic approach with either mesh or primary closure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In this study, we present a challenging case involving a TAWFH which occurred in a patient after an MVC. The patient developed a hernia at the location of the spigelian fascia with also completely torn abdominal oblique and transversus abdominis from the iliac crest attachment, thus requiring a unique definitive closure utilizing component separation, biological mesh, and synthetic Ventralight™ mesh.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】A 39-year-old male with a past medical history of epilepsy was brought in by ambulance after being involved in a rollover MVC. The patient reportedly experienced a seizure while driving, which led to the MVC. On arrival to the trauma bay, the patient complained of abdominal pain and left lower extremity pain. The patient was neurologically intact with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 15 and his initial vital signs were significant for hypotension with a systolic blood pressure below 80 mm Hg. Extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma (e-FAST) was negative for any intraabdominal or intrathoracic bleeding. During the primary trauma survey, a malrotated left ankle along with an absent left dorsalis pedis pulse and a large left lower flank contusion was discovered . The patient’s left ankle was reduced by orthopedic surgery with return of palpable pulses. The patient’s blood pressure was stabilized with 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and a 2 L crystalloid bolus.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Ecchymosis noted on the patient’s left flank and hip. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】The complete blood cell count (CBC) showed a leukocytosis of 17.6 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, and platelets of 229 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Basic metabolic panel was within normal limits except a chloride of 114 mEq/L and a carbon dioxide of 19 mEq/L. Coagulation tests showed a prothrombin time of 15.3, international normalized ratio of 1.2, and partial thromboplastin time of 29.4. A urine drug screen (Roche Diagnostics Indianapolis, IN) was positive for amphetamine. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, pelvis, and bilateral lower extremity with intravenous contrast (IV) was notable for a left lateral abdominal wall hematoma, left lateral abdominal hernia , comminuted left distal femur fracture, left fibula fracture, a left fifth metatarsal fracture, and three vessel runoffs of bilateral lower extremities without any noted vascular injuries. The patient was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) for hemodynamic monitoring.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. Sagittal, transverse, and coronal computed tomography of abdomen showing disruption of left abdominal wall musculature from iliac crest and retraction of the muscle noted by a white arrow in the three figure segments. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【10】Treatment\n\n【11】On hospital day 2, the patient underwent an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the left distal femur. He returned postoperatively to the SICU for continued close hemodynamic monitoring. The patient was taken back to the operating room on hospital day 3 for a left abdominal wall component separation and complex TAWFH repair. An incision was made over the defect and the external oblique was divided lateral to the linea semilunaris, then vertically and separated from the internal oblique. While providing adequate exposure, the team noted that there was complete tearing of the abdominal obliques from the iliac crest with near to total disruption of the internal oblique. The underlying bowel contents were examined and noted to be intact without any injury. The complete obliteration of the left lateral wall provided additional difficulty with the repair. A biological mesh inlay was used to bridge the transversus abdominis to iliac crest to recreate the visceral sac as shown in Figure 3a . This was performed by drilling two holes in the iliac crest in order to affix the muscle and mesh. Then, a Ventralight™ mesh was secured to the internal oblique and iliac crest. A counter incision was required for access to the retracted abdominal wall musculature, as shown in Figure 3b, c . Lastly, the internal oblique muscle was re-approximated over the mesh repair as shown in Figure 3d . The patient left the operating room in stable condition with an abdominal binder in place. Postoperatively, antibiotics were discontinued and his WBC was 11,800 µL.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

(d) Re-approximation of internal oblique muscle over mesh repair. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【13】The patient was advanced to a regular diet by hospital day 6. On hospital day 7, the patient was noted to have an ileus along with an increased WBC of 21,900 µL, cough, and fever. A CT of chest without IV contract was suggestive of lobular pneumonia and sputum cultures showed growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient was started on IV vancomycin.\n\n【14】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【15】On hospital day 8 during daily dressing changes, serous fluid was noted to be draining from his hernia repair incision which also had increased tenderness. These findings were consistent with a seroma, and due to the absence of incision site warmth, erythema, edema, or purulence and a normalizing WBC, no additional antibiotics were initiated. By hospital day 12, drainage from the seroma site had ceased and by hospital day 19, the patient was discharged. The patient was working with physical and occupational therapy with significant improvement; however, he decided to leave against medical advice. At departure, there were no documented complaints related to his left abdominal surgical site and his ileus had resolved with normal bowel function.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Development of TAWFH is an important consideration in blunt abdominal trauma. Blunt abdominal trauma transiently increases intra-abdominal pressures and allows for herniation through the spigelian fascia along with disruption of abdominal wall musculature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Diagnosis of such an injury can be difficult as some patients are asymptomatic while others complain of dull abdominal pain with a mild bulge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Often, it is difficult to find physical evidence of TAWFH on primary or secondary trauma survey. This highlights the importance of radiological imaging. Abdomen and pelvis CT scan allows for visualization of abdominal wall defects and provides information on size, location, and the presence of any neighboring structural damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Our radiographic images demonstrate the complete avulsion of the abdominal wall musculature from the iliac crest which confirmed the presence of TAWFH versus other differential diagnoses related to the presence of ecchymosis on exam.\n\n【18】In the setting of TAWFH, open hernia repair is recommended, although laparoscopic repairs have been reported in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Open repair is recommended due to the possibility of coexisting structural damage that requires prompt visualization and expeditious repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In our case, an open approach with incisions directly overlying the defect was necessary due to the mechanism of injury, large disruption of left lateral abdominal musculature, and strong suspicion for concurrent intra-abdominal injuries. Upon opening the abdomen, we noted the extent of damage to the abdominal wall musculature. Primary repair with a combination of biological and synthetic mesh was necessary. While mesh repair is recommended regardless of open or laparoscopic technique, the large abdominal disruption in our patient warranted combination of biological and synthetic mesh 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Biological meshes provide the benefit of bridging abdominal wall defects and are less prone to infection, enterocutaneous fistula formation, and adhesion formation; however, they confer less mechanical support than synthetic counterparts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. In this case, we used a combination of both biological mesh and synthetic Ventralight ST mesh. The biological mesh provided a bridge between the avulsed transversus abdominis and iliac crest attachment as well as a bolster for the overlying repaired internal oblique and synthetic mesh. The Ventralight ST mesh provided tensile strength to the repair to reduce the risk of future recurrence.\n\n【19】While our patient did not experience re-herniation during his acute hospital stay, he did develop a seroma over the incision site, without any clinical signs of infection. In future repairs, we would consider placement of a drain to prevent seroma formation. The patient was initially on IV vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and no additional antibiotics were initiated for the seroma. The seroma spontaneously drained through the stapled closure by hospital day 12. Aside from the seroma, our patient’s postoperative course had no further complications related to the hernia repair.\n\n【20】A diagnosis of TAWSH is difficult and often requires three-dimensional imaging to accurately visualize the underlying hernia. More importantly, repair of the hernia is warranted to prevent future bowel strangulation. From our isolated case, we recommend utilizing a biological mesh in large muscular avulsions overlayed with a synthetic mesh for increased support as compared to the more common single mesh approach.\n\n【21】Learning points\n\n【22】While TAWSHs are rare, they can be a significant cause of morbidity related to the possibility of visceral strangulation. There is no standardized method of repair and few studies have reported using a combination of biological and synthetic mesh. In our presented case, the use of a biological mesh inlay, reinforced with a synthetic Ventralight™ mesh, offers an alternative approach to the management of a complex TAWSH.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank and express their gratitude to the wonderful Arrowhead Regional Medical Center operating room staff, emergency department trauma staff, and the Surgical Intensive Care Unit exceptional nursing staff for their expert clinical support.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The research presented in this manuscript had no specific funding from any agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

It occurs in about 3.8% of patients who undergo left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) with the Watchman device 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. About 89% of patients with IHPE develop hemodynamic deterioration and require intervention within 24 h of the procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Iatrogenic acute cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening complication that can lead to death; it often involves hemodynamic instability, and requires cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 20% of patients and blood transfusion in more than 25% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. When IHPE occurs, any concomitant intracardiac procedure should be cancelled, and anticoagulation should be reversed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. These two steps are sufficient if the pericardial effusion is small and not hemodynamically significant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>. In cases of tamponade, pericardiocentesis and percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) should be urgently performed, and in certain circumstances, surgical repair is required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Traditionally, the drained pericardial blood is collected in a drainage bag, and an allogenic blood transfusion is used to correct low hemoglobin levels in patients with significant bleeding who are hemodynamically unstable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. However, blood transfusions may carry some risk of complications.\n\n【3】We describe our experience with managing IHPE by immediately retransfusing drained pericardial blood through a central venous line.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 79-year-old man was scheduled to undergo LAAC in our department. He had non-valvular atrial fibrillation with a contraindication to oral anticoagulants because of a history of recurrent significant intestinal bleeding with angiodysplasia, as well as an increased risk of bleeding (HAS-BLED score, 5). He also had a high risk for thromboembolism (CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score, 4).\n\n【6】He was sedated with propofol 2%, and spontaneous respiration was maintained. All standard anesthetic monitors were attached. Invasive blood pressure monitoring was performed using a 4-French sheath inserted into the left femoral artery. Unfractionated heparin (70 units/kg, intravenous bolus) was administered at the beginning of the procedure to achieve a target activated clotting time of 250 - 300 s. During manipulation of the stiff wire and deployment of the LAAC device (Watchman device 27 mm) in the LAA, he became hemodynamically unstable; the intra-arterial pressure decreased suddenly, from 125/80 to 84/33 mm Hg, with a typical decrease in the systolic arterial pressure of more than 10 mm Hg during inspiration (pulsus paradoxus) . His heart rate increased from 62 to 115 beats/min. Additionally, bilateral jugular venous distension was noted. An echocardiogram demonstrated pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right ventricle and right atrium . Subxiphoid pericardiocentesis was immediately performed using ultrasound guidance. A 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted into the pericardium, after which we aspirated blood from the pericardium by using a 50-mL syringe. Then we reinfused the blood through a 5-French central venous catheter into the right femoral vein. This action was repeated approximately 50 times. Parallel colloidal fluids were rapidly infused. An angiogram showed contrast agent in the pericardium with perforation of the LAA . The procedure was terminated, and a suitable dose of protamine sulphate was administered to reverse the effects of heparin. Pericardial blood aspiration and reinfusion resulted in a noticeable improvement in the patient’s hemodynamic status, and bleeding from the LAA stopped. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit in a hemodynamically stable condition. Follow-up echocardiograms showed no evidence of pericardial effusion, and the pigtail catheter was removed after 24 h. The patient was asymptomatic and had a good clinical condition; hence, he was discharged from the hospital on the fifth day postoperatively. He was informed in detail about the complication, and he decided to receive medical treatment with clopidogrel.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Clearly, making an early diagnosis and having an experienced interventional cardiologist perform emergency pericardiocentesis are life-saving measures in cases of tamponade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】The present report describes an emergency response to a nearly catastrophic complication of PLAAC, wherein pericardial tamponade was reversed by aspiration of the pericardial hemorrhage, followed by immediate reinfusion of that blood. Our patient received his own blood, which is safer, easier, and more cost-effective, and it contains more adequate clotting factors and platelets than banked blood. On the basis of our experience, we recommend gently aspirating blood from the pericardium and directly reinjecting that blood through a large central venous line. We do not advise retransfusing collected blood from the drainage bag to avoid complications such as thrombosis, air embolism, and hemolysis. We believe that our experience makes a significant contribution to the literature because this complication is commonly encountered in percutaneous intracardiac interventions, and our approach facilitated rapid yet physiologically appropriate recovery. Additionally, our report is the first in the medical literature about a new successful strategy for treating IHPE by using autotransfusion.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】IHPE is not uncommon complication in daily percutaneous intracardiac interventions. Pulsus paradoxus is the most important clinical sign of cardiac tamponade. Our approach to reinfusion of the drained pericardial blood may allow rapid physiologically appropriate recovery. There are currently no guidelines on the significance of autotransfusion in the treatment of IHPE patients. Future consensus of opinion of experts focusing on autotransfusion in such cases is needed.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Elsevier’s Webshop for editing the manuscript.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:52:38", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:52:52", "cost": 14.146}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:52:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:52:35"}

We report a fourth case of a rare hemoglobin (Hb) variant, Hb South Florida (Hb-SF) with only three cases reported previously worldwide to our knowledge since its initial description in 1985. It causes falsely elevated HbA1c results during standard laboratory testing in the range of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 42-year-old female with a history of sclerosing bone dysplasia was found to have an elevated HbA1c of 13.8% during routine lab work using the ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Repeat testing showed HbA1c of 12.8% with fasting blood sugar of 98 mg/dL. Patient did not have a prior diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and denied any symptoms of polyuria, polyphagia, or polydypsia. She denied any family history of diabetes. Physical exam was unremarkable. Routine lab work that included a complete blood count, lipid and renal panel was within normal limits. Her home medication included acetaminophen/codeine that she takes for bone pain from sclerosing bone dysplasia. She was asked to repeat lab work over a course of several months, which showed persistent elevated HbA1c in the range of 12-14% with mildly elevated blood sugar readings .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. HbA1c Results |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【5】Patient remained asymptomatic. Her random blood glucose readings did not correspond to HbA1c values. She was referred to the endocrinology clinic for further evaluation. Hb electrophoresis was performed due to suspicion for a hemoglobinopathy. The results showed that the patient was heterozygous for a rare Hb variant called Hb-SF that causes falsely elevated HbA1c levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Her corrected HbA1c, when evaluated by affinity column HPLC showed results in the normoglycemic range .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 2. Hemoglobin Electrophoresis Results: April 21, 2014 |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Glycosylation is the addition of glucose molecules to amino groups of proteins in a non-enzymatic way 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. HbA1c is the most abundant fraction of glycosylated hemoglobin, proportional to average blood glucose concentration over the previous 2 - 3 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The concept of measuring HbA1c is based on the fact that Hb formed in new red blood cells enters the circulation with a minimal glucose attached 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Red blood cells are freely permeable to glucose and Hb becomes irreversibly bound with it at a rate dependent on the surrounding blood glucose concentration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Healthy adults Hb consists of approximately 97% HbA, 2.5% HbA2 and 0.5% HbF. Hb A is composed of four polypeptide chains: two alpha and two beta chains held together by non-covalent bonds 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Glycosylation occurs by a non-enzymatic reaction between glucose and NH2 groups of the N-terminal valine of the beta globin chains 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This is a two-step process. First a reversible reaction between the free aldehyde group of glucose and a free animo group on the Hb molecule forms a Schiff base 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This is followed by an irreversible Amadori rearrangement, where the Schiff base is converted to 1-deoxyfructose, producing glycosylated hemoglobin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】There are many commercially available tests for measuring HbA1c levels. Methods of identification are based on either physical, chemical or antibody characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Additionally, structural variants in Hb interfere with many of these methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. There have been more than 700 Hb variants reported which arise from point mutations in one of the four chains 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The current estimation of Hb variants worldwide is thought to be around 7% of the population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】The four most common types of methods of measuring HbA1c are affinity column immunoassay, ion-exchange HPLC, boronate affinity HPLC and enzymatic assay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In the affinity column immunoassay method ligands recognize the structure of the N-terminal glycated amino acids of the beta chain. Ion-exchange HPLC separates Hb based on their charge differences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Boronate method uses acid, which reacts with groups of glucose, bound to Hb. Enzyme-linked method uses an enzyme, which reacts with the N-terminal valine of the Hb 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】As mentioned previously, ion-exchange chromatography is a commonly used method to separate Hb chains, as they elute in the exchange column at different times based on their charge differences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Variant Hb that elute separately from HbA1c are not included in this measurement. Abnormal results occur when a Hb variant cannot be separated from the HbA1c fraction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Hb-SF variant substitutes a neutral amino acid for a charged one, with valine substituted by methionine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. This alteration decreases its transit time in the exchange column and causes it to co-elute together with HbA1c, giving a falsely elevated value as they get measured as the same species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】There are many common hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease, which are known to cause abnormal HbA1c results. These variants can cause either increased or decreased HbA1c levels, depending on the test type used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Hb-SF was first described in 1985 in Tampa Florida in a 9-year-old boy, referred to the South Florida Diabetes Center. He presented with symptoms of poor weight gain, polyuria, a normal glucose tolerance test, a normal Hb electrophoresis (cellulose acetate method) and HbA1c of 14.8% (ion-exchange chromatography) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 9 \\]</u>. Despite the normal electrophoresis results, there was a suspicion for an Hb variant due to elevated HbA1c levels in the absence of diabetes. The authors found that the ion-exchange chromatography results were not consistent when repeated with affinity column immunoassay testing. The latter was able to correctly report the patients HbA1c, without the false values caused by the non-glycosylated hemoglobin. They concluded that when this Hb variant is suspected the test should be repeated with affinity column testing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 9 \\]</u>. The variant Hb-SF has since been reported in two other cases worldwide, one case in Turkey in 2013 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> and one in Malaysia in 2006 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The variant Hb is not associated with any clinical disorder reported in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】In the case of our patient, she initially underwent HbA1c testing with ion-exchange chromatography that showed elevated levels. This was subsequently repeated with affinity chromatography, which showed normoglycemic results analogous to the original case from Florida.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】This is the fourth case of Hb-SF to our knowledge. It is important for clinicians to keep a wide perspective when making an assessment of diabetes solely based on HbA1c values. Patients who do not present with symptoms consistent with diabetes, and have normal blood glucose should prompt a further workup for abnormal Hb variants. This should be done in order to prevent incorrect diagnosis and treatment. It is also important to remember that there are many Hb variants in the populations, some of which are clinically silent but interfere with routine laboratory tests.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgement</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to also acknowledge the assistance of Dr Ronald J.

In the evaluation of Ki-67, less than 2% of the tumor cells showed nuclear proliferative activity.\n\n【23】The patient was subsequently discharged after 2 weeks.

Microscopic analysis revealed the diagnosis of solid pseudo-papillary tumor. Results of immunoperoxidase stains showed tumor cells that were positive for CK, CD56, CD10 and β-catenin. In the evaluation of Ki-67, less than 2% of the tumor cells showed nuclear proliferative activity.\n\n【23】The patient was subsequently discharged after 2 weeks.

Frantz tumor, solid and cystic tumor, solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm, papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas, and Hamoudi tumor have been used to describe this rare lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. From 1996, the tumor was designated as a solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas by WHO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Patients with SPTT usually experience epigastric discomfort, nausea, weight loss, pain which are vague and unspecific, and they may have a palpable abdominal mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>. Some patients have no clinical symptoms but are discovered by common physical examination. In the present case, the patient remained asymptomatic although an increase of the lesion up to more than 18 cm diameter and SMV compression was assessed when she came to our department.\n\n【27】Most of the tumor was 5 - 10 cm in size while in our case the rare size of 19 cm was observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. SPTT cells are typically positive for vimentin, CD10, CD56 and alpha-1-antitrypsin and may reveal focal immunoreactivity for neuron-specific enolase, cytokeratin and synaptophysin, demonstrate abnormal nuclear localization of beta-catenin and may express galectin-3, all of which are useful in differentiating them from endocrine pancreatic tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 14 , 15 \\]</u>. In the present case, immunoperoxidase stains showed SPTT cells were positive for CK, Vimentin, CD56, CD10 and β-catenin, which confirmed that SPTT is not an endocrine origin.\n\n【28】Surgical resection is the first choice of treatment which including pancreaticoduodenectomy, local tumor resection, segmental pancreas resection, resection of pancreatic body and tail and spleen resection according to the location of the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 17 \\]</u>.

EGPA is typically characterized by a prodromic history of allergic asthma, sinusitis and nasal polyposis for many years, followed by an eosinophilic phase hallmarked by peripheral eosinophilia and organ involvement, and a vasculitic phase with clinical manifestations due to small-vessel vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-4 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in EGPA is much less frequently reported than peripheral neuropathy in the literature, but it is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-6 \\]</u>. Therefore, prompt diagnosis and treatment are mandatory when EGPA is associated with cerebral involvement.\n\n【3】We describe a patient with transient cerebral ischemic attack and delirium heralding the vasculitic phase of EGPA.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 76-year-old Italian woman with a history of asthma, sinusitis, mild renal insufficiency and arthralgias was admitted in Stroke Unit of San Donato Hospital in Arezzo (Tuscany, Italy) with acutely developing aphasia, ataxia and delirium. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 14. She was outside recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment window. The patient was afebrile.\n\n【6】Laboratory data at admission revealed C-reactive protein (CRP) 1.7 mg/dL (normal value (NV) < 0.5), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 51 mm/h (NV 2 - 30), fibrinogen 461 mg/dL (NV 150 - 450), creatinine 1.35 mg/dL (NV 0.50 - 1.20) with a glomerular filtration calculated by CKD-EPI was 38 mL/min, and mild proteinuria was 30 mg/dL (NV < 15) in urinalysis. Complete blood count showed a significant increase of eosinophils (11%), with abnormal blood cell count 通用删除7(英):<u>(12,000)</u>, hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL (NV 11.7 - 16), with normal TSH (1.55 mUI/L, NV 0.20 - 4.20) and complement.\n\n【7】She had some risk factors for stroke: cholesterol 299 mg/dL (NV < 200), with non-HDL 221 mg/dL (NV < 130) and homocysteine 34.2 μmol/L (NV 0 - 15). Moreover, she was treated for hypertension.\n\n【8】In anamnesis 6 months before she underwent rheumatological visit for her symmetrical arthralgias associated with recurrent fever. She was treated with a low corticosteroid dose (8 mg of methylprednisolone) with suspicion of polymyalgia rheumatica. The corticosteroid therapy was effective on arthralgias and fever, and the follow-up was recently interrupted.\n\n【9】Brain computed tomography (CT) at admission showed diffuse cerebrovascular disease and excluded cerebral hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed signs of diffuse small-vessel cerebrovascular disease in basal nuclei and periventricular white matter with no acute focal lesion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and paranasal maxillary sinuses non-erosive polyposis .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. (A) Brain MRI showed multiple hyperintense lesions in both corona radiata and the bilateral deep periventricular white matter on the T2 FLAIR. The lesions showed hypointensity on DWI (not shown). (B) Head MRI showed bilateral maxillary sinuses non-erosive polyposis  on T2 coronal scan. (C) The peculiar facies of the patient with a saddle nose acquired deformity and mild exophthalmos. (D) The chest radiograph shows peripheral and symmetrical patchy consolidation in the lungs. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【11】CT-angiography showed bilateral but not critical internal carotid arteries stenosis. The diagnostic approach for ischemic stroke failed to reveal a definite etiology, and she was treated with clopidogrel 75 mg for secondary stroke prevention.\n\n【12】The patients was, therefore, admitted in neurorehabilitation unit, a post-intensive unit of the same hospital, with dysarthria, with moderate cognitive impairment (memory loss, disorientation), and ill-defined but symmetrical pain and weakness in her legs and ataxia, unable to walk. The rheumatologist noted the peculiar facies of the patient that showed a saddle nose acquired deformity, and mild exophthalmos . The patient and her parents confirmed that such deformities were observed progressively after repeated sinusitis, about 10 years before. Moreover, she told that in the past she was also admitted in a pneumologic clinic to treat severe asthma and sinusitis (clinic documentation was unavailable).\n\n【13】The rheumatologist re-evaluated the complete anamnesis of the patient and the diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis, or relapsing polychondritis was then suspected.\n\n【14】Indirect immuno-fluorescence showed a p-ANCA pattern. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed the positivity of myeloperoxidase ANCA (MPO-ANCA) at 17.87 UI/mL (NV < 5). Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) resulted negative. Abnormal level of total IgE was also noted 1,355 UI/mL (NV 0 - 100).\n\n【15】The patient underwent laryngoscopy that excluded subglottic narrowing. Echocardiography excluded cardiomyopathy, endomyocarditis, valvular heart disease and pericarditis.\n\n【16】Chest X-ray revealed diffuse and symmetrical interstitial pulmonary disease with a restrictive pattern of functional tests .\n\n【17】An EMG confirmed a mixed motor and sensory axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy.\n\n【18】A comprehensive anamnestic and clinical examination permitted to diagnose EGPA on the basis of American College of Rheumatology 通用删除7(英):<u>(1990)</u> criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The diagnosis was probable, as the patient fulfilled five of the six criteria at the time of present admission or anamnestic (asthma, eosinophilia > 10%, polyneuropathy, pulmonary infiltrates, paranasal sinus abnormality). Furthermore, based on the elevated serum titer of p-ANCA and total IgE and nose chondritis, the patient was diagnosed as having EGPA, although biopsy was not performed.\n\n【19】On the suspicion that the patient had a vasculitic CNS involvement, the patient was given 32 mg of methylprednisolone orally every day, and with gradual tapering. Weakness and pain in both lower extremities improved slowly but continuously, and she became much less confused with 2 weeks of treatment. The patient was discharged after about 1 month on 8 mg methylprednisolone daily. Inflammatory reactant was negative. She was able to walk with mild assistance, without relevant speech or cognitive impairment.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】EGPA is a systemic, small-vessel necrotizing vasculitis that occurs in several organ systems, but it rarely affects the CNS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Involvement of small intracranial vessels is more likely to result in transient cerebral ischemic attack, cerebral infarction or hemorrhage, and CNS involvement of EGPA may cause significant morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>. Because of the rarity of CNS involvement, and in particular as first presentation of the vasculitic phase, the suspicion of such rare vasculitis in patients with acute cerebrovascular disease can be challenging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】An Italian long-term follow-up study of 38 patients affected with EGPA did not report case of CNS involvement, and the recent study of the French Vasculitis Study Group cohort reported a 5.2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. CNS involvement in EGPA seems to be more frequent in Asian patients than in Caucasian 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】However, the presence of high titer of ANCA hallmarks the vasculitic disease complications, as some large studies demonstrated that ANCA were positive in among 30-40% of EGPA patients and that ANCA-positive patients more frequently had peripheral neuropathy, glomerulonephritis, purpura and CNS involvement (which are due to small-vessel vasculitis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Thus ANCA should be tested in patients with cerebrovascular disease associated with systemic inflammation or eosinophilia and anamnestic asthma.\n\n【25】The present case illustrates that EGPA is a risk factor for multiple cerebral infarctions and should be considered in differential diagnosis of patients with cerebrovascular disease symptoms, systemic inflammation and asthma with hypereosinophilia.\n\n【26】Early detection of this condition and treatment with immunosuppressive therapy can lead to improved systemic and neurologic function and prevent long-term disability.\n\n【27】In conclusion, CNS involvement of EGPA is very rare, but it may cause significant morbidity and mortality. EGPA should be suspected, and ANCA should be tested in patients with acute cerebrovascular disease associated with systemic inflammation or eosinophilia and anamnestic asthma or sinusitis.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors declare no financial or personal relationships that may pose conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:07:30", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:07:57", "cost": 26.813}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:07:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:07:21"}

The mechanism of action of VPA revolves around its ability to potentiate the effects of the neurotransmitter Gamma Amino Butyrate (GABA). Specifically, VPA inhibits GABA degradation as well as GABA Transaminobutyrate (ABAT), increases GABA synthesis, and decreases turnover. This in turn allows increased availability of GABA at the synapse. Mild side effects of VPA include decreased sleep at the end of treatment, weight gain, drowsiness, nausea, and unsteadiness. However, if taken in supra-therapeutic doses, VPA can lead to toxicity and have a significant impact on patient’s safety. VPA toxicity includes signs and symptoms of CNS depression, lethargy, encephalopathy, and respiratory depression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Valproic acid toxicity has been steadily increasing in frequency since the FDA approved the drug for acute mania in 1995. According to the 2008 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Center's National Poison Data System (NPDS), 8,705 acute exposures to valproic acid occurred. Of these cases, major adverse outcomes were reported in 404 patients of this cohort 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Valproic acid toxicity though rare is an easily identifiable clinical scenario. When encountered, it has a typical presentation that can be dealt with promptly if the care giver has a baseline level of knowledge about the presenting signs and symptoms. The goal of this case report is to help explain and educate clinicians on the presentation and the treatment of VPA toxicity.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 30-year-old white male with a history of hypertension and bipolar disorder presented to an outside hospital after his wife heard him fall from his bed. At this time, she found him unarousable. Prior to this event he was in his normal state health. At the outlying facility he was confused and combative with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3. He was therefore transferred to our institution for a higher level of care. In route, he was intubated due to apneic episodes and further airway protection. On arrival vitals were stable, he was obtunded, withdrew all extremities to pain, and had a gag and corneal reflex with bilateral lower extremity clonus noted. Initial information was that the patient had overdosed on some of his depression medications. It was then learned that the medication was valproic acid.\n\n【6】Multiple laboratory values were obtained, and significant derangements noted were: anion gap metabolic acidosis of 23, hypernatremia (153 mmol/L), hypocalcemia (7.8 mg/dl), hyperosmolality (321 mmol/kg), and hyperammonemia (176 µmol/L). Computerized tomography (CT) of the head showed no acute abnormalities. The patient’s VPA level was found to be 990 mcg/mL (nml 50-100 mcg/mL).\n\n【7】Initially poison control was notified and supportive measures were begun. The patient was placed in the ICU for continuous monitoring and nephrology was consulted for evaluation for hemodialysis. Nephrology’s opinion was that he could benefit from dialysis. The patient underwent one treatment of hemodialysis and had dramatic improvement of his VPA blood levels from 998 µg/mL to 207 µg/mL. At this point, the patient was still unresponsive. Because of concern for cerebral edema, a repeat CT of the head was performed and again showed no acute abnormalities. The patient remained on a ventilator overnight.\n\n【8】The morning after admission his VPA level had been reduced to 90 ug/mL and his dialysis access was removed. A chest x-ray was performed and showed a right lower lobe infiltrate. Because of this, the patient required continued ventilator support and antibiotic coverage for a presumed aspiration pneumonia. By hospital day three, his mental status showed some improvement and he was extubated. He continued to become more alert and was transferred out of the ICU on day four of admission. On day five, the patient was doing well and back to his baseline mental status. He was discharged to a psychiatric facility for management of his psychiatric issues including suicidal ideation and bipolar disorder.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Recognizing VPA toxicity is the first step in appropriate management. Although rare, literature reveals a consistent presentation involving specific metabolic and structural derangements. Key signs and symptoms include: CNS depression, lethargy and encephalopathy, respiratory depression, nausea/vomiting and myoclonus. Laboratory abnormalities are particularly helpful in this case. In addition to elevated VPA levels, blood chemistries often demonstrate hypernatremia, elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperosmolality, hypocalcemia, and hyperammonemia with a transaminitis. Helpful imaging studies include noncontrast head CT that may demonstrate cerebral edema, the peak of which occurs between 12 hours and 4 days after ingestion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Biochemical knowledge behind VPA toxicity allows an understanding of the associated metabolic abnormalities. The hypernatremia is due to VPA’s composition: sodium valproate (approximately 13.8 mg sodium/100 mg valproate) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The hyperosmolality and anion gap acidosis result from elevated VPA metabolites which are organic anionic acids (propionic acid derivatives). These are osmotically active, leading to hyperosmolality and contribute to anion gap acidosis. Further, VPA metabolites are negatively charged, which facilitate binding to free ionized calcium causing hypocalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The propionic acid derivatives increase ammonia levels by two key mechanisms: first, they inhibit the hepatic mitochondrial enzyme carbamyl phosphate synthetase, the first step in eliminating ammonia during the urea cycle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>; second, metabolites interfere with carnitine, another mitochondrial co-factor which also increases ammonia levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】The treatment of VPA toxicity is primarily supportive. Activated charcoal can be given early if the timing of overdose is known, especially if sustained release forms have been ingested sometimes several doses of activated charcoal can be helpful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. VPA is absorbed rapidly so if timing of ingestion is unknown this may not be helpful. In patients with CNS depression and unknown timing, the use of charcoal is limited since the risk of an aspiration event would be increased. Also, the treatment with charcoal will not change supportive measures or decrease plasma concentrations of VPA or its metabolites. Serial head CT scans may be needed to monitor the side effect of cerebral edema. Cerebral edema in VPA toxicity can have delayed onset. This edema is thought to be precipitated by the abnormal metabolism of VPA that allows accumulation of 2-EN-VPA in the brain and plasma. This metabolite has a long half life (around 43 hours), thus accounting for the potentially delayed onset of cerebral edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Calcium should be replaced to avoid arrhythmias. Lactulose is used to trap ammonium in the gut, decreasing serum ammonia levels and reducing the risk of encephalopathy. Another mainstay of treatment is L-carnitine. L-carnititine increases levels of free carnitine to participate in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In extreme cases, hemodialysis may be required to reduce the levels of VPA and the associated metabolites. Hemodialysis can filter off free VPA. At blood levels above 90-100, the protein binding sites become saturated and there is a progressive increase in the free serum drug levels, which can be easily filtered by hemodialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Though VPA toxicity occurs rarely, it has a consistent presentation and defined treatment regimen. Awareness of a typical patient’s presentation would assist in early diagnosis and successful treatment.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 09:48:15", "endTime": "2024/09/19 09:56:27", "cost": 491.482}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 17:56:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 17:48:14"}

The term adenomatoid tumor was introduced by Golden and Ash in 1945 to describe a group of benign tumors with a glandular pattern and obscure histogenesis, localized in the urogenital tract.\n\n【2】These tumors present either as an incidental finding or a slow growing scrotal mass. In men, this tumor most commonly occurs at the head of the epididymis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The enlargement is usually painless with normal scrotal skin and no other symptoms. In many cases the scrotal mass has been present for several years prior to presentation. These tumors vary in size, although they most commonly measure between 1 and 2.5 cm in diameter (usually no larger than 5 cm). The tumor prevalence is highest in males, aged between 30 and 50 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Adenomatoid tumors are the most common tumors of paratesticular tissue, representing 30% in this group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Involvement of the testicular parenchyma, as in our case, is highly exceptional. In such cases a more common primary testicular tumor (such as seminoma) may be mimicked.

Palpation of the testis was painful. There was no history of dysuria, unsafe sexual contact or weight loss. Diagnostic imaging using ultrasound, revealed a 2.2 cm diameter, solid, non-compressable, hyperechoic mass in the lower testicular pole, with only sparse vascularisation. There was also evidence of a possible epididymitis. The findings were not compatible with a dermoid cyst, and considered suspicious for malignancy, although atypical both in appearance and age of presentation. He was referred to the urology department. A subsequent CT scan of the thorax and abdomen revealed no evidence of metastases.\n\n【6】Serum tumor markers were checked, and alpha-fetoprotein and beta-HCG were negative. LDH was normal.\n\n【7】Radical orchiectomy was performed. Through an inguinal incision the testis was removed from the scrotum while the spermatic cord was being clamped, to prevent possible hematogenous metastatic spread. Postoperatively, there were no remaining complaints of pain.\n\n【8】The tumor was submitted for histopathological analysis. Macroscopic examination showed an orchiectomy specimen of 7 × 4.5 × 3.5 cm, with nodular deformation. The tunica vaginalis was unremarkable. Sectioning revealed an intraparenchymal tumor with a diameter of 1.8 cm, which was well-circumscribed. There was no macroscopic involvement of the tunica albuginea or tunica vaginalis, or of the rete testis. The central part of the tumor showed haemorrhagic change.\n\n【9】Microscopically, the tumor was found to consist of an area of fibrosis with atypical epithelioid cells, arranged in strands, tubular structures and small nests. The cytoplasm was clear to amphophilic and contained moderately pleiomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Mitotic activity was limited (up to 2 mitoses per 10 HPF) and centrally, necrosis was seen. The abnormality was limited to the testicular parenchyma, and there was no microscopic involvement of the epididymis, or of the resection margin of the funiculus spermaticus. The surrounding parenchyma showed normal spermatogenesis. There was no evidence of an in-situ component, or of angio-invasive growth.\n\n【10】Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were strongly positive for keratin AE1AE3, calretinin and S100, with focally weak staining for CD30.

They often present as asymptomatic small lumps, which are accidentally discovered. In some cases, they are noticed with other concurrent pathology, for example a hydrocele or orchitis. Serum tumor markers are negative in all cases. In our case, the scrotal mass had probably been present for a longer period of time and was discovered during a visit to the emergency room because of pain, most likely based on a superimposed epidydimitis.\n\n【14】Most cases are paratesticular in location, but rare intratesticular adenomatoid tumors have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Ultrasound is used to differentiate between intra- and extratesticular lesions and allows accurate diagnosis of cystic forms and solid lesions. However, radiographic findings are non-specific, with tumors presenting as iso-, hypo-, or hyperechoic nodules, which in most of the cases, do not allow differentiation between a benign or malignant solid intraparenchymatous lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. For intratesticular cases of adenomatoid tumor, the radiological differential diagnoses include germ cell tumors of the testis, hemangioma, malignant mesothelioma, metastatic carcinoma of the prostate, and lymphoma.\n\n【15】The absence of tumor markers, the well-demarcated appearance on ultrasound and age of the patient can aid in distinguishing adenomatoid tumors of the testis from other malignant scrotal tumors. In addition, excision biopsy is considered a both diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. Intraoperative frozen sections can facilitate organ sparing surgery.

The radiographic findings are non-specific, which in most cases makes it difficult to differentiate between a benign or malignant solid intraparenchymatous lesion. If a benign lesion is suspected, it is recommended to perform intra-operative biopsy. If its benign nature is thus confirmed, the testicle can be conserved by performing tumorectomy with wide margins of resection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:08:36", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:08:51", "cost": 15.107}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:08:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:08:35"}

Endoscopic sphincterotomy and antibiotic treatment were performed at that time, at another hospital. After sphincterotomy, he was treated for cholangitis with levofloxacin twice before admission. On admission to our hospital, the patient’s temperature was 39.0 °C, his heart rate was 124/min (regular), and he had a disturbance of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale; E4V4M6). He also had a stiff neck. His pupil size (diameter) was 2.5 mm/2.5 mm, and light reflex was positive in both eyes. There was no evidence of heart murmur or lung rale. There were no other abnormal findings. Chest/abdominal radiographs and brain computed tomography upon admission revealed normal findings. Blood tests revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 18,700 cells/µL and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 14.48 mg/dL; however, there were no other significant findings in the blood and urine tests indicating the focus of infection.

The presence of confounding factors such as features suggestive of autoimmune disease makes the diagnosis difficult. However, HIV-related inflammation of the pancreas sharing features with autoimmune pancreatitis has rarely been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Serological features (elevated IgG4) reported in autoimmune pancreatitis have not been demonstrated in HIV-related inflammation of pancreas. It is important for the physician to carefully consider the diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis in immunocompromised patients as the use of steroids may lead to adverse events. Here, we present a case of acute pancreatitis in an HIV patient where the etiology was attributed to HIV-related inflammation after extensive workup despite serological features described in autoimmune pancreatitis. The case report emphasizes the importance of extremely cautious consideration of the diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis solely on presence of elevated IgG4 levels especially in patients with HIV infection.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 36-year-old HIV positive African American female presented at our emergency department for recurrent episodes of epigastric pain for the last 8 days. The pain was intermittent in nature and mild to moderate in intensity. Even though, the patient reported nausea associated with abdominal pain, she denied any episodes of vomiting. She denied any history of fever, night sweats during the last few months. She had lost 5 lb during the last 6 months. She denied alcohol intake prior to the episode. The patient had a history of poor medication compliance to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Due to high viral load and poor medication compliance, she had recurrent episodes of cutaneous herpetic lesions. She was also treated for candida esophagitis. She was not on any medications prior to the visit. Physical examination was unremarkable except for epigastric tenderness. Initial investigations revealed lipase of 1,367 U/L (normal 3 - 60 U/L). Liver function tests, calcium levels and triglyceride levels were within normal limits. The plasma HIV viral load was 1,383,810 copies RNA/mL and CD4 count was 20 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed diffuse inflammatory changes consistent with acute pancreatitis  but further imaging did not reveal capsule-like rim or lymph node enlargement . The patient’s complaints, elevated levels of lipase along with imaging features were consistent with acute pancreatitis. Subsequently, treatment including IV fluids, pain management and bowel rest was initiated. However, the etiology of the pancreatitis was unable to be determined initially. The usual causes such as alcohol intake, medications, and gallbladder stones were not present in our patient. The low CD4 count prompted workup for possible opportunistic infections of the pancreatitis. Surprisingly, evaluation for infectious etiologies was unrevealing, including syphilis (RPR negative), CMV (CMV quantitative PCR undetectable), Tuberculosis (AFB blood cultures negative), Mycoplasma (IgM negative), Histoplasma (antigen negative), and Cryptococcus (antigen negative). Further workup to determine the etiology revealed elevated IgG4 levels (117 mg/dL, normal 4 - 86 mg/dL). The patient refused to undergo EUS for tissue diagnosis. The differential diagnosis after the workup included HIV-related inflammation, autoimmune pancreatitis. An EUS-guided biopsy could not be performed as patient refused due to personal reasons. She was treated initially with a trial of steroids for possible autoimmune pancreatitis. However, the patient’s condition worsened as she continued to have abdominal pain and steroids were discontinued. Thereafter, HAART therapy was started considering the diagnosis of HIV-related inflammation of the pancreas. Subsequently, the patient started to improve and 2 months after her initial presentation, the patient was totally asymptomatic.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The incidence of pancreatitis in HIV patients is higher than general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> and risk increases with progression of the HIV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The etiologies of acute pancreatitis in HIV-infected patients, in addition to common causes, include the side effects of the medication and opportunistic infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Inflammation of the pancreas directly related to HIV has been suggested in a few reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 4 \\]</u>. The mechanism of acute pancreatitis in such cases could be related to inflammatory process related to viral replication. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT in HIV-infected patients has revealed non-specific features of acute or chronic pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Serum IgG4 in HIV patients has been reported to be low as compared to general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Even though, serum IgG4 was elevated, autoimmune pancreatitis was unlikely the etiology in our patient as the patient did not show other features of IgG4-related disease such as salivary or lacrimal gland enlargement and lymphadenopathy. The absence of tissue diagnosis and genetic analysis such as SPINK or PRSS1 to support the etiology is a major limitation in our case report. However, we are cautious in reporting that our case most likely represents pancreatitis as a direct consequence of HIV infection after the exclusion of any opportunistic infection, side effects of the medication or malignancy. The complete resolution of the clinical abnormalities after HAART re-initiation also suggests the inflammation was related to HIV infection. To the best of our knowledge, HIV-related inflammation of pancreas mimicking radiological features of autoimmune pancreatitis has been described only once before 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. This is only the second reported case of pancreatic inflammation which shared overlapping features of autoimmune pancreatitis in a patient with HIV and the first to report elevated IgG4 levels in these settings. However, the case suggests that the results of IgG4 should be considered in the setting of other clinical findings suggestive of autoimmune disease. Considering the diagnosis solely on basis of serological markers may lead to inappropriate treatment with steroids and increasing risks of adverse events in setting of immunocompromised patients. We also suggest that the physician should also consider HIV infection leading to inflammation of the pancreas as the etiology of pancreatitis in patients with poorly controlled HIV infection.\n\n【8】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【9】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abhishek Bhurwal contributed towards data gathering and writing the manuscript.

Although dabigatran is not currently approved for DVT/VTE prophylaxis in the hospitalized medical patient, recent studies demonstrate its non-inferiority compared with warfarin in the prevention of recurrent VTE. In light of this, we argue that our patient constitutes a treatment failure.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 65 year-old man with a history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, HLD, biV-ICD and atrial fibrillation on dabigatran was initially admitted for a right inguinal hernia surgery. His course was complicated by sepsis, respiratory failure requiring intubation and ventricular tachycardia which required antiarrhythmics. He was ultimately stabilized and extubated. He improved and was ambulating for several days. On the scheduled day of discharge, he was noted to be hypoxic to 86% on room air. He had mild crackles but no cough, lower extremity edema or JVD. As the patient had a complicated and lengthy hospital course, with sudden onset hypoxia, a CTPA was done to evaluate for pulmonary embolism which showed extensive pulmonary emboli bilaterally, without evidence of right heart strain.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) approved for anticoagulation in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and DVT prophylaxis in post-operative patients after knee and hip surgeries. Dabigatran is an effective anticoagulant because DTI’s suppress thrombus growth by inhibiting both fibrin-bound and free thrombin which converts fibrinogen to fibrin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Direct thrombin inhibitors are gaining favor because they require less frequent monitoring, have fewer interactions with foods and have a less variable drug availability when given twice daily 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】In 2009, the RE-LY trial compared dabigatran and warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation for stroke prevention. The primary outcome was acute stroke or systemic embolism. RE-LY studied dabigatran at doses of 110 mg and 150 mg twice daily compared with warfarin dosed to an appropriate INR. The study found that low dose dabigaran was non-inferior to warfarin and high dose dabigatran reduced risk of stroke without increasing the risk of major bleeding. This formed the basis of FDA approval for the use of dabigatran in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】Later that year, RE-COVER evaluated dabigatran versus warfarin in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism. This trial compared twice daily dabigatran and warfarin dosed to an appropriate INR with primary outcome of recurrent symptomatic, objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism and related death. Non-inferiority was demonstrated with a similar bleeding risk and safety profile. This study concluded that for the prevention of recurrent thromboembolism, dabigatran is as effective as warfarin and is associated with less bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】Other DTIs such as ximelagatran have also been shown to be as effective as the standard regimen for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. However, ximelagatran proved to be hepatotoxic. Although the FDA has not currently approved dabigatran for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism, the effectiveness of other DTIs coupled with the promising results of the RE-COVER trial support that dabigatran can potentially serve as a therapeutic anticoagulant for this indication.\n\n【9】Under this premise, our patient would be considered a treatment failure of dabigatran. Despite compliance with an appropriate dose of dabigatran, our patient developed symptomatic bilateral pulmonary emboli.

The underlying pathophysiology is still not fully understood and treatment options are limited. Herein, we are describing a patient who was taken to the emergency department with refractory ascites.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 27-year-old woman with a past medical history of diabetes type 1 associated with latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood diagnosed from the age of 11 years, ESRD secondary to diabetic nephropathy on hemodialysis (diagnosed in December 2017), bilateral diabetic retinopathy, ovarian cyst, hypertension, and anxiety was brought to the emergency department for evaluation of intractable abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. These health issues started 2 days prior to emergency visit at the hospital. The patient has a history of multiple admissions with similar presentations. She was found to have large ascites.\n\n【4】It was observed that the patient was a young woman, anxious at the moment but alert and oriented × 3. She was pale but had no jaundice or lymphadenopathy. Her blood pressure was 218/108 mm Hg. Her cardiac and respiratory exam was unremarkable.\n\n【5】Abdominal examination showed abdominal distension, mild tenderness, and positive shifting dullness. The normal bowel sounds, no dilated veins and no palpable masses were found in the examination of the abdomen. Extremities exam was remarkable for bilateral +1 leg edema.\n\n【6】Her laboratory investigations revealed blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 42 mg/dL, serum creatinine (Cr) of 6.1 mg/dL, serum calcium of 8.8 mg/dL and serum phosphorus of 4.8 mg/dL, white blood cell (WBC) of 12.0, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.6, and platelets of 428. The patient’s international normalized ration (INR) on checking was within the normal range. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast was significant for moderate to be marked as abdominal ascites with hepatomegaly and a somewhat reticular pattern of enhancement suggesting possible cirrhosis. Hepatitis B and C serology had been negative in the previous admissions of the patient. Liver function test (LFT) of the patient was also conducted which was within normal limits. Therapeutic/diagnostic paracentesis was done and resulted as: fluid appearance of xanthochromia; fluid WBC of 892/µL; fluid red blood cell (RBC) of 5,120/µL; fluid polynuclear WBC of 0%; fluid mononuclear WBCs of 0%; fluid lymphocytes of 34%; fluid unclassified cell of 66%; fluid glucose of 134 mg/dL; fluid total protein of 5.7g/dL; fluid albumin of 2.0g/dL; fluid lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) of 226 IU/L; and fluid amylase of 25 IU/L. Serum albumin from December 12, 2018 was 2.7 g/dL. SAAG was calculated to be 0.7. Cytology showed chronic inflammatory and rare mesothelial cells, and no malignant cells were identified. Culture of ascitic fluid did not grow any organisms. With predominance of lymphocytic cells, ascetic fluid was sent for acid fast bacillus (AFB) and Gold QuantiFERON test was requested. All results were negative.\n\n【7】Hepatobiliary ultrasonographic (US) exam with Doppler did not show any finding suggesting portal vein thrombosis or Budd-Chiari syndrome.\n\n【8】In the previous admission, CT scan abdomen/pelvis showed a complex ovarian cyst and cancer antigen 125 (CA-125, U/mL) was slightly elevated. Repeat CT abdomen/pelvis and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) did not reveal any ovarian cyst. Echo did not show any elevation in right ventricular pressure with ejection fraction (EF) of 60%.\n\n【9】Based on the detailed workup, hepatic, cardiac, infectious and malignant causes for ascites were ruled out. The diagnosis of ascites of nephrogenic origin was made.\n\n【10】Because of her comorbidities and non-compliance with treatment, the patient was a poor candidate for intra-abdominal dialysis and renal transplant. The patient has been treated conservatively with salt/fluid restriction and intensive hemodialysis sessions with ultrafiltration. A gradual reduction in ascites was noted and abdominal girth had been reduced by about 40% with management. But because of her non-compliance with hemodialysis sessions, the patient keep presenting to the emergency room with the same complain.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】This case represents a medical condition known as dialysis-related ascites, a problem that has been seen in ESRD patients on hemodialysis. The prognosis, prevalence and outcomes are not well known as no large evidence-based data are available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The pathogenesis of nephrogenic ascites is not well established and could be due to a combination of factors such as poor nutrition status, patient’s non-compliance, and a late presentation that results in delayed initiation of appropriate renal replacement therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】The underlying pathophysiologic factors that contribute to nephrogenic ascites formation include: 1) Hepatic vein hydrostatic pressure secondary to liver disease could lead to accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the peritoneal cavity, and the absence of varices on endoscopy and SAAG of less than 1.1 g/dL reinforce the absence of clinically significant degree of postal hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>; 2) Changes in peritoneal membrane permeability caused by an inflammatory effect of uremic toxins, circulating immune complexes, and prior exposure to dialysis solutions, hemosiderosis, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 , 6 \\]</u>; 3) Obstruction of lymphatic channels caused by inflammatory infiltrate resulting in an alteration in the peritoneal fluid absorption and ascetic fluid accumulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\- 8 \\]</u>; and 4) Other predisposing factors could be hypoalbuminemia, hyperparathyroidism, congestive heart failure, constrictive pericarditis, pancreatitis, and cirrhosis with portal hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】On biopsy, the peritoneum grossly appears normal but histological examination usually shows chronic inflammatory and mesothelial cells with a variable degree of fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The diagnosis of nephrogenic ascites is made by exclusion and requires complete workup to rule out hepatic, cardiac, infective and malignant causes of ascites. In about 15% of cases, detailed evaluation might reveal secondary causes for ascites formation.\n\n【16】Recommended evaluation for nephrogenic ascites starts with the history of the patient and their physical examination. The history of the patient shows massive ascites with minimal peripheral edema in a dialysis patient. It is also noted that the patients usually have cachexia, dialysis-related hypotension, and anorexia. The recommended general blood chemistries include BUN, Cr, LFTs, hepatitis panel, thyroid- stimulating hormone and iron studies.\n\n【17】The ultrasound of abdomen with portal venous Doppler, echocardiogram with right and left atrial pressure estimation is done when it is relevant. According to the condition of the patient, it is also suggested that abdominal CT scan, laparoscopy with peritoneal biopsy should also be done to rule out liver disease with portal hypertension, peritoneal infection/malignancy, pancreatic causes and cardiac causes such as cardiomyopathy.\n\n【18】The paracentesis and ascetic fluid analysis is of great importance to get a fair idea about the condition of the patient. The paracentesis and ascetic fluid analysis shows that the ascites has straw color which is linked with cirrhosis. Exudate (high protein), SAAG < 1.1, WBC count 25 - 150 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> with low neutrophil count and lymphocyte predominance were also observed in the paracentesis and ascetic fluid analysis. The negative cultures/AFB cultures, negative cytology were also observed. The SAAG < 1.1 indicates non-portal hypertension which is suggested to be the peritoneal cause of ascites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】If not treated, nephrogenic ascites is associated with grave prognosis. The average survival ranges from 7 to 10.7 months, with 44% chances of dying within 15 months of diagnosis. The clinical course in a patient with refractory nephrogenic ascites is marked by worsening cachexia and progression to death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 13 \\]</u>. In contrast, the majority of responders and long-term survivors had resolution of ascites with treatment. The survival rate in those patients is found to be closer to the survival rate of ESRD without ascites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Management of nephrogenic ascites is complicated and includes a variety of medical and surgical modalities. Salt and fluid restriction, intensive hemodialysis with ultrafiltration and intravenous albumin infusions with a high protein diet are given in the initial stages to control the ascites, but this is limited by severe hypotension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is also effective in the treatment of ascites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 , 10 \\]</u>. This modality of treatment improves nutrition and reduces ascites by removal of protein-rich fluid which limits the fluid shift to the peritoneal space by oncotic pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>, but this modality is often associated with protein loss secondary to repeated removal of large volume of protein-rich fluid. Peritoneovenous shunt is another option that was found to be effective in controlling nephrogenic ascites formation, but this option is not free of complications that include shunt malfunction and infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Other modalities that are associated with less predictable outcome include intra-abdominal steroid injections and binephrectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Renal transplant is the only definitive treatment for nephrogenic ascites with complete resolution of the ascites within 2 - 6 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. The recurrence of ascites may occur at any time of graft failure or at any time up to 3 years due to various reasons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】Nephrogenic ascites is a rare condition of grave prognosis. The etiology is unknown but is thought to be multifactorial. As the patient is suffering from it and the condition is not improving therefore, the initial treatment options include salt and fluid restriction, daily intensive hemodialysis with ultrafiltration along with intravenous albumin infusion and high protein diet. CAPD and peritoneovenous shunt are alternative options which are not free of complications. Renal transplant is the only definitive treatment option associated with complete resolution of the ascites but recurrence of ascites is possible within a specified time due to various reasons.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr. Jay Nfonoyim in the Department of Medicine for the supervision of the study.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors report no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RAZ is the first author, collected data, guided the literature search, and wrote the manuscript.

Multiple studies have suggested a possible link between impairment in mitochondrial metabolism due to decreased phosphocreatine in chronic hypothyroidism and subsequent elevation in a creatine kinase indicating muscle destruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-3 \\]</u>. It is common to see muscular dysfunction in the setting of hypothyroidism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Some instances have even evolved into serious complications like acute kidney injury secondary to rhabdomyolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6-9 \\]</u>. Several case reports have documented an uncommon correlation between hypothyroidism and associated acute renal failure. However, only a handful of these instances have revealed extremely critical states in which muscle tissue destruction ensued to a point where hormone re-administration, hydration, and hemodialysis failed to clinically improve renal status and patient recovery. We report one such case of severe hypothyroidism with associated rhabdomyolysis leading to acute kidney failure, wherein thyroid hormone replacement therapy and acute hemodialysis failed to resolve kidney function.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 70-year-old woman who presented with a 4-day history of progressively worsening shortness of breath was admitted to our institution. She also noted generalized myalgia, weakness, and edema with evident facial swelling. The patient additionally complained of left-sided, intermittent, non-radiating chest pain with 5/10 intensity and associated orthopnea. Her prior medical history comprised of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, adult onset hypothyroidism, cervical spinal stenosis, history of transient ischemic attack (date unknown), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/well-controlled intermittent asthma, uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathy, Parkinson’s disease, and vascular dementia. Her home medication regimen included aspirin 81 mg daily, carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily, Detemir 52 units nightly, Januvia 100 mg daily, insulin aspart 14 units three times daily, melatonin, lisinopril 5 mg daily, and synthroid 150 μg daily. The patient was noted to be poorly compliant with her medications and overall medical care.\n\n【4】On physical examination, the patient was obese and exhibited facial edema as well as bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. On admission, her laboratory tests were notable for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 717 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 227 U/L, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 169.8 μIU/mL, T3 < 1.0, free T4 < 0.4, bicarbonate level of 15 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 70 mg/dL, creatinine of 12.1 mg/dL, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 3 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> . Her baseline levels of BUN, Cr, and GFR were 11 - 17 mg/dL, 0.9 mg/dL, and 62 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> , respectively. The patient’s CKMB on admissions was 237.2 ng/mL and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was 42,670 U/L.\n\n【5】Troponin was negative when evaluated on three different occasions and separated by an 8-h time span. Additionally, EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm at a rate of 63 bpm, left axis deviation, and non-specific ST changes. Her chest radiograph displayed hyperinflated lungs compatible with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, normal heart size, and status post coronary bypass graft with sternal wires and mediastinal clips.\n\n【6】The patient was diagnosed with severe symptomatic hypothyroidism with rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney failure. Endocrinology was consulted and the patient was initiated on 100 mg hydrocortisone via IVPB with re-administration of levothyroxine 100 mg IVPB and later advanced to 150 μg. Initially, due to the patient’s acute kidney failure, nephrology recommended adequate hydration with isotonic IV fluids. However, acute hemodialysis was deemed necessary owing to the patient’s poor urine output (< 400 mL produced in any 24-h period). A non-tunneled hemodialysis catheter was therefore placed for subsequent treatment. Fluid infusion rate was decreased to avoid volume overload despite the patient’s oliguric state, and she was also given sodium bicarbonate to alkalinize her urine. Over the course of treatment, the patient was placed on calcitriol with supplemental calcium.\n\n【7】During her hospital stay, the patient received six dialysis treatments over the course of approximately 14 days. She was noted to have refused dialysis early in her care despite lengthy discussions of how this decision could greatly impact her state of health and prognosis. Nevertheless, after receiving aggressive treatments including dialysis sessions, IV fluids, IV levothyroxine, and hydrocortisone, the patient’s creatine kinase decreased from 42,670 to 1,582 U/L, serum CO <sub>2 </sub> improved from 12 to 22 mmol/L, BUN improved from 70 to 43 mg/dL, and Cr improved from 12.1 to 8.5 mg/dL. Despite improvement in CK, CO <sub>2 </sub> , BUN, and Cr, the patient’s GFR remained relatively unchanged throughout hospitalization, only improving just slightly from 3 to 5 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> . Ultimately, the patient did not wish to continue with dialysis treatments and agreed to comfort care only via hospice.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Muscle involvement is commonly found in adults who suffer from hypothyroidism, and is more likely to be found in those with severe or longstanding untreated hypothyroidism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Patients with hypothyroidism frequently have elevated creatine kinase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>. This marker for muscular damage can often be elevated for years before clinically evident features of hypothyroidism emerge. Furthermore, myalgia, in addition to muscle hypertrophy and proximal myopathy, is also observed in adults with hypothyroidism. Various case reports have noted very high serum creatine kinase and rhabdomyolysis associated with hypothyroid disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 , 6 \\]</u>. In some cases, vigorous exercise or concurrent statin therapy administration also seems to precipitate rhabdomyolysis. Rarely, rhabdomyolysis secondary to hypothyroidism can culminate into dangerous complications such as renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 \\]</u>. Thus, patients reporting fatigue or myalgia require further evaluation by measuring variations in their TSH level. Additionally, electromyography can be useful in determining whether muscle involvement is secondary to hypothyroidism as opposed to inflammatory myositis. Invasive diagnostic procedures like muscle biopsy are not typically necessary.\n\n【10】The pathogenesis of hypothyroid myopathy is poorly understood. Symptoms of muscle involvement and abnormalities in muscle function may possibly be related to the effects of hypothyroidism on cellular metabolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Thyroxine (T4) affects energy metabolism. Deficient levels of T4 can lead to abnormalities of glycogenolysis, mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, and triglyceride turnover, all of which can impact muscle function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Additionally, studies have linked a deficiency in skeletal muscle L-carnitine found in hypothyroid patients, which subsequently normalizes upon establishing a euthyroid state via hormone replacement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】As previously indicated, hypothyroid myopathy is treated by replacement of thyroid hormone. Hormone replacement therapy usually lowers creatine kinase levels, which typically return to baseline over a few weeks, indicating decreased muscle destruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 11 \\]</u>. TSH levels, however, usually require an extended period of time to normalize 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. With regard to prognosis, notwithstanding the normalization in creatine kinase and TSH levels within weeks to months, prospective analyses have indicated that actual functional muscle strength improvement requires over a year of hormone treatment along with physiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 13 \\]</u>. Initial recovery required 3.6 months of therapeutic intervention, while residual weakness resolved after a year of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Thus, usually with prompt diagnosis and treatment, patients have a good prognosis. However, in rare cases such as the one described, individuals who are refractory to therapy might require renal replacement or terminal palliative care.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:51:34", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:51:43", "cost": 9.514}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:51:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:51:25"}

It is a multisystem disorder, with predilection for small and medium sized arteries, especially coronary arteries. If left untreated, it can lead to various complications like coronary artery aneurysm, thrombosis, stenosis and even sudden death.\n\n【12】Diagnosis can be made with the established criteria of persistent fever for 5 days with additional at least four of the five following symptoms: bilateral conjunctival injection, changes in lips and oral mucosa, polymorphous exanthema, cervical lymphadenopathy, usually unilateral, changes in hands and feet: erythema, edema and desquamation. The American Heart Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend a combination of aspirin and IVIG for treating acute KD.\n\n【13】Autoimmune diseases have been associated with the presence of solid or hematological malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

Of the 3,469 patients with KD, the average age was 3 years, 11 patients (0.31%) developed cancer, with a female/male ratio of 0.56 and an incidence of 34.7/100,000 people. The 11 patients were under 20 years old and were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in five patients, bone tumors and soft tissue sarcomas in four, and leukemias in two of them.

Association with oncological disease has been shown predominantly in male children. Therefore, it is important in a patient who has criteria for KD, which does not improve with the usual treatment or starts with atypical behavior of the disease or alterations in the cell count, consider a timely diagnostic approach to concomitant oncological diseases to improve the life expectancy of the patient.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MG, JV, and JG were the treating physicians and the monitoring of the hematological disease.

Several studies have shown that the risk of progression and recurrence of non-invasive bladder neoplasia with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is lower than with other intravesical chemotherapies such as mitomycin, epirubicin and gemcitabine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Thus American and European Urology Associations recommend the use of intravesical BCG in the treatment of non-invasive cancer for all patients at high risk of disease progression and for selected intermediate risk patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】The mechanism of action of BCG is not fully understood; however, several immunological changes are reported that appear to contribute to its antitumor activity, notably by local increase in CD4 T lymphocytes and macrophages, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon-gamma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. This is a very effective immunotherapy since the bladder being a closed compartment allows high local concentrations of BCG and consequently an effective and long lasting recruitment of the immune cells.\n\n【3】Complications of intravesical BCG therapy include local and systemic reactions. Shelley et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, in a review that included six randomized trials, found that the toxicities most frequently associated with this therapy were urinary frequency (71%), cystitis (67%), fever (25%) and hematuria (23%).

He underwent transurethral tumor resection and initiated intravesical BCG instillations 1 month after surgery. He performed a total of seven intravesical instillations which were done monthly, without any registered intercurrence. Three weeks after the last instillation, the patient started with unproductive cough, fever (maximum registered 39 °C) and sweating. He went to the hospital Emergency Department and was hospitalized. At admission, the patient had a normal physical examination, except for the temperature of 38.5 °C and heart rate of 90 beats per minute. Pulmonary auscultation revealed a slightly diminished vesicular murmur, with no adventitious sounds. The patient denied dyspnoea, thoracalgia, expectoration and hemoptyses. The following laboratory alterations were found: erythrocytes 4.4 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> µL, hemoglobin 11.6 g/dL, mean globular volume 82 fL, urea 17 mg/dL, creatinine 0.66 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, gamma glutamyltransferase 133 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase 59 IU/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 4.19 mg/dL. The chest X-ray performed at admission showed no pathological changes. The patient performed blood, sputum and urine collection for bacteriological and mycological examination. Empirical antibiotic therapy with meropenem was initiated. During the first days of hospitalization, the patient maintained daily high fever peaks and his clinical condition worsened. Therefore, the diagnosis of disseminated BCG infection was considered and tuberculostatic therapy was started on the eighth day with isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and rifampicin. After the institution of the quadruple antibacterial therapy, the patient presented improvement of symptoms, with apirexia and decreased cough. On the 13th day of hospitalization, computed tomography of the thorax was performed, which revealed multiple small and diffuse pulmonary nodules, with a predominant centrilobular distribution suggesting miliary tuberculosis . There were also mediastinal adenomegalies . At the 16th day of hospitalization, the patient performed bronchofibroscopy without evidence of bacilli in the bronchoalveolar lavage and secretions. Three weeks after the onset of symptoms, chest X-ray presented a generalized reticulo nodular pattern compatible with miliary tuberculosis . During hospitalization, the patient presented progressive improvement of liver function tests and normalization of CRP. The patient was discharged after 8 days of apirexia and was followed in an outpatient Pneumology Department. Blood cultures, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage were negative. M. bovis was isolated in the urine and its antibiogram revealed resistance to pyrazinamide. Therefore, the patient started to perform triple antibacterial therapy, mantained for 2 months, followed by double therapy with isoniazid and rifampicin. He is currently in the fourth month of treatment, does not present any alterations in physical examination and remains asymptomatic.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

In addition, as it has been observed in our patient, the diagnosis is often delayed by the fact that the thorax radiography has a low sensitivity, not allowing the diagnosis in many cases with a disseminated miliary pattern later proven in CT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Sometimes the definitive diagnosis is difficult because it is not possible to isolate M. bovis nor to identify its DNA, although non-caseous granulomas are in many cases found in lung biopsies. An explanation presented in the literature relates to a cross-reaction between the autoantigens and the antigens of the mycobacteria, so a hypersensitivity response is considered being responsible for the disseminated disease. A relevant feature in the present case is the isolation of M. bovis in urine, an aspect in favor of the hypothesis of hematogenous dissemination of mycobacteria as a mechanism to explain the systemic complication. The recommended treatment is triple antibiotic therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin and etambutol) for 2 months followed by double therapy (isoniazid and rifampicin) for 4 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. It should be noted that although M. bovis is intrinsically resistant to pyrazinamide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, several cases have been described in which it was included in the treatment of these patients with no apparent impact on therapeutic success 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Our patient showed a rapid improvement in his clinical symptoms right after the start of the quadruple antibacterial therapy.\n\n【12】Although there are some risk factors described in the literature (immunocompromised state, hematological malignancy, pregnant women or breast-feeding women) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, there are no predictors of disseminated disease following intravesical BCG therapy. Thus a high level of suspicion is required in patients submitted to this therapy and who develop moderate to severe local symptoms or even systemic symptoms without apparent cause. Delaying the tuberculostatic therapy can aggravate the prognosis of miliary tuberculosis, therefore this diagnosis should be considered when evaluating this kind of clinical presentation.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflicts of interest related to this manuscript.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:11:08", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:40:44", "cost": 1776.447}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:40:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:10:58"}

PI disparity between two consecutive radiographs ran contrary to the notion that PI remains more or less constant since the mobility of the SIJs is considered negligible. By exploring the contradictory event, we postulate that PI change would be a potential role for recognizing SIJ dysfunction.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Investigations\n\n【6】A 47-year-old female investment banker complained of right buttock pain for approximately 2 months. The patient used to participate in marathon races. Six months before her first chiropractic visit, she experienced a right gluteal strain, while she was performing stair climbing exercise. The pain resolved spontaneously after 2 days. During the period of pandemic-related restrictions on mobility, she worked from home and started to frequently experience soreness in her right buttock and lower back, which could be relieved by walking and gentle stretching. However, her right buttock and low back symptoms worsened over the subsequent 2 months. Sitting could aggravate pain and prevented her from using a laptop to work from home. During her first orthopedic workup, lumbar magnetic resonance imaging did not identify abnormalities. The patient was given acetaminophen and ibuprofen for pain relief, while physiotherapy was used for treating right buttock pain. Four weeks later, she sought chiropractic attention because of the worsening of her right buttock ache that shot down her right posterior thigh and a limp on the right side while walking.\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】On examination, the patient used a cane for ambulation and had an antalgic gait affecting the right side. Standing posture observation revealed anterior pelvic tilt (PT), right pelvic drop and anterior rotation of the left pelvis. Pain was induced by axial extension, standing or leaning on the right leg. The self-reported peak pain intensity of her buttock and low back pain was 8 - 9/10 on an 11-point numeric pain rating scale, where 0 means no pain and 10 means the worst imaginable pain. Physical examination identified motion restriction at C5/6, C7/T1, T3/T4, L1/L2, and L4/L5 levels, as well as a painful right SIJ. The passive lumbar flexion and extension ranges of motion were limited. Palpation over the right SIJ elicited tenderness. The response of distraction provocation (by applying vertically pressure to the anterior superior iliac spine), compression provocation (by applying pressure to the pelvis over the iliac crest), and the thigh thrust test (by applying an anteroposterior shear force to the SIJ through the flexed hip) were positive in the right SIJ. Muscular hypertonicity was palpated at bilateral upper trapezius, left quadrates lumborum, and right gluteus medius/minimus and hamstrings. Sensory and motor functions were identical and intact bilaterally. Radiographs  revealed posterior sacral tilting (counter-nutation), forward left innominate and twisted lumbar spine. An inflammatory sclerosis (black arrow head) on the iliac side of the right SIJ was evident. Her clinical pictures, positivity in three provocation tests and radiological findings were consistent with right SIJ dysfunction.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

(b) Six months later, radiographs showed dense sclerosis surrounding the right SIJ (black arrow heads), sacral nutation (forward rotation, blue circle) and anterior pelvic tilt (yellow circle). Normally, the range of motion of the SIJ does not exceed 3° and nutation occurs during increased load-bearing situations e.g. standing and sitting.

She was started with three sessions per week. After 1 month, the patient reported buttock and low back pain reduced from 8 - 9/10 down to 2/10 on an 11-point numeric pain scale, where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates the worst pain imaginable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. She stopped her pain medication and resumed work. Thoracolumbar adjustment along with rehabilitation exercises, including hamstring stretch, gluteal squeeze and squat, were added to correct the spinal alignment and strengthen muscle functions. Treatment frequency was reduced to two times a week.\n\n【12】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【13】The patient reported complete resolution of symptoms alongside full hip and back mobility 6 months after the beginning of treatments. No adverse events had occurred. Improvements in patient’s physical function were associated with the corresponding changes in the spinopelvic alignments  and differences observed in all the radiographic parameters . The disparity in PI, sacral inclination, sacral slope (SS), etc. between the pre- and post-treatment measurements denoted destabilized condition of the SIJ complex. A comparison of initial and follow-up measurements is summarized in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. Comparison of spinopelvic parameters measured before and after chiropractic care.

(b) Six months later, interval change in all the measurements was demonstrated on the follow-up radiograph. Pelvic incidence (PI) has been considered as a static parameter in health individuals.

Comparison of Spinopelvic Parameters Before and After Treatment |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】The SIJ, by nature, is not pressure resistant to axial load or rotation in relation to the ilium. Compared to the standing position, sitting brings the lower lumbar segments to undergo flexion, thereby increasing loading on the sacrum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. A sedentary lifestyle involving little or no physical activity may generally reduce the translational activity of collagen protein for formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, and also affects the tensile strength of the tendons and ligaments, being more prone to injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. In consequence, the biomechanics of the SIJ will be altered and compromised with regard to its function of load transference and motor control, resulting in SIJ dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The history of sport-related right buttock pain of our patient could be a risk factor for a repetition of SIJ injury. Joseph et al reported that individuals with SIJ dysfunction had reduced muscle mass of the ipsilateral local and global systems, and proposed the use of exercise therapy and manual therapy for stabilizing and strengthening the muscles surrounding the SIJ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Diagnosis of SIJ dysfunction is often a challenge due to the complex anatomy and biomechanics of the joint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Clinicians typically rely on composites of pain provocation results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. These maneuvers include distraction, thigh thrust, compression, sacral thrust, Gaenslen and FABER (flexion-abduction-external rotation) tests 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 17 \\]</u>. Positivity in three out of six provocation tests was adopted as the criterion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. However, positive provocation tests are unable to distinguish between the SIJ and adjacent affected structures, having poor inter-examiner reliability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Anesthetic blocks only identifying the anatomical location of pain do not determine the etiology of SIJ pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Furthermore, SIJ pain can present through localized and/or referred pain from any stimuli in any structure segmentally innervated by L5 to S3 spinal nerves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. As such, the identification of dysfunctional joints requires a reliable modality, with a focus on functional kinematic relations and the integration of structural constructs. The identification of improper sacroiliac motions is the foundation of diagnosing SIJ dysfunction.\n\n【19】Stability and flexibility modes are simultaneously counter-opposing states in the SIJ and place conflicting demands on its joint construction. From Hippocratic times to modern times, one of the most contentious issues in SIJ research has been the mobility of the joint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Amplitudes and nature of sacroiliac motion have been debated and studied extensively. The physiological range of motion of the SIJ does not exceed 3° in rotations and 2 mm in translations along axes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In biomechanical studies, sacral rotation (nutation and count-nutation) in the sagittal plane was mainly investigated to compare with the changes of spinopelvic parameters. A dysfunctional SIJ may result in spinopelvic complex misalignment, including pelvic rotation, pelvic obliquity, lumbar rotation, and painful symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>, as seen in Figures. 1 and 2 .\n\n【20】Measuring the radiographic spinopelvic parameters such as PI, PT, and SS has gained importance in reconstructive surgery of the spine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 20 \\]</u>. The schematic diagram in Figure 2 depicts geometries for parameter measurements commonly utilized in clinical settings. PI is defined as the angle subtended by a line perpendicular to the midpoint of the sacral endplate and a line from this point to the axis of the femoral head 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. In geometry, “incidence” refers to a binary relation between different types of object in space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. PI angle remains more or less constant throughout adult life since the mobility of the SIJs is considered negligible beyond childbirth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】There have been a number of studies on the PI change in clinical settings. A retrospective study of 72 patients who had obtained flexion and extension radiographs of the lumbar spine showed that intra-individual PI change from flexion-extension was quite small, with a mean of -0.94° 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Researchers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 20 \\]</u> observed 84-88% of healthy subjects experienced a change in PI when the subjects varied their pelvic position, with a mean of 2.12° to 2.9° measured on standing radiographs. A computed tomography (CT) study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u> in 24 healthy subjects showed that PI changed by 3.2° when standing and supine positions were compared. X-ray or CT examination itself did not affect the measurements but postural changes were reflected in the results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】The angle of incidence is the algebraic sum of two dynamic angles, SS and PT. PI = SS + PT. As the sacrum is the entire weight of the spine to rest on, PI is the angle correlating with lumbar lordosis through SS and consequent spine degeneration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 24 \\]</u>. Although PI has been considered as a static parameter in health individuals, it can be seen that when the sacral inclination changes in destabilized conditions, PI changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The PI correlates strongly with the position of the sacrum in space and could contribute to a marker of SIJ stability.\n\n【23】Studies have found strong association between PI changes and destabilized conditions of the SIJ. Researchers observed the disparity of PI in patients after surgical correction of the fixed lumbar deformities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The disparity in PI after surgery was significantly greater in non-sacropelvic fixation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Sacroiliac fixation could diminish the PI variability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Mikula et al have reported an association between postural PI change and advanced SIJ degeneration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The disparity in PI angle was explained by increasing motion across the SIJ in pathological status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\- 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Radiographic measurements of PI have been independently utilized by various medical professionals after defining and agreeing to the specific manner of measurement. It should be aware that the spinopelvic parameters are dynamic and change in different positions to a few millimeters or degrees, at most 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. The implications of a variable PI could have consequences for implant placement, stabilization techniques, classification schemes, as well as for some treatment alternatives 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Remarkable PI changes need to be correlated to individual patients to determine if the changes reflect destabilized conditions of the SIJ. Understanding the associations between the sacral motion and pelvic parameters can improve clinical assessment and treatment planning.\n\n【25】Conclusions\n\n【26】As this is a retrospective study, the main limitation is lack of control group. The drawbacks of not having a control can be partially addressed by the key observational point, i.e. PI. PI remains more or less constant throughout adult life since the mobility of the SIJs is considered negligible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]</u>. PI disparity itself between consecutive measurements could be a surrogate measure for the comparison. The other limitation is that PI change was noticed after treatment, not the basis used in making diagnosis of SIJ dysfunction on the first visit. By exploring the contradictory event, we postulate that PI change would be a potential role for recognizing SIJ dysfunction. While it is often difficult to generalize results from a single case to a larger population, further studies are required to corroborate this issue and to determine the optimal interval for repeating radiography.\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no potential conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the patient for case publication.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>EC was mainly involved in diagnosis and treatment of this patient.

A mercury thermometer was broken in her hand, and wounded it accidentally. The metallic mercury inside the thermometer scattered throughout the soft tissue of the left hand. She complained of pain and redness with edema around the wound on the palm.\n\n【4】Physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory findings, such as complete blood cell count, urine analysis, serum levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes, calcium and phosphorus, and liver function tests were normal. Analysis of the arterial blood gas levels were within normal limits on room air. Chest radiograph, and ultrasound of the abdomen were normal. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the left hand showed multipl scattered metal-density opacities localized in the soft tissues around the metacarpals and carpometacarpal joint . Following her hospitalization, on the 17th May she was operated for removing the mercury and broken parts of the thermometer. Mercury could not be removed totally.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Preoperative lateral and anteroposterior radiographs of the left hand showing multipl scattered metal-density opacities localized in the soft tissues around the metacarpus. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【6】By atomic absorption method, blood mercury level was 14.1 µg/L (N: 0 - 10 µg/L), and 24-h urine mercury level was 12.0 µg/d (N: 0 - 20 µg/d) at admission on the 17th of May 2011. Over a 12-month of follow-up, the patient did not show any general or central nervous system symptoms of mercury intoxication. During this period, blood and 24-h urine mercury levels were monitored . On the 21st of September, then on the 27th of October the patient was operated in view of the elevated blood mercury levels and the potential severity of mercury intoxication if not properly treated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In the operation, it was impossible to excise all tissues where mercury had scattered because of reserving and protecting important anatomical structures like tendons and neurovascular tissues inorder to protect the hand function. Mainly residual mercury was left in the soft tissue around the carpometacarpal joint. X-ray scope used during the operation to evaluate the excision. Postoperative radiographs of the left hand showed residual metallic mercury was left in the soft tissues around the metacarpals and carpometacarpal joint  and . The histopathological examination of the removed tissue showed mercury as black pigmented globules and a foreign-body reaction with polymorphs, lymphocytes, histiocytes and fibrosis of chronic inflammation around the globules  and .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1.

The patient presented with complaints of itching skin rash and painful abdomen after the third operation. Treatment with nonspecific agents such as low-sedating antihistamines and antacids had no effect on her symptoms. The symptoms regressed in time which was related to the gradual decrease of mercury concentrations in blood. None of the systemic symptoms and signs of mercury absorption were detected, and chelation therapy with dimercaprol was not required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. She has been followed for 12 months now.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Mercury is still used in the manufacture of many technical and medical instruments, including sphygmomanometers, manometers, thermometers, and barometers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Mercury in any form is toxic. Mercury poisoning can result from vapor inhalation, ingestion, injection, or absorption through the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. The difference lies in how it is absorbed, the clinical signs and symptoms, and the response to treatment modalities. Neurologic, gastrointestinal, and renal systems are the most commonly affected organ systems in mercury exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 5 , 7 \\- 10 \\]</u>. Elemental mercury (Hg) is found in liquid form including mercury in thermometers and vaporizes at room temperature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 , 10 \\]</u>. Elemental mercury is not well absorbed by the GI tract, when ingested (eg. thermometers) is only mildly toxic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\- 7 \\]</u>, and absorption through the skin is limited unless tissue inflammation is present or the mercury is retained over a prolonged period of time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. After absorption, elementary mercury is gradually oxidized into soluble mercuric salts that bind sulfhydryl groups, resulting in enzyme inhibition and pathologic cell membrane alteration. This can lead to systemic toxicity particularly in the central nervous system and the kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 , 6 , 9 \\]</u>. Mercury is mainly excreted from the body by the kidneys, but the rate of excretion is usually very slow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, like in our patient, and traces of mercury can be seen on radiographs, and in urine even two years after the index event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Measurements of mercury in blood and urine are useful in quantifying the degree of exposure. Clinically significant poisoning with mercury is unlikely if blood and urine concentrations are below 100 µg/L 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 \\]</u>. Although in two different measurements the patient had urine mercury levels above the mentioned range, finding a measurable amount of mercury in blood and urine does not mean that the level of mercury causes an adverse health effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Individual prognosis is dependent on the severity of exposure, the form of the mercury compound, the route of administration, and the duration of exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 , 9 , 10 \\]</u> In cases of mercury poisoning, close monitoring of the clinical status of the patient is required with follow-up for at least two years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Complete recovery is possible when the exposure to inorganic (i.e. elemental, mercuric salt) and organic compounds is mild. Treatment with chelators should be considered in patients with acute symptoms arising from the central nervous system due to confirmed mercury poisoning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>. There is no proof that chelation therapy induces significant removal of subcutaneous mercury, and even in patients demonstrating increased elimination, clinical benefit may not be apparent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. As recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>, surgical excision of the mercury granulomas lowered serum and urine mercury levels in this case. There is still some metallic mercury left in the soft tissues of the hand, and the patient will be followed for the ongoing absorption which may unexpectedly cause systemic lesions.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Ankara Duzen Laboratory for measuring mercury concentrations in the blood and urine in their laboratory.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors’ Contributions</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DE and ARS acquired the data and wrote the manuscript, MT and CA did the operation and handled the specimen to the Pathology Laboratory, ET, EK, YCK, SHT and MP performed the clinical follow-up of the patient, SB performed the pathological evaluation.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Competing Interests</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:16:01", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:16:15", "cost": 14.097}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:16:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:16:00"}

In addition to the significant infectivity of the virus, the disease caused by the virus, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has demonstrated significant mortality. One of the most interesting observations about COVID-19 is the wide range of clinical manifestations it has from mild upper respiratory illness to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This report highlights one of these manifestations, namely the hypercoagulopathy suspected to be caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection as evidenced by multiple systematic reviews and case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. As the number of cases rose exponentially early on in the pandemic, investigations were underway to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms for severe disease and ultimately death. Multiple autopsy reports demonstrated evidence for microvascular thrombosis in pulmonary vessels suspected to result from pneumonitis and alveolar injury induced by the infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. In our case, we will demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection is also associated with macrovascular thrombosis, and we will discuss the implications of this complication in the management of severe COVID-19 cases who require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations and diagnosis\n\n【4】A 33-year-old Hispanic male with no past medical history presented initially with subjective fever (temperature 37.4 °C) and dry cough. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia via positive “Xpert SARS-COVID 2 PCR” nasopharyngeal swab, and computed tomography (CT) angiography chest showing multifocal, patchy, and bilateral ground-glass opacities in a peripheral distribution without any evidence for pulmonary embolism (PE) . Initially, our patient was sent home after an evaluation revealed no fever, mild tachycardia with a heart rate of 117 beats/min, mild tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min, and no increased oxygen requirement. He was given a prescription for azithromycin 250 mg daily and advice for home quarantining and supportive care.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Evaluation at that time, revealed temperature 37.2 °C, mild tachycardia with heart rate 118 beats/min, worsened tachypnea with respiratory rate 24 - 41 breaths/min, oxygen saturation down to 86% on room air, up to 92% on 4 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula, but our patient continued to have respiratory distress and shortness of breath, which were relieved only with supplemental oxygen from high-flow nasal cannula set at fraction of inspired oxygen 100% with 25 L/min of oxygen flow. Repeat CT angiography chest was completed, which again showed no evidence of PE, but interval increase of the bilateral pulmonary opacities noted on the previous CT 5 days before . The patient was initially admitted to the medical/surgical (Med/Surg) telemetry ward.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

His supplemental oxygen requirements remained high, increasing from a flow rate of 25 L/min to 35 L/min, and remaining on 100% fraction of inspired oxygen. Despite this respiratory support, he continued to desaturate as low as 88%, eventually requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation before being transferred to a tertiary care facility to undergo central veno-venous (CVV)-ECMO.\n\n【11】After transfer, the patient was given convalescent plasma and increasing doses of medical DVT prophylaxis with enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously every 12 h, as his D-dimer trended upward to 4.09 µg FEU/mL from 0.460 µg FEU/mL (normal range: 0 - 0.490 µg FEU/mL). He was also cannulated for CVV-ECMO in his right internal jugular vein (RIJV) and right common femoral vein (RCFV). A left internal jugular central venous catheter was placed for continued care. As part of CVV-ECMO therapy, the patient received a continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin with a goal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 60 - 80 throughout the whole time spent on ECMO and for one additional day. While on ECMO, the patient spent the majority of time within the target range.\n\n【12】During his hospital course, he underwent tracheostomy tube placement for failing to wean off of mechanical ventilation. Despite continuous therapeutic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin, the patient’s D-dimer continued to trend upward to a peak level of 17.79 µg FEU/mL (normal range: 0 - 0.490 µg FEU/mL). The day after decannulation, he underwent controlled ultrasound (US) venous duplex scans of the RIJV and RCFV, which revealed non-occlusive thrombi in both veins. Therapeutic dosing of anticoagulant therapy continued despite being off of CVV-ECMO given the discovery of these DVTs.\n\n【13】Repeat nasopharyngeal swab and tracheal aspirate tests for SARS-CoV-2 after 40 days were negative and the patient was subsequently transferred back to the community hospital for further care.\n\n【14】Eventually, after hospitalization for 58 days, the patient was discharged home on warfarin 7.5 mg daily with prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) monitoring as an outpatient.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】COVID-19 disease is a novel presentation of Coronaviridae, which has caused a worldwide pandemic. In addition to the multi-system organ involvement, the virus can be associated with coagulopathy as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, which has been described in systematic reviews and a few case series with an increased incidence of VTE associated with COVID-19 disease up to 6.2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The underlying cause of the hypercoagulable state induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection is suspected to be the severe systemic inflammatory response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The primary predictive marker associated with increased risk of VTE in COVID-19 patients is the D-dimer with a direct relationship between D-dimer level and increased incidence of VTE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. It should be noted that catheter-associated DVTs (CaDVT) are a known complication of CVV-ECMO, the incidence of which is reported to be in the range of 10-85% in patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Therefore, it is important to report on instances of CaDVTs in the setting of COVID-19 due to the severe extent of the disease and because of the increasing use of ECMO in the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.\n\n【17】Our case was appropriately started on CVV-ECMO for persisting hypoxic respiratory failure due to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Immediately before the initiation of CVV-ECMO, the patient’s D-dimer was 2.67 µg FEU/mL (normal range: 0 - 0.490 µg FEU/mL) and there was no evidence of VTE at that time. Despite appropriate practices to prevent thrombosis from SARS-CoV-2 and simultaneous ECMO therapy, the patient’s D-dimer continued to trend upward, and the patient developed DVTs at the cannula sites in his RIJV and RCFV. Artifoni et al showed that higher levels of D-dimer correlate positively with a higher incidence of VTE in COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Subsequently, in our case, post-decannulation US venous duplex revealed DVTs in the RIJV and RCFV.\n\n【18】Based upon ongoing available research, a wide range of incidences (23-85.4%) have been reported for CaDVT in the setting of ECMO therapy since 2017 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\- 10 \\]</u>. Because of this inconsistency in incidence reports, there is currently no universal guideline for post-decannulation US scans to check for VTE at cannulation sites. Current recommendations from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) are to screen patients based on clinical suspicion in each individual case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. However, given that COVID-19 disease is suspected to be associated with hypercoagulopathy and that there are already varying reports of CaDVT associated with ECMO therapy, some with rates alarmingly high more than 60% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, protocols for ECMO therapy would benefit from the addition of routine post-decannulation screening recommendations. At least, during the current pandemic, patients with COVID-19 who require ECMO therapy would benefit from routine screening within 24 - 48 h post-decannulation to ensure that potentially life-threatening diagnoses are not missed.\n\n【19】Data indicating that the rates of using ECMO in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are scarce, although the ELSO registry shows that there are 3,360 confirmed COVID-19 cases currently receiving ECMO therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Without having reliable data about the current number of active cases, which is difficult to ascertain because, while death rates are reported promptly, recovery rates are not, it is too complicated to establish an estimation of the rate of ECMO therapy usage in COVID-19 cases.\n\n【20】In conjunction with this difficulty, there are even fewer reports of VTE post-ECMO-decannulation. To our knowledge, there is a single article by Belys et al in the British Journal of Anaesthesiology, which describes 12 patients who were treated with CVV-ECMO for severe COVID-19 ARDS between March 1, 2020 and April 4, 2020 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Of these, six patients were noted to have VTE, four of which were discovered during cannulation for CVV-ECMO, one of which developed massive PE as a result of cannulation and died, one of the six developed CaDVT, and the remaining two patients of six developed intra-circuit thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The conclusion of this paper was that screening for VTE prior to the initiation of CVV-ECMO in COVID-19 ARDS patients should be done. However, since VTE is a known complication of CVV-ECMO by itself without the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and since currently during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the infection is strongly suspected to induce hypercoagulopathy, our case shows that screening before starting ECMO therapy would not be enough. Therefore, we argue that protocols should be written recommending screening for VTE with Doppler US both pre-cannulation and post-decannulation related to CVV-ECMO therapy in COVID-19 patients.\n\n【21】To our knowledge, hypercoagulopathy with COVID-19 disease is an uncommon occurrence based on the evidence currently available. However, the severity of the disease makes further research into this subject crucial especially since data regarding VTE in COVID-19 patients are increasing. In addition, as a large number of severe COVID-19 ARDS cases require ECMO therapy during the course of treatment, a protocol to screen patients for VTE post-ECMO-decannulation would be especially useful in this patient population given the high degree of suspicion that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a hypercoagulable state.\n\n【22】Learning points\n\n【23】COVID-19 has many disease manifestations with growing evidence suggesting the disease induces a hypercoagulable state. Many COVID-19 cases are severe enough to warrant ECMO therapy during the course of treatment. ECMO therapy carries a risk of VTE by itself but this risk is likely worsened by COVID-19 with dire consequences. To mitigate these consequences, we recommend updating current protocols for managing COVID-19 patients who require ECMO therapy with pre-cannulation and post-decannulation US venous duplex to screen patients for possible VTE.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr. Garg and Dr. Yazdanpanah devised the project, reviewed the case in great detail, and wrote the paper.

They make up 0.3 to 0.9% of female breast tumors. They occur in women aged 35 to 55 years. The tumor is rarely found in adolescents and the elderly. They have been described as a giant type of fibroadenoma. The World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the term phyllodes tumor and as described by Rosen subclassified them histologically as benign, borderline, or malignant according to the features such as tumor margins, stromal overgrowth, tumor necrosis, cellular atypia, and number of mitosis per high power field 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 2 \\]</u>. The majority of phyllodes tumors have been described as benign (35% to 64%), with the remainder divided between the borderline and malignant subtypes. The term phyllodes tumor represents a broad range of fibroepithelial diseases and presence of an epithelial component with stromal components differentiates the phyllodes tumor from other stromal sarcomas. Unlike carcinoma breast, phyllodes tumors start outside of the ducts and lobules, in the breast’s connective tissue. In addition to stromal cells, phyllodes tumors can also contain cells from the ducts and lobules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Accurate preoperative pathological diagnosis allows correct surgical planning and avoidance of reoperation. Malignant phyllodes tumors, if inadequately treated, have a propensity for rapid growth and metastatic spread. In contrast, benign phyllodes tumors on clinical, radiological, and cytological examination are often indistinguishable from fibroadenomas and can be cured by local surgery. With the non-operative management of fibroadenomas widely adopted, the importance of phyllodes tumors today lies in the need to differentiate them from other benign breast lesions. Treatment can be either wide local excision or mastectomy provided histologically clear specimen margins are ensured. The role of adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy remains uncertain, but encouraging results using radiotherapy and chemotherapy for soft-tissue sarcomas suggest that consideration should be given for their use in cases of malignant phyllodes tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 42-year-old female patient presented in our department with a 4-month history of palpable mass on the left breast. There was no family history of breast cancer. In clinical examination there was a protruding and hardened palpable mass occupying the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Signs of axillary involvement were not evidenced.\n\n【5】During the diagnostic investigations, the patient was submitted to mammography and ultrasound. Mammogram showed a hyper dense rounded mass measuring approximately 30 mm with well-defined margins in the left breast. Ultrasound showed rounded confluent lesion with well-defined and regular contour, with cystic areas in its interior, posterior acoustic enhancement and internal flow to color-flow Doppler examination.\n\n【6】Ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy (core biopsy) was performed on the breast lesion, which revealed a biphasic neoplasm with malignant stromal component.\n\n【7】Because of the malignant result on core biopsy the patient underwent left wide local excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Surgical margins were free of tumor and axilla was clear. The histopathological analysis of the surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis of a malignant phyllodes tumor.\n\n【8】The patient underwent adjuvant radiotherapy in the left breast and received 40 Gy in 15 fractions with IMRT technique. No radiation related skin toxicity was seen. The patient continues being followed up in a yearly basis.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Malignant phyllodes tumor is a rare lesion of the breast that can mimic benign masses such as fibroadenomas on clinical diagnosis but is characterized by a typical rapid growth. They usually occur in middle-aged women ranging in age from 35 to 55 years old. They are classified into benign, malignant, and borderline tumor according to histopathologic features. They are rare fibroepithelial neoplasms, which represent roughly 0.3% - 0.9% of all breast cancers. Like fibroadenomas, phyllodes tumors are composed of epithelial elements and a connective tissue stroma, but phyllodes tumors have higher stromal cellularity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】The term “phyllodes” means leaf like and refers to the papillary projections that are seen on microscopic examination. The diagnosis of phyllodes has been well established in commendations of the WHO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A benign phyllodes tumor is characterized by mildly increased stromal cellularity and irregular borders. In contrast, a fibroadenoma whilst may have increased stromal cellularity usually has a circumscribed margin but this cannot be assessed on the biopsy. Therefore it may be difficult to distinguish a fibroadenoma and phyllodes tumor on biopsy. Furthermore, the distinction of benign and borderline phyllodes using the criteria of increased stromal cellularity, stromal atypia and mitoses can be very subjective and hence the accurate diagnosis is usually made only on the excision specimen. A malignant phyllodes tumor is distinguished from a benign/borderline phyllodes tumor by the presence of marked stromal cellularity, cellular atypia and mitotic activity of at least 10/10 high power field 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Surgical resection remains the gold standard of treatment, whereas radiation therapy and chemotherapy have a more undefined role. Most studies recommend a more than 1- to 2-cm excision margin based on the evidence that local recurrence occurs more frequently in patients with narrow surgical margins less than 1 - 2 cm. However, an excision of this size is not possible because of the large size of the tumor and the minimal remaining normal breast tissue.\n\n【13】Clinically, phyllodes tumors tend to present as enlarging pain-less breast masses that stretch the overlying skin. Though ulceration and nipple retraction have been reported, they remain uncommon. The median size of phyllodes tumors are usually 4 cm though recently in the literature there has been reports of large tumor size up to 50 cm and these are mostly malignant. Palpable axillary lymphadenopathy has been reported in up to 20% of cases but these are often reactive in nature and metastatic involvement of axillary lymph nodes is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】There are no pathognomonic mammographic or ultrasound features of phyllodes tumor. However, a recent retrospective study suggests a tumor size of greater than 3 cm, irregular shape, micro lobulated margins, complex internal echo pattern and hyper vascularity were significant findings of phyllodes tumor. Presence of internal cystic areas on MRI also was predictive of phyllodes tumors. Thus imaging may still serve as an aid to identify phyllodes tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. However, a core biopsy remains the best investigation for preoperative diagnosis. Though most cellular fibroepithelial lesions are fibroadenomas, surgeons should take into account the clinical presentation, image findings and the pathologist input how likely a phyllodes is present. This allows planning of the intended surgical margins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Surgical management is the mainstay but the type of surgery has been a source of debate over the years. Studies have shown no differences between breast conserving surgery versus mastectomy in terms of metastasis-free survival or overall survival, despite the higher incidence of local recurrence that comes with breast conserving surgery. If diagnosed preoperatively, tumor should be resected with at least 1 cm margins particularly in the borderline and malignant phyllodes tumors. This can be accomplished by either lumpectomy or mastectomy, depending upon the size of the tumor relative to the breast. Local recurrence and 5-year survival rates of 4% and 96% respectively have been reported for benign phyllodes tumors diagnosed after local excision of what appeared to be a fibroadenoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Whether patients with benign phyllodes tumors who have undergone local excision and have histologically positive specimen margins should undergo further surgery or be entered in surveillance program remains controversial. Re-excision of borderline and malignant phyllodes tumors identified after local excision should be considered. Successful management of phyllodes tumor involves wide excision with adequate margins. Most advocate a surgical margin of 1 cm. Routine axillary dissection is not recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not been proven to be useful in the treatment of phyllodes tumor. Adjuvant radiotherapy has been proven to be beneficial in patients with adverse features like bulky tumors, close or positive surgical margins, hyper cellular stroma, high nuclear pleomorphism, high mitotic rate, presence of necrosis, and increased vascularity within the tumor and tumor recurrence. Radiotherapy is usually recommended only for cases with positive or near-positive surgical margins and selected cases whose further surgical procedures cannot be performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Chemotherapy, including anthracyclines, cisplatin, and etoposide, has been mentioned in various studies but with no survival advantage. The use of hormonal therapy, such as tamoxifen, has not been fully investigated in cystosarcoma phyllodes. Still, the use of endocrine therapy in either the adjuvant or palliative setting has not been extensively studied 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The prognosis for malignant phyllodes tumors is poor, and the role of the variety of treatment modalities is not clearly defined because of how rare the disease actually is. The most common path of spread is hematogenous, which occurs mostly in the lungs, pleura, and bones, such as in sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Conclusions\n\n【19】Phyllodes tumors are rare causes of rapidly enlarging painless breast masses in middle age women. A core biopsy is needed for diagnosis but often, definitive diagnosis is only obtained after excision. The surgeon should take into account the clinical and imaging characteristics to assess the likelihood of presence of phyllodes to decide the extent of margins needed during surgery. The patient must be adequately counselled for possibility of further surgery and adjuvant treatment depending on the final histology. Further studies should be done so as to establish a golden standard treatment for the overall management of this rare entity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:16:38", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:18:37", "cost": 118.79}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:18:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:16:38"}

It can be classified into alpha (α)- and beta (β)-thalassemia. Alpha-thalassemia occurs when there is a deletion of one or more α-globin genes (located on chromosome 16), leading to reduced or absent synthesis of α-globin chains 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Hemoglobin (Hb) Bart’s disease involves the complete loss of all four α-globin genes (—/—), resulting in no α-globin chain production 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is the most severe form of α-thalassemia, usually leading to death in utero or shortly after birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Thalassemia is inherited in a simple autosomal recessive Mendelian pattern. Hb Bart’s disease is usually due to inheritance of α-thalassemia cis deletion (—/αα) from each parent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and couples who are both carriers of this deletion have a 25% chance of having a child affected by Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. We present a case of Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis syndrome due to uniparental disomy.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】The patient was a 32-year-old gravida 2 para 0 Chinese woman with a previous history of a right tubal ectopic pregnancy and a family history of thalassemia. She had an early dating scan at 8 weeks of gestation. First trimester Down’s syndrome screening was performed at 12 + 2 weeks of gestation, with ultrasound scan showing that fetal nasal bone was present, but fetal nuchal translucency was thickened at 5 mm . Adjusted risks of trisomy 21 (Down’s syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edwards’ syndrome) and trisomy 13 (Patau’s syndrome) were 1 in 30, 1 in 25, and 1 in 352, respectively. Non-invasive prenatal testing revealed a low probability of trisomy 21, 18 and 13, low probability of sex chromosome aneuploidy and no evidence of Digeorge syndrome. Antenatal blood tests done showed that the patient had an Hb level of 9.6 g/dL with low MCV of 72.9 fL. Hb electrophoresis did not reveal any abnormal Hb band and blood group and antibody screen showed that her blood group was O+ with no significant red cell antibodies. Her husband had a normal Hb (15.6 g/dL) and MCV (86.0 fL). His Hb electrophoresis did not reveal any abnormal Hb band. The patient underwent amniocentesis at 16 + 1 weeks of gestation. Amniotic fluid sent for karyotyping showed a female karyotype (46XX) with no apparent chromosomal abnormalities. Chromosome microarray (CMA) was also sent.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. First trimester ultrasound showing fetal thickened nuchal translucency (arrow). |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】Mid-trimester fetal anomaly ultrasound scan at 19 weeks showed signs of hydrops fetalis. An enlarged fetal heart with pericardial effusion  and suspicion of possible atrial septal defect (ASD) was noted. Scalp edema  and ascites  were also seen. Fetal middle cerebral arterial peak systolic velocity (MCA PSV) was also elevated at 41 cm/s (> 1.5 MoM) suggesting fetal anemia. Fetal 2D echocardiogram at 20 + 4 weeks of gestation showed moderate pericardial effusion, moderate secundum ASD and mild tricuspid regurgitation. Doppler ultrasound showed persistently elevated MSA PSV at 43 cm/s (> 1.5 MoM). Infective screening tests for cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis and parvovirus were negative. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) indicated that the patient was a heterozygous carrier of the SEA type 2 α-globin gene (-SEA) deletion and her husband did not carry any α-globin gene deletion. Multiplex PCR on DNA from amniocentesis showed that the fetus was homozygous for SEA type 2 α-globin gene deletion. Maternal contamination was excluded. CMA showed two regions of absence of heterozygosity (AOH) on the terminal p and q arm of chromosome 16, respectively: 16q21q24.3 and 16p13.3p13.2, which raised the suspicion of maternal uniparental disomy.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

In Singapore, a multiracial Southeast Asian country, 6.4% of Chinese, 4.8% of Malays and 5.2% of Indians were found to be carriers of α-globin gene mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Routine antenatal screening for thalassemia is conducted for all pregnant women in Singapore by measurement of maternal MCV and Hb electrophoresis. A low measurement of maternal MCV will warrant a measurement of paternal MCV. Genetic testing for α-thalassemia will also be offered. A low maternal MCV and normal paternal MCV usually do not trigger further investigation since the child should not be affected by thalassemia major syndromes if we follow the typical Mendelian autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.\n\n【16】We present a rare case of Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis syndrome due to maternal uniparental disomy at chromosome 16. Uniparental disomy refers to the inheritance of a pair of chromosomes from only one parent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Although maternal uniparental disomy at chromosome 16 is commonly associated with intrauterine growth restriction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, it has been associated with unmasking of recessive conditions, such as α-thalassemia major and Fanconi anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Several cases of maternal uniparental disomy leading to Bart’s hydrops fetalis syndrome have been reported by Kou et al, Au et al and Wattanasirichaigoon et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\- 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】This case highlights the limitations of thalassemia screening with parental MCV. Firstly, using the threshold of MCV < 80 fL may not detect all patients who are thalassemia carriers, and there are cases of α-globin gene deletions found in patients with MCV > 80 fL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Moreover, similar to our case, in the cases reported by both Kou et al and Au et al, only one parent was a carrier of α-thalassemia. This suggests that a normal MCV and negative thalassemia screen in a single parent may not rule out fetal Hb Bart’s disease due to the rare occurrence of maternal uniparental disomy.\n\n【18】In our case, signs of fetal hydrops were noted on mid-trimester ultrasound screening. Further investigation of the cause of fetal hydrops led to the discovery that the fetus was affected by Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis syndrome, which is the commonest cause of hydrops fetalis in Southeast Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. The fetus was found to be homozygous for SEA type 2 α-globin gene deletion, which is the main cause of the Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis in Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. This highlights the importance of a mid-trimester screening ultrasound even if only one parent is a thalassemia carrier. Although not available in all Asian countries, a mid-trimester ultrasound screening for fetal anomalies is performed for all antenatal patients in Singapore from 18 to 20 + 6 weeks as recommended by the NICE guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】In conclusion, uniparental disomy of chromosome 16 is a rare but possible cause of Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis and should be considered in cases with sonographic features of fetal hydrops, even in cases where only one parent is an α-thalassemia carrier.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to acknowledge the valuable input and support from the doctors and sonographers from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Singapore General Hospital, as well as the doctors from the Genetics Service, KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors were involved in conception and editing of the manuscript.

There are regional differences in the incidence of mushroom poisoning globally, but high-quality epidemiological data are lacking. The average annual incidences were estimated to be 1.7 cases per 100,000 in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and 5.0 cases per 100,000 in Switzerland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.

Only isolated cases were reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\- 14 \\]</u>, but the exact incidence worldwide is unknown.\n\n【2】Muscarine is most commonly found in mushrooms such as Inocybe and Clitocybe species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

(b) An Inosperma species collected by hikers from a mountain. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【4】When muscarinic mushrooms are ingested, muscarine stimulates postganglionic cholinergic receptors in the autonomic nervous system, causing a cholinergic toxidrome that may include symptoms such as diarrhea, urinary frequency, miosis, bradycardia, bronchorrhea, vomiting, lacrimation, lethargy and hypersalivation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 18 \\]</u>. Clinical manifestations of muscarine poisoning are usually mild and self-limiting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, but fatal cases due to parasympathetic overdrive causing severe hemodynamic compromise have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Here we report two cases of cholinergic poisoning with exposure to muscarinic mushrooms in Hong Kong. The clinical and biochemical features are described and compared with reported cases in the literature.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】Investigations\n\n【8】A 49-year-old woman and a 37-year-old man presented to the emergency unit with an acute onset of gastrointestinal symptoms including epigastric pain, vomiting and diarrhea; this was followed by salivation, palpitations and diaphoresis approximately 1 h after the ingestion of two tablespoons of cooked wild mushrooms picked from a local country park. The clinical presentations were compatible with a cholinergic toxidrome. The patients also complained of lower limb numbness and drowsiness. There was no hallucination, chest pain or shortness of breath.\n\n【9】The patients were normotensive and had stable vital signs. Physical examination of the patients revealed miosis (bilateral equal pupil size 2 mm) with an otherwise unremarkable neurological examination. Their Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15/15. There was no muscle power deficit with normal tendon reflexes and intact sensation. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with normal heart rate. Biochemical tests revealed that the female patient had mildly elevated liver enzymes (alanine transaminase 50 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase 114 IU/L) and a normal total bilirubin of 9 µmol/L. The other patient had normal liver function test results. The complete blood counts, serum amylase and glucose were all unremarkable.\n\n【10】Diagnosis\n\n【11】A mushroom specimen was collected from the patients, and this was sent to a mycologist for identification . The small, cooked mushroom measuring 1.5 cm in length was identified by the mycologist to be Psathyrella incerta. The morphological identification result, however, could not explain the patients’ clinical cholinergic toxidrome.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. A small (1.5 cm in length) piece of cooked mushroom saved by the patients for morphological identification. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【13】The apparent cholinergic toxidrome led to a suspicion of muscarine mushroom poisoning. A urine specimen was collected after admission to look for muscarine toxin, which was extracted and tested using a liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method.\n\n【14】To extract muscarine from urine specimens, different solid phase extraction (SPE) methods were tested to give the cleanest extract for analysis. As muscarine is a quaternary amine, which is known to be a very polar compound and a strong base, Waters HLB, MCX and WCX cartridges were chosen for optimization. The mixed-mode weak ion exchange SPE method using Waters WCX cartridge, which is a cation exchange sorbent, was shown to produce the best signals. Edrophonium was used as an internal standard as it shares similar chemical properties with muscarine. The sample was subjected to a liquid-chromatography using a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) column for polar analytes and a tandem mass spectrometry method using SCIEX 5500Q operating in the multiple ion monitoring (MRM) mode. The MRM is obtained by infusing standard muscarine chloride hydrate into the system. The compound was monitored by three MRM transition pairs (174.1→57.1, 174.1→115.1 and 174.1→60.1). The percentage relative intensities of the three transition pairs were compared with and should correspond to that of the reference standard. A negative and two levels of urine positive quality control (QC) spiked at 6 and 10 ng/mL respectively were performed on each analysis.\n\n【15】The limit of detection of 2 ng/mL was obtained by spiking five level standards in 10 urine matrixes. The limit of quantification was not determined and no calibration curve was obtained as this was a qualitative test only. Ten patient urine specimens and 10 negative control specimens were obtained from individuals known to be free from muscarine exposure; no non-specificity was observed. The analytical results are reported qualitatively as detected or not detected. Muscarine was subsequently identified in patients’ urine specimens, thus confirming muscarine exposure.\n\n【16】Treatment\n\n【17】The Poison Information Centre was consulted. The patients were given supportive treatment at the emergency department. Activated charcoal was given to the patients under close monitoring. Intravenous fluids were not used as there was no significant hypotension observed in these patients. Atropine was considered in view of the cholinergic toxidrome but it was not given to the patients as their cholinergic symptoms were self-limiting.\n\n【18】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【19】The patients were subsequently transferred to medical wards for close observation for a further 24 h to look for any delayed presentations. Blood tests for liver and renal function tests were repeated and were unremarkable. Their gastrointestinal and cholinergic symptoms gradually subsided. After 3 days of hospital stay, they fully recovered. The patients were discharged with follow-up appointments scheduled 2 months after the admission.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】We reported two cases of cholinergic mushroom poisoning with classical signs and symptoms. Muscarine was detected in patients’ urine specimens which confirmed the diagnosis.\n\n【22】Muscarinic mushroom poisoning cases typically have a mild clinical course and a rapid onset time within 30 to 120 min of exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 , 13 , 14 \\]</u>. An exception was reported in one Israeli patient who presented 5 h after consuming toxic mushrooms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The symptoms usually subside within 24 h. Gastrointestinal symptoms are the most frequently reported with up to 90% of patients experienced symptoms mimicking gastroenteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Profuse sweating is the most useful clinical presentation in differentiating poisoning induced by cholinergic mushrooms and gastroenteritic mushrooms (personal communication, Dr. CK Chan). In our case, both patients reported profuse sweating, salivation and palpitations 40 min after ingesting wild mushrooms. They also complained of drowsiness, which was unexpected as muscarine is not known to cross the blood-brain barrier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In a review of 14 cases by Lurie et al, none of the patients had central muscarinic effects which may include sedation, rigidity or convulsions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The presentation and the severity of symptoms can vary among individuals from the same cluster of poisoning cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】It is estimated that the mushroom toxins remained unidentified in more than 90% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Currently, morphological examination remains the gold standard for identifying toxic mushrooms. In our report, the unknown mushroom was identified to be Psathyrella incerta . From the literature, Psathyrella incerta has a clear yellowish, convex cap and non-distinctive odour and taste 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. However, it was neither known to contain muscarine nor associated with cholinergic toxidromes upon ingestion. Morphological identification is laborious and requires experts with local mycological knowledge. Microscopic examination of intact mushroom is seldom possible in the emergency setting where clinical samples are often incomplete and may come in the form of leftovers from a cooked dish, vomitus or gastric lavages. Contrary to common misconceptions, muscarine is a thermostable compound and is not destroyed by cooking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Biochemical detection of muscarine helps to determine patients’ prognosis and treatment options.\n\n【24】Treatment of cholinergic mushroom poisoning is mainly supportive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 14 , 18 \\]</u>. In our case, gastric decontamination using activated charcoal was given. Repeated doses of activated charcoal were shown to enhance the excretion of amatoxin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>, but its role in excreting muscarine remains controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 14 \\]</u>. In cases with hypotension and severe symptoms associated with muscarine overstimulation, intravenous atropine may be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. In a case series reported by Lurie et al, five out of 14 patients required low-dose atropine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, whereas two out of five patients from the same family in Malaysia required atropine treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Fluid resuscitation should be provided to correct any volume depletion or electrolyte imbalance. In our case, one patient was noted to have elevated liver transaminases. In a small case series, Chew et al also reported two patients from the same family with deranged liver function tests 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>, whereas Lurie et al reported one middle-aged female with mild renal impairment, probably caused by fluid depletion from recurrent vomiting and diarrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These patients should be closely monitored for any liver or renal impairment. Cholinergic mushroom poisoning is mostly self-limiting and only on rare occasions fatal cases were reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. In the United States, none of the fatal cases reported in a retrospective review was induced by cholinergic mushrooms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Muscarinic mushrooms, often with appearances mimicking edible mushrooms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, tend to fruit in urban area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. In our case, the mushrooms were picked in a country park. With the discovery of more diverse muscarine-containing species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 , 13 \\]</u>, it is important for medical professionals to be aware of these mushrooms being the culprits of such toxidromes.\n\n【26】In conclusion, we have reported two cases of cholinergic mushroom poisoning. The clinical features and mushroom species associated with cholinergic toxicity are likely under-reported and under-diagnosed. The course of illness is usually mild and self-limiting with the management mainly being supportive. Muscarine testing may be advantageous for the early confirmation of the diagnosis and to uncover cases of poisoning induced by muscarinic mushrooms.\n\n【27】Learning points\n\n【28】Cholinergic mushroom poisoning is uncommon - only a limited number of cases were reported in the literature. Clinical presentations of profuse sweating, salivation and palpitation, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms, are experienced by patients with a rapid time of onset. Together with a history of consuming wild mushrooms, poisoning by muscarine-containing fungi needs to be considered. Muscarine testing in the urine or other biological specimens would be particularly useful in confirming the diagnosis in cases with ambiguous presentations. It would also serve as an important tool for prognostication purposes and clinical surveillance.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Prof. S.W.

We report a case of a patient with HIV and KS, who developed bilateral chylothorax as a manifestation of IRIS, after the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 37-year-old HIV-infected man was transferred to the thoracic surgery department due to bilateral chylothorax. The patient presented with respiratory distress and also malnutrition, hypovolemia and electrolyte imbalance. During his 30-day hospitalization, a central line and parenteral nutrition with medium chain triglycerides had been started in order to medically treat the condition. The diagnosis of chylothorax was documented based on bilateral thoracentecis with pleurocath and the appearance of a milky (chylous) pleural effusion with an elevated triglyceride level (> 110 mg/dL). One week after pleurocath insertion, a fever up to 38 °C complicated chylothorac. Antibiotis was started (teicoplanin 400 × 2, meropenem 1 × 3, itraconazole sir 10 × 2) along with antiretroviral treatment. The patient was treated with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with clip ligation of the thoracic duct with talc pleurodesis at first at the right side . Twenty days later, we operated on the left side. Postoperatively, in the second operation, the patient developed an acute respiratory distress syndrome and stayed for 24 h at the intensive care unit. The distress syndrome was probably a result of pulmonary edema due to lung re-expansion. Another possible explanation was an systemic reaction due to talc pleurodesis. The patient was extubated 20 h later and was discharged 10 days later in stable clinical condition. Three years later, the patient is stable in excellent clinical condition.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. (a) Initial intraoperative view.

An acute onset of pleural effusion and the presence of turbid fluid that does not clear when centrifuged or that contains at least 1.24 mmol/L (110 mg/dL) triglyceride establish the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In advanced HIV infection, chylothorax may also be caused by infiltration of the thoracic duct by KS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Chylothorax, the presence of lymph in the pleural space, has remained a difficult clinical challenge for which the ideal treatment has not been well established. The general approach to the problem varies in that some clinicians adopt early surgical intervention while others adopt a conservative approach to the problem.\n\n【10】The treatment of chylous pleural effusions required prompt and aggressive measures. Although conservative approach may have a role to play in small chylothoraces, therapeutic thoracentesis and tube thoracostomy are the initial step in large chylothoraces that cause respiratory distress. During the period of excessive chyle leak, patients are generally advised nil by mouth or a diet rich in low fat, medium-chain triglycerides. Many follow guidelines that Selle and associates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u> suggested. They propose surgery in trauma, daily loss of chyle exceeds 1,500 mL in adults or > 100 mL/kg body weight per day in a child, when the output of chyle is not diminished over a 14-day period, or when nutritional complications seem imminent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Graham et al recommend that surgical intervention is highly effective and seems warranted if the chylothorax has not responded after 5-7 day trial of medical therapy in both adults and children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Our patient was treated with VATS with talc pleurodesis and the result was excellent. Its use specially for chylothorax has only a few case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】VATS offers the advantage of access to the entire hemithorax with excellent visualization of the mediastinal structures including the thoracic duct, without the morbidity of thoracotomy. It also allows application of clips to the thoracic duct at the aortic hiatus, or to thoracic duct injuries or pleural defects at other sites. Finally, it allows chemical pleurodesis and application of talc or fibrin glue as required.\n\n【13】In the past, the mortality due to chylothorax was in excess of 50%. Currently, the morbidity and mortality have improved due to the more aggressive management strategies adopted. VATS offers the advantage of successful treatment of chylothorax while avoiding thoracotomy. The limited incisions of thoracoscopy produce less postoperative pain, less rehabilitation time and less recovery time, while accomplishing the same desired outcome. We strongly propose VATS for the management of chylothorax for these reasons.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:58:28", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:59:08", "cost": 39.811}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:59:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:58:28"}

Depletion of lymphocytes and impaired CNS immune surveillance are thought to be predisposing factors. Natalizumab (NTZ) treatment is associated with an increased risk of PML, though the exact pathogenic mechanisms are still not fully understood. PML should be diagnosed as early as possible but this may sometime be difficult as the clinical presentation of PML is often similar to a multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse. Diagnosis is based on a combined analysis of clinical course, brain MRI scans, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for JCV.\n\n【2】NTZ treatment should be suspended immediately on suspicion of PML and their clearance can be accelerated by plasma exchange (PLEX) therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, though re-establishment of CNS immunosurveillance is often associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), characterized by inflammatory changes on MRI. Information on the immune cells and mediators involved in PML is patchy. We describe the sequential clinical and radiological features of PML from onset in an NTZ-treated relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patient and provide data on CSF JCV copies and immune cell counts in CSF and peripheral blood (PB). The study was conducted at the Neurology Department of the Gregorio Maranon University Hospital (Madrid) and approved by the local ethics committee.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】We report a 47-year-old man with a 20-year history of RRMS on NTZ after failure to control disease activity with interferon beta and glatiramer acetate therapy. While on NTZ treatment (300 mg every 4 weeks for 27 months), he had remained free of disease activity (no clinical relapses and no new T2 or Gd <sup>+ </sup> \\-enhancing T1 lesions) and the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score was stable at 4.5. He was evaluated due to worsening of cerebellar and pyramidal symptoms affecting both lower limbs and left hand apraxia in the previous month (EDSS, 5.5). A cranial MRI scan was consistent with PML  and he was seropositive for JCV. The CSF (January17, 2012) revealed 75 copies/mL of JCV. pDCs and CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells were predominant in CSF with respect to PB , and the IgG index was 0.75 (normal ≤ 0.7). NTZ was discontinued and the patient received six PLEX sessions followed by IV-IgG 0.4 g/kg/day for 4 days.\n\n|  Figure 1. Serial MRI images. At baseline, axial proton-density spin-echo images showed hyperintense lesions in cortical and juxtacortical areas of the frontal lobes (A1). Abnormal hyperintensity of the middle cerebellar peduncles was also observed on axial turbo-spin-echo (TSE) T2-weighted images (A2), consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). After administration of gadolinium, a subtle enhancement of these lesions on axial T1-weighted magnetization transfer (MT) images was observed (A3 and A4). After 6 weeks, progression of the PML lesions on axial double inversion recovery (DIR) images (B1) and TSE T2-weighted images (B2) was observed. In addition, Gd \\+ contrast enhancement became more conspicuous on axial T1-weighted MT images (B3 and B4). In the cerebral MRI performed after 15 weeks, the hyperintense lesions on the frontal lobes and middle cerebral peduncles had enlarged, as shown on axial DIR images (C1) and on TSE T2-weighted images (C2). Worsening of these findings was more subtle in the frontal lobes (C4) than in the cerebellum (C3) by axial post-contrast T1-weighted MT images. Cerebral-MRI performed after 31 weeks showed improvement in PML lesions as shown on DIR images (D1 and D2). MRI findings suggested neurodegenerative phenomena as we observed hyperintensity of pontocerebellar fibers (arrow) on axial TSE T2-weighted images (D3) and atrophy at previous PML lesions in the cerebral hemispheres. These findings were more conspicuous in the right precentral gyrus (arrow) on T1 inversion recovery image (D4). |\n| --- |\n\n| Table 1. Cellular Immunological Changes in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and Peripheral Blood (PB) During the Course of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy in a Patient With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Treated With Natalizumab |\n| --- |\n\n【7】After 6 weeks, lower limb kinetic tremor and left partial motor seizures were observed. The MRI lesions worsened . In CSF analysis, 475 JCV copies/mL and IgG index of 0.56 were found. A marked CSF increase in CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and CD19 <sup>+ </sup> B cells and decreased CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and pDCs compared with PB (February 24, 2012) were found.\n\n【8】MRI after 15 weeks showed worsening of the previous findings .\n\n【9】After 4 months, the patient presented a new spinal cord relapse at T8 level. Increase in CD4 <sup>+ </sup> , CD19 <sup>+ </sup> , and pDCs persisted in CSF compared with PB , and the IgG index increased to 3.96.\n\n【10】Eight months after onset of PML, pyramidal signs, gait ignition failure, severe proximal intention tremor in lower limbs movements, left hand apraxia, and sensory loss from T8 were present. The MRI-PML lesions  were suggestive of neuronal and axonal damage because of inflammatory PML lesions. All immune cell counts remained high in CSF with respect to PB  and no JCV copies were found; the IgG index was 4.16.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】On withdrawal of NTZ and PLEX, the only Gd <sup>+ </sup> lesions on cranial MRI were the PML lesions compatible with an inflammatory form of PML (PML-IRIS). Simultaneously, higher percentages of mature CD86 <sup>+ </sup> pDCs and CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and lower percentages of CD19 <sup>+ </sup> B cells and CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells were in CSF with respect to PB. This finding was consistent with the described perturbance of memory and lower CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and CD19 <sup>+ </sup> B cells into the CNS could facilitate marginal zone-like B-cell homing in secondary lymphoid organs during NTZ treatment of JCV infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Lower CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and pDCs depletion have been reported in a histopathological study of NTZ-PML patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The influx of CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and CD19 <sup>+ </sup> B cells into the CSF after withdrawal of NTZ and PLEX coincided with control of JCV, providing evidence for the potential role of these cells in specific JCV responses. The CSF increase of CD8 <sup>+ </sup> cytotoxic T cells known to be the main effector cells in viral infection could be implicated in the control of dissemination of JCV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Autopsy of a patient of PML-IRIS showed that the inflammatory infiltrate was composed predominantly of CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells in both parenchyma and perivascular cuffs, with fewer CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and CD20 <sup>+ </sup> B cells, which were confined to perivascular cuffs.

Depletion of lymphocytes and impaired CNS immune surveillance are thought to be predisposing factors. Natalizumab (NTZ) treatment is associated with an increased risk of PML, though the exact pathogenic mechanisms are still not fully understood. PML should be diagnosed as early as possible but this may sometime be difficult as the clinical presentation of PML is often similar to a multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse. Diagnosis is based on a combined analysis of clinical course, brain MRI scans, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for JCV.\n\n【2】NTZ treatment should be suspended immediately on suspicion of PML and their clearance can be accelerated by plasma exchange (PLEX) therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, though re-establishment of CNS immunosurveillance is often associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), characterized by inflammatory changes on MRI. Information on the immune cells and mediators involved in PML is patchy. We describe the sequential clinical and radiological features of PML from onset in an NTZ-treated relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patient and provide data on CSF JCV copies and immune cell counts in CSF and peripheral blood (PB). The study was conducted at the Neurology Department of the Gregorio Maranon University Hospital (Madrid) and approved by the local ethics committee.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】We report a 47-year-old man with a 20-year history of RRMS on NTZ after failure to control disease activity with interferon beta and glatiramer acetate therapy. While on NTZ treatment (300 mg every 4 weeks for 27 months), he had remained free of disease activity (no clinical relapses and no new T2 or Gd <sup>+ </sup> \\-enhancing T1 lesions) and the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score was stable at 4.5. He was evaluated due to worsening of cerebellar and pyramidal symptoms affecting both lower limbs and left hand apraxia in the previous month (EDSS, 5.5). A cranial MRI scan was consistent with PML  and he was seropositive for JCV. The CSF (January17, 2012) revealed 75 copies/mL of JCV. pDCs and CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells were predominant in CSF with respect to PB , and the IgG index was 0.75 (normal ≤ 0.7). NTZ was discontinued and the patient received six PLEX sessions followed by IV-IgG 0.4 g/kg/day for 4 days.\n\n|  Figure 1. Serial MRI images. At baseline, axial proton-density spin-echo images showed hyperintense lesions in cortical and juxtacortical areas of the frontal lobes (A1). Abnormal hyperintensity of the middle cerebellar peduncles was also observed on axial turbo-spin-echo (TSE) T2-weighted images (A2), consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). After administration of gadolinium, a subtle enhancement of these lesions on axial T1-weighted magnetization transfer (MT) images was observed (A3 and A4). After 6 weeks, progression of the PML lesions on axial double inversion recovery (DIR) images (B1) and TSE T2-weighted images (B2) was observed.

The MRI lesions worsened . In CSF analysis, 475 JCV copies/mL and IgG index of 0.56 were found. A marked CSF increase in CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and CD19 <sup>+ </sup> B cells and decreased CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and pDCs compared with PB (February 24, 2012) were found.\n\n【8】MRI after 15 weeks showed worsening of the previous findings .\n\n【9】After 4 months, the patient presented a new spinal cord relapse at T8 level. Increase in CD4 <sup>+ </sup> , CD19 <sup>+ </sup> , and pDCs persisted in CSF compared with PB , and the IgG index increased to 3.96.\n\n【10】Eight months after onset of PML, pyramidal signs, gait ignition failure, severe proximal intention tremor in lower limbs movements, left hand apraxia, and sensory loss from T8 were present. The MRI-PML lesions  were suggestive of neuronal and axonal damage because of inflammatory PML lesions. All immune cell counts remained high in CSF with respect to PB  and no JCV copies were found; the IgG index was 4.16.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】On withdrawal of NTZ and PLEX, the only Gd <sup>+ </sup> lesions on cranial MRI were the PML lesions compatible with an inflammatory form of PML (PML-IRIS). Simultaneously, higher percentages of mature CD86 <sup>+ </sup> pDCs and CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and lower percentages of CD19 <sup>+ </sup> B cells and CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells were in CSF with respect to PB. This finding was consistent with the described perturbance of memory and lower CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and CD19 <sup>+ </sup> B cells into the CNS could facilitate marginal zone-like B-cell homing in secondary lymphoid organs during NTZ treatment of JCV infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Lower CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and pDCs depletion have been reported in a histopathological study of NTZ-PML patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The influx of CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and CD19 <sup>+ </sup> B cells into the CSF after withdrawal of NTZ and PLEX coincided with control of JCV, providing evidence for the potential role of these cells in specific JCV responses. The CSF increase of CD8 <sup>+ </sup> cytotoxic T cells known to be the main effector cells in viral infection could be implicated in the control of dissemination of JCV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Autopsy of a patient of PML-IRIS showed that the inflammatory infiltrate was composed predominantly of CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells in both parenchyma and perivascular cuffs, with fewer CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and CD20 <sup>+ </sup> B cells, which were confined to perivascular cuffs. These findings are in line with the first CSF, in which lower CSF JCV load and increased of CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells and pDCs was found.\n\n【13】Dendritic cells are central to the initiation and regulation of immune responses.

We present a rare case of acute pancreatitis, likely from trans-hiatal herniation of the pancreas within a type IV hiatal hernia. Our patient did not have the traditional risk factors for acute pancreatitis. The report of this rare anatomic abnormality contributes to a growing, albeit small, list of cases of acute pancreatitis secondary to pancreatic herniation whereby the pathophysiology may create a challenge for diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 65-year-old Caucasian male was hospitalized for recurrent abdominal pain, nausea and emesis. He was admitted twice for the same symptoms 1 week apart. His abdominal pain was located the left upper quadrant. The patient was hospitalized 9 months prior, at another facility, for a large para-esophageal hernia and perforation of a gastric ulcer located within the hernia sac, resulting in mediastinal abscess which was drained surgically. He had a prolonged post-operative recovery following the surgery. In addition, he had a remote history of exploratory laparotomy for a retroperitoneal bleed. He did not have history of alcohol abuse. His past medical history was significant for hypertension and osteoarthritis.\n\n【4】On examination, his vitals showed a heart rate of 106 beats/min, blood pressure of 137/85 mm Hg, temperature of 37.2 °C, and respiratory rate of 20/min. Physical exam demonstrated left-upper quadrant tenderness without guarding or rebound tenderness, with normoactive bowel sounds. Lipase was elevated at 2,687 U/L (reference range: 73 - 383 U/L). His lipase with the first episode of abdominal pain had been 1,051 U/L. Hematocrit was 41.2% (reference range: 42-52%), white cell count was 7.1 t/mm (reference range 4.8 - 10.8 t/mm) and creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL (references range: 0.5 - 1.4 mg/dL). Liver chemistries, serum triglycerides and serum calcium levels were within reference ranges. Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant showed normal common bile duct and no evidence of gallbladder stones or sludge. A computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen demonstrated a large type IV hiatal hernia through the esophageal hiatus, with near complete intrathoracic displacement of the stomach and a vertically oriented pancreas with herniation of the tail and body of the pancreas into the thorax . There was no evidence of inflammation of the pancreas. Given his clinical presentation and serum lipase elevation, a diagnosis of mild acute pancreatitis was made and the patient was aggressively hydrated. Upper endoscopy demonstrated a large paraesophageal hernia and two small clean-based ulcers in the body of the stomach. He was prescribed a proton pump inhibitor and his symptoms improved with conservative management. He was discharged 2 days later with plans to be followed up by his surgeon for repair of the hiatal hernia.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

About 20% of cases of acute pancreatitis are idiopathic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Our patient was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis based on his symptoms and elevated serum lipase. The duration of the paraesophageal hernia was not known as the patient did not have any prior images pertaining to this. The absence of traditional risk factors causing acute pancreatitis and the CT findings, led us to believe the etiology of the patient’s acute pancreatitis was trans-diaphragmatic herniation of the pancreas.\n\n【8】Hiatal hernias are more common in Western populations, hypothesized to stem from lower fiber intake leading to constipation, straining, and unnaturally raised intra-abdominal pressures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Furthermore, pregnancy, ascites, obesity and trauma may all increase intra-abdominal pressure and can contribute to the development of hiatal hernias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Hiatal hernias are classified into the following categories depending on the extent of herniation and the position of the gastroesophageal junction: sliding hernias (type I), paraesophageal hernias (type II), mixed sliding and paraesophageal hernia (type III), and herniation of additional organs (type IV) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. The latter category is less common, accounting for 5-15% of cases of hiatal hernias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Type IV hiatal hernias are large and have both a sliding and paraesophageal component with trans-diaphragmatic herniation of intra-abdominal organs including, but not limited to the colon, spleen and pancreas. Symptomatic hiatal hernias, being sliding or paraesophageal, are treated with surgical repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Some of the gastrointestinal (GI) complications of paraesophageal hernias include gastric volvulus, GI luminal obstruction, incarceration of omentum, or herniated bowel.\n\n【9】Trans-diaphragmatic hernia of pancreas can be asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging or result in acute pancreatitis. Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 \\- 15 \\]</u> lists the cases of acute pancreatitis from pancreatic herniation in hiatal hernias from published literature. All cases were diagnosed based on exclusion of other etiologies for acute pancreatitis. The rarity of these cases may be attributable to the fact that the head of the pancreas and the duodenum are anchored by the ligament of Treitz in the retroperitoneum, thereby preventing trans-hiatal herniation of the pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Cases of Acute Pancreatitis From Trans-Diaphragmatic Hernia of Pancreas |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【11】The presumed mechanism of pancreatitis due to herniation of the pancreas is thought to be from repetitive trauma of the pancreas and ischemia resulting from intermittent stretching and traction of the vessels supplying the pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Another possible mechanism includes volvulus formation of the pancreas which prevents normal pancreatic outflow, thereby leading to intraductal hypertension and subsequent inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】In conclusion, the etiologies of pancreatitis are diverse, and it is rarely due to pancreatic herniation. Given the rarity of these cases, the exact management of acute pancreatitis secondary to pancreatic herniation is not well established. While several reports have been published of urgent surgical repair, others, including our patient, were managed conservatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The decision for surgical management depends on the acuity and severity of symptoms, the presence of comorbid conditions, and patient preference. Given serious complications of type IV hiatal hernias, patients known to have this type of hernia need to be followed closely and offered surgical treatment earlier on to prevent serious complications.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>David Do: primary manuscript writer; Steven Mudroch: editor; Patrick Chen: editor; Rajan Prakash: editor; Padmini Krishnamurthy: editor and guarantor.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Support</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No financial or competing interests to disclose.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Disclosures</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed patient consent was obtained for publication of the case report.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:18:40", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:19:04", "cost": 23.918}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:19:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:18:39"}

Whereas AKI is well known to occur frequently in patients with heat stroke, no studies have examined potential changes in creatinine clearance in this patient population. We herein present the case of a patient with AKI due to heat stroke whose creatinine clearance was elevated.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 40-year-old male without past medical or family history presented to our hospital with nausea and generalized muscle pain after working outdoors on a hot summer day. On arrival, his rectal temperature was 37.6 °C, and his serum creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were 2.58 mg/dL, 68 IU/L and 82 IU/L, respectively. His serum creatinine kinase (CK) was 237 IU/L. On physical examination, his tongue was dry; however, no other abnormal findings were observed. He was diagnosed with heat stroke and renal dysfunction and admitted to the intensive care unit. According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, his renal dysfunction was classified as stage 3 AKI based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Fluid resuscitation successfully decreased serum creatinine level to 0.84 mg/dL by 12 h after admission. However, his creatinine clearance, measured by a 12-h urine collection, was elevated to 230 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> . He was discharged home from hospital on day three.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】The presented case can suggest that in patients with elevated serum creatinine due to heat stroke, creatinine clearance calculated by a 12-h urine collection might also be elevated. The KDIGO criteria and severity classification for AKI have an important role in predicting mortality and CKD risk. Previous studies found that AKI was associated with increased short and long-term risk of death and increased risk of CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Conversely, one study reported that while AKI occurred in about 90% of heat stroke patients, more than 95% of the AKI patients were alive with serum creatinine levels that were recovered to baseline at the time of discharge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Thus, renal function may not be impaired in heat stroke patients diagnosed with AKI.\n\n【6】Rhabdomyolysis is known to be associated with heat stroke, and cause AKI. CK level in this case was under 250 IU/L throughout the hospital stay. It was much lower than the reported cases of rhabdomyolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Thus, we consider that the AKI was not caused by rhabdomyolysis, but by hypovolemia from heat stroke. The elevation of serum creatinine is potentially caused by muscle injury by heat stroke, thereby meeting the AKI criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\- 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】As shown in this patient, creatinine clearance is also known to be probably elevated in septic AKI, ultimately affecting dosing of drugs such as antibiotics. In septic AKI patients, renal function was reported not to decline as low as expected, which could lead to underestimation of glomerular filtration rate and insufficient drug dosing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. This phenomenon is termed augmented renal clearance in which renal function for solution clearance is elevated more than expected by visible laboratory data in critically ill patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Therefore, more sensitive biomarkers such as the measured creatinine clearance are needed.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n\n【9】The measured creatinine clearance might be elevated in AKI due to heat stroke, and renal function for solution clearance might be underestimated with estimated glomerular filtration rate.\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:07:08", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:07:28", "cost": 19.934}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:07:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:07:06"}

The giant tumor compressed his nose and mouth, resulting in breathing and eating difficulties. He is a victim of cerebrovascular accident 4 years ago, hypertension for 12 years, and left hemiplegia. He has no personal history of smoking or alcoholism. Although rosacea was previously diagnosed and proven by biopsy, no aggressive treatment commenced. Facial disfigurement led to psychological distress, and he sought out residence at a nursing home as a social recluse. Examination revealed a giant pedunculated bulbar mass measuring 23 × 13 × 8 cm and extending from the forehead to over the tip of the nose, with complete obliteration of the normal nasal contour . Biopsy revealed perifollicular inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes, plasmacytes, and epithelioid cells within the fibrotic and telangiectatic stroma. Dermal vascular and lymphatic dilation, along with sebaceous gland hyperplasia, were prominent . The phymatous rosacea not only presented in the nose (rhinophyma), but also involved the forehead (metophyma), glabella, eyelids (blepharophyma), left nasal vestibule, zygoma (zygophyma), and earlobes (otophyma). All four subtypes of rosacea consisting of erythematotelangiectatic (type I), papulopustular (type II), phymatous (type III), and ocular (type IV) were concomitantly presented. MRI scan revealed extensive nasal cutaneous lobulated tumors with complete obstruction of his left nostril due to vestibular phymatous lesions. We coined the term “vestibulophyma” to describe such a phenomenon .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

We managed hypertension with diuretics and angiotensin-1 receptor blocker. Giant rhinophyma de-bulking consisted of slow and controlled electrosurgery, followed by full thickness skin graft harvested from the left inguinal area. Epinephrine soaked gauze was applied for hemostasis. The patient also accepted vestibulophyma resection, inferior turbinectomy, and middle turbinectomy with microdebrider to alleviate severe nasal obstruction. Although the grafted skin initially showed complete “take”, it was progressively uplifted and replaced as a result of re-epithelialization from remnant sebaceous glands. The skin graft played an important role as an ideal and effective biological dressing during the healing process. The patient is currently well and satisfied with the result .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 4. This postoperative picture shows very satisfactory results 6 months after the de-bulking procedure. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Rosacea affects many people worldwide, but it is uncommon for rhinophyma to develop. The most commonly used and established therapeutic regimens for rosacea include topical metronidazole, topical azelaic acid, and oral doxycycline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Normally associated with phymatous rosacea, rhinophyma may occur without any other symptoms. Rhinophymas should be examined carefully, as differential diagnoses may include cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>. The treatment method typically consists of surgical excision followed by skin graft or second intention healing after electrosurgery or laser resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Apart from giant rhinophyma, our patient exhibited phymatous rosacea on the forehead, glabella, eyelids, left nasal vestibule, zygoma, and earlobes. Concomitant presentation of all four rosacea subtypes was also noted. It is important to consider evaluation for internal phymatous lesions, as is seen and described as “vestibulophyma”.\n\n【11】Given the scale of his disease, we were not able to find any precedent cases to use as references for an appropriate treatment plan. We decided to proceed using the conventional approaches of metranidazole, doxycycline, electrosurgery, and skin graft. Our standard care of nasal obstruction in rosacea patients prioritizes alleviation of difficulty in breathing, and we performed vestibulophyma resection combined with middle and inferior turbinectomy. The patient has excellent clinical results functionally and cosmetically after medical treatment, surgical resection with meticulous hemostasis, and full thickness skin graft. It is exceedingly rare to document cases involving presentation of giant rhinophyma associated with extensive external phymatous rosacea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, nonetheless with internal nasal “vestibulophyma” and concomitant occurrence of all four rosacea subtypes. This case highlights the recognition of unique rosacea and rhinophyma presentation,as well as the efficacy of conventional treatment for management of even the most complicated cases.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No grant support was involved in this case report.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors report no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:08:53", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:09:03", "cost": 10.108}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:09:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:08:52"}

Failure to make timely diagnosis and give urgent and appropriate treatment to the patient will result in multisystemic dysfunction, and eventually, death. There were an estimated 405,000 deaths from malaria globally in 2018, and 93% of them were caused by severe falciparum malaria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) is a rare condition in the patient with severe malaria. There was no report so far. Early diagnosis and proper management are extremely important.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】A 29-year-old male peacekeeper, deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for 2 months, presented with a history of 3-day fever, headache, fatigue and 1-day jaundice. There was no past medical history. He was taking compound dihydroartemisinin tablets (dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine phosphate + trimethoprim) weekly as chemoprophylaxis since entering the mission area. Physical examination showed fever (39.4 °C), acute sick looking, poor spirit, yellow staining of skin and sclera.\n\n【5】Diagnosis\n\n【6】Pulse oxygen saturation was 96%. Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was 15. Ultrasonic examination of the abdomen showed splenomegaly. The blood smear revealed 8% parasitemia. The laboratory results after admission were summarized in Table 1 . Of note were hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin 81.3 µmol/L), electrolyte disturbance, and thrombocytopenia. Hepatitis series tests were negative. A rapid diagnostic test was positive for Plasmodium falciparum . A diagnosis of severe falciparum malaria was made.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Laboratory Investigations |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【8】Treatment\n\n【9】We carried out antimalaria therapy with intramuscular artemether 240 mg at admission and 160 mg at 12, 24 h later (artesunate was temporarily unavailable), correcting dehydration and the electrolyte disturbance, and protecting liver function. The patient did not sweat and the body temperature did not drop after antimalarial treatment. It was above 39.0 °C. Thirty-six hours after admission, he felt left upper quadrant pain, combined by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, all of which occurred for three times. The pain was so severe that he could not take a deep breath or cough, resulting in shallow and fast breathing, and a pulse oxygen saturation of 92%. And this was followed with progressive abdominal distension and an inability to pass stool and flatus. On examination, the patient was extremely weak and tired. Without abdominal guarding and rigidity, tenderness was obvious in the left. There was no rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds disappeared. In addition, the blood smear revealed 5% parasitemia. Liver function deteriorated (total bilirubin 189.5 µmol/L), and platelets decreased further (52 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). Fifty-five hours after admission, his abdominal pain was significantly worse. The consciousness was gradually indifferent, and GCS was 13. Breath rate was 45/min, and pulse oxygen saturation was 89%. X-ray of the chest showed lung texture thickening and upright abdominal plain film indicating that the colon was dilated and gas accumulation in the splenic flexure . Ultrasound of the abdomen showed hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. So we considered the patient was complicated by ACPO. At this time artesunate was available and 2.4 mg/kg body weight administered intravenously (time = 0), then at 12 h and 24 h. At the same time, fasting, no retention enema, rectal decompression tubes and oral 30 mL paraffin oil were taken. One day after these measures, he passed a small quantity of feces; and abdominal pain and distension were relieved. Body temperature also gradually decreased. Blood test showed bilirubin level dropped than before (total bilirubin 165.7 µmol/L), platelets level rose to a certain extent (81 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), and the blood smear revealed 1% parasitemia. X-ray of the abdomen revealed that dilation of the left colon disappeared, and intestinal gas accumulation decreased . Five days after admission, the patient could tolerate oral therapy, so he completed a treatment of 3-day artemisinin-based combination therapies.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Upright abdominal plain film. (a) Fifty-five hours after admission, the colon was dilated and gas accumulation shown in the splenic flexure (arrow). (b) One day after taking new measures, dilation of the left colon disappeared and intestinal gas accumulation decreased (arrow). |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【11】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【12】We concluded that ACPO was secondary to malaria. Ten days later, all symptoms disappeared and the patient was discharged. His 1-month follow-up was unremarkable.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】As a peacekeeper in the DRC from Asia, the risk for severe falciparum malaria is greater due to lack of immunity. Various symptoms may appear. Abdominal pain is a common symptom of malaria. The causes of abdominal pain in malaria are diverse, such as gastroenteritis, hepatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, acute abdomen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, splenic rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, acute pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, sub-acute intestinal obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, and so on. In this patient, abdominal pain affecting respiration was related to ACPO. ACPO is a rare condition characterized by acute colonic dilatation in the absence of mechanical obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. It is even less common in adult malaria cases, and there was no report so far. However, several cases of sub-acute bowel obstruction caused by malaria have been reported. One is a 42-year-old man in Cameroonian 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> and the other is an 18-month-old girl in India 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】ACPO is a functional obstruction characterized by absent peristalsis or peristalsis which can be present but in a non-propulsive form. It usually occurs in hospitalized patients with severe illness or trauma, or follows general, orthopedic, neurosurgical, gynecological or other surgical procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, with an associated mortality rate of 15% to 44% because of colonic ischemia or perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.The pathophysiology underlying ACPO resulted from malaria remains blurred.\n\n【16】After admission, the patient in this study was treated with artemether immediately,however his condition significantly aggravated. A non-immune adult and a few days of illness allowed a large number of plasmodium parasites to reproduce in the blood, leading to persistent hyperparasitemia. Infected red blood cell was sequestrated in microvascular beds of multiple organs, and resulted in microvascular occlusion and tissue ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Infected erythrocytes also adhered to surrounding uninfected red blood cells to form rosetting, or activated platelets to form clumping. Both rosetting and clumping further contributed to microvascular obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The splenic flexure of the colon is at the junction of the blood supply at the end of two arteries, which is prone to insufficient supply of blood. When the local circulation continues to stagnate without improvement, it can cause colonic wall infarction or even perforation. However, we discovered the trouble early and adjusted the treatment in time. Artesunate acts faster and has a high intestinal distribution dose. So we switch from artemether to artesunate. And artesunate may kill late-staged sequestered parasites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Clogged microvascular restored blood flow, and the colon function gradually recovered.\n\n【17】Electrolyte disturbance is also one cause of the ACPO. Electrolyte disturbances are common in patients with severe malaria, especially falciparum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The patient in this study had hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypochlorous. The minimum potassium is 3.3 mmol/L, and the minimum sodium is 126 mmol/L. Changes in potassium and other electrolyte concentrations affect ion channel function and may alter pacemaker activity generated by interstitial cells of Cajal or smooth muscle activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Autonomic dysfunction is also one of the reasons. Colonic function is regulated by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves systems. Most patients with major illness have increased systemic sympathetic drive, potentially contributing to autonomic imbalance at the level of the colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. An imbalance in autonomic nervous activity with an increased sympathetic tone and decreased parasympathetic tone leads to functional obstruction in the distal colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】In conclusion, ACPO should be considered for severe malaria patients with abdominal distention and pain. Early recognition of ACPO in malaria is extremely important, and the appropriate conservative treatment can achieve a good prognosis.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr. Rui Zhao and Dr. Yong Zhao for their supports and all staff of Chinese Level II Hospital in DRC involved in the care of this patient.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there are no competing interests.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient authorized the main author, in written form, to publish this case report and the accompanying image (X-ray).</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Peng Fei Yao wrote the paper.

Here, we describe a case of shoulder palsy probably due to cardiogenic embolism, which proves that the area corresponding to the shoulder receives its blood from the cortical branch of MCA.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】An 80-year-old Japanese woman with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation suddenly presented with sensory aphasia and difficulty in lifting the right arm, despite no shoulder pain in June 2012; therefore, the patient was admitted to our hospital. Consciousness was alert. General examination demonstrated no abnormalities. Cranial nerve impairment was not detected. The patient was right-handed. Hand grasping power was 12 kg in the right and 10 kg in the left. In the upper extremities, the right-sided Barre sign was positive. In the lower extremities, neither the Barre sign nor Mingazzini sign was positive on the left side. Manual muscle testing of the left upper limb demonstrated that the pectoralis major, deltoid, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, rhomboideus, serratus anterior, and latissimus dorsi were grade 3, although the trapezius, biceps brachii, triceps brachialis, brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor carpi ulnaris were grade 5. Bend, extension, and wiggle of the fingers were normal on both sides. Muscle tonus was normal in the extremities. Muscle atrophy and fasciculation were not observed. Deep tendon reflexes were all normal and pathological reflexes were not detected in the extremities. Superficial sensation (touch sensation, pain sensation, temperature sensation, and topesthesia), deep sensation (joint sensation and vibratory sense), and combined sensation (two-point discrimination, graphaesthesia, stereognosis, and double simultaneous stimulation) were all normal. The finger-nose test, nose-finger-nose test, hyperpronation test, and hand pronation supination test were all normal. Truncal ataxia was not observed. In the gait test, arm swing was slow on the left side. There were no other neurologic abnormalities. As a result, there was moderate weakness restricted to the right shoulder with normal joint flexibility, despite normal muscle strength in the elbow, wrist and fingers; therefore, the patient was diagnosed as having right-sided shoulder palsy. Complete blood cell count and blood chemistry were within normal ranges. Chest roentgenogram, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram findings were normal. Carotid ultrasonogram demonstrated normal findings. Shoulder roentgenogram demonstrated no abnormalities. Cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated an infarct lesion in the territory of the MCA on the left side . A localized infarct lesion was demonstrated in the precentral gyrus on the left side, which was considered responsible for the right shoulder palsy. Cranial MR angiography demonstrated normal findings. Under rehabilitation therapy, sensory aphasia resolved within 20 days and right-sided ISP within 10 days, respectively.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

In addition, Celebisoy et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> noted that the hand area in the primary motor cortex is located in the middle to lower portion of the anterior wall of the central sulcus; however, in the primary motor cortex, detailed vascular supply remains uncertain. Kim 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> speculated that the medial portion of the precentral knob representing topographically ulnar-sided fingers may correspond to the border area between the anterior cerebral artery and MCA, whereas the lateral portion representing radial-sided fingers is supplied by distal MCA branches.\n\n【7】In 2003, Komatsu et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> described the first case of ISP. Cranial diffusion-weighted MR imaging demonstrated a small infarct lesion in the precentral gyrus on the ipsilateral side to shoulder palsy. Electrocardiogram did not demonstrate the source of the embolus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A borderzone infarction between the anterior cerebral artery and MCA was suspected as its pathogenesis because of severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery based on MR angiography findings; however, no MR angiography image was shown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Because cerebral angiography, 3D-CTA, and carotid ultrasonogram were not performed, whether collateral circulation was present was unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In 2006, Nah et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> noted a second case of ISP. Cranial MR imaging demonstrated a small infarct lesion in the right precentral gyrus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Cranial MR angiography demonstrated no steno-occlusive lesions in the intracranial and extracranial arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Electrocardiogram demonstrated atrial fibrillation and vigorous spontaneous echogenic contrast with sludge in the left atrial appendage; however, the detailed etiology of infarction was not mentioned, although intravenous heparin therapy was performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In 2007, Uncini et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> reported a case of unilateral shoulder palsy due to a localized cortical infarction. Analysis of functional MR imaging confirmed the location of the corresponding area to the shoulder in the precentral gyrus; however, muscle strength weakness of the biceps brachii and triceps brachialis was also observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Pathogenesis of the infarction was not mentioned 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In 2011, we noted a third case of ISP. Diffusion-weighted cranial MR imaging demonstrated a cortical infarct lesion in two serial axial images 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, carotid ultrasonography, and cranial MR angiography demonstrated normal findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Marked blood pressure fluctuations were not observed. Consequently, atherothrombosis was suspected. After administration of an intravenous anti-platelet agent, the patient became asymptomatic within 10 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In 2012, we reported a fourth case of ISP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Diffusion-weighted cranial MR imaging demonstrated infarction of the cortical branch of MCA, probably due to atherothrombosis, which involved the area corresponding to the shoulder in the primary motor cortex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Therefore, we proposed that the area corresponding to the shoulder received its blood from the cortical branch of MCA. Here, in our present case, right-sided shoulder palsy was caused by an infarct lesion in the precentral gyrus on the left side, which resulted from an embolism of the MCA. Consequently, we have provided further evidence that the cortical branch of MCA may supply blood to the area corresponding to the shoulder in the precentral gyrus.\n\n【8】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【9】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no conflict of interest relevant to this article.</u>\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no grant support.</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 13:40:17", "endTime": "2024/09/19 13:40:24", "cost": 6.477}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 21:40:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 21:40:17"}

Here, we describe a first reported case of PMM in the upper extremity due to an MMI. Moreover, this case may be useful for elucidate the topographical organization of the corticospinal tract fibers in the medulla oblongata.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 69-year-old man with essential hypertension complained of abruptly presenting with difficulty in lifting the left arm, despite no shoulder pain, and was admitted to our Neurologic Ward on July 2014. Consciousness was alert. Blood pressure was 154/84 mm Hg. The heart rate was 62/min. General examination demonstrated no abnormalities. Cranial nerve impairment was not detected. The patient was right-handed. Hand grasping power was 31 kg in the right and 29 kg in the left. In the upper extremities, left-sided Barre sign was positive. In the lower extremities, neither Barre sign nor Mingazzini sign was positive. Manual muscle testing on the left upper extremity demonstrated that pectoralis major, deltoid, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, rhomboideus, serratus anterior, latissimus dorsi, trapezius, biceps brachii, triceps brachialis, and brachioradialis were at grade 4, while extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor carpi ulnaris at grade 5-. Muscle tonus was normal in the extremities. However, manual muscle testing on the right upper extremity and bilateral lower extremities demonstrated no abnormalities. Muscle atrophy and fasciculation were not observed. Deep tendon reflexes were all normal and pathological reflexes were not detected in the extremities. Superficial sensation (touch sensation, pain sensation, temperature sensation, and topesthesia), deep sensation (joint sensation and vibratory sense), and combined sensation (two-point discrimination, graphesthesia, stereognosis, and double simultaneous stimulation) were all normal. Dysmetria, decomposition of movement, and intension tremor were not observed in finger-nose test and nose-finger-nose test. Hyperpronation test and hand pronation supination test were slow on the left side. Truncal ataxia was not observed. In the gait test, arm swing was slow on the left side. There were no other neurologic abnormalities. As a result, there was moderate weakness in the left upper extremity with proximal dominancy. Complete blood cell count and blood chemistry were within normal ranges. Electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and chest roentgenogram findings demonstrated no abnormalities. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a localized MMI on the right side . Cranial magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated no abnormalities. Seven days of intravenous argatroban therapy were performed. Thereafter, oral clopidogrel at 75 mg/day was initiated. Under rehabilitation, the patient became asymptomatic within 14 days.\n\n|  Figure 1. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image of cranial magnetic resonance imaging on the axial image demonstrated a small infarct lesion in the medial medulla oblongata on the right side (arrow). |\n| --- |\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Although the somatotopic arrangements of the corticospinal tract in the human brain have been generally elucidated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, very little is known about the somatotopy at the medullary pyramid. In 2011, based on the diffusion tensor tractography analysis, Kwon et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> reported that the hand somatotopy of the corticospinal tract was located at the medial portion of the medullary pyramid; in contrast, the leg somatotopy occupied its lateral portion. However, in our patient, despite PMM in the upper extremity, a localized infarct lesion was detected in the lateral portion of the medial medulla oblongata. This neurological symptom was incompatible with the diffusion tensor tractography analysis which was reported by Kwon et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】There were only two reported cases of lateral medullary infarction with ipsilateral monoparesis of the leg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. In both cases, infarct lesion was observed in the most caudal region of lateral medulla oblongata. Regarding the etiology of leg weakness due to ipsilateral lateral medullary infarction, Liu et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> and Tsuda et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> speculated that the corticospinal tract fibers innervating the lower and upper extremities might decussate at different levels, and that the decussation of the lower extremity might locate rostral to that of the upper extremity.

Regarding responsible infarct lesions for PMM in the upper extremity, the cerebral cortex, corona radiata, internal capsule and pons have been noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Here, we describe a first reported case of PMM in the upper extremity due to an MMI. Moreover, this case may be useful for elucidate the topographical organization of the corticospinal tract fibers in the medulla oblongata.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 69-year-old man with essential hypertension complained of abruptly presenting with difficulty in lifting the left arm, despite no shoulder pain, and was admitted to our Neurologic Ward on July 2014. Consciousness was alert. Blood pressure was 154/84 mm Hg. The heart rate was 62/min. General examination demonstrated no abnormalities. Cranial nerve impairment was not detected. The patient was right-handed. Hand grasping power was 31 kg in the right and 29 kg in the left. In the upper extremities, left-sided Barre sign was positive. In the lower extremities, neither Barre sign nor Mingazzini sign was positive. Manual muscle testing on the left upper extremity demonstrated that pectoralis major, deltoid, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, rhomboideus, serratus anterior, latissimus dorsi, trapezius, biceps brachii, triceps brachialis, and brachioradialis were at grade 4, while extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor carpi ulnaris at grade 5-. Muscle tonus was normal in the extremities. However, manual muscle testing on the right upper extremity and bilateral lower extremities demonstrated no abnormalities. Muscle atrophy and fasciculation were not observed. Deep tendon reflexes were all normal and pathological reflexes were not detected in the extremities. Superficial sensation (touch sensation, pain sensation, temperature sensation, and topesthesia), deep sensation (joint sensation and vibratory sense), and combined sensation (two-point discrimination, graphesthesia, stereognosis, and double simultaneous stimulation) were all normal. Dysmetria, decomposition of movement, and intension tremor were not observed in finger-nose test and nose-finger-nose test. Hyperpronation test and hand pronation supination test were slow on the left side. Truncal ataxia was not observed. In the gait test, arm swing was slow on the left side. There were no other neurologic abnormalities. As a result, there was moderate weakness in the left upper extremity with proximal dominancy. Complete blood cell count and blood chemistry were within normal ranges. Electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and chest roentgenogram findings demonstrated no abnormalities. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a localized MMI on the right side . Cranial magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated no abnormalities. Seven days of intravenous argatroban therapy were performed. Thereafter, oral clopidogrel at 75 mg/day was initiated. Under rehabilitation, the patient became asymptomatic within 14 days.\n\n|  Figure 1. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image of cranial magnetic resonance imaging on the axial image demonstrated a small infarct lesion in the medial medulla oblongata on the right side (arrow). |\n| --- |\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Although the somatotopic arrangements of the corticospinal tract in the human brain have been generally elucidated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, very little is known about the somatotopy at the medullary pyramid. In 2011, based on the diffusion tensor tractography analysis, Kwon et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> reported that the hand somatotopy of the corticospinal tract was located at the medial portion of the medullary pyramid; in contrast, the leg somatotopy occupied its lateral portion. However, in our patient, despite PMM in the upper extremity, a localized infarct lesion was detected in the lateral portion of the medial medulla oblongata. This neurological symptom was incompatible with the diffusion tensor tractography analysis which was reported by Kwon et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】There were only two reported cases of lateral medullary infarction with ipsilateral monoparesis of the leg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. In both cases, infarct lesion was observed in the most caudal region of lateral medulla oblongata. Regarding the etiology of leg weakness due to ipsilateral lateral medullary infarction, Liu et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> and Tsuda et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> speculated that the corticospinal tract fibers innervating the lower and upper extremities might decussate at different levels, and that the decussation of the lower extremity might locate rostral to that of the upper extremity. In our patient, an infarct lesion was located in the caudal region in the medial medulla oblongata. Therefore, we agree with the hypothesis which was proposed by Liu et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> and Tsuda et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In addition, we emphasize that this is a first reported case of PMM in the upper extremity due to an MMI.\n\n【8】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【9】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "index": 3436, "show": true, "start": 3436, "end": 3639, "comment": "3", "isEdit": false, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"]}], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:47:34", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:47:47", "cost": 12.638}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:47:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:47:25"}

Patient was being followed by outside oncologist for ongoing radiation therapy since December 2018. Patient also reported experiencing decrease in appetite with some nausea, taste alterations and > 8% weight loss over 2 months. Patient had no known drug or food allergies. Patients’ risk factors for VTE include obesity (body mass index (BMI), about 40.31 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), chronic tobacco use, increased age (> 60 years) and driving for long periods of time. Chest computed topography (CT) scan revealed right lower lobe pulmonary embolism with associated opacity and atelectasis. Upon admission, patient’s liver function tests (LFTs) were within normal limits. Complete blood count (CBC) revealed low hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, and absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /mm <sup>3 </sup> (elevated).\n\n【4】Patient was placed on intravenous heparin drip. Inpatient medications included ondansetron, hydrocodone prn for pain, and ketorolac for muscle relaxation. He also received one dose of intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone on day 2 of hospital admission. At this time, patient was transitioned to rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 21 days, thereafter to be continued as 20 mg daily. Patient was discharged on day 11 and consult for pharmacist-led anticoagulation clinic was placed. On day 23, patient called the primary care provider to report that he developed generalized urticaria that appeared every couple of hours. These reactions were intermittent and self-limiting that usually appeared 1 - 2 h after taking rivaroxaban and were not specific to an area of body and moved across different areas of patients’ body. Patient also reported to have swollen hands. Some symptoms such as itching associated with rash were alleviated with the use of diphenhydramine 50 mg 2 - 3 times a day; however, no relief was reported with the swelling in his hands. Patient denied any changes in soap, detergents or intake of new food items. Patient was on low residual diet for recent small bowel obstruction. No new medications were started since the hospitalization other than rivaroxaban. Patient was instructed to continue rivaroxaban at this time along with diphenhydramine for symptom relief by the primary care provider and advised to call in case of worsening symptoms.\n\n【5】On day 25, patient woke up with generalized urticarial with erythema (raised plaques also known as wheals), swollen hands and feet. This quickly progressed to angioedema manifested as shortness of breath, bronchospasm as well as swelling of tongue and face and was immediately taken to ER at nearby hospital. These symptoms were confirmed based on the medical chart documentation by ER physician. The causality assessment is not very accurate due to lack of availability of serum biomarkers/immunoassay tests. Patient was discharged from the ER with prescription for 5 days of prednisone 20 mg. CBC was within normal limits; however, differential count was not checked. LFTs were not available for assessment either.\n\n【6】At the time, the patient was switched to dabigatran 150 mg twice daily as he could not afford to travel 2 h for international normalized ratio (INR) check and refused to take warfarin. On day 36, 10 days after dabigatran initiation, patient called the anticoagulation clinic pharmacist to report that 10 - 15 min after ingestion of dabigatran, he experienced rash with hand swelling. Patient denied swelling of lips, tongue or throat as well as shortness of breath or wheezing. Upon examination by medical provider, patient was confirmed to have developed pruritic morbilliform exanthamas eruptions on his elbows, axillae and lower extremities accompanied by swelling of hands . Patient had repeat LFTs and CBC which were all within normal limits. Laboratory abnormality if present would have been likely shadowed due to prednisone use. Patient continued to use diphenhydramine 2 - 3 times per day that provided some relief with the rash but did not help with the swelling. Patient was seen at the anticoagulation clinic for further management and providing counselling on available anticoagulation therapy options. With the help of social worker, patient was approved to have his labs done at a nearby hospital to avoid commuting long distance for INR monitoring. Patient was provided in depth education and was switched to warfarin with enoxaparin bridge on day 40. Patient’s cutaneous manifestations as well as swelling of extremities resolved 1 week after the drug discontinuation. At day 50, patient’s INR was 3 and enoxaparin was discontinued. Patient has remained stable on warfarin since then and continues to deny any skin reactions or swelling. Patient was assessed against Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability scale for both rivaroxaban and dabigatran.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Anticoagulants-induced drug hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. With superior risk-benefit profile and simpler dosing regimen, DOACs are being increasingly utilized over warfarin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Angioedema is characterized by localized rapid swelling of the dermis, subcutaneous or submucosal tissues of the upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract manifested as swelling of oral cavity, tongue or larynx leading to life-threatening airway obstruction and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. A variety of adverse drug reactions including angioedema (three of the 22,222 DOAC-treated patients) have been reported in the patients taking DOACs in the pivotal randomized clinical trials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\- 20 \\]</u>. Currently there are at least two published case reports that specifically link rivaroxaban with angioedema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 \\]</u>. According to the monograph, the incidences of cutaneous reactions reported in the clinical trials were: blisters (1.4%) and pruritis (1.8%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Overall incidence of cutaneous manifestations and anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock associated with factor-XA inhibitors reported is < 0.1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In one of the case reports of rivaroxaban-induced angioedema, patient experienced generalized urticarial, erythema, severe pruritus and angioedema of orbital area and lips along with shortness of breath an airway obstruction. The drug was promptly discontinued, and patient was managed with supportive oxygen, IV antihistamines and methylprednisolone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. In another case report, rivaroxaban-induced hypersensivity syndrome manifested as rash, and hepatic cytolysis was reported along with histopathological evidence of spongiotic dermatitis with perivascular lymphocytes and eosinophilic infiltrates. The authors suggest that the causative effect of rivaroxaban can be established with more certainty in this case than other cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. According to the eHeathme database of 137,932 people who experienced side-effects to rivaroxaban, about 88 patients (0.06%) report experiencing angioedema. Patients who are older than 60 years of age, female, who have been taking the drug for less than 1 month, who are on concomitant aspirin and have past medical history of stroke seemed more prone to experiencing angioedema. Of note, the risk of experiencing angioedema is 80% in the first month and is reduced to 0% after 5 years of initiating rivaroxaban 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 , 26 \\]</u>. Dabigatran-induced morbilliform exanthamas has been reported as the most common drug reaction. Patients have reported to have isolated or diffuse pruritic, palpable purpura on trunk and limbs which resulted in discontinuation of dabigratran. In both cases, patient was switched to warfarin. The reaction resolved in 5 - 7 days after dabigatran discontinuation. It is pertinent to note that in most of the cases, the drug reaction was not confirmed using serum biomarkers for allergic reactions or skin testing neither were the patients re-challenged 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 , 28 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Our case study provides an advantage over previously published case reports as we not only report rivaroxaban-induced urticarial and angioedema but also the evidence of cross-reactivity to dabigatran. This can provide further information to the clinicians when considering alternative treatment in the patients who develop adverse drug reaction to one of the agents in the drug class. Initially dabigatran was chosen assuming its difference in pharmacodynamics compared to rivaroxaban. It would be useful to see if patients in this scenario can benefit from using apixaban. In our case, since the patient had experienced adverse drug reaction to two out of three available DOACs at our facility, it was decided not to challenge patient with apixaban.\n\n【11】Well-documented case reports are essential component of post marketing safety surveillance; however, they typically suggest a probable reaction based on the Naranjo score and are inadequate for making causal inferences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. A recently published cohort case-crossover study by Connolly and colleagues, aimed to quantify the association between DOACs and angioedema relative to warfarin in AF patients who were drawn based on study eligibility from three different databases. This cohort reported 249 incident angioedema events among 267,681 DOAC users and 281,143 warfarin users with an average follow-up of 89 days. The hazard ratio for metanalysis of the results from three different databases comparing any DOAC versus warfarin was 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 - 1.2). The odds ratio for association between warfarin and angioedema in the case-crossover design was 0.91 (95% CI 0.68 - 1.21) based on 431 cases. This study did not observe a large relative increase in the angioedema rate comparing DOACs with warfarin. These findings seemed to suggest a much smaller increase in risk as compared to the previously published case reports and the pivotal trials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. There have been at least four cases of hypersensitivity reaction case reports published with rivaroxaban, and six case reports associated with dabigatran; however, there were not many reported cases with apixaban until recently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Two patient cases were identified that reported adverse drug reactions associated with apixaban. In one case, patient experience cutaneous adverse drug reaction secondary to apixaban leading to cessation of the medication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. In the other case, patient experienced angioedema with significant laryngeal edema without presence of urticaria or pruritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】With a score of 7 out of possible 13 points on the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability scale 通用删除1(英):<u>( Supplementary Material 1 , www.journalmc.org)</u> for rivaroxaban and 8 points for dabigatran 通用删除1(英):<u>( Supplementary Material 2 , www.journalmc.org)</u>, causality between rivaroxaban/dabigatran and the observed clinical events are deemed probable in our patient case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>. We believe that our case report can help highlight the rare adverse drug reactions associated with the DOACs to create vigilance and help with prompt intervention by clinicians.\n\n【13】Implication on clinical practice\n\n【14】Early identification and treatment of these drug reactions is critical in avoiding escalation to morbidity and mortality. Well-documented case reports that provide further clinical evidence and increase awareness amongst the clinicians treating patients with DOACs specially with the rapid increase in its use are important.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】In this report, we have described a case of rivaroxaban-induced urticaria and angioedema manifested by severe pruritic rash, swelling of tongue and face as well as shortness of breath and bronchospasm. We further provide evidence of possible cross-reaction to dabigatran which in our patient manifested as morbilliform exanthamas along with swelling of hands. The pharmacologic mechanism by which DOACs might lead to angioedema is unclear. Further evidence to establish presence or absence of cross-reaction to apixaban may provide useful information in guiding clinical decisions when treating patients on DOACs who provide challenge for warfarin use. Additionally, use of skin patch testing at different concentrations to all factor-Xa inhibitors under direct medical supervision can also be considered given the severity of reaction to the suspected agent. Furthermore, use of immunoglobulin E specific testing may confirm the causal relationship between DOACs and these adverse drug reactions. DOACs are structurally different and the manifestations developed also differ in pathologies. Hence future studies are necessary to explore the implications on clinical practice in patient developing adverse drug events to one of the DOACs.\n\n【17】删除2:<u>Supplementary Material</u>\n\n【18】Supplementary Material 1.

Overall incidence of cutaneous manifestations and anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock associated with factor-XA inhibitors reported is < 0.1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In one of the case reports of rivaroxaban-induced angioedema, patient experienced generalized urticarial, erythema, severe pruritus and angioedema of orbital area and lips along with shortness of breath an airway obstruction. The drug was promptly discontinued, and patient was managed with supportive oxygen, IV antihistamines and methylprednisolone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. In another case report, rivaroxaban-induced hypersensivity syndrome manifested as rash, and hepatic cytolysis was reported along with histopathological evidence of spongiotic dermatitis with perivascular lymphocytes and eosinophilic infiltrates. The authors suggest that the causative effect of rivaroxaban can be established with more certainty in this case than other cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. According to the eHeathme database of 137,932 people who experienced side-effects to rivaroxaban, about 88 patients (0.06%) report experiencing angioedema. Patients who are older than 60 years of age, female, who have been taking the drug for less than 1 month, who are on concomitant aspirin and have past medical history of stroke seemed more prone to experiencing angioedema. Of note, the risk of experiencing angioedema is 80% in the first month and is reduced to 0% after 5 years of initiating rivaroxaban 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 , 26 \\]</u>. Dabigatran-induced morbilliform exanthamas has been reported as the most common drug reaction. Patients have reported to have isolated or diffuse pruritic, palpable purpura on trunk and limbs which resulted in discontinuation of dabigratran. In both cases, patient was switched to warfarin. The reaction resolved in 5 - 7 days after dabigatran discontinuation. It is pertinent to note that in most of the cases, the drug reaction was not confirmed using serum biomarkers for allergic reactions or skin testing neither were the patients re-challenged 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 , 28 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Our case study provides an advantage over previously published case reports as we not only report rivaroxaban-induced urticarial and angioedema but also the evidence of cross-reactivity to dabigatran. This can provide further information to the clinicians when considering alternative treatment in the patients who develop adverse drug reaction to one of the agents in the drug class. Initially dabigatran was chosen assuming its difference in pharmacodynamics compared to rivaroxaban. It would be useful to see if patients in this scenario can benefit from using apixaban. In our case, since the patient had experienced adverse drug reaction to two out of three available DOACs at our facility, it was decided not to challenge patient with apixaban.\n\n【11】Well-documented case reports are essential component of post marketing safety surveillance; however, they typically suggest a probable reaction based on the Naranjo score and are inadequate for making causal inferences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. A recently published cohort case-crossover study by Connolly and colleagues, aimed to quantify the association between DOACs and angioedema relative to warfarin in AF patients who were drawn based on study eligibility from three different databases. This cohort reported 249 incident angioedema events among 267,681 DOAC users and 281,143 warfarin users with an average follow-up of 89 days. The hazard ratio for metanalysis of the results from three different databases comparing any DOAC versus warfarin was 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 - 1.2). The odds ratio for association between warfarin and angioedema in the case-crossover design was 0.91 (95% CI 0.68 - 1.21) based on 431 cases. This study did not observe a large relative increase in the angioedema rate comparing DOACs with warfarin. These findings seemed to suggest a much smaller increase in risk as compared to the previously published case reports and the pivotal trials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. There have been at least four cases of hypersensitivity reaction case reports published with rivaroxaban, and six case reports associated with dabigatran; however, there were not many reported cases with apixaban until recently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Two patient cases were identified that reported adverse drug reactions associated with apixaban. In one case, patient experience cutaneous adverse drug reaction secondary to apixaban leading to cessation of the medication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. In the other case, patient experienced angioedema with significant laryngeal edema without presence of urticaria or pruritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】With a score of 7 out of possible 13 points on the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability scale 通用删除1(英):<u>( Supplementary Material 1 , www.journalmc.org)</u> for rivaroxaban and 8 points for dabigatran 通用删除1(英):<u>( Supplementary Material 2 , www.journalmc.org)</u>, causality between rivaroxaban/dabigatran and the observed clinical events are deemed probable in our patient case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>. We believe that our case report can help highlight the rare adverse drug reactions associated with the DOACs to create vigilance and help with prompt intervention by clinicians.\n\n【13】Implication on clinical practice\n\n【14】Early identification and treatment of these drug reactions is critical in avoiding escalation to morbidity and mortality. Well-documented case reports that provide further clinical evidence and increase awareness amongst the clinicians treating patients with DOACs specially with the rapid increase in its use are important.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】In this report, we have described a case of rivaroxaban-induced urticaria and angioedema manifested by severe pruritic rash, swelling of tongue and face as well as shortness of breath and bronchospasm. We further provide evidence of possible cross-reaction to dabigatran which in our patient manifested as morbilliform exanthamas along with swelling of hands. The pharmacologic mechanism by which DOACs might lead to angioedema is unclear. Further evidence to establish presence or absence of cross-reaction to apixaban may provide useful information in guiding clinical decisions when treating patients on DOACs who provide challenge for warfarin use. Additionally, use of skin patch testing at different concentrations to all factor-Xa inhibitors under direct medical supervision can also be considered given the severity of reaction to the suspected agent. Furthermore, use of immunoglobulin E specific testing may confirm the causal relationship between DOACs and these adverse drug reactions. DOACs are structurally different and the manifestations developed also differ in pathologies. Hence future studies are necessary to explore the implications on clinical practice in patient developing adverse drug events to one of the DOACs.\n\n【17】删除2:<u>Supplementary Material</u>\n\n【18】Supplementary Material 1.

The typical neuroimaging findings consist of bilateral, symmetric vasogenic edema involving the white matter of the parietal and occipital lobes. This entity has been described mainly related to hypertension, renal failure and chemotherapy or immunosuppressive drugs. Hypertension is not always present, particularly in drug-related cases. Although PRES has been reported in the course of several autoimmune disorders, its association to Behcet’s disease has not been described so far.\n\n【2】We report the case of a woman diagnosed with Behcet’s disease on immunosuppressive therapy, who developed PRES.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 58-year-old female had been diagnosed with Behcet’s disease on the basis of recurrent aphthous oral ulcerations, uveitis and erythema nodosum. She was on methotrexate 2.5 mg a week, adalimumab every 2 weeks and 2.5 mg of daily prednisone, as well as calcium and vitamin D.\n\n【5】She was admitted for a sudden, bilateral, painless visual loss. Physical examination disclosed complete blindness with light-unresponsive pupils, without any other neurologic or systemic abnormalities. Funduscopy was normal, and ophthalmological evaluation ruled out uveitis or any other ocular problems. Blood chemistry, ESR, CBC and differential were normal. She was afebrile, and her blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg. A cranial CT scan was normal, and a transcranial duplex examination (color mode) showed a less obvious spectrum in the posterior circulation as compared with the anterior circulation. A brain MRI performed a few hours after onset disclosed an abnormal signal on FLAIR sequences over the subcortical white matter of both occipital lobes. MR-angiography showed a less intense representation of the posterior cerebral arteries as compared with the anterior circulation; posterior arteries displayed multiple segmental stenoses .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The resolution of the edema is seen on the MRI performed 72 h later (D), with signs of reactive hyperperfusion of the posterior regions on perfusion maps (E). An angio-MRI performed 4 weeks later showed the resolution of the posterior circulation segmental stenoses (F). |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【7】Blindness was followed by right-sided neglect and left upper limb ataxia. All the neurological signs resolved spontaneously in 72 h. She remained asymptomatic and with normal blood pressure throughout.\n\n【8】Another brain MRI 72 h later showed a normalization of the brain parenchyma signal, together with an increase in brain volume of the posterior regions in the perfusion maps, likely reflecting a reactive hyperperfusion .\n\n【9】She was discharged, and methotrexate and adalimumab were stopped. An angio-MRI performed 4 weeks later showed resolution of segmental stenoses of the posterior circulation . She has remained asymptomatic ever since.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】PRES is a clinicoradiological entity characterized by headache, confusion, seizures and diverse visual abnormalities in combination with neuroimaging evidence of reversible vasogenic edema predominantly involving the subcortical white matter of parietal and occipital lobes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】This patient, with Behcet’s disease and immunosuppressive therapy, presented with a painless blindness together with abnormal signal on the occipital lobes and evidence of posterior circulation disturbances on imaging studies. These abnormalities were rapidly reversible, thus suggesting the diagnosis of PRES.\n\n【13】PRES has been described in association to hypertension, eclampsia, organ transplantation, infections, connective tissue disorders, autoimmune disorders, immunosuppressive therapy, chemotherapy, hypercalcemia, uremia, porphyria and HIV patients on antiretroviral treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\- 3 \\]</u>. While PRES has been described in several autoimmune disorders (mainly lupus), we have not found any other case associated to Behcet’s disease in the literature.\n\n【14】A number of drugs have been associated to PRES, including cyclosporine, tacrolimus, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, high-dose steroids and diverse monoclonal antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. This patient was on methotrexate, adalimumab and low-dose prednisone, and their combination could have played a role in PRES development. A sudden increase in blood pressure is the most common trigger for PRES, although it can also occur with normal blood pressure, particularly when it is associated, as in our patient, to chemotherapy or immunosuppressive drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. A drug-induced endothelial cell damage affecting the brain blood flow autoregulation has been proposed as a pathophysiological mechanism in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Neuro-Behcet is the main consideration in the differential diagnosis in this patient. The clinical presentation with a reversible course and the neuroimaging findings would be highly atypical for a small venous inflammatory disease of the brain typical of Behcet’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>, supporting the diagnosis of PRES. This was the reason why an invasive conventional angiography was not performed. There was no evidence of other neurological complications of Behcet’s disease, such as cerebral sinus venous thrombosis, aseptic meningitis or neuropathy.\n\n【16】The diagnosis of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) should also be considered. This entity is defined by the association of severe headaches (often thunderclap) with or without additional neurological symptoms, and reversible constriction of cerebral arteries resolving spontaneously in 3 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Our patient had no headache associated with the neurological deficit, and the presence of reversible white matter lesions supported the diagnosis of PRES.\n\n【17】The management of PRES includes blood pressure control and correction of electrolytic abnormalities when present, as well as discontinuation of offending drugs. PRES relapse occurs in approximately 4-8% of patients, particularly if predisposing factors are not eliminated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】In summary, the diagnosis of PRES should be borne in mind of physicians caring for patients with systemic disorders including Behcet’s disease, since misdiagnosis will likely result in severe neurologic injury or death.\n\n【19】Financial Disclosures\n\n【20】This manuscript did not receive any financial aid.

There are several secondary causes for amyloidosis like chronic inflammatory process or malignancies. There is no definitive cure for amyloidosis yet. It can present with a wide range of clinical manifestations depending on organ system involvement.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】We present here a 47-year-old Asian woman with history of hypothyroidism who came to emergency room with intermittent right upper quadrant abdominal pain for a month with worsening of symptoms for the last 3 - 4 days prior to presentation. Symptoms were associated with nausea, bloating sensation, abdomen distension, early satiety and weight loss. On examination, she had mild abdomen distension, right upper quadrant tenderness, hepatomegaly and bipedal pitting edema. Her pertinent laboratory findings were serum albumin of 1.6, total bilirubin of 3.5, direct of 2.1, AST/ALT of 151/81 and alkaline phosphatase of 1,339. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/Cr was 20/1.6 and urinalysis (UA) was positive for proteinuria of 300 mg/dL. Ultrasound (US) of gallbladder revealed hepatomegaly, thickened gallbladder wall with 4 mm gall bladder polyps vs. non-shadowing stones concerning for acute cholecystitis. Cholestatic pattern of liver enzymes prompted us to get magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, which confirmed the findings of US gallbladder along with ascites without any intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. Her viral serologies were suggestive of past hepatitis B infection. Antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-mitochondrial antibody, alpha-1 antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin and iron profile were within normal limits. Patient felt better with supportive treatment by day 3 of admission. Since most of the workup was unrevealing, decision was made for liver biopsy. Biopsy was positive for amyloidosis.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Clinical presentation of amyloidosis depends on the type of protein, tissue distribution and the amount of amyloid deposition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Some clinical and laboratory features that suggest amyloidosis include waxy skin and easy bruising, enlarged tongue, symptoms and signs of heart failure, cardiac conduction abnormalities, hepatomegaly, proteinuria, peripheral and/or autonomic neuropathy and impaired coagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Proteinuria leading to nephrotic syndrome and renal insufficiency is the earliest and most frequent clinical manifestation that should raise suspicion of AA amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. There are very few cases reported in the literature of amyloidosis initially presenting with features of acute cholecystitis and cholestatic pattern of liver function tests along with ascites. Our patient presented clinically as acute cholecystitis. The clinical dilemma was more when US commented on the findings as non-shadowing stones vs. polyps. Diffuse wall thickening of gall bladder as seen in US in this case might just be amyloid deposition rather than actual inflammation and the non-shadowing stones could as well be the amyloid deposition. Cholecystitis secondary to gallbladder localization of amyloidosis is very unusual. Generally amyloidosis affects the epithelium of intrahepatic bile duct without reaching canaliculi and acini of glandular peribiliares and amount of bile deposits correlates with the extent of amyloidosis in liver parenchyma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】Conclusion\n\n【7】Amyloidosis can rarely present as acute cholecystitis and there could be diagnostic dilemma because of inconclusive US findings.\n\n【8】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Source of Support</u>\n\n【9】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:08:59", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:11:45", "cost": 165.897}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:57", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:11:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:08:59"}

The first description was attributed to Heberden in 1806, but Schonlein first described the association of arthralgias and purpura, termed “peliosis rheumatica”, in 1837.

The HP infection could be detected by the 13C-urea breath test. The standard diagnostic test relies on gastric mucosal biopsy. Herein we present a rare case report of an Indian adult man diagnosed with HP infection complicated by HSP.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 30-year-old Indian man who migrated to the USA from India 3 years prior to this presentation with a past medical history of psoriasis, not on any medications presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset constant abdominal pain for 5 days. The pain was in the right and left upper quadrant, spasmodic in nature, 5/10 in intensity, not radiating and no aggravating or relieving factors. The abdominal examination did not reveal any guarding, or any other abnormality. In the ED, he was evaluated with a complete blood count, metabolic panel, urinalysis, computed tomography (CT) abdomen and pelvis, and right upper quadrant ultrasound, all of which were negative except for leukocytosis 17.9 (4.5 - 11 ×10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL). He was discharged from the ED with a prescription for pantoprazole and tramadol.\n\n【4】The patient returned to the ED 2 days later with persistent abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting and inability to tolerate an oral diet. At this time, he also reported maculopapular rash that he noticed on both legs which started at the same time with abdominal pain. He reported rash extended to his calves. He was admitted for further evaluation and underwent endoscopy which showed non-bleeding small gastric ulcer with multiple duodenal erosions . He was treated symptomatically and discharged on pantoprazole. On day 12 (since the onset of pain), the gastric biopsy came back positive for HP  and he was started on triple therapy (clarithromycin, amoxicillin and lansoprazole) for HP.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The rash continued to spread to involve the thighs, flanks, around the umbilicus, and extensor surfaces of arms . The patient came back to the ED on day 27 (since the onset of symptoms) with the same symptoms after finishing triple antibiotic therapy. The patient was again admitted and underwent extensive immunological workup including rheumatoid factor, C-reactive proteins, anti-nuclear antibodies, total complement level, C3, C4, IgA level, ANCA IgG level, myeloperoxidase antibody, serine protein 3, anti-DNA antibody and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which were all within normal limits. He underwent repeat endoscopy which showed healed gastric ulcer. Skin rash continued to worsen to involve almost all extensor surfaces of both legs . A skin biopsy of the skin rash was obtained while the patient was treated symptomatically with narcotics to control the pain. The patient was eventually discharged with pain medications and instructed to follow-up as an outpatient. The skin biopsy eventually came back positive for leukocytoclastic vasculitis . HSP diagnosis was made by exclusion since patient did not have connective tissue disorders based on immunological workup, no history of drug ingested prior to symptoms. At that point, the patient was started on prednisone 40 mg daily and improved drastically on the following day of starting steroids. Patient continued on steroids taper for 8 weeks. Rash as well as abdominal pain resolved completely.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

It is the most common acute vasculitis disorder affecting children; however, it is relatively uncommon in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Prior to the last 30 years, it was considered a disease of children only, with an estimated incidence of 20 cases/100,000 children per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It recurs in approximately one-third of children. An upper respiratory infection is the primary precipitating event in children, although approximately two-thirds of children with HSP have no precipitating event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This disorder is encountered even more rarely by nephrologists caring for adults and accounts for 0.6-2% of adult nephropathies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. HSP in adults can initially present as malignant lung, breast, prostate and intestine carcinomas (66%) and 33% are hematological such as lymphoma and multiple myeloma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Reinauer et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> reported the first HSP and chronic gastritis case with diagnosed HP infection by 13C-urea breath test in 1995, in whom the purpura, intestinal symptoms and albuminuria disappeared after eradication treatment. A subsequent case was reported by Mozrzymas et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Mytinger et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> reported HSP induced by HP in pediatric patients. Multiple articles in China reported a potential association between HP infection and HSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Thus, detecting HP carrying status in HSP children, particularly those with abdominal manifestations, is indispensable in endemic areas. Diagnostic methods that can confirm the current infection situation are recommended to detect the existence of HP in HSP patients. Our patient was diagnosed by gastric biopsy.\n\n【13】HP is a known etiology for gastric diseases such as gastritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, peptic ulcer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, gastric cancer and B-cell lymphoma of gastric mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue (MALT lymphoma) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In addition to local tissue damage, a potential role of HP infection in various extragastric pathologies has been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Autoimmune diseases include HSP, Sjogren’s syndrome, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, acute immune polyneuropathies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Association with other diseases such as ischemic heart disease and membranous nephropathy was described as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The mechanism of HSP and HP is unclear. The presence of more toxic HP strains induces a strong inflammatory response, directly or indirectly, with the release of bacterial and host-dependent cytotoxic substances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, genetic predisposition of the individual 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>, antibodies against HP cross-reaction with some extragastric tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>, polymeric immunoglobulin A (pIgA), activated complements (C3 or C5) and certain fibrinogen/fibrin deposited in vessel walls, without IgG or IgM deposition. The immune complex between these elements in skin, gut, kidney and other organs resulted in purpura, intestinal manifestation, nephritis and other relatively rare symptoms. Most investigators agreed that IgA1 was crucial in the progression of HSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. It is most likely the pathogen raises IgA levels resulting in type III hypersensitivity allergic reaction. Another factor is virulence of HP. The products of vacuolating toxin gene A (vacA) and cagA are the main virulence factors of HP. The vacA and cagA alleles encoded the most important HP virulence proteins VacA and CagA, which has a high prevalence in China. Based on the high toxigenicity of Chinese HP strains and its association with HSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u> and relatively low toxigenicity of strains in western countries, it is though that vacA or cagA might participate in the progression of HSP through a complicated and unknown mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of IgA by immunofluorescence in purpuric skin lesions or IgA and C3 complement mesangial deposits on kidney biopsy. In our patient, diagnosis was made by skin right arm punched biopsy which showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis; however, IgA staining was not done.\n\n【16】Mytinger et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> reported a 13-year-old boy with HSP associated with HP infection who was treated with triple therapy antibiotics and prompt resolution of the HSP was achieved. However, in this patient, abdominal pain and rash persisted even after completion of triple antibiotic therapy and resolution of HP infection.\n\n【17】In general, patients with HSP are treated supportively or symptomatically, whereas in patients with severe GI manifestations or renal complications, corticosteroid therapy is considered. Recently, a randomized controlled study confirmed that corticosteroid therapy is effective in reducing the intensity of abdominal pain and joint pain and in shortening the duration of mild nephritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. However, there is no evidence that it is effective in preventing recurrence or the development of nephritis. Dapsone is believed by some to have beneficial effects on cutaneous, GI and joint manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Pulse methylprednisolone therapy and such immunosuppressive agents as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide have been used anecdotally for severe kidney disease or another life-threatening disease. There are case reports of the efficacy of cyclosporine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>, intravenous immunoglobulin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>, plasmapheresis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u> and thalidomide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u> in patients that were resistant to steroids. In our patient, HSP symptoms persisted even after completing the triple therapy antibiotic course. Abdominal pain resolved after the initiation of the steroids course.\n\n【18】Prognosis of the typical course of kidney disease associated with adult HSP progresses over months, and a minority of patients will present with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). The literature demonstrates multiple case reports of acute kidney failure in adults due to HSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 , 27 \\]</u>. Thirty-eight percent of adult patients with HSP demonstrated kidney disease. Of these, 85% had microhematuria, 10% had macroscopic hematuria and 32% had impaired renal functions. End-stage kidney disease was reached in 11% of patients, and half of these occurred in less than 3 years from the onset of the disease. Factors predictive of the poor renal outcome included advanced age, preexisting chronic kidney disease, proteinuria more than 1 g/day, macroscopic hematuria, advanced pathological stage of kidney disease and glomerular sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis on kidney biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 , 28 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】HSP, also known as a leukocytoclastic vasculitis of small vessels, primarily involves the skin, GI tract, joints and kidneys. It is a pediatric disease; however, it can occur in adults. It can be associated with underlying malignancy in adults. HP infection can trigger HSP in pediatric and adult patients. Detection of the carrier state is crucial in HSP patients in areas where HP is endemic. Eradication of HP infection is usually associated with the resolution of HSP. In resistant cases with GI and renal involvement, corticosteroids use results in resolution of symptoms and reduction of the duration of mild nephritis.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Chunwei, Ma (Liberian at Jersey Shore University Medical Center) for the help of providing us with other case reports of HSP in adults to compare them to our case.

The most common cause is central disc protrusion at L5 - S1 level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. When diagnosis is suspected, neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lumbar spine is the initial choice for confirmation and identification of the cause. Treatment involved urgent decompression of nerve roots. CES due to any cause is very rare, with incidence of seven per 100,000 in USA. We present a case of CES due to Burkitt lymphoma which is a very rare presentation.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 54-year-old male active smoker with recent diagnosis of recurrent Burkitt lymphoma presented with complain of back pain and hip pain. Patient was initially diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma (Ki-67 100%, strong MYC protein staining, negative for MYC translocation, BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangements) few months back when had presented with syncope and was noted to have multiple lesions in lung, liver and kidney.\n\n【4】He presented again in start of this year with back pain, had biopsy of left iliac crest done. Two weeks later the patient presented to emergency department with acute worsening of back pain associated with left leg weakness and numbness. He was noted to have acute urine retention with overflow incontinence and complained of constipation. He denied having any trauma, fall or fevers.\n\n【5】On examination he was noted to have saddle anesthesia (loss of sensation in the perianal area left side much more so than the right) and decreased motor power (3/5) and sensations on left leg. Bladder scan showed 2,500 mL urine in bladder. MRI of LS spine and pelvis was done which showed extensive lesions at L4, L5, S3 causing nerve root compression and symptoms suggestive of CES .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Later he was started on three cycles of rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide (R-ICE). Patient’s symptoms improved significantly after chemoradiotherapy. His motor power improved and he was able to walk by himself, and there was also some improvement in saddle sensory loss and anal sphincter and bladder function. Follow-up imaging was done in 2 months showed improvement in mass on left side of L5 . Surgery was not done due to presence of metastatic disease and improvement in patient’s symptoms after chemoradiation therapy.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

Typical signs and symptoms associated with this disorder include low back pain, loss of bladder and bowel function, saddle anesthesia and unilateral or bilateral sciatica 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The most common cause of CES is an intervertebral disc prolapse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Other rare causes of CES include fracture, compression by tumor, penetrating trauma, chiropractic manipulation, chemonucleolysis, postoperative hematoma, free epidural fat graft, and ankylosing spondylitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) rarely affects central nervous system (CNS). It most commonly involves brain (2% of primary CNS and 7-9% of metastatic brain tumors). The involvement of spinal cord or cauda equina is very rare. The incidence of lymphoma is less than 2% in tumors involving cauda equina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Three different forms of CES have been reported: 1) Acute CES in a patient without previous back problems; 2) Acute neurologic deficits in a patient with chronic back issues; 3) Gradual progression to CES in a patient who have chronic back pain and sciatica 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However in 85% of cases, the signs and symptoms of CES develop with 24 h.\n\n【13】Several studies suggest that CES should be operated within 6 h of onset of symptoms. But literature review showed that there is no statistical difference in the outcome of patients who underwent surgery within 6 h or 48 h 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. However patients presenting with CES due to tumor compression should be immediately given IV steroids.\n\n【14】Our patient presented to hospital after 1 month of symptoms onset, if he had presented immediately after the symptoms onset the final outcome would have been more favorable. Delay in diagnosis and treatment can lead to devastating outcomes in CES leading to persistent neurologic deficit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In one of the retrospective review of 44 patients with CES it was noted that the delayed surgery group (> 48 h) demonstrated a significantly greater chance of permanent motor weakness, urological dysfunction, chronic severe pain and sexual dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. This finding was again supported by data from a meta-analysis of 322 cases of CES which showed a significant difference in outcome in those cases decompressed in within 48 h and those decompressed after 48 h 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Conclusions\n\n【16】We report a rare presentation of Burkitt lymphoma causing extradural compression and leading to CES. Clinicians must be aware of clinical manifestations of CES and it should be considered in differential diagnoses in patients presenting with neurological deficits with underlying lymphoma. MRI with contrast enhancement allows for timely diagnosis of the syndrome, and immediate surgical intervention should be done to avoid permanent disability.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We do not have any financial disclosure or funding received from anyone.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no conflict interest (all authors).</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient gave informed consent of the publication of this report.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Each author contributed to writing of this report.

It presents with progressive weakness, loss of motor function, hypotonia and hyporeflexia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) first described AFM following a surge of cases within the United States in 2014 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. AFM diagnosis is suggested by the typical clinical findings, with a pleocytosis (greater than 5 white blood cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> ) and a mild elevation of protein concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Confirmation of the diagnosis is made by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrating characteristic destruction of the gray matter of the ventral horns of the spinal cord 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Antecedent respiratory and/or gastrointestinal viral illness with or without fever occurs in the majority of AFM cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>. The proximal muscle groups of the upper extremities are more commonly affected, typically with a relative preservation of distal limb motor function. Cranial nerve involvement with bulbar dysfunction may also occur, as AFM may affect gray matter of the brainstem (particularly, the pons), resulting in diplopia and facial muscle weakness due to affected cranial nerves VI and VII 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 \\]</u>. Given the progressive and frequently long-term neurological involvement of AFM, patients may require anesthetic care during radiological imaging or other surgical procedures. We present a 4-year-old girl with AFM who required anesthetic care during a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The end-organ involvement of the disease is discussed, pathogenesis and treatment options are reviewed and anesthetic implications are presented.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Institutional Review Board approval is not required for single case reports at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH). The patient was a previously healthy 4-year-old, 21.5 kg girl presenting for a PEG tube placement and tracheostomy secondary to respiratory failure due to neuromuscular weakness. She presented initially to the emergency department (ED) 3 weeks prior to the date of current surgery for complaints of bilateral weakness of the upper and lower limbs (inability to stand), flaccid paralysis, areflexia, hypotonia and bulbar dysfunction. Her past medical history included a viral upper respiratory illness with cough, rhinorrhea and congestion for 2 weeks prior to admission. A diagnosis of AFM was made following MR imaging, which demonstrated bilateral destruction of the gray matter, largely restricted within the ventral horns of the cervical and thoracic spinal cords. Lumbar puncture was performed, and the cerebrospinal fluid showed a normal protein and glucose with 1 red blood cell and 3 white blood cells per mm <sup>3 </sup> . The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (total dose of 2 g/kg) with minimal improvement in strength. Due to ongoing motor weakness, she required mechanical ventilation, and a direct laryngoscopy with placement of a tracheostomy and laparoscopic gastrostomy tube (PEG) was planned. Previous surgical procedures had been delayed twice due to preoperative hemodynamic instability with hypotension and intraoperative hypoxemia after induction of anesthesia of unclear etiology. A gastrostomy was initially scheduled approximately 1 week after admission to ED; however, it was cancelled due to progressive respiratory failure with worsening oxygenation and atelectasis on the morning of the procedure. After stabilization, the second planned operative procedure included tracheostomy and PEG placement. However, upon transferring the patient to the operating room table, decreased oxygen saturation and absent breath sounds on the left side were noted. A chest radiograph performed revealed left-sided atelectasis. After removal of a large mucous plug via rigid bronchoscopy, ventilation and oxygenation improved. However, the planned procedure was cancelled, the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and the procedure was rescheduled for the following week. On the morning of the procedure 1 week later, the patient’s respiratory status was stable with a low oxygen requirement and no evidence of atelectasis on the morning chest radiograph. The patient was kept nil per os after midnight and intravenous fluids were started. Anesthetic plan, risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with the parents and informed consent was obtained. The patient was transported to the operating room from the PICU. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors were applied. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl. Neuromuscular blockade was provided by rocuronium. Infusions of midazolam and hydromorphone, which were being administered in the PICU, were continued during the case. Additional maintenance anesthesia included sevoflurane in air/oxygen. She was placed in a supine position, with arms tucked to the side. A second peripheral intravenous cannula was placed. Intraoperatively during the procedure, there were intermittent episodes of hypotension (blood pressure 50/33 mm Hg) which were treated with bolus doses of phenylephrine. During these episodes of hypotension, there were associated decreases in oxygen saturation (pulse oximeter reading as low as 30%). During the procedure, a total of five bolus doses of phenylephrine (1 - 2 µg/kg) were administered. Both the blood pressure and oxygen saturation returned to normal with the intermittent phenylephrine doses. The blood pressure instability was assumed to be due to autonomic dysfunction related to AFM. The procedure lasted approximately 2.5 h during which time a PEG tube and tracheostomy were placed. Intravenous fluids included 165 mL of maintenance fluids, 5% dextrose in 1/2 normal saline and 160 mL of lactated Ringers. The patient was transferred to the PICU, and the remainder of her postoperative course was unremarkable. Over the next 3 - 4 weeks, the patient’s need for mechanical ventilation support was weaned. The tracheostomy and PEG tube were removed successfully approximately 2 months after placement. Her current status includes residual weakness and spasticity which impair activities of daily life and mobility. Specifically, she has residual weakness in her arms and legs with spastic tetraplegia, the right side being more affected than her left. She continues to participate in physical therapy and rehabilitation.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】AFM typically starts with a prodromal febrile viral illness of the upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 \\]</u>. Symptoms are typical of viral infections including cough, rhinorrhea, and congestion or vomiting and diarrhea, generally lasting approximately 1 week. Following this, an acute neurological phase with flaccid muscle weakness, as described above, is noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Although there is generally recovery of motor function over time, residual weakness and paralysis is frequent and, at times, irreversible. Fatemi et al noted that only 5% of AFM cases in 2014 showed full recovery to previous strength 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Treatment of AFM consists primarily of supportive care, including endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation and provision of adequate nutrition. Various treatments targeting the immune system have been offered with limited success, including plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Anecdotal reports outline the use of antiviral agents, such as fluoxetine, which may counteract EV-D68 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】The specific etiology of AFM remains unclear. However, there are several enteroviruses that have been implicated in the pathogenesis, the most common being EV-D68 and EV-A71 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Herpes viruses, adenoviruses and flaviviruses, such as West Nile and Japanese encephalitis viruses, have also been implicated, although less frequently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Despite this association with viral infections, causality has not been established between any specific virus and AFM. Given the overlap in clinical signs and symptoms, AFM can be mistaken for Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), transverse myelitis and poliomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Definitive diagnosis requires MR image that demonstrates bilateral destruction of gray matter that is limited to the ventral horns of the spinal cord. MR imaging of GBS typically demonstrates enhancement of anterior nerve roots in the conus medullaris and cauda equina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Sensory symptoms may be more indicative of transverse myelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The absence of poliovirus in stool should be confirmed to exclude poliomyelitis as the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】As with any anesthetic care, appropriate preoperative preparation begins with a thorough preoperative examination and identification of end-organ effects of the disease process. In patients with AFM, primary anesthetic concerns include the potential for involvement of the upper airway and the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Bulbar weakness and poor upper airway control may predispose these patients to aspiration. Based on the patient’s central nervous system involvement and nil per os status, techniques to limit aspiration during anesthetic induction, including rapid sequence intubation and airway control with endotracheal intubation, may be indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. As our patient’s airway had been previously secure with endotracheal intubation, these issues were already addressed.\n\n【8】Our patient had previously developed preoperative mucus plugging, atelectasis and hypoxemia necessitating cancellation of the scheduled procedure. These issues are also relevant during the perioperative period when the residual effects of anesthetic agents and neuromuscular blocking agents may exacerbate poor baseline respiratory function and result in perioperative respiratory insufficiency. General precautions include postoperative monitoring of respiratory function in an ICU setting, tracheal extubation when patient is fully awake following dissipation of residual effects of intraoperative anesthetic agents, complete reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade and judicious use of opioid analgesia. Extubation to non-invasive techniques of respiratory support such as bilevel positive airway pressure with a slow transition to unassisted breathing may facilitate postoperative tracheal extubation and prevent atelectasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>. Frequent chest physiotherapy, including assisted cough devices and incentive spirometry, may also help to facilitate the clearance of mucus and prevent postoperative respiratory complications.\n\n【9】The central and peripheral nervous system involvement of AFM may further impact the perioperative choice of neuromuscular blocking agents. Although not required for all surgical procedures, depolarizing and non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents raise concerns regarding safety and effective blockade reversal, respectively. Due to denervation of the neuromuscular junction by succinylcholine, a depolarizing muscle relaxant, proliferation of extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors can be expected with the potential for an exaggerated hyperkalemic response. Although there are no reports regarding the administration of succinylcholine to a patient with AFM, hyperkalemia has been reported following the administration of succinylcholine to patients with GBS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 17 \\]</u>. The similar involvement seen with AFM and GBS would suggest that succinylcholine should be avoided in patients with AFM. As our patient would receive postoperative mechanical ventilation, neuromuscular blockade was established with rocuronium, a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. With pre-existing hypotonia and weakness, the effects of rocuronium can be expected to be prolonged; however, the novel agent, sugammadex, offers an option for rapid reversal of neuromuscular blockade with rocuronium and a limited chance of residual weakness even in patients with comorbid neuromuscular conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】A final issue noted in our patient was the potential for autonomic instability and intraoperative hypotension due to spinal cord involvement, similar to spinal shock with traumatic injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Hypotension was noted, which we would postulate is related to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) with bradycardia and limited tachycardic response to blood pressure changes. These cardiovascular effects may be exaggerated by the hemodynamic effects of the anesthetic agents. Treatment options include the administration of fluids and the treatment of low SVR with the direct-acting α-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine.\n\n【11】In summary, we present the perioperative care of a child with AFM. Primary anesthetic concerns include the potential for involvement of the upper airway and respiratory systems, with hypotonia, poor airway control and potential for postoperative respiratory failure. Central and peripheral nervous system involvement impacts the perioperative use of neuromuscular blocking agents, while hemodynamic instability may be seen related to spinal cord involvement.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Obtained.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Anuradha Kanaparthi: review of the medical record with preparation of the case report and the manuscript (initial and revised versions).

GTD includes different conditions such as hydatidiform mole (HM) (complete or partial), invasive mole, gestational choriocarcinoma, placental-site trophoblastic tumor, and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor. The most common GTD is HM. HM is a gestational disease with abnormal development of the villous trophoblast and characterized by an excess of paternal to maternal genetic material. It occurs once in every 600 pregnancies in Western countries but at higher rates in the Middle East, Latin America, Africa, and the Far East 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-3 \\]</u>. The most important risk factors for the development of HM are maternal age, geographical factors including ethnicity, and a previous molar pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Women with GTD history appear not to be at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, although there have been some reports of an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, recurrent HM, stillbirth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. In this retrospective evaluation, we have aimed to report the obstetrical history features of our patients who have experienced HM in their previous pregnancies.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】This retrospective study was conducted at the Division of Perinatal Medicine, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine from January 2010 to December 2012.\n\n【5】The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were achieved through patient files and electronic records of the hospital. Patient demographics (age, parity, gravida, etc.), obstetrics history, perinatal complications (miscarriage, chromosomal abnormalities, malformations, and stillbirth) were recorded.\n\n【6】A total of six patients with history for HM were admitted to our hospital from January 2010 to December 2012. The mean age of the pregnant patients was 31.33 ± 5.33 years (range: 24 - 39 years). The mean gravida of the patients was 3.83 ± 0.75 (range 3 - 5). Details are given in Table 1 . There were two patients who had heterozygous mutation for methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) enzyme. One patient had both factor V Leiden and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme heterozygous mutation. Excluding HM pregnancies, these six patients had 17 pregnancies totally. Eleven pregnancies (64.7%) experienced obstetrical/perinatal complications during their pregnancies. The most common complication was miscarriage (five pregnancies in four patients). Other complications were anomalous fetus, motor and mental retarded child, ectopic pregnancy, preterm birth and stillbirth.

Many studies did not reveal adverse perinatal or maternal complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Results from earlier studies indicate that women with a history of HM can expect a normal subsequent reproductive outcome, except for a slightly increased risk of a recurrent HM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】On the contrary, the results of a large national cohort study from Sweden could not demonstrate an association between a history of HM and adverse maternal outcomes in subsequent pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. They have demonstrated an evidence of an increased risk of large for gestational age birth, stillbirth, and preterm birth among women with a history of HM (OR (95% CI): 1.19, 1.13, and 1.13, respectively). They have also reported that women exposed to a previous HM had a 25% lower risk of gestational hypertensive disease and preeclampsia when compared to controls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our findings are consistent with recent literature because there were 11 pregnancies with obstetrical/perinatal complications (64.7%).\n\n【12】Previous studies revealed that overall recurrence risk for HM was 1.8% (1 in 55), or a 20-fold increase compared with baseline risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6-10 \\]</u>. We did not observe recurrence of HM in our small series probably because of inadequate number of patients.\n\n【13】There have been a lot of published reports about the relationship between MTHFR polymorphism and genetic disorders such as Down’s syndrome, cleft lip and palate, congenital heart disease, and neural tube defect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11-13 \\]</u>. In our study, we have shown that 60% (3/5) of the patients had heterozygous mutation for MTHFR enzyme (impaired enzyme activity). When recent literature is reviewed, there were no paper about association between MTHFR enzyme mutation and HM. This DNA methylation disorder may be the triggering reason of empty oocyte which may be the reason of HM. We believe that further studies are needed to validate this finding.\n\n【14】In conclusion, we advise obstetricians to be careful when their patients experienced HM in their previous pregnancies.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:49:40", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:50:05", "cost": 24.933}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:50:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:49:40"}

It is a synthetically modified γ-cyclodextrin that selectively reverses steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) including rocuronium and vecuronium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Sugammadex selectively encapsulates the NMBA in a one-to-one molecular interaction forming a complex and effectively removing the NMBA from the plasma. In contrast to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, sugammadex is able to rapidly reverse even profound neuromuscular blockade occurring immediately after the administration of a NMBA. Given this rapid reversal of profound blockade, it has been suggested for use in critical situations where the rapid reversal of profound neuromuscular blockade is necessary including the “cannot intubate-cannot ventilate” (CICV) scenario 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\- 4 \\]</u>. We report the use of sugammadex to reverse neuromuscular blockade following difficulty with positive pressure ventilation after endotracheal intubation in a neonate with duodenal atresia and a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). The potential for its use in critical airway and ventilation scenarios is reviewed.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Institutional Review Board approval is not required at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, Ohio) for the presentation of single case reports. The patient was a 1.77 kg, 34-week gestation neonate with duodenal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), presenting for emergent gastrostomy tube placement and ligation of the TEF. Following birth, multiple congenital anomalies were noted including a solitary kidney with a sacral anomaly and possible tethered cord. Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 min and 5 min, respectively. A preoperative chest radiograph revealed a markedly distended stomach bubble with termination of an esophageal tube high in the upper thorax. Mild diffuse bilateral lung disease was noted suggesting either aspiration or hyaline membrane disease. On day 1 of life, she was taken to the operating room. Her vital signs were stable while breathing spontaneously on room air with a blood pressure of 48/26 mm Hg, heart rate of 137 beats/minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 98%. Given the risks of aspiration and the potential for insufflation of the stomach through the fistula with positive pressure ventilation, the decision was made to proceed with awake endotracheal intubation followed by the induction of anesthesia. Following the administration of dexmedetomidine (1 µg/kg), the infant’s trachea was intubated and positive pressure provided. As it appeared that the lungs could be effectively ventilated without insufflation of the stomach, rocuronium (1 mg/kg) and propofol (3 mg/kg) were administered. Following the administration of rocuronium, ventilation became problematic and air entry was noted into the stomach with a decrease of the SpO2 to 72%. Sugammadex (8 mg/kg) was administered and spontaneous ventilation was regained within 1 - 2 min. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane with spontaneous or assisted ventilation as needed and the gastrostomy tube was placed. The TEF was ligated and the patient was returned with the endotracheal tube in place to the neonatal intensive care unit. The patient’s trachea was extubated on postoperative day 5 and the remainder of the postoperative course was uneventful.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】For anticholinesterase inhibitors to effectively reverse competitive blockade with non-depolarizing NMBAs, the concentration of the neuromuscular blocking agent in the synaptic cleft must be relatively low and there must be significant residual neuromuscular function present. As such, in a patient such as ours, who had just received a full dose of rocuronium for endotracheal intubation, these agents would be ineffective. Three prospective trials involving a total of 180 pediatric patients have demonstrated a significantly more effective and more rapid return of the TOF to ≥ 90% with sugammadex than with neostigmine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\- 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】Given these clinical effects, sugammadex may allow the potential for the rapid pharmacologic reversal of profound neuromuscular blockade and therefore has been suggested for use in critical airway and ventilation scenarios including a CICV scenario 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Its potential utility in such scenarios was evaluated in a prospective trial in adults which compared the administration of rocuronium (1 mg/kg) plus sugammadex (16 mg/kg) with succinylcholine (1 mg/kg) for rapid sequence intubation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The time to resumption of spontaneous ventilation was shorter in the rocuronium-sugammadex group (216 s versus 406 s). However, others have published models to simulate the duration of anesthesia, apnea, and respiratory depression using common anesthetic induction techniques with predicted rates of oxygen desaturation to explore to what degree the rapid reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex might improve the return of spontaneous ventilation in CICV situations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Their simulations demonstrated that the duration of neuromuscular blockade was longer with 1.0 mg/kg succinylcholine than with 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium followed 3 min later by 16 mg/kg sugammadex (10.0 vs. 4.5 min). The authors concluded that the duration of intolerable ventilatory depression after sugammadex reversal may be as long as 15 min in 5% of individuals and therefore, the clinical management of CICV should focus primarily on restoration of airway patency, oxygenation, and ventilation consistent with the American Society of Anesthesiologist’s practice guidelines for management of the difficult airway.\n\n【7】We report anecdotal experience with the use of sugammadex for rapid reversal of neuromuscular blockade in a patient with a TEF, in whom positive pressure ventilation became problematic after the administration of rocuronium, due to gastric insufflation through the fistula. Spontaneous ventilation resumed and oxygen saturation increased 1 - 2 min after the administration of sugammadex. To date, there is only one previous report of the use of sugammadex in a critical airway scenario 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The patient was a 9-month-old, 5.9 kg infant with severe stridor, scheduled for upper airway evaluation. Anesthesia was induced with a combination of propofol and fentanyl followed by the demonstration of effective bag-valve-mask ventilation and the administration of vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg). After several failed attempts at direct laryngoscopy, bag-valve-mask ventilation became difficult due to insufflation of the stomach and the oxygen saturation decreased to 75%. Sevoflurane was discontinued and sugammadex (8 mg/kg) was administrated. The time from the administration of vecuronium to the administration of sugammadex was less than 6 min. Effective spontaneous ventilation returned 25 s after the administration of sugammadex. Ninety seconds after the administration of sugammadex, the skeletal muscle tone was regained and oxygen saturation returned to 99-100% with an inspired oxygen concentration of 0.4.\n\n【8】This anecdotal information may be useful as recent reports and guidelines have suggested a reappraisal of specific tenets of airway management and recommend the consideration of instituting neuromuscular blockade when facing a “cannot ventilate scenario” to overcome functional airway obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. The report of the national project from the United Kingdom recommends that when CICV occurs, waking up the patient is not a first step anymore and the administration of neuromuscular blockade should occur prior to proceeding to a surgical airway. The pediatric airway guidelines from the Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (APAGBI) recommend that further attempts at endotracheal intubation should not occur without using neuromuscular blockade. They note that rocuronium is regarded as a favorable choice because of its rapid onset and the potential for reversal with sugammadex.\n\n【9】In summary, we present anecdotal experience with the efficacy of sugammadex to reverse neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium in neonate during a critical airway and ventilation scenario. When positive pressure ventilation became problematic and oxygen saturations decreased due to gastric insufflation from the TEF, spontaneous ventilation resumed and oxygen saturations increased 1 - 2 min after the administration of sugammadex. Sugammadex offers the potential for the rapid reversal of neuromuscular blockade in various critical airway and respiratory scenarios. Future anecdotal experience and prospective trials are needed to future outline its utility in these clinical scenarios.\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:49:23", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:49:36", "cost": 13.06}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:49:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:49:21"}

The histopathological evaluation revealed that the polyp in the cecum was tubular adenoma and that the polyps in the transverse colon and rectum were hyperplastic polyps. An area of congested mucosa measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter was noted in the rectum.

Splenic abscesses may often be misdiagnosed, because the signs and symptoms are non-specific; nevertheless, modern imaging has improved the process of their diagnosis. In this series, treatment was carried out by antibiotics and percutaneous drainage or splenectomy. The mortality rate appeared to be related to the patient’s general underlying condition. Our patients recovered from their splenic abscess regardless of the treatment modality. Thus, based on these observations, the prognosis for these patients cannot be accurately predicted by the intervention methods. Percutaneous treatment of splenic abscess is an effective alternative to surgery; furthermore, it offers the theoretical advantages of preserving immunologic function by avoiding splenectomy in young patients. The success rate of percutaneous drainage for splenic abscess has been reported between 67% and 100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Traditional treatment includes appropriate antimicrobial therapy with or without splenectomy. There are a number of studies in favor of spleen preservation and management using percutaneous drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Percutaneous aspiration or drainage may be used as a bridge to surgery, allowing non-operative healing for splenic abscess patients who are at risk for surgery, and helps avoid the risk of a fulminant and potentially life-threatening infection.\n\n【24】In conclusion, the best therapeutic approach for splenic abscess is still a matter of debate. We agree with the traditional treatment of antibiotics with or without splenectomy. However, based on our experience and the current literature, percutaneous aspiration of splenic abscess can be used as a bridge to surgery for those patients who are critically ill or who have several co-morbidities. Early diagnosis of splenic abscess requires a high degree of suspicion. Most of our patients presented with unexplained fever, abdominal pain and radiologic evidence of pathology in the left chest or abdomen, and these signs and symptoms should lead to suspicion of splenic abscess. Abdominal CT and ultrasonography were usually diagnostic. We suggest that treatment should be tailored and applied to splenic abscess patients on an individual basis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:48:00", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:48:40", "cost": 39.413}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:48:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:47:59"}

However, when clinically apparent, women usually experience heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding or pelvic pressure. Acute complications secondary to fibroids are rare and seldom necessitate emergency surgical intervention. The complications include venous thromboembolism, acute pain secondary to degeneration or torsion of a pedunculated fibroid, acute urinary retention and subsequent renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is rare for a uterine fibroid to spontaneously rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Intraperitoneal hemorrhage from rupture fibroid is usually venous and secondary to an increase in abdominal pressure, which causes rupture of superficial veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Bleeding can also be arterial and usually associated with hypertension. Trauma causing avulsion of a fibroid, torsion of a pedunculated fibroid, and pregnancy causing venous congestion resulting in vessel rupture are other possible etiologies for intra-abdominal bleeding from a fibroid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]</u>. With regard to our case, we could not demonstrate any cause that could lead to rupture of the vessel.\n\n【11】Imaging modalities can aid in diagnosis of hemoperitoneum. The differential diagnosis between ascites and hemoperitoneum is sometimes not easy. Ultrasound is a helpful instrument to make a diagnosis of hemoperitoneum. CT could help the clinician to arrive at the correct diagnosis quickly. However, CT and ultrasound may not be able to delineate the origin of the bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Prompt emergency surgical intervention can be life-saving in situations such as the case described.\n\n【12】Conclusions\n\n【13】Rupture of uterine fibroid is rare, but it should be included in the differential diagnosis when encountering patient with known submucosa fibroid and acute abdomen pain. Exploratory laparotomy is both diagnostic and therapeutic in this life-threatening condition.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent has been obtained from the individual included in this study.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>JT prepared first and subsequent drafts; MS contributed to the concept and review of all drafts; all authors discussed the findings and commented on the manuscript.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Data Availability</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:14:49", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:15:18", "cost": 29.126}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:15:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:14:48"}

Due to legal and ethical problems, the real frequency is unknown. As the area where the procedure is made is small and the surgeon is generally in control of the surgical area, this is a rare occurrence in the breast. Although there may be imaging findings which have been generated due to reactions, there are very few diagnostic findings for gossipyboma and some cases can be confusing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The case is presented here of gossipyboma found in the breast of a 65-year-old patient.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 65-year-old female presented with complaints of discharge from the surgical field of the upper inner quadrant (UIQ) of the right breast. There was a history of lumpectomy 2 months previously for a breast tumor (BI-RADS V). One week after the lumpectomy, a serous discharge from the wound site started and continued. The discharge was not flowing strongly and was caused by changing the dressing twice daily. Microbiologic examination of the discharge revealed no reproduction and thus the discharge was thought to be reactive. The patient presented at hospital as her complaints had not been resolved. In the physical examination, there was an incision of approximately 5-6 mm in the UIQ of the right breast. A serous discharge was observed from a defect of approximately 5 mm in the mid-section of the incision. On palpation, a mass was felt. In B-mode ultrasonography (USG) a mass was observed, approximately 3 × 2 cm in size, with light acoustic shadow, which was hypoechoic and irregular and located vertically . The mass had led to shrinkage in the surrounding tissues. When the lesion was evaluated only with the USG findings, it had the properties of BIRADS V appearance. Mammography (MG) was then applied to the patient. On the medio-lateral oblique (MLO) radiograph, asymmetric density of equivalent intensity to breast glandular tissue in the surgical localization of the right breast upper quadrant was observed . Within this area there was a twisted, linear appearance, which was thought to be suture material. Shrinkage in the skin in this area, which was thought to be secondary to the operation, accompanied the findings. From all these findings, the patient was admitted for surgery with a preliminary diagnosis of gossipyboma. A surgical sponge containing rolled suture material was removed .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The true frequency of all cases is unknown because of legal and ethical concerns. It is generally observed after abdominal surgery and may also be seen in the thoracic area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, the central nervous system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and in the extremities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In surface tissues such as the breast, it is extremely rare. Diagnostic difficulties are experienced because of confusion of what is seen with tumor, abscess or hematoma.\n\n【9】The clinical findings of gossipyboma show variations depending on location and the reaction created. While it may be determined coincidentally especially in internal abdominal organs, it can sometimes be fatal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although in surface tissue such as in the breast, findings are generally evident very soon, different clinical findings may be observed from asymptomatic granulomatosis to the appearance of abscess-fistula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】The radiologic appearance of gossipyboma represents the reaction created. While ultrasonography is useful in surface tissues, sensitivity in the determination of lesions in the abdomen, especially between intestinal loops is low compared to computerized tomography (CT). Although the ultrasonographic image shows variations depending on the time it has remained in the body and the reaction which has been created, it is generally non-specific. As in the case presented here, cystic, hypoechoic and complex masses can be seen as an acoustic shadowing showing an irregular mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】The use of sponges containing radio-opaque markers in cases undergoing abdominal surgery in particular, facilitates detection by radiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In these types of cases mammography is the method with the highest sensitivity in the determination of lesions in the breast. In the case reported here, a radio-opaque marker was determined on mammography which was applied directed towards the diagnosis of gossipyboma. In the light of clinical findings, USG and MG are sufficient in the diagnosis of lesions in the breast. However, there are also cases in literature where diagnosis has been made from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】In conclusion, even though it is rarely seen, gossipyboma should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a mass is determined in the surgical site of cases after operations. If sponges with radio-opaque markers are used, diagnosis can be made easily with mammography. In cases where radio-opaque markers are not observed, contrast CT and MRI may be beneficial.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support and Other Assistance</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declared no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:36:25", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:36:39", "cost": 13.464}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:36:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:36:15"}

Its prevalence increases with age to affect over 19% of people older than 80 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. As an age-related disorder, RLS is often seen in long-term care patients. RLS has hallmark features of discomfort or paresthesias in the lower legs that are relieved by movement. RLS is also commonly associated with observable periodic limb movements of sleep, which are involuntary stereotyped jerking movements of the limbs.\n\n【2】Dementia is also extremely common in long-term care settings, with prevalence in residents 65 years and older recently measured at 45% for men, and 52 % for women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In patients with dementia, having RLS as a comorbidity has been associated with nocturnal agitation behavior 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. These disruptions can create problems for nursing home residents including sleep deprivation and a decreased quality of life. Our case demonstrates this type of situation, along with the diagnostic difficulties surrounding RLS in patients with dementia.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Our patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia and challenging behavior who lives in a skilled nursing facility. Her past history included difficulties with sleep disruptions. In 2000, she stated that she had experienced symptoms of RLS since her teenage years. She was living independently in her home and took gabapentin and carbidopa/levodopa to treat her RLS symptoms. Later in 2001, her gabapentin was tapered off and her carbidopa/levodopa dosage was increased to counter worsening RLS symptoms. In 2003, pramipexole was added to her treatment, and in 2006, carbidopa/levodopa was discontinued while continuing pramipexole. In September 2008, she was admitted to the hospital for atrial fibrillation, and the hospital team noted problems in her memory and executive function, which her family confirmed had developed over a period of years. After dismissal from the hospital, she returned home but refused home health care. In November 2008, she experienced a fall and was eventually discharged to a long-term care (LTC) facility in light of further decline in memory.\n\n【5】Her RLS symptoms started to worsen while she was in LTC. In 2010, the medical team started treatment with gabapentin. She experienced agitation, which disrupted her sleep and provoked aggression towards staff. She was prescribed quetiapine for the agitation, presumed secondary to her dementia, but these symptoms persisted. The patient was unable to communicate any subjective experience of RLS symptoms, due to her cognitive decline. The primary concerns from the medical and nursing teams involved the potential challenges of RLS, as well as her dementia. The team increased the pramipexole, which helped improve her symptoms of agitation.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Current diagnostic criteria for RLS, published by the National Institute of Health and the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG), are based entirely on the subjective accounts of symptoms by patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. These diagnostic criteria are not applicable to patients with difficulties in memory, cognition, or communication. Patients with dementia and concurrent RLS have been previously shown to be incapable of reliably answering questions during an RLS diagnostic interview 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The IRLSSG also offered diagnostic criteria for patients with cognitive impairment, essentially consisting of observed patterns of behavior suggesting the subjective experience of RLS detailed in the diagnostic criteria for typical patients. Unfortunately, these criteria have not been formally studied or validated, like those applying to the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】These circumstances suggest that numerous patients with dementia and RLS are at-risk of delayed diagnosis and treatment, exacerbating their sleep disruption and cognitive difficulties, and leading to a decreased quality of life. Positive results from more objective diagnostic modalities, involving immobilization combined with electromyography, have been shown to be correlated with RLS in the past 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, but a large scale assessment showing the value of these tests has not yet been completed. Empiric treatment may be necessary for patients with cognitive impairment who are also thought to suffer from RLS, particularly in LTC settings. Nursing home providers should attempt treatment or modifications of treatment for RLS in appropriate residents. Observation by family and nursing staff is essential to evaluate improvement in the residentÃ­s quality of life.\n\n【9】RLS has notably been found to be correlated with iron deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Providers should screen for iron deficiency in all patients with suspected RLS, and residents should receive iron supplementation when their serum ferritin is below 50 Âµg/L 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Our patient experienced RLS continuously throughout her life, including when her serum ferritin was measured at 136 Âµg/L in 2004, suggesting her symptoms had a different etiology.\n\n【10】First-line pharmacologic therapy for RLS includes dopamine agonists, such as pramipexole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> and ropinirole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, titrated upwards to a suitable dose. These agents commonly result in an augmentation effect, with symptoms appearing earlier in the day and medication effectiveness decreasing over time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. This effect creates the challenging need to modify medications in residents who cannot communicate symptoms. The treatment regimen for our patientÃ­s RLS included pramipexole for several years, and as her symptoms have worsened, an appropriate adjunct, gabapentin, was added.\n\n【11】Levodopa/carbidopa can also be used as a baseline treatment for intermittent RLS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 13 \\]</u>. Unfortunately, augmentation and rebound symptoms in the morning commonly develop with this treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Clonazepam can be a useful adjunct therapy in patients with additional causes of poor sleep, with temazepam being recommended for patients with late-night awakenings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. These long-acting benzodiazepines may not be ideal in residents with dementia, due to their adverse effects on cognition and risk of falls. Opioids should be reserved for treatment in refractory cases of RLS, with codeine or tramadol to start, and higher-strength opioids used only in the most refractory cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Again, the risk of falls and sedation should be considered with opioids. Some medications commonly used in LTC may worsen RLS, including antidepressants, neuroleptics, dopamine agonists, and sedating antihistamines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. These should be discontinued if possible.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】With the subjective nature of accepted diagnostic criteria, there is a high-risk of RLS going unnoticed or untreated in LTC patients with dementia. RLS can be a significant contributor to sleep disturbance, agitation, and decreased quality of life in these patients. There is a need for further research to validate objective criteria for RLS diagnosis in patients such as ours, who experience cognitive and communication difficulties due to their dementia. Nevertheless, many treatment options exist for RLS, and they may be pursued empirically in patients with dementia and possible RLS, even in the face of inapplicable diagnostic criteria.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have none to report.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 09:47:16", "endTime": "2024/09/19 09:47:52", "cost": 36.329}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 17:47:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 17:47:13"}

However, attention should be paid to anomalies related to the left main coronary artery (LMCA) because it plays an essential role in providing blood supply to the majority of the left ventricle. We report an adult case of LMCA atresia in which heart failure developed without episodes suggesting angina.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 40-year-old man was referred to the department of cardiology of our hospital for difficulty breathing. The patient had been in his normal state of health until approximately 2 weeks before presentation, when exertional dyspnea developed and gradually progressed. His previous medical history included hypertension, dyslipidemia and gout. He did not take any medications. The patient did not drink, smoke, or use illicit drugs, and had no known allergies. There was no family history of cardiovascular diseases.\n\n【4】On examination, he was alert and well. His vital signs were normal except for a blood pressure of 130/111 mm Hg. The jugular venous pressure was not high, but gallops were audible at the apex. No pulmonary rales were heard on auscultation and there was no edema in the legs. Electrocardiography demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial dilation. Chest radiography revealed cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio of 55% without pleural effusion. The complete blood cell counts were normal. Levels of total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, uric acid and C-reactive protein were 1.7 mg/dL, 110 U/L, 132 U/L, 1.67 mg/dL, 33 mg/dL and 0.43 mg/dL, respectively. Although the creatinine kinase level was 540 U/L, the MB enzyme level was 20 U/L and the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T level was 0.020 ng/mL (reference value < 0.100). The level of brain natriuretic peptide was high at 734.9 pg/mL (reference value ≤ 18.4).\n\n【5】On echocardiography, the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic with an ejection fraction of 22% and enlarged with an end-diastolic diameter of 56 mm, accompanied by mild mitral regurgitation, findings consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy. The transmitral E/A ratio was 2.73 and the E/early diastolic mitral annular velocity ratio of the intraventricular septum was 22.77. The peak velocity of the tricuspid regurgitant was 3.7 m/s and the systolic pulmonary artery pressure was estimated to be 63 mm Hg. The left atrial volume index was high at 48 mL/m <sup>2 </sup> (reference: 17 - 32).\n\n【6】A diagnosis of heart failure was made, and diuretics, enalapril, bisoprolol and warfarin were administered. The contractility of the left ventricle improved to an ejection fraction of 52% and pulmonary hypertension disappeared. Warfarin was discontinued. Coronary angiography demonstrated no trace of the ostium of the LMCA in the sinuses of Valsalva; the middle to distal part of the LMCA was visualized by rich collateral flow from the right coronary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery and left circumflex coronary artery .

A total of 36 images over a 180° anterior arc were acquired 5 min and 3 h after tracer injection. The acquisition lasted 50 beats per projection, was stored in a matrix of 64 × 64 pixels and the images were reconstructed using a Hanning filter without attenuation or scatter correction. Bull’s eye maps demonstrated mild tracer defect of Tl-201 and I-123 BMIPP in the apex on the initial images, with complete redistribution on the images 3 h later , suggesting myocardial damage, but not infarction, on the apex in the left ventricle. Of note, the tracer uptake was milder in Tl-201 than in I-123 BMIPP.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

CT: computed tomography; LMCA: left main coronary artery. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】The current patient was diagnosed with heart failure at the age of 40 years. Dilated cardiomyopathy was initially suspected as the etiology, but congenital LMCA atresia was later confirmed. This case is notable because the patient was diagnosed in adulthood, there was a lack of chest pain suggestive of myocardial ischemia and scintigraphy findings were abnormal.\n\n【15】Occlusion of the LMCA can be congenital or acquired. Considering the incidence in the general population and his lipid profile, atherosclerosis was initially considered the most likely cause for the LMCA occlusion despite the absence of chest pain. However, no stump of the LMCA ostium in the sinuses of Valsalva was detected on multiple modalities, including echocardiography, CT angiography and invasive angiography. Furthermore, no atherosclerotic lesion was observed in the coronary arteries except for the LMCA. A diagnosis of congenital LMCA atresia was made based on findings obtained during coronary artery bypass grafting.\n\n【16】The incidence of coronary artery anomalies is estimated to be less than 1% in the general population, although it varies depending on the definition such as including separate ostia of the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries without the LMCA, myocardial bridge, a high take-off of the coronary ostium and a hypoplastic right or circumflex coronary artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]</u>. Although the exact incidence of LMCA atresia remains unclear, this condition is considered a markedly rare coronary anomaly that differs from a single coronary artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. LMCA atresia has retrograde blood flow via collateral circulation from the right coronary artery, whereas the blood flow is antegrade in patients with a single coronary artery. In a series of more than one hundred thousand coronary angiograms, coronary anomalies were observed in 1.33%, including 0.04% in a single coronary artery, but no case of LMCA atresia was found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Bland-White-Garland syndrome or ALCAPA syndrome (i.e. anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery) should be included in the differential diagnosis for LMCA atresia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. In the current case, no evidence suggesting the presence of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery was obtained on echocardiography focused on the pulmonary artery or cardiac CT. However, the right coronary artery may provide extensive collateral flow to the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries, leading to the disappearance of the LMCA originating from the pulmonary artery if patients survive to adulthood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. This possibility was excluded in this case based on the findings during coronary artery bypass grafting.\n\n【18】LMCA atresia is considered to be associated with a poor prognosis because the blood flow to the left coronary arteries is insufficient for the left ventricle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The majority of patients with LMCA atresia are symptomatic, and sudden cardiac death occurred in 10% of pediatric patients and 7% of adult patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The current patient developed heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, which was managed by medication. Based on the myocardial scintigraphy findings, recovered left ventricular ejection fraction and lack of chest pain, myocardial ischemia was considered minimal with optimal medical treatment. This may be explained by rich collateral flow from the right coronary artery to the left coronary arteries on angiography. Furthermore, this may explain why the current patient survived without symptoms until the age of 40 years. Similarly, there are reports of adults diagnosed with LMCA in their 40s or later 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】In this case, the uptake of the I-123 BMIPP tracer was greater in the initial images than that of Tl-201. This phenomenon is called paradoxical mismatch and considered to result from an artifact, especially when observed in the inferior wall due to attenuation and infra diaphragmatic scatter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. This is also observed in the non-hypertrophied regions of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Both conditions are less likely to explain the paradoxical mismatch between I-123 BMIPP and Tl-201 observed in the current case. Of note, the myocardial damage assessed by dual scintigraphy using Tl-201 and I-123 BMIPP was less severe in the current patient than in patients with Bland-White-Garland syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 17 \\]</u>, although the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Further studies are required to evaluate the utility of dual scintigraphy for differentiation.\n\n【20】In conclusion, this case demonstrated the importance of considering LMCA atresia even in the absence of chest symptoms suggesting angina in patients with heart failure.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank Drs Hiroki Sugihara and Satsuki Fukushima for their comments on scintigraphy interpretation and surgical findings, respectively.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable because the manuscript has been sufficiently de-identified to protect the patient.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MH, KH, MY and TK contributed to data analysis and study design; MH and TK wrote the paper; KH and MY reviewed the paper; all authors gave the final approval.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Data Availability</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:46:52", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:17:00", "cost": 1807.477}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:16:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:46:51"}

Intramural strictures are an uncommon cause of small bowel obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Here we are presenting an unusual case of sequential, stenotic stricture leading to SBO of a patient who had prior history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) abuse.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】This patient had presented to the emergency department (ED) for four times since February, 2014 with acute onset abdominal pain and distension. On each occasion, computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with intravenous and oral contrast was remarkable for SBO without any obvious cause. The patient had no history of prior abdominal surgery. She had history of NSAID-codeine abuse and hospitalisation in 2010. Brief hospitalization with narcotic analgesia and nasogastric bowel decompression was effective in resolving obstructive symptoms. The patient resumed her usual activities and diet without limitation. She had a laparoscopy for bowel obstruction before but no mechanical cause was identified. Gastric ulcer and duodenal stricture was found on endoscopy in 2013.\n\n【4】Outpatient capsule endoscopy indicated small bowel webs. She presented to the ED of Sutherland Hospital with abdominal pain, vomiting and obstipation. CT scan demonstrated SBO with a transition point in the right iliac fossa. She was monitored over 24 h of presentation, but no clinical improvement. Then she was taken to undergo a laparoscopy. Small bowel walked from ileocecal junction (ICJ) proximally until transition point identified. Small bowel was all entirely viable and pink. Transition point was marked with suture and delivered extracorporeally via entension of umbilical wound caudally. Stricture was palpable from extraluminal surface . Longitudinal antimesenteric enterotomy was made centred on transition point. Fibrotic stricture in form of web was found. Enterotomy was closed in transverse manner to fashion a stricturoplasty 3-0 monocryl single layered interrupted.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Small bowel web causing bowel obstruction. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【7】Postoperatively she recovered well and was discharged once her bowels were moving.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】SBOs are most commonly caused by adhesions, hernias, neoplasms, or inflammatory strictures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> with most caused by extraluminal adhesions due to postoperative inflammatory changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Though our patient had previous operation for SBO, she had no evidence of adhesion in her previous operations. Her primary cause of SBO was secondary to intraluminal strictures. Inflammatory bowel disease like Crohn’s disease may also cause intestinal stricture. In Crohn’s, obstruction may occur either due to acute inflammation or for chronic inflammation. Our patient had previous scope with no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease. Usually inflammatory bowel disease strictures are longitudinal but our patient’s strictures were distinct, concentric jejunal bands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Malignancy could be another cause of inflammatory strictures. Adenocarcinoma is the most common primary malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, but our patient had no history of malignancy and the post operative histopathology revealed no evidence of malignancy.\n\n【11】Chronic NSAIDs usage can also cause intraluminal pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. NSAIDs are one of the most commonly used medications worldwide. Although NSAIDs have great benefit, significant morbidity from chronic use of NSAIDs can affect upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract. Most physicians are aware of NSAID complications in the UGI tract including pill-induced esophagitis and gastroduodenal ulceration and hemorrhage, but only recently has the medical community become aware of the significant potential for NSAID injury of the small intestine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Small bowel enteropathy caused by NSAIDs has been hypothesized to occur through disruption of the mucosal and cellular integrity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. NSAIDs act as lipid-soluble weak acids that interfere with enterocyte phospholipid membranes, uncoupling of mitochondrial phosphorylation, ultimately loss of mucosal barrier and cyclooxygenase-mediated compromise of villous blood flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Diaphragm strictures are rare but pathognomonic of NSAID use. There are often multiple, 2 - 3 mm thick septa, usually in the small intestine, which can reduce the size of the intestinal lumen to a pinhole causing bowel obstruction.\n\n【13】Conclusions\n\n【14】In this case report we found sequential intraluminal stricture leading to SBO. The lack of clearly defined cause of bowel obstruction during her previous presentations with SBO made this an interesting case.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:38:54", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:43:30", "cost": 275.555}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:43:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:38:53"}

Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) revealed in the middle pole of the right kidney a mass of 50 × 45 mm. Enhanced CT (dynamic study) with contrast material revealed a mass with necrotic areas, contoured lobules, displaying heterogeneous retention of contrast material. No pathological masses were seen in the other organs in the abdominal CT and X-ray images.\n\n【4】The patient with radiological and clinical RCC diagnosis underwent right flank radical nephrectomy. Tumor was of 50 × 45 mm size and tattletale gray. No adrenal tissue was seen in the specimen. Histopathological analysis made using hematoxylin and eosin stain showed nests of epithelial cells with clear cytoplasm and a distinct cell membrane, separated by a delicate branching network of vascular tissue and thus verified clear cell RCC. The pathology report of the nephrectomy specimen showed a Fuhrman grade 2 stage T1 (T1bN0M0) RCC. The patient did not undergo chemotherapy or immunotherapy during the post-operative period. During the 4 years following the surgical intervention, there were not any pathological findings in the abdominal and thorax CT images. Yet, at the fifth year, a 30 × 15 mm mass was seen in the left adrenal gland . Laboratory analyses, including hormonal examinations, revealed data within normal limits. Likewise, chest CT and bone scintigraphy revealed no abnormal findings. Upon this, the patient underwent left laparoscopic adrenalectomy. The macroscopic tumor size was 30 × 15 mm and histopathology analysis enabled metastatic clear cell RCC . Since the second post-operative period was also uneventful, the patient was discharged on the fourth post-operative day. As her contralateral adrenal mass was a result of systemic metastasis, she was placed on tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment.\n\n|  Figure 1. CT images.

On August 18, 2020, obstructive jaundice due to an increase in the liver hilum tumor was observed. No obstruction of the lower common bile duct was observed. He underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and an endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) tube was placed. This led to an improvement in jaundice and hepatobiliary enzyme levels. A thoracoabdominal contrast-enhanced CT performed on September 3, 2020, for the purpose of determining the effects showed SD and a reduction in ascitic fluid. A decrease in tumor markers was observed. We decided to continue treatment with FOLFIRINOX and continued it until the fifth cycle. He was subsequently admitted to the hospital on November 20, 2020, with grade 3 anemia. Abdominal CT showed exacerbation of peritoneal dissemination and increased ascites. We continued treatment with blood transfusions and ascites punctures, but the patient died on December 9, 2020.\n\n【12】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【13】On the same day, we performed a pathological autopsy. The pathological result was a diagnosis of pancreatic head cancer 通用删除1(英):<u>(CK7+/CK20+/CA19-9+, Fig. 3 )</u>. Pancreatic head cancer could not be found on EUS.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3. Neoplastic cells, hematoxylin-eosin stain, immunohistochemical stains × 100.

Pathological anatomy is important to confirm the validity of treatment. We discuss each of these separately below.\n\n【17】FOLFIRINOX is effective against cancers of unknown primary presumed to be pancreatic cancer\n\n【18】Cancers of unknown primary make up 3-5% of malignant tumors, and no improvement in overall survival has been observed over the last 10 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. If the patient is judged to have a poor prognosis based on the location of the lesion and clinical/pathological characteristics, chemotherapy is the main treatment. Among the cancers of unknown primary in the poor prognosis group, several studies have reported on adenocarcinoma treated with a taxane- or platinum-based regimen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Lee et al performed an analysis that combined a systematic review and meta-analysis. Adjusted prognostic factors showed no significant difference in survival benefit between platinum-based and non-platinum-based regimens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. A systematic review by Amela et al concluded that there is no specific regimen that can be recommended for these cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Currently, chemotherapy for patients with disseminated metastasis is limited to patients with good performance status (PS). The regimens in their study were often taxane- or platinum-based, but no specific regimen was recommended.\n\n【19】In the present case, EUS-FNA was used to collect tissue from the tail of the pancreas, and immunostaining revealed CK7+/CK20+/CA19-9+, and a blood test showed abnormal CA19-9, SPan-1, and DU-PAN-2. Since the values were high, we decided to start treatment for a suspected pancreatic cancer of unknown primary cancer. FOLFIRINOX was selected as the regimen. A total of five cycles of treatment were performed. Although CT indicated SD, we judged that the disease condition was temporarily suppressed. Anne et al reported a case of cancer of unknown primary suspected to be pancreatic cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This is the second report of FOLFIRINOX for cancer of unknown primary origin with presumptive pancreatic cancer. Currently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) for cancers of unknown primary is being performed, and it has been pointed out that it may improve the prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In the future, further optimization of treatment is desired by accumulating cases.\n\n【20】Pathological anatomy is important to confirm validity of treatment\n\n【21】In some cases, as in this case, the primary lesion cannot be identified even if cancer is diagnosed by pathological examination of the metastatic lesion. Cancers of unknown primary make up 3-5% of all malignancies. The prognosis for cancers of unknown primary is poor and overall survival is 6 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. There is no commonly agreed-upon chemotherapy regiment for such cancers. In order to confirm the validity of treatment to improve future treatment, it is important to examine the primary lesion by pathological autopsy. In this case, the primary lesion could be confirmed in the head of the pancreas by performing pathological autopsy. The primary lesion in this case could not be confirmed by contrast-enhanced CT or PET-CT while the patient was alive. FOLFIRINOX is not a common treatment for cancers of unknown primary. However, in this case, treatment with FOLFIRINOX was considered to be appropriate.\n\n【22】In this case, pancreatic cancer was diagnosed as a cancer of unknown primary, and treatment was performed in the same manner as for pancreatic cancer. Later, pathological autopsy revealed pancreatic cancer. It is not always necessary to choose taxane- or platinum-based chemotherapy, which has been widely reported on, even for cancers of unknown primary. If there is a suspected primary lesion, the physician may choose the treatment most appropriate for cancers of that origin. In the case of cancer of unknown primary, it is important to perform pathological autopsy as much as possible in order to confirm the validity of the treatment performed. This will allow the physician to improve future treatment for cancer patients.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient described in the case report had given informed consent for the case report to be published.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Naonori Inoue: case selection, discussion and drafting manuscript; Genichiro Matsumoto: drafting manuscript and revision; Shiho Sumitomo: drafting manuscript and revision; Atsushi Sirakawa: manuscript revision and final approval; Koichiro Mandai: manuscript revision and final approval; Takuji Kawamura: manuscript revision and final approval; Koji Uno: case selection, planning, manuscript revision and final approval.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Data Availability</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The data supporting the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CA: carbohydrate antigen; EUS-FNA: endoscopic ultrasound/fine needle aspiration; SPan: s-pancreas antigen; DU-PAN-2: pancreatic cancer-associated antigen; CT: computed tomography; PET: positron emission tomography; CK: cytokeratin; MSI: microsatellite instability; ERCP: endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; ERBD: endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage; SD: stable disease; PS: performance status; NGS: next-generation sequencing</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:46:54", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:48:06", "cost": 71.67}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:48:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:46:54"}

She also reported diaphoresis and fever. The visual changes are described as ‘very bright, foggy, and blurred vision in both eyes’. She also mentioned improvement of her vision when she lays flat with resolution of her ‘foggy’ vision. Her past medical history is significant for anemia, diabetes mellitus, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Her family history is significant for psoriasis.\n\n【2】She was receiving a treatment of etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously on a weekly basis over the last two years for psoriatic arthritis. She was eventually admitted to the hospital for further work up of her symptoms. On admission, physical exam showed normal vital signs and was unremarkable except for decreased visual acuity and bilateral carotid bruits.\n\n【3】Her laboratory tests showed ESR 47 mL/hr, CRP 1.06 mg/dL, and negative ANA and ANCA tests. CT scan of the brain without contrast did not show any evidence of neoplasm, ischemic change or hemorrhage. MRI of the brain showed nonspecific white matter changes. The ophthalmologist’s report revealed mild diffuse ischemic edema in the macula. Carotid ultrasound was consistent with high-grade stenosis of the left internal carotid artery (ICA), and probable external carotid occlusion on the right. An angiogram of the aortic arch and upper arteries and cerebral angiogram were done and showed diffuse long segment near-occlusive stenosis involving the common carotid arteries bilaterally , left and proximal right subclavian arteries  and limited flow to the left anterior cerebellar circulation suggestive of Takayasu arteritis.

Clinically the patient has had improvement of her neurological symptoms but continues to have some foggy vision. She was referred again to interventional radiology for further angioplasties in order to improve her vision. She continued to be on etanercept for psoriatic arthritis but there was a discussion about discontinuing the drug as it was not clear if it had a relation in triggering the Takayasu arteritis in this case.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a chronic disease characterized by inflammation of large vessels, primarily the aorta and its primary branches. Individuals of any race, gender, or age may be affected by TA, but it is most common in young Asian females. Glucocorticoids are the standard treatment in patients with Takayasu arteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

Despite such data, we report what we believe to be the first case in literature to show that Takayasu arteritis can, indeed, develop in a patient who is actively receiving etanercept. An important question remains to be answered: could the etanercept in this case have played a role in triggering Takayasu arteritis in the patient? The answer for such a link, needs further case reports to be answered clearly. Such paradoxical relation has been reported in literature.

Due to the lethal nature of the consequences associated with AAA, the awareness of the most unique presentations of this deadly diagnosis is critical to save a valuable human life.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 60-year-old paraplegic African American male presented with a 4-week history of bilateral lower extremity and scrotal edema. His review of system was positive for shortness of breath accompanied by orthopnea. Past medical and surgical history consisted of a back surgery 30 years ago, which had left him paraplegic with limited motor strength and sensation in his lower extremities. Social history was positive for a 42-pack-year smoking history, but he denied alcohol or illegal drugs. On exam, he was afebrile, tachycardic at 105 beats per minute with a blood pressure 140/88 mm Hg and 97% oxygen saturation on room air. Auscultation of lung revealed bibasilar crackles and cardiac exam showed normal heart sounds with absence of murmurs. Third heart sound was not appreciated. Jugular venous distention was absent. Abdominal exam revealed an obese and protuberant abdomen. No masses were palpable and no bruits were auscultated. Exam revealed 4+ pitting edema extending up to the thighs . Neurologic exam showed 1/5 power in bilateral lower extremities. Labs showed normal complete blood counts, renal function, and electrolytes. Chest X-ray revealed mildly prominent pulmonary vasculature. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. Duplex ultrasound of the lower extremity venous system was negative for deep venous thrombosis. On the basis of this presentation, he was diagnosed with heart failure clinically and an echocardiogram was planned for him the next day. He was started on low dose furosemide for diuresis and low dose lisinopril for afterload reduction.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Image showing pitting edema at presentation. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【5】On day 2, patient underwent an echocardiogram which showed normal left ventricular and right ventricular function with no valvular abnormalities. The findings of the echocardiogram were personally reviewed by the medical team with the cardiologist. After a multi-specialty discussion between the medical and the cardiovascular team, the thought of an intra-abdominal pathology was entertained. Though an abdominal CT scan confirmed the suspicion of an intra-abdominal pathology, the results exceeded expectations. CT showed a large AAA (8.77 cm diameter) , extending to involve bilateral common iliac arteries. The right common iliac artery was dilated to 6.16 cm and the left common iliac artery to 7.27 cm. The inferior vena cava was compressed inferiorly by the iliac aneurysms , giving rise to the bilateral lower extremity edema.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. CT abdomen with contrast (axial view). (a) Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm in contact with inferior vena cava (just superior to the nearly complete compression). (b) Common iliac artery aneurysm with venous compression posteriorly. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【7】The patient underwent an open surgical repair with aortoiliac bypass and tolerated the surgery well. Following the surgical repair, the patient had rapid resolution of lower extremity and scrotal edema. The patient was ultimately discharged to rehabilitation.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Ruptured AAAs are a common and potentially preventable cause of death in the United States. The high mortality stems from the asymptomatic nature of presentation of most AAAs. In 2008, only 5-20% of surgically corrected AAAs were symptomatic at first presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Although most cases of AAA are diagnosed as incidental findings, awareness of the atypical ways of presentation is important due to the poor prognosis associated with this diagnosis. A case by Sajjad et al found a large AAA that displaced the inferior vena cava with resulting thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Takaseya et al described an aortocaval fistula presenting with unilateral lower extremity swelling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Our patient was stable, in no pain and was not old enough to be screened for AAA. Also, the fact that the initial presentation simulated a classic presentation of new onset heart failure deterred us from the diagnosis at the time of initial presentation.\n\n【10】The US Preventative Task Force recommends screening for all men greater than the age of 65 that have smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime or have a family history of AAA. The duration of smoking has been shown as an independent risk factor for an increased risk of AAA with a reduction of risk noted with smoking cessation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Some studies suggest men as young as age 50 would benefit from screening ultrasound for AAA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Recent research suggests that even with a thorough physical exam, the accuracy of abdominal palpation to detect AAA is only 68% sensitive and 75% specific. Furthermore, in patients with an abdominal girth greater than 100 cm (40 inch waistline), this specificity drops to 53% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Our patient had not been screened for AAA largely due to his age, although he did have multiple risk factors including obesity and an ongoing tobacco use. Our case also brings to question whether there is a space for more autonomy for the physician to screen AAA solely due to the poor prognosis it carries if the diagnosis is not made in a timely manner 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】In conclusion, lower extremity edema developing over a short to intermediate time period with normal cardiac function can be a late presentation of AAA. Diagnosing AAA is challenging and often requires a critical diagnostic decision that can be missed with dire consequences.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:42:58", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:10:11", "cost": 1632.402}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:10:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:42:49"}

Furthermore, myocardial function may be impacted by alterations in preload, afterload, and myocardial contractility related to the surgical procedure, anesthetic agents, and changes in intravascular volume. We present two pediatric patients with a known diagnosis of HCM who presented for non-cardiac, minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedures. The perioperative implications of HCM are reviewed with particular emphasis placed on the potential cardiovascular alterations induced by the MIS procedure with increases in intra-thoracic or intra-abdominal pressure (IAP).\n\n【3】Case Reports\n\n【4】IRB approval at Nationwide Children’s Hospital is not required for case reports involving two or fewer patients.\n\n【5】Case 1\n\n【6】A 10-year-old, 39.6 kg boy with severe HCM and an automated implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) in situ presented with noisy breathing and dyspnea on exertion (NYHA class III) for several weeks. There were no complaints of coughing, wheezing or increased work of breathing. His family history was suggestive of HCM in his maternal aunt and grandfather. His medication regimen included atenolol 25 mg by mouth twice daily, albuterol inhaler as needed, and montelukast chewable tablet. On physical examination, his vitals were stable with a grade III systolic ejection murmur heard at the left lower sternal border which increased on standing with a Valsalva maneuver. Laboratory evaluation prior to the surgery showed hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL, hematocrit 35.8%, and a platelet count of 175,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Coagulation studies, serum electrolytes and blood glucose levels were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria with a normal sinus rhythm. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed asymmetrical septal hypertrophy with a gradient of 25 mm Hg with hyperdynamic right and left ventricular function, a dilated left atrium, thickened mitral valve, moderate mitral regurgitation and dynamic LVOT obstruction. Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest showed bulky lymphadenopathy in the upper right mediastinum deviating the trachea to the left in association with a right upper lobe nodular density measuring 3.2 × 3.4 cm. There were ground glass opacities of the lung fields and nodules concerning for malignancy or infection. He was scheduled for elective video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) biopsy under general anesthesia. The patient was held nil per os for 8 h except for his usual medications, the AICD was inactivated for the surgical procedure, and a peripheral intravenous infusion was started to provide maintenance intravenous fluids. Premedication included intravenous midazolam (2 mg). The patient was transported to the operating room and routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ (ASA) monitors were placed. Anesthesia was induced with etomidate (0.3 mg/kg), fentanyl (5 µg/kg), and lidocaine (1 mg/kg). Neuromuscular blockade was provided by rocuroniuim (1 mg/kg). Under direct laryngoscopy, a 28-French, left-sided double lumen tube (DLT) was placed and position was confirmed by use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy. A second peripheral intravenous cannula and a left radial arterial cannula were placed. The patient was positioned with his right side up and one-lung ventilation (OLV) was initiated to maintain normocarbia. Anesthesia was maintained with a dexmedetomidine infusion at 0.2 - 0.4 µg/kg/h without a loading dose and inhaled sevoflurane (0.5-2%) in air and oxygen to maintain the oxygen saturation at 94-96%. During the VATS procedure, effective lung isolation with OLV was noted. Wedge biopsy of the RUL nodule and lymph node were obtained and sent for frozen pathological examination to rule out malignancy. A necrotizing granuloma was noted, suggestive of histoplasmosis. The hemodynamic parameters remained stable throughout the procedure with a heart rate ranging from 60 to 80 beats/min and a systolic blood pressure (BP) from 90 to 120 mm Hg. Hypotension (systolic BP less than 80 mm Hg) was treated with a fluid bolus and phenylephrine (1 µg/kg). The procedure lasted approximately 2.5 h. Fluid administration included 900 mL of crystalloid and 500 mL of 5% albumin. After the biopsy was obtained, two-lung ventilation was resumed. Arterial blood gas analysis at the completion of the procedure was unremarkable with hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, a hematocrit of 31%, and normal electrolytes and blood glucose values. At the completion of the surgical procedure, neuromuscular block was reversed with standard doses of neostigmine and glycopyrrolate and the patient’s trachea was extubated. The patient was admitted to the cardiothoracic surgical intensive care (CTICU) for overnight monitoring. Postoperative pain was managed with intravenous acetaminophen (15 mg/kg) every 6 h and patient-controlled analgesia with hydromorphone. His postoperative period was unremarkable and he was transferred to the inpatient floor on postoperative day (POD) 2 and discharged home on POD 4.\n\n【7】Case 2\n\n【8】A 14-year-old, 32 kg boy with non-obstructed HCM with a history of incomplete bladder emptying, posterior urethral valves, and hydronephrosis with renal insufficiency presented for robotic-assisted laparoscopic appendicovesicostomy. The patient also had a history of hypertension, previous placement of a urethral stent, and renal insufficiency secondary to obstructive uropathy. There was no family history of cardiomyopathy. His medication regimen included oral lisinopril 5 mg once a day and calcitriol 0.5 µg once daily. On physical examination, his vital signs were stable with a grade IV systolic ejection murmur heard at the left lower sternal border which increased on standing with a Valsalva maneuver. Laboratory evaluation prior to the surgery showed a hemoglobin of 12 g/dL, hematocrit 36.5%, and a platelet count of 292,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Coagulation studies, serum electrolytes, and blood glucose levels were within normal limits. Renal function test showed an elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 2.85 and 27 mg/dL, respectively. ECG and 24-h Holter study revealed a normal sinus rhythm without evidence of arrhythmias. TTE showed asymmetrical septal hypertrophy with normal chamber sizes and normal ventricular function with no LVOT obstruction. Renal ultrasound showed bilateral echogenic kidneys with cortical scarring and moderate hydronephrosis on the left side.\n\n【9】The patient was held nil per os for 8 h except for his usual medications and a peripheral intravenous infusion was started to provide maintenance intravenous fluids. Premedication included intravenous midazolam (1.5 mg). The patient was transported to the operating room and routine ASA monitors were placed. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 3 mg/kg, fentanyl (2 µg/kg), and lidocaine (1 mg/kg). Neuromuscular blockade was provided by cis-atracurium (0.2 mg/kg). Under direct laryngoscopy, the trachea was intubated with a 6.0 mm cuffed endotracheal tube. A second peripheral intravenous cannula and a right radial arterial cannula were placed. Anesthesia was maintained with a dexmedetomidine infusion at 0.2 - 0.4 µg/kg/h without a loading dose, remifentanil infusion 0.2 - 0.3 μg/kg/min and inhaled desflurane (4-5%) in air and oxygen to maintain the oxygen saturation at 94-96%. During the robotic-assisted laparoscopic procedure, the abdomen was insufflated to a maximum IAP of 12 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O. The hemodynamic parameters remained stable throughout the procedure with a heart rate ranging from 80 to 100 beats/min and a mean BP from 60 to 70 mm Hg. Hypotension (systolic BP less than 80 mm Hg) was treated with a fluid bolus (10 mL/kg of 5% albumin) and phenylephrine (1 µg/kg) as needed. The procedure lasted approximately 3 h. Fluid administration included 850 mL of crystalloid and 250 mL of 5% albumin. Arterial blood gas analysis at the completion of the procedure showed a hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, a hematocrit of 27%, lactate 0.5 mM/L and normal electrolytes and blood glucose values. Neuromuscular block was reversed with standard doses of neostigmine and glycopyrrolate and the patient’s trachea was extubated. The patient was admitted to the CTICU for overnight monitoring. Postoperative pain was managed with intravenous acetaminophen (15 mg/kg) every 6 h and patient-controlled analgesia with hydromorphone. His postoperative course was unremarkable and he was transferred to the inpatient floor on POD 2 and discharged home on POD 4.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】HCM is generally diagnosed when the patient or a close relative manifests clinical signs and symptoms such as chest pain, arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. The most common echocardiographic finding is a hyperdynamic LV with diastolic dysfunction and abnormal ventricular compliance. Arrhythmias are common and often intractable in HCM as noted in our first patient who required placement of an AICD. The arrhythmias may be of atrial or ventricular origin, frequently altering ventricular preload and impacting hemodynamic function. Preoperatively, if there are clinical concerns regarding arrhythmias or findings on the preoperative ECG, more thorough investigations including 24-h Holter monitoring or electrophysiological studies may be indicated prior to anesthetic care.\n\n【12】Although there are limited data for the pediatric-aged patient, 40% of adult HCM patients have at least one adverse cardiac event during non-cardiac surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Predictors of adverse perioperative cardiac event (congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia and dysrhythmias) include the magnitude of the surgical procedure and the duration of surgery. The degree of the resting LVOT gradient, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, severity of mitral regurgitation, the presence of left ventricular dysfunction, and septal thickness did not correlate with the incidence of perioperative adverse cardiac events. Given the complex nature of our patients’ co-morbid cardiac disease, close collaboration with our pediatric cardiology colleagues was required. This included not only non-invasive imaging, but also preoperative discussion regarding the optimal perioperative management.\n\n【13】The goals of perioperative care for patients with HCM are to limit the dynamic consequences of HCM with avoidance of tachycardia, maintenance of normal sinus rhythm, normal to slightly decreased myocardial contractility, while maintaining baseline preload and afterload. Control of these hemodynamic factors limits the increase in the outflow tract gradient thereby maintaining cardiac output. While many outpatient pediatric patients are held nil per os for several hours prior to anesthetic care, in patients with significant myocardial involvement, long periods of fasting may not be tolerated and hence intravenous fluids should be considered during nil per os times. Additionally, the presence of intravenous access allows for the rapid administration of resuscitative medications or fluids when such hemodynamic alterations occur during anesthetic induction.\n\n【14】Hemodynamic fluctuations with alterations in contractility, preload and afterload may be particularly common during anesthetic induction, direct laryngoscopy, and endotracheal intubation. In our first patient, we chose etomidate, fentanyl and lidocaine given their hemodynamic stability. Etomidate has been shown in multiple studies to have stable hemodynamic properties in both adult and pediatric patients, even in the presence of significant myocardial involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. Although its adrenal suppressive effects due to inhibition of 11-β hydroxylase have made its use controversial in specific clinical scenarios, adverse perioperative implications of this effect have not been clearly demonstrated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. In our second patient, as his hemodynamic status was judged to be more stable, intravenous propofol and fentanyl were used for anesthetic induction.\n\n【15】For maintenance anesthesia in both patients, we chose a combination of dexmedetomidine and sevoflurane. Of the available inhalational anesthetic agents (sevoflurane, isoflurane and desflurane), sevoflurane has the least effect on systemic vascular resistance while having negative chronotropic effects, both of which may be beneficial in patients with HCM. The dose requirements for sevoflurane were decreased by the concomitant administration of dexmedetomidine which also have negative chronotropic properties and may have anti-arrhythmic properties during the perioperative period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Additionally, we chose dexmedetomidine to supplement maintenance anesthesia in our first patient as it has limited effects on oxygenation during OLV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Although hypotension may be seen with dexmedetomidine, it provides effective sympatholysis thereby effectively controlling heart rate and myocardial contractility. As noted in both of our patients, the incidence of hypotension with dexmedetomidine can be limited by omitting the loading dose. Control of the perioperative hemodynamic parameters (maintenance of a low heart rate and a high-normal systemic vascular resistance) was facilitated by the intermittent use of intraoperative phenylephrine to treat hypotension. An additional concern perioperatively with HCM is the potential for an imbalance of the myocardial oxygen delivery-demand ratio. Histologically, the thickened walls of HCM may result in luminal narrowing of the intramural coronary arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. As such, diastolic BP should be maintained and heart rate should be controlled.\n\n【16】Given the associated co-morbid cardiac disease and the magnitude of the surgical procedure in our two patients, intraoperative monitoring included invasive monitoring of arterial BP to ensure that we could quickly identify and treat hypotension. For more invasive procedures where significant alterations in hemodynamic parameters are expected or if unexplained intraoperative hemodynamic instability occurs, central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring or intraoperative TEE may be warranted. As such, we would recommend the ready availability of a pediatric cardiologist for intraoperative consultation. In addition to TEE and CVP monitoring, mixed-venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) monitoring and periodic evaluation of plasma lactate concentration may be helpful in evaluating end-organ oxygen delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22-25 \\]</u>. Alternatively, near-infrared spectroscopy may be used to monitor cerebral and tissue oxygenation as an indicator of end organ perfusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Intraoperative care in our patients was also impacted by the associated MIS procedure using VATS and laparoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 , 28 \\]</u>. Insufflation into the thoracic or abdomen can have adverse physiologic effects including decreased preload, increases afterload, and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. For minimally invasive thoracic procedures, the effective use of OLV may eliminate the need for insufflation thereby mitigating the hemodynamics effects. For abdominal procedures, the IAP should be kept to less than 8 - 12 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O to limit the potential for adverse hemodynamic effects especially in patients with compromised myocardial function.\n\n【18】Despite its prevalence, there are limited previous reports regarding the perioperative care of patients with HCM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 29-35 \\]</u>. The reported literature has demonstrated success with various intravenous induction agents including midazolam, propofol, barbiturates (thiopentone), and etomidate. Maintenance anesthesia has included opioids (fentanyl, morphine and remifentanil) in combination with halothane, sevoflurane or isoflurane with or without nitrous oxide, and occasional supplementation with dexmedetomidine. In an effort to avoid or limit the need for general anesthesia, regional anesthesia including peripheral and neuraxial blockade has been reported especially in the parturient. These reports demonstrate the basic tenets of caring for such patients including: 1) maintenance of sinus rhythm with control of heart rate; 2) reduction in sympathetic activity to reduce chronotropy and inotropy; 3) maintenance of left ventricular filling pressures (preload); 4) control of variables responsible for myocardial oxygen delivery and demand; 5) maintenance of normal myocardial contractility; and 6) preservation of normal pulmonary vascular resistance.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:11:47", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:12:07", "cost": 19.311}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:11:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:11:38"}

The pathogenesis of verruciform xanthoma remains unclear, though it may arise due to trauma or chronic inflammation. Surgical removal is considered curative in most cases. Other destructive methods such as CO <sub>2 </sub> ablation, cryotherapy, chemical peels, and electrosurgery typically lead to recurrence. We present the case of a farmer with verruciform xanthoma appearing on the lower lip, a rare site of involvement. This area is particularly known for its association with actinic damage. This association may provide clues into the pathogenesis of verruciform xanthoma.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 35-year-old male farmer presented with a 1-month history of an intermittently tender lower lip plaque.

The overlying epidermis has a verruca-like configuration consisting of hyperkeratosis, focal parakeratosis, and acanthotic epidermal invaginations. Exocytosis of neutrophils may also be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The pathogenesis of verruciform xanthoma has not been precisely elucidated and continues to be a topic of debate. Recent reports suggest the condition to be a unique reactive process to trauma or chronic inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This may be supported by the occurrence of verruciform xanthoma in conditions such as discoid lupus erythematosus, lichen planus, lichen sclerosus, psoriasis, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, graft versus host disease (GVHD) and pemphigus vulgaris. However, cases have occurred in the absence of other skin disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.

Ten minutes after arterial blood sampling, a SPECT scan was started.\n\n【5】About 45 min after acetazolamide administration, the patient complained of difficulty breathing and tightness in the chest. His condition did not improve and dyspnea became apparent. He was moved to the emergency rescue unit and treatment by cardiologists and emergency rescue doctors was started. First, oxygen inhalation (10 L/min) was started. The patient’s dyspnea and discomfort did not improve and he gradually became unresponsive to verbal stimuli. Wheezing and rales were heard on pulmonary auscultation. His pulse rate was around 170 beats/min, systolic blood pressure ranged from 200 to 170 mmHg, and percutaneous oxygen saturation was around 97%. On electrocardiography, regular tachycardia, narrow QRS, abnormal Q wave on II, III, and aVf, and poor R wave progression on V1 - 3 were continuously observed. On ultrasonic cardiography, diffuse left ventricular hypokinetic wall motion was observed and left ventricular ejection fraction was around 27%.\n\n【6】Intravenous administration of 20 mg of adenosine triphosphate twice, administration of seven or 8 direct current shocks, intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of digoxin and 20 mg of furosemide, continuous intravenous infusion of human atrial natriuretic peptide with an injection rate of 0.025 µg/kg/min, again application of a direct current shock, two injections of 2mg of isosorbide dinitrate, one injection of 1mg of isosorbide dinitrate, and continuous intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin with an injection rate of 0.3 µg/kg/min were performed one after another. However, his symptoms and signs did not improve quickly.\n\n【7】Over the 3 hour after these emergency treatments, about 700 mL of urinary output was obtained, and dyspnea improved gradually and systolic blood pressure was reduced to around 100 mmHg. His dyspnea disappeared the following day. Although a plain-film chest radiograph taken on the day of onset showed marked cardiomegaly and increased vascular markings of both lungs, these findings improved after admission .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Two cases of adverse reactions involving the circulatory system after acetazolamide challenge have been reported in patients with coronary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>, but symptoms of those cases were not so severe. In one of these cases, Shimotsu et al performed acetazolamide augmented <sup>99m </sup> Tc-hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime brain and通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>201 </sup></u> TlCl myocardial SPECT simultaneously in a patient with severe coronary artery disease and通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>201 </sup></u> TlCl myocardial imaging with dipyridamole was performed 5 days after acetazolamide stress imaging. A defect seen on acetazolamide stress imaging was seen to be located in the same region as that seen on dipyridamole imaging. In their case, blood pressure and heart rate was unchanged and the patient had no chest pain, ischemic ST-T change, or arrhythmia on electrocardiography during the acetazolamide stress test. However, the patient showed significant ST-T changes on electrocardiography after dipyridamole administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. They subsequently performed the same examination in 9 patients, and showed acetazolamide could cause myocardial ischemia in patients with severe coronary artery disease.

However, the authors could not explain this mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. On the other hand, Suzuki et al performed acetazolamide-augmented cerebrovascular SPECT in patients with severe coronary artery disease with continuous intravenous administration of nicorandil, and severe back pain with ST depression on electrocardiography occurred in one case. Although sublingual administration of isosorbide was ineffective, symptoms disappeared 30 min after intravenous administration of morphine although mild ST depression continued for a further 90 min 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Shimotsu et al speculated that a vasodilation mechanism unrelated to acetazolamide’s ability to inhibit carbonic anhydrase is involved in the direct action of acetazolamide on vascular smooth muscle, and that acetazolamide also reduces systolic blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance and increases the cardiac output ratio in patients with cardiovascular diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. They also mentioned that acetazolamide might increase myocardial oxygen consumption by increasing cardiac output, thus inducing myocardial ischemia in patients with severe coronary artery disease with low ischemic thresholds 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In contrast, Suzuki et al conjectured that there is little possibility of coronary spasm because of inefficacious sublingual administration of isosorbide, and also mentioned that it seemed unlikely acetazolamide would raise blood pressure and heart late, increase myocardial oxygen consumption, and worsen angina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Although they considered cardiac output would be increased at the onset of angina, this phenomenon was attributable to sympathicotonia caused by chest pain, not by acetazolamide, because change in the electrocardiography wave continued even after chest pain disappeared. They considered that acetazolamide affected the tonus of the coronary artery, and that the steal phenomenon occurred not only from dilatation of the coronary artery but also potentialization of nicorandil’s pharmacological action 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Our patient, however, had no complaint of chest pain, both heart rate and blood pressure were raised, and double product (i.e. systolic blood pressure multiplied by heart rate) of > 30,000 was continued. Although myocardial ischemia should have occurred in the present case because of elevation of CPK and CPK-MB, the mechanism causing it should be different from that in Shimotsu and Suzuki’s cases. It should be considered whether elevation of cardiac output induced myocardial ischemia or whether onset of myocardial ischemia induced acute heart failure. It would seem that there is little possibility that acetazolamide causes myocardial ischemia directly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\- 13 \\]</u>. Although the details were unclear, our patient also had systemic arteriosclerosis including severe coronary artery disease. One possible explanation in this case is that acetazolamide might have increased myocardial oxygen consumption by increasing cardiac output, but peripheral vascular resistance might not have been much reduced. This might have caused increased cardiac work, leading to cardiac ischemia because of severe coronary arteriosclerosis with a low ischemic threshold as well as increased myocardial oxygen consumption, followed by acute heart failure with high systolic blood pressure and tachycardia. In addition, renal dysfunction might have aggravated the symptoms as a synergistic effect. There is every possibility that our patient’s acute heart failure and myocardial ischemia were affected by acetazolamide administration since he had not only coronary disease but also severe systemic arteriosclerosis.\n\n【16】As a matter of course, preparations should be made for a possible emergency during and after cerebrovascular SPECT with acetazolamide challenge, and patients should be closely observed after the examination. Although the frequency of acute heart failure associated with acetazolamide challenge may be low, the possibility of severe adverse reactions in patients with severe arteriosclerotic disease should be routinely considered.\n\n【17】Funding Statement\n\n【18】Any company did not support this work.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Funding Statement\n\n【18】Any company did not support this work.", "content": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Regional cerebrovascular reactivity to acetazolamide (DIAMOX <sup>® </sup> , LEDERLE PHARMACEUTICAL DIVISION, NY, USA, Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho CO.

We performed an MRA of the chest for further delineation of the aortic wall and mobility of the aortic thrombus since this area of the ascending aorta and aortic arch is difficult to visualize on transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram. The MRA indicated that the base of the thrombus was wide and immobile; however, there were a few, very thin projectile strands that were quite mobile. A piece of these thin projections most likely embolized through the left main coronary artery during diastole leading to the myocardial infarction. The overall description and improved clinical scenario allow us to consider conservative management and successful resolution of the thrombus. Since the etiology was unclear, we plan on continuing anticoagulation therapy with imaging of the aorta every 6 months for 1 year.\n\n【11】In brief, this is an interesting presentation of a middle-aged woman with ascending and aortic arch thrombi successfully treated conservatively with anticoagulation.

The MRA indicated that the base of the thrombus was wide and immobile; however, there were a few, very thin projectile strands that were quite mobile. A piece of these thin projections most likely embolized through the left main coronary artery during diastole leading to the myocardial infarction. The overall description and improved clinical scenario allow us to consider conservative management and successful resolution of the thrombus. Since the etiology was unclear, we plan on continuing anticoagulation therapy with imaging of the aorta every 6 months for 1 year.\n\n【11】In brief, this is an interesting presentation of a middle-aged woman with ascending and aortic arch thrombi successfully treated conservatively with anticoagulation. Thrombi in such locations are rare, but should be considered as a possible source of systemic embolism. Further investigation is needed to understand risk factors and evaluate the various treatment modalities for this rare condition.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No disclosures.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "index": -1, "show": true, "start": -1, "end": 287, "comment": "5", "isEdit": false, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"]}], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:41:03", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:46:49", "cost": 345.915}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:46:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:40:54"}

It can be congenital or acquired. In obstetrics and gynecology, an AVM may be acquired either following treatment of miscarriage, termination of pregnancy, or following a cesarean section. When ruptured, AVM can lead to potentially life-threatening intractable hemorrhage. It is one of the extremely rare causes of PPH and presents great difficulty in recognition and initiation of correct treatment.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Our patient was a 40-year-old para 2 with a history of lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) in her first pregnancy. She had no other surgical or medical issues of note. Her current pregnancy had been uneventful with a planned elective repeat LSCS at 39 weeks. She presented in spontaneous labor prior to her scheduled surgery and opted for a trial of vaginal birth after cesarean section (VBAC). However, there was failure to progress beyond 6 cm dilatation and she underwent an emergency LSCS. The procedure was complicated due to intra-abdominal adhesions resulting in injury to urinary bladder which was repaired in layers. The blood loss during the procedure was average. The patient made good recovery and was discharged home on third day post-procedure with the indwelling urinary catheter in situ . The catheter was removed 1 week post-procedure and patient showed complete recovery. However, she presented to the emergency department on day 25 postnatal with significant secondary PPH associated with an episode of hypovolemic shock. Following resuscitation, she underwent an examination under anesthesia (EUA). Suction evacuation of the uterus was done and blood clots along with a small amount of retained products of conception (RPOC) were obtained. The blood loss was estimated as 2.5 L and she received 4 units packed red cells, 2 units fresh frozen plasma, and 1 unit platelets. She was also given uterotonics such as carbetocin, prostaglandin analogues such as carboprost and misoprostol along with intravenous (IV) tranexamic acid for control of bleeding. She received broad spectrum IV antibiotics due to the possibility of endometritis. Her bleeding settled and following a period of observation she was discharged on third post-operative day. A week following her discharge, she re-presented to the emergency department of our hospital with another episode of significant bleeding. On account of ongoing bleeding, she underwent another EUA and evacuation of uterus with a possibility of proceeding to a laparotomy and a hysterectomy as a last resort. The interventional radiologist was alerted as the possibility of uterine artery embolization (UAE) was also under consideration. There was minimal curettings obtained during the evacuation of uterus which was carried out under ultrasound guidance. A pelvic angiogram done showed profuse contrast extravasation and acute bleeding from the left uterine artery . A super-selective embolization of left uterine artery was performed. Post-embolization angiogram showed satisfactory results with no further contrast extravasation . Thereafter the patient recovered well and was discharged well after a week. Currently, 6 months post-embolization, she is under follow-up for irregular periods.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

According to the World Health Organization, it affects approximately 2% of all women in relation to childbirth and is the leading cause of maternal mortality in most low-income countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. According to the MBRRACE (UK) report of December 2014, from the year 2009 to 2012, obstetric hemorrhage in the UK accounts for approximately 10% of all direct maternal deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It has an overall mortality rate of 0.49 per 100,000 maternities (CI 0.29 - 0.78) and a case fatality rate for massive hemorrhage of approximately 1 per 1,200 women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】PPH is commonly defined as a blood loss of 500 mL or more within 24 h after birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Severe PPH is defined as a blood loss of 1,000 mL or more within the same time period after birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It may also be classified as primary and secondary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. While primary PPH occurs within the period from delivery up to 24 h post-delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, secondary PPH occurs from the period between 24 h and 12 weeks postnatal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The most common causes include uterine atony and genital tract trauma while the less common causes include uterine rupture, retained placental tissue, infection or maternal coagulopathy disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Ruptured uterine AVM or pseudoaneurysm as a cause of intractable secondary PPH is an extremely rare phenomenon but should be considered and looked for in intractable PPH where other common causes have been excluded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Uterine AVM can be congenital or acquired, when it is also known as a “pseudoaneurysm” of the uterine artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. An acquired uterine AVM is characterized as a communication between the branches of the uterine artery and the myometrial venous plexus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. It rarely affects nulliparous women without a history of uterine instrumentation or surgery such as evacuation of uterus, cesarean section, dilatation and curettage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Other than iatrogenic causes, pathologic processes such as infection, trophoblastic disease, and malignancies involving the uterus have also been found to be associated with acquired uterine AVM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In obstetric, there is another form of acquired AVM called pseudoaneurysm of the uterine arteries, which is more likely to be the cause in case of intractable secondary PPH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is said that trauma to the uterine arteries during LSCS is commonly found to be associated with this type of vascular abnormality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The hypothesis is that it may be due to lateral extension of the lower uterine segment incision and failure to secure the apex during repair, thus leading to formation of a pseudoaneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Uterine AVM has traditionally been diagnosed during laparotomy or during pathological examination of the uterus after a hysterectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The method of diagnosing uterine AVMs has traditionally been proved to be difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Typical diagnostic procedures such as pelvic examination, hysteroscopy and gray-scale ultrasonography have not been found to be adequately effective in diagnosing this condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In recent years, Doppler ultrasound studies and focused magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been found to be useful in diagnosing uterine AVM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. It provides a non-invasive method of diagnosis of uterine AVMs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. MRI is mostly helpful where there is doubt in diagnosis on ultrasonography and there is an aversion to invasive angiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The current gold standard in diagnosing uterine AVM is by pelvic angiography which maps out the pelvic vascular anatomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It also helps to identify the bleeder and its leading “feeder” vessels whereby selective embolization can be done at the same setting as a conservative treatment option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Historically, the main treatment for uterine AVMs has been hysterectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, embolization is the preferred treatment with a high success rate of > 90% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, most commonly the uterine artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It also serves as an alternative option for patients seeking to preserve fertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> and major operative morbidity associated with a hysterectomy. However, it can be associated with complications including fever, neurological complications, puncture site hematomas, abscess, ischemic complications like vesicovaginal fistulas, endometrial atrophy, etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The effect of embolization on future fertility is still unknown and is a subject of research 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】In the case of our lady she had history of prior LSCS with last procedure performed approximately 4 weeks prior to her presentation with first of the recurring episodes of PPH. She had also undergone evacuation of uterus twice during the management of her PPH. We hypothesized that her uterine surgeries may have predisposed her to the formation of her pseudoaneurysm in her left uterine artery, a pathology which accounted for her presentation.\n\n【13】A review of literature shows that there are no known prevention measures for acquired AVM except for high clinical suspicion when a patient presents with intractable PPH with a background of recent surgical intervention, i.e. cesarean section 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. There must also be diligent care during surgical repair, i.e. cesarean section to reduce the risk of developing iatrogenic vascular abnormalities that may cause such rare intractable hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Uterine AVM as a cause of PPH unresponsive to conventional treatment methods is rare but can be potentially life-threatening. In the case of an intractable PPH, there should be high index of clinical suspicion especially in the presence of risk factors such as prior surgical intervention. Multi-disciplinary care involving interventional radiology team with use of selective UAE as treatment method should be considered should suspicion of uterine AVM arise, due to its high success rate and minimally invasive nature.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:41:30", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:41:40", "cost": 10.157}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:41:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:41:20"}

To achieve euphoria, stay awoke and improve alertness, higher doses may be taken as misuse of the drug. The abuse of MPH among teenagers has become more common and increased death rates have been reported. Since its availability, MPH overdoses have been seen more commonly similar to overdoses with other amphetamine-like drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Widespread use of MPH raised serious concerns regarding abuse, toxic and possible life-threatening effects in pediatric patients. In 2004, 8,336 cases of MPH intoxication have been reported in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Clinical manifestations of MPH intoxication especially include central nervous system and cardiovascular system findings. Although the clinical manifestations include symphathomimetic findings like irritability, agitation, palpitation, hyperreflexia, seizures, hypertension, hyperventilation and hyperthermia, it may also cause stroke, tics, toxic psychosis, Tourette’s syndrome and neuromuscular findings such as dyskinesia and paresthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, hyperventilation due to MPH overdose is rare and carpopedal spasm associated with overdose of MPH has not been reported to date.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 10-year-old girl applied to our emergency department with agitation, crying and wandering complaints. She had received a high dose of MPH (11 MPH 10-mg tablets) two times higher than the daily maximum allowed dose 2 h before the admission (3.14 mg/kg). Her blood pressure was 126/83 mmHg, pulse rate was 114/min, respiration rate was 22/min and temperature was 37.1 °C. Her physical examination revealed tachypnea, palpitation, numbness in the hands and feet and carpopedal spasm. The initial blood tests revealed a creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 17 mg/dL, albumin 4.2 g/dL, sodium 137 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 96 mmol/L, ionized calcium 1.08 mmol/L (N: 1.12-1.32), total calcium 9.1 mg/dl (N: 8.1-10.4), magnesium 2.1 mg/dL, glucose 93 mg/dL, phosphate 5.1 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase14 IU/L and aspartate aminotransferase 25 IU/L. Blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.47, pCO <sub>2 </sub> 26 mmHg, pO <sub>2 </sub> 47 mmHg, HCO <sub>3 </sub> 29 mmol/L and base excess +1.2 mmol/L. Corrected QT time was measured as 0.47 s from simultaneously taken ECG (N: 0.31 - 0.44 s).\n\n【4】The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, gastric lavage was performed and 1 g/kg of activated charcoal through nasogastric tube was administered. The patient was treated with the paper bag ventilation and at the end of the first hour, her numbness and contraction began to resolve. At the fourth hour, the heart rate and blood pressure were in normal levels. The blood gas analysis showed pH 7.4, pCO <sub>2 </sub> 38 mmHg, pO <sub>2 </sub> 52 mmHg and HCO <sub>3 </sub> 23 mmol/L. Corrected QT time was measured as 0.41 s. The patient’s symptoms, clinical findings, blood gas analysis and ECG findings returned to normal 4 - 6 h after the initiation of treatment. Carpopedal spasm rapidly responded to paper bag ventilation and normalization of arterial carbondioxide levels. The patient was discharged in the second day of hospitalization with normal systemic examination findings and resolved complaints.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】MPH is the primary treatment of ADHD and exerts its efficacy through neurotransmitters including dopamine, noradrenalin, adrenalin and serotonin. Also, it is thought to be exerting its efficacy on hyperactivity through dopaminergic activity in the certain areas of the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. A wide range of indications of the MPH make it the most commonly prescribed psychostimulant. Therefore, accidental or suicidal intoxications related with MPH have been increased dramatically. The present case was diagnosed as ADHD and had used MPH for 4 months.\n\n【7】After oral administration, MPH absorbed rapidly and almost completely from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak plasma concentration is reached in 2 h. Clinical signs begin to appear 4 - 6 h after oral administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The clinical findings in our case have emerged 5 - 6 h after the ingestion of the drug.\n\n【8】Clinical findings related with high doses of MPH resemble the overdose of amphetamine-like drugs. In addition to neurologic (headache, depression, abnormal movements or rigidity, paranoia and hallucinations), cardiovascular (hypertension, tachycardia and chest pain) and gastrointestinal (vomiting and abdominal pain) changes, hyperthermia, dysrhythmias and convulsions can be detected in some cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, there is no association between the severity of clinical symptoms and the dose of MPH intake 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Foley et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> reported that exposures to MPH in children were accidental and most of them were asymptomatic. However, exposures to MPH in adolescent were intentional and half of them were asymptomatic. In some reports 80 mg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> and 270 mg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> MPH were found to be well tolerated. For this reason, determined toxic dose of MPH is unknown. In our patient ingestion of overdose of MPH at 110 mg caused cardiovascular and neuromuscular findings as toxicity.\n\n【9】A reduction in cerebral blood flow in the setting of hyperventilation, hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis may explain the neurologic symptoms associated with hyperventilation including paresthesias. Although there is no evidence that hyperventilation results in changes in total serum calcium levels, respiratory alkalosis may also trigger changes in ionized serum calcium levels with consequent binding of calcium to albumin, and it can result in paresthesias and tetany. Paresthesias and tetany in patients with hyperventilation are mainly secondary to decreased PaCO <sub>2 </sub> in the setting of respiratory alkalosis. Carpopedal spasm rapidly responded to paper bag ventilation and normalization of arterial carbondiokside levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Central nervous system stimulants can lead to hyperventilation. Blood pCO <sub>2 </sub> value decreases as a result of hyperventilation. These patients may present with very different clinical pictures including paresthesia and carpopedal spasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The cause of paresthesia and spasms due to hyperventilation is unknown; however, it may be related with the decrease in ionized calcium due to alkalosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】In conclusion, MPH is commonly prescribed for patients with ADHD and has become easily avaliable drug for children. Side effects of MPH are well known and possible findings in the event of poisoning and drug abuse should be recognized. It should be known that the patients can apply with spasm carpopedal and it can be treated easily with the paper bag ventilation. Respiratory alkalosis may trigger changes in ionized serum calcium levels which should be taken into consideration rather than total calcium level.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:41:43", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:42:22", "cost": 39.451}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:42:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:41:33"}

Moreover, because unilateral INO was observed in four of these five cases, the authors speculated that GP might run in the vicinity of the MLF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Tsuda et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> noted a case of BL with hypalgesia and thermophypoesthesia in the territory of all divisions of the trigeminal nerve caused by a rostral pontine tegmentum infarction, and stated that GP might run in the vicinity of the ventral trigemino-thalamic tract in the rostral pons. In our present patient 1, in addition to leftward BL, right-sided INO and left-sided hypalgesia and thermohypoesthesia in the territory of the maxillary as well as mandibular nerve was caused by infarction in the right rostral pontine tegmentum. This neurologic finding denoted that GP might run in between MLF and the ventral trigemino-thalamic tract in the rostral pons.\n\n【11】NPPE is defined as unilateral INO with exotropia of the contralateral eye 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. NPPE without alternating exotropia is caused by complete involvement of the MLF as well as incomplete damage to the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. On the other hand, comitant skew deviation may be induced by abnormalities in the midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata, cerebellum and thalamus, and is considered as a poorly localizing sign of posterior fossa dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.

It is a rare finding in adults, and the rarest form of intussusception, representing only 10% of all cases of intussusception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Most common causes of gastroduodenal intussusception are gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), gastric carcinoma, gastric lipoma, gastric leiomyoma, and gastric schwannoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\- 6 \\]</u>. Hsieh et al reported in a systemic review of the relevant literature regarding gastroduodenal intussusception and found that GISTs were the most common etiology, accounting for more than half of these cases in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Isolated duodenal intussusception is also very rare since duodenum is fixed in retroperitoneum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It is caused by benign or malignant tumors of the duodenum such as adenomas, hamartomas, or stromal tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, and malrotation abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Meckel’s diverticulum was reported as a cause as well. It is extremely rare for gastroduodenal intussusception to be caused by migration of percutaneous gastrostomy tube. Herein, we present a rare case of adult gastroduodenal intussusception due to migrated percutaneous gastrostomy tube.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 50-year-old woman with a past medical history of traumatic brain injury complicated by quadriplegia, spasticity on baclofen 100 mg orally daily, muscle contractures, dysphagia status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube (Boston scientific Endovive feeding tube 24 Fr) in October 2022, with external marking at the time of insertion of 3.5 cm and external bumper used for external fixation, seizure disorder on levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily, presented to the emergency department in January 2023 from nursing home due to nausea, vomiting and abdominal distention. Physical examination revealed that vital signs: heart rate 128 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure 125/90 mm Hg, respiratory rate 20/min, oxygen saturation 96% on room air, weight 40.9 kg. The patient appeared to be cachectic. Muscle spasticity in upper and lower limbs was noted, and contractures noted on both lower limbs. The abdominal exam revealed distended abdomen with mild leak around PEG. The external bumper of feeding tube was loose and numerical markings of the feeding tube were absent. A short segment of PEG tube was hanging outside the anterior abdominal wall. Otherwise, the patient had a foley catheter in place. Blood tests showed: white blood cell counts 38 (4.5 - 10), hemoglobin 13.1 (reference range of 14 - 18 g/dL), platelets 308 (150 - 440 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 86 fL (80 to 100 fL), sodium 131 (135 - 145 mEq/L), creatinine 1.2 (0.6 - 1.1 mg/dL), normal serum aminotransferases, procalcitonin 5.08 (a concentration of < 0.5 ng/mL represents a low risk of severe sepsis and/or septic shock, a concentration of more than 2 ng/mL represents a high risk of severe sepsis and/or septic shock). Arterial blood gas revealed: PCO <sub>2 </sub> 30 mm Hg, PO <sub>2 </sub> 96 mm Hg, oxygen saturation 98%, and serum lactic acid 4.6 mmol/L (0.7 - 2.1 mmol/L). Radiological data included computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showing dilated duodenum (6 cm), and gastroduodenal intussusception within the duodenum. A swirling of the mesentery was seen, as well suggesting coexistent volvulus in the same location. The stomach was distended and full of fluids . There was dilation of intra and extra hepatic biliary tracts. The feeding tube was pulled back and placed with gravity, around 1,100 mL of bilious fluid was drained, and abdominal distention was improved. Repeat CT scan showed improvement of duodenal intussusception and volvulus. On the following day, the patient underwent upper endoscopy which revealed an intact gastrostomy with a patent G-tube present in the gastric body. Two non-bleeding linear duodenal ulcers with no stigmata of bleeding were seen in the second and third part of duodenum. The largest lesion was 16 mm in largest dimension . There was no endoscopic evidence of stenosis, mass or deformity in the entire stomach and duodenum. An external fixation was applied using Avanos Saf-T-Pexy T-fasteners to prevent recurrence of this complication. The patient was discharged back to nursing home 2 days later.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Mostly it is caused by gastric tumors, resulting in prolapse of the tumor and subsequent invagination of a portion or the full thickness of the gastric wall into the duodenum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. Gastric stromal tumors were reported to be the most common cause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Gastroduodenal intussusception caused by migration of percutaneous feeding tube is even rarer clinical presentation. Most of reported cases were retrograde jejunogastric intussusception causing small bowel obstruction due to PEG tubes, as a result of the tube migrating forward into jejunum and acting as a leading point 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. It is not very well understood the exact underlying mechanism of intussusception, but it was hypothesized that it is caused by a not properly fixed tube which can migrate away from abdominal wall through gastrostomy tube, as a result of normal peristalsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. These further pushes stomach antrum into duodenum, resulting in antegrade intussusception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Our case was an anterograde gastroduodenal intussusception. In literature review, only one case was reported by Alomari et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Our case and previously reported case are both women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Endoscopic insertion of a gastrostomy tube was first introduced in 1980 by Gauderer et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. It has increasingly become the method of choice to obtain long-term gastric access. Approximately 10% of the institutionalized elderly depend on PEG tubes for feeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>, with an annual estimate of 100,000 to 125,000 PEG tubes being placed in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. It is important to be aware of complications related to PEG tube while caring for those patients. Serious complications include tube migration, perforation, bleeding, and infections. To this date only one case was previously reported of gastroduodenal intussusception caused by feeding tube migration.\n\n【10】Clinical presentation of gastroduodenal intussusception is usually nonspecific, and symptoms can be acute or chronic or intermittent intestinal obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Most common presentation includes blood in stool, anemia, low-grade fever, weight loss, or abdominal lumps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. In acute settings it can present as bowel obstruction with nausea and vomiting. Obstructive jaundice and chronic pancreatitis can occur when hepatopancreatic ampulla is involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In this patient presentation was acute onset of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and abdominal distention. Hepatopancreatic ampulla was involved evidenced by dilation of intra and extra hepatic biliary tracts. No jaundice or abnormal liver functions in this patient was probably due to rapid onset and rapid improvement after pulling the feeding tube back.\n\n【11】Most accurate test to diagnose gastroduodenal intussusception is CT abdomen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Classic symptoms seen in CT include “target”, “doughnut”, or “sausage-shaped” signs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. The role of endoscopy is to aid diagnosis in case of intra luminal lesions (polyps, tumors ulcers, adenomas) and to rule out any gastroduodenal cancer. In this case endoscopy was performed after pulling feeding tube back. Two linear nonbleeding ulcers were seen which were believed to be caused by the migrating feeding tube. No polyps, masses or hamartomas were seen in the stomach or duodenum.\n\n【12】Adult gastroduodenal intussusception is an urgent condition and should be treated by surgery without delay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Treatment includes endoscopic resection of any intra luminal lesion that maybe cause it, and laparotomy or laparoscopy. Mucosal resection should be done in lesions confined to mucosal layers and less than 2 cm in size. Surgical resection is recommended in lesions more than 2 cm in size 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. In this case complete resolution was achieved by pulling back the feeding tube. Early diagnosis, pulling and repositioning tube was important in preventing late complications such as bowel ischemia and perforation in this case.\n\n【13】It is important to emphasize the relevance of external fixation to prevent this complication from recurrence. We used Avanos Saf-T-Pexy T-fasteners. It is a T-fastener with absorbable suture designed to secure the position of the stomach against the anterior abdominal wall.\n\n【14】Conclusions\n\n【15】Gastroduodenal intussusception in adults is an extremely rare condition with nonspecific clinical manifestation. Most common reason is GISTs. It is even rarer to be caused by migration of percutaneous feeding tube. Poor external fixation can result in this complication. Most common presentation is nausea and vomiting. CT abdomen is the most accurate test, and upper endoscopy is needed to rule out any intra luminal causes. Treatment of choice is either endoscopic resection or surgical resection depending on the size and depth of extension of lesion into luminal wall. Proper external fixation of percutaneous feeding tube is essential to prevent recurrence.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank our library staff at the Cabell Huntington Hospital for supplying us with articles to complete this manuscript.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This project was not supported by any grant or funding agency.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient described in the case report had given informed consent for the case report to be published.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Each author has individually been involved and participated in drafting the manuscript and revising it critically for important intellectual content and has given final approval of the version to be published.

The popularity for chewing khat is primarily due to the psycho-stimulant effects that the use of khat produces. Until recently, the use of khat has been largely confined to East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and little has been known about khat-induced hepatitis or khat-induced chronic liver disease. Due to immigration, this social habit has been steadily gaining popularity in Western countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of khat-induced hepatotoxicity in the US, and one of only a small number of documented cases involving the formation of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 34-year-old immigrant male from Yemen with a medical history significant for kidney stones, ureteral stones, and jaundice in the past presented to the emergency department with a complaint of yellow discoloration of the eyes, dark urine, and bothersome pruritus. The patient was of a usual state of health until about 3 weeks prior when he first noticed the progressive jaundice. The patient had additional complaints of intermittent right upper quadrant abdominal pain and intermittent fever, although no temperature was taken at home. Further discussion with the patient revealed a similar episode of jaundice 3 years prior where he was initially evaluated in the emergency department, but subsequently left the hospital against medical advice without a clear diagnosis. The previous episode of jaundice was said to have resolved spontaneously without any additional medical intervention.\n\n【4】At initial presentation, the patient denied alcohol and drug abuse, use of over-the-counter medications, or use of any herbal supplements. His physical examination was significant only for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, and mild-to-moderate splenomegaly.\n\n【5】Laboratory investigations for the patient suggested a pattern of acute hepatitis with the following results: total bilirubin 15.8 mg/dL (reference range (RR): 0.2 - 1.0 mg/dL), direct bilirubin 13.01 mg/dL (RR: < 0.2 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase 689 U/L (RR: 15 - 37 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 935 U/L (RR: 12 - 78 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase 209 U/L (RR: 45 - 117 U/L). Results of the complete blood count, serum electrolyte levels, and coagulation studies were normal. Viral serology labs for hepatitis A, B, C, and E were all negative, and human immunodeficiency virus infection was excluded as well. Laboratory workup also did not show any evidence of hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Mitochondrial antibody and anti-nuclear antibody direct testing were negative. However, anti-smooth muscle antibody and IgG antibody counts were shown to have strong positivity, at levels of 53 units (RR: < 19 units) and 2,634 mg/dL (RR: < 1,600 mg/dL), respectively, indicating a high probability of an underlying AIH.\n\n【6】Initial imaging via ultrasonography and computed tomography showed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and possible cirrhotic liver changes. A patent portal vein was visualized and there was no obvious evidence of biliary ductal dilation. A thorough assessment of the biliary tree was made via magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), which confirmed the absence of an obstructive process. A percutaneous core needle liver biopsy was performed on the fourth day of hospital admission. Liver biopsy concluded a chronic hepatitis with grade IV inflammation. Piecemeal and lobular necrosis was visualized. Stage III-IV focal fibrosis and sporadic bridging fibrosis was present. There was evidence of hepatic steatosis with focal ballooning changes. The liver portal tracts were diffusely infiltrated by mixed inflammatory cells including neutrophils, plasma cells, lymphocytes, and eosinophils . Taking the patient’s clinical presentation, negative viral panel, and positive autoimmune markers into account, the processed liver biopsy samples suggested features of AIH with a differential diagnosis of drug-induced hepatitis.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

(D) Regenerative nodularity of the liver biopsy, indicating probable liver cirrhosis. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【8】With supportive management, the patient experienced moderate liver function improvement. At the time of hospital discharge, the patient’s total bilirubin had decreased to 7.1 mg/dL, and the patient’s aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were 430 and 576 U/L, respectively. At this time, the patient’s brother disclosed information pertaining to the patient’s long-term intermittent use of khat for recreational purposes. This information was then confirmed with the patient. The patient was instructed to immediately abstain from the use of khat and was started on 40 mg prednisone daily. At 1-week post-discharge follow-up, the patient admitted overall improvement of health status and labs continued to show liver function improvement.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Khat ( Catha edulis ) is a slow-growing flowering shrub native to portions of East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. When chewed, khat leaves release an amphetamine-like substance which produces a pleasurable euphoric effect. As a popular cultural custom, khat is estimated to be used daily by over 20 million people in Yemen, Somalia, and other surrounding countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This number is steadily increasing due to the introduction of khat chewing to Western countries through extensive immigration. Populations of Yemeni and Somali immigrants living in the UK and the US have contributed to the spread this popular social habit, making khat use a worldwide issue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】The alkaloid compounds primarily responsible for the stimulant properties of khat include cathinone, and to a lesser degree, cathine, and norephedrine. The main alkaloid, cathinone, has been shown to have considerable structural similarity with amphetamine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>, leading to a similar central nervous system response when ingested. It is also relatively unstable, and will spontaneously break down into cathine and norephedrine over a short period of time after the khat leaves are harvested. Therefore, only fresh khat leaves seem to hold the most potency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Cathinone acts on the central nervous system to release large stores of dopamine and other catecholamines. When chewed, khat typically evokes an initial feeling of excitability, increased alertness, and euphoria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>. This stimulation is typically followed by unpleasant feelings of lethargy, somnolence, and sadness. For chronic users and heavy users, severe depression and psychosis may occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\]</u>. As with amphetamine use, khat users are at increased risk for major cardiovascular events. Typical adverse events from khat consumption include anxiety, anorexia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and mydriasis, as well as recurring gastrointestinal episodes of esophagitis, gastritis, ulcers, and constipation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5-7 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】With khat use becoming more prevalent, there has been an increased awareness and growing concern about the potential for khat-induced hepatotoxic injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6-13 \\]</u>. Animal studies published in 2002 have evaluated the toxicological effects of long-term khat ingestion and have shown significant hepatotoxic injury from khat exposure in rabbits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. The hepatotoxic features from these studies revealed marked increases in the plasma concentrations of alkaline phosphatase and liver transaminases, along with steady increases in direct and total bilirubin levels. Additionally, histopathological analysis from these studies revealed mixed inflammatory infiltrate and porto-portal fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Human studies have corroborated this evidence through an increasing number of case studies published from Europe and Australia on khat-induced hepatotoxicity in Yemeni and Somali immigrants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9-13 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】In addition to hepatotoxic effects, khat has now gained recognition as a potential triggering agent in the development of a severe form of AIH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 14 , 15 \\]</u>. AIH develops from a breakdown of the body’s immunological tolerance to antigens found on hepatocytes. This breakdown of tolerance is often compounded by a loss of appropriate immune system regulation, leaving the immune system to mount extensive immune responses against the liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15-17 \\]</u>. Recent studies have suggested that chronic exposure to khat is triggering AIH in individuals via an unknown mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Although no specific cause to the development of AIH in chronic khat users has been elucidated, a number of studies have explored the potential connection of khat inducing AIH in genetically susceptible individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 15 \\]</u>, as well as the potential ability for khat to trigger drug-induced immune responses through auto-antigen mimicry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】In a case study of three Yemeni patients with a social history of chronic daily khat use, all three patients had a positive immunological profile consistent with type one AIH. These patients shared similarities in their clinical presentation and diagnostic workup, and all three had a favorable response to steroid treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. In a second study exploring the potential role of khat in triggering AIH, six patients were identified from the Hepatology database at Sheffield Hospital system in the UK as having acute hepatitis with a background of khat use. These patients were evaluated for the probability of having AIH and a strong argument was made that these patients developed a suspected atypical presentation of AIH through khat-induced hepatotoxic effects and possible genetic susceptibility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This evidence was supported by an earlier case study from the UK that identified seven Somali patients from 1996 to 2006 who presented with acute hepatitis and a background significant for chronic khat use. Two out of the seven patients in this study were found to have met the criteria for probable AIH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Atypical presentations of AIH in Somali men have also been documented in an additional clinical study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>, and although no specific mention of khat use was reported, it is believed that there may be a correlation between the increased presentations of AIH seen in Somali men and the prevalent use and under-reporting of khat consumption in this region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】AIH is a chronic inflammatory condition of unknown etiology and is typically reserved as a diagnosis of exclusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16-18 \\]</u>. It is characterized by elevated liver transaminase levels, a positive autoantibody screen, elevated immunoglobulin G levels, and interface hepatitis on histology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16-18 \\]</u>. The clinical course of AIH may be characterized by a waxing and waning of autoimmune activity, making clinical manifestations among patients decidedly variable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. AIH can be triggered through exposure to environmental agents, drugs, and cross-reactivity between viral particles and liver antigens. It is unclear whether drugs, herbs, and other environmental agents expose or induce AIH, or if they cause a drug-induced hepatitis with autoimmune features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Our patient has demonstrated characteristic features of AIH with a background significant for khat consumption. It is hypothesized that chronic chewing of khat induces a form of AIH in genetically susceptible individuals, and current literature helps to support this association 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 14 \\]</u>. Our hypothesis that khat induces AIH is further strengthened by the lack of AIH cases within Somali women, as fewer women seem to engage in khat chewing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. From the current literature, the prognosis of khat-induced liver injury is unclear. Favorable responses to abstinence from khat and corticosteroid therapy have been documented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 14 \\]</u>, although progression to cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure from drug-induced hepatotoxicity is possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The implication that khat consumption causes AIH in genetically susceptible individuals should only be used as a tentative interpretation based on current literature and our patient’s clinical and diagnostic presentation. More research is needed to better elucidate the role of khat in the pathogenesis of AIH. This study highlights a need for better cultural awareness in the US when dealing with immigrants from East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula who present with unique forms of hepatitis, cirrhosis, or fulminant liver failure.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Disclosures</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no conflicts of interest or financial support involved in this case study.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Note</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Sanjeev Slehria, Xiao-Lan Chen, Satyanarayana Vaidya, and Nafisa Saleem are contracted through Cape Fear Valley Medical Center, 1638 Owen Drive, Fayetteville, NC, USA.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:51:54", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:52:01", "cost": 6.877}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:52:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:51:53"}

It includes three basic subtypes: cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis and superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. The infection source associated with the subtypes of septic CVST differs due to an extinct venous drainage pathway and anatomical location. According to previous reports, septic lateral sinus thrombosis is almost exclusively associated with otitis media or infection of the mastoid air cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. By contrast, cavernous sinus thrombosis is more vulnerable to facial, dental, sphenoid and ethmoid sinus infections since the cavernous sinus receiving blood from the facial veins and pterygoid plexus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Periodontitis is one of the most common chronic bacterial infections, accounting for 5-15% in any population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. It has been proposed that chronic periodontitis may contribute to the pathogenesis of several systemic infectious and inflammatory diseases such as infectious endocarditis and carotid atherosclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. There have been a few reports showing that odontogenic infection may cause septic cavernous sinus thrombosis but there have been no reports with regard to the other cerebral venous sinuses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Here we report a case of septic CVST involving the transverse and sigmoid sinuses which was related to periodontitis.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 42-year-old woman who denied any previous major disease had acute headache in left temporal region and intermittent fever for 1 month. She visited our emergency room for explosive headache and a painful sensation radiating to her waist that made it difficult to sit or walk.\n\n【5】On admission, her temperature was 38.8 °C. Neurological examination revealed neck rigidity and weakness of the right upper extremity. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed thrombosis in the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses . Leukocytosis (WBC count 13,360/μL) was present. Lumbar puncture revealed increased intracranial pressure (280 mm H <sub>2 </sub> O), elevated protein (199 mg/dL), low glucose (19 mg/dL) and neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis (WBC count 1,539/μL). Chest plain film revealed a dense nodular shadow at the right upper lung field, and follow-up chest computed tomography revealed multiple pulmonary nodules, and some with cavitation . Septic lateral sinus thrombosis complicated with septic pulmonary emboli was considered. The fever and headache subsided after empirical antibiotic therapy with ceftriazone, vancomycin and metronidazole. The follow-up cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed reduced WBC count and chest plain film showed gradual resolution of the dense nodular shadow.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

(C) Chest computed tomography shows multiple pulmonary nodules with cavitation, which is compatible with septic emboli. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【7】The blood culture yielded Peptostreptococcus micros , an anerobic bacteria being a commensal organism in the mouth, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. The CSF analysis after empirical antibiotic treatment was negative for acid-fast stain, cryptococcal antigen, and bacterial culture. An ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist confirmed the absence of otogenic infection. A complete dental examination revealed full-mouth periodontitis. Meanwhile, a transthoracic echocardiogram did not show intra-atrial thrombus or valvular vegetation. Serum studies for coagulopathies, tumor markers and autoimmune profiles were within normal limits. Therefore, we considered the peptostreptococcal bacteremia to be the infection source of lateral sinus thrombosis and pulmonary emboli, and it was highly suspected due to the patient having periodontitis. She received regular dental treatment after discharge, and no recurrent episode was noted during more than 2-year follow-up.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】This report illustrates the unusual presentation of a patient with periodontitis and demonstrates that untreated periodontitis can be the source of septicemia with reactive prothrombotic status, preceding septic lateral sinus thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.\n\n【10】In our case, the primary infection origin for the septic lateral sinus was thought most likely to be periodontitis after extensive workup for the source of peptostreptococcal bacteremia. Possible mechanisms in our case include direct bacterial invasion of the cerebral vessel walls and systemic bacteremia with reactive prothrombotic status.\n\n【11】Septic CVST has been associated with pulmonary emboli in 11% of patients in one series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The association of CVST and pulmonary embolism may be explained by two mechanisms, that is the consequence of a global prothrombotic status or the detaching thrombus from the lateral sinus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Any procedure performed by dentists on the teeth, or even everyday brushing, can produce transient bacteremia, causing a pathogen to enter the circulation, which may initiate a secondary infection within distant organs, especially the cardiovascular system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Reducing the bacterial load in the mouth is considered to be a key step for preventing secondary thrombus formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In our patient, dental treatment and maintenance of oral hygiene effectively prevented a recurrent episode.\n\n【13】In conclusion, although it is very rare, periodontitis can be the cause of septic lateral sinus thrombosis.

The incidence of SIFs is still unknown, but it is clear that SIFs are more common than estimated. The most common cause is postmenopausal osteoporosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Osteoporotic SIFs are rare and may present with symptoms similar to those low back and sciatic pain. Corticosteroid use, radiotheraphy, rheumatoid arthritis, long-term use of bisphosphonates, renal osteodystrophy, Paget disease, osteomalacia, hyperparathyroidism, and pilimary bilier cirrhosis are reported as the other risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】The purpose of this paper was to report an SIF in a young lady who was followed for years with a diagnosis of idiopathic primary osteoporosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the evidence-based medical literature of this kind of fracture in a young osteoporotic patient.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 29-year-old, 176 cm height and 62 kg weight woman, was admitted to outpatient clinic with low back pain, on the left side, radiating to the gluteus region and posterior surface of the proximal thigh which began suddenly after sneezing 4 days ago. There was no history of trauma. The patient was diagnosed idiopathic primary osteoporosis 5 years ago; however, she did not take bisphosphonates, but was given only supplemental calcium (2,000 mg/day) and vitamin D (400 IU/day) since the initial diagnosis. The recent bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar vertebra (L1-L4) was assessed in the “hip” and “spine” programs. The spine T-score was -2.7, and the hip T-score was -2.1. When we examined the reason why the doctor did not prescribe bisphosphonates, the use of bisphosphonates was considered early for such a young lady.\n\n【5】At the physical examination, palpation over the left buttock was painful, and the hip range of motion (ROM) was normal but little painful. Global palpation of the left sacroiliac joint region was also painful, however with no spesific point being found. The sacroiliac compression test was positive on the left side, whereas the Lasegue maneuver was negative bilaterally. She had an antalgic gait with pain on left side which she had never previously suffered. Neurological examination revealed no abnormality.\n\n【6】Plain radiographs of the thoracolumbar, lumbosacral and pelvis showed no osseos pathology . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a vertically oriented fracture line on the left side of the iliac ala, with prominent bone marrow edema at T2 sequence, characterizing a stress fracture .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Laboratory results were all normal thus new BMD levels were required, whereas it was expected an increase in biochemical bone turnover markers in such situations.\n\n【10】A diagnosis of a sacral stress fracture was established on the basis of both clinical and radiological tests. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were initiated for a week in association with a physiotheraphy programme which was focused on stretching of the posterior thigh, strengthening of the abdominal muscle and core stabilization maneuvers. Though pain was reduced after a week of medication and bed rest, physiotheraphy program lasted 4 weeks. The patient returned to work after 4 weeks of treatment. At the sixth week’s clinical examination, there was no pain on palpation of the left buttock and sacroiliac joint region. Subsequent pelvic radiography and pelvic MRI revealed reduced bone marrow edema and distally healed fracture line .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

(b) Axial-sectional MRI of the pelvis at 1 month showing reduced signal intensity in left sacral ala with distally healed fracture line. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Pentecost et al have classified sacral stress fractures into two groups as fatigue and insufficiency fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Fatigue fractures occur in healthy bones under abnormal stresses, while the latter occurs in weakened bones under normal stresses. Sacral stress fractures are mostly seen in athletes, especially long-distance runners, due to unusual loads with repetitive activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Sacral fatigue fractures have been reported in athletes and during postpartum and intrapartum periods most of which were related to excessive weight gain, hyperlordosis, pelvic ligament weakness and osteopenia during pregnancy, whereas insufficiency fractures have been mostly reported in the elderly postmenopausal osteoporotic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The common underlying cause of the SIFs is osteoporosis. Osteoporosis mostly affects trabecular bone than cortical bone where the ratio of trabecular bone is highest in the sacral ala. Additionally osteoporosis lowers bone strength, thus resulting in greater susceptibility to injury with normal repetitive activites and minor traumas. Hence, the stress on the weight-bearing bones such as vertebral bodies, pelvis and sacrum is particularly affected as insufficiency fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Moreover, the clinical presentation is often variable and considered to be an acute low back pain. Patients usually present with insidious low back pain which is exacerbated by weight-bearing activities and improved with rest. Back pain may radiate to the gluteal region, hips and lower extremities which may be confused with spinal stenosis and lumbar disc herniations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, neurological symptoms are generally absent.\n\n【17】In initial anamnesis, patients’ activity levels related to trauma and any relevant risc factors (e.g. osteoporosis, prolonged corticosteroid use, cancer or rheumatlogical disease) should be questioned. Physical examination may reveal sacral tenderness on lateral compression and sacroiliac joint tests. Patients have usually antalgic and slow gate pattern.\n\n【18】In laboratory assessment, at first a slightly raised bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as a bone formation marker can be valuable adjunct in directing the clinican towards a diagnosis of SIFs in the beginning period of the sympyoms. Then urine cross-linked N-telopeptides of type 1 collagen, cross-linked C-telopeptides of type 1 collagen can be detected in urine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Conventional radiographs are usually inadequate to demonstrate the SIFs due to many reasons as overlying gas shadows, fecal matter and geometry of the sacrum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. MRI is the by far most sensitive diagnostic method. Low signal intensity at T1 and high signal intensity at T2-weighted sequences demonstrate the edema at the fracture line. Further investigation can be achieved with intravenous gadolinium if needed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Moreover, CT and bone scintigraphy can be performed in differential diagnosis. In our case, MRI helped us to understand the nature of the fracture pattern, thus confirming the diagnosis.\n\n【20】Treatment of SIFs is generally conservative. Rest, short-term pain control with analgesics and allowing partial weight-bearing are the first choices, whereas stretching of the posterior thigh, strengthening of the abdominal muscle and core stabilization maneuvers regarding early rehabilitation should be applied as much as can be tolerated by patient. Refractory cases may require more rest and follow-up imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. Surgical intervention is only needed when the conservative treatment fails or in case of a pelvic instability. Rishi et al reported a case of rheumatoid patient who has an unstable sacral insufficiency with translation at sacroiliac joint treated with in situ iliosacral screw fixation. In this report, it is emphasized that early intervention in such cases should be managed by surgical fixation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】On the contrary, management of osteoporosis in young premenopausal women should focus on the treatment of any secondary cause such as weight-bearing exercise, calcium and vitamin D intake, and avoidance of tobacco and alcohol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. However, in a situation of major fracture due to osteoporosis, pharmacological therapy is required. Biphosphonates are usually preferred for the first choice of treatment, whereas they should be avoided in women of childbearing potential not to have adverse effects on the fetal skeleton 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 17 \\]</u>. Selective estrogen receptor agonists are not recommended in young women due to bone loss. On the other hand, teriparatide use is recommended in such cases in many recent literatures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Any fracture history was not reported in this case before, only intake of calcium and vitamin D has been hitherto applied. The patient should take pharmacological therapy from now on.\n\n【22】In conclusion, clinicians should suspect a possible SIF in differential diagnosis of osteoporotic patient with low back and buttock pain even in young patients without any trauma. Low back pain exaggerated by long-term activities and even sneezing as in our case should not be overlooked in the anamnesis; otherwise non-specific symptoms may delay the diagnosis which improves the disability by dislocating the fracture line.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funds have been received for this study.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the patient to present and publish the medical documents.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 09:47:17", "endTime": "2024/09/19 09:48:13", "cost": 55.86}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 17:48:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 17:47:16"}

C. difficile is the main agent for PMC. C. difficile is a spore-forming, anaerobic, Gram-positive bacillus. Proliferating C. difficile produces toxins that cause several complications, including PMC, toxic megacolon, perforations of the colon, and sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Spores produced by C. difficile are highly resistant to heat, gastric acid and biocidal cleaning products and can remain viable for months on surfaces, being resistant to hospital cleaners and even solutions that are used to disinfect the hands by healthcare professionals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. The ability to produce spores is of crucial importance in the transmission of C. difficile , leading to frequent recurrences after successful initial treatment. Currently, C. difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea in industrialized countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, and the incidence of CDI is increasing in Europe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6-8 \\]</u>. This infection is often associated with healthcare facilities and usually appears as a nosocomial infection, and it is directly related to the length of hospital stay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The main risk factor for the development of CDI is exposure to antibacterial therapy, classically broad-spectrum agents, which are able to disrupt colonic microflora 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, whereas older age (≥ 65 years old), previous hospitalization, severity of underlying disease, immunocompromised state, suppression of gastric acid secretion, tube feeding and gastrointestinal surgery, chemotherapy and obesity are also risk factors for CDI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11-14 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】The clinical presentation due to colonization and infection by C. difficile can have a highly variable spectrum, which can range from asymptomatic carrier, mild to moderate CDI or PMC, one of the most serious manifestations of CDI with high mortality associated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15-17 \\]</u>. The clinical presentation of CDI is caused by toxins A and B, produced by C. difficile , responsible for inflammation, damage the lining of the colon and cause inflammation leading to diarrhea and colitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】The clinical treatment of suspected CDI requires a rapid and accurate diagnosis, and the establishment of appropriate drug therapy. The first-line antibiotherapy in non-severe CDI/first episode is metronidazole, orally, but it appears that increasing cases of resistance to this antibiotic make a second-line treatment with vancomycin administered orally necessary. The current European guidelines recommend the use of vancomycin over metronidazole as first-line therapy in severe CDI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 18-20 \\]</u>. Although vancomycin and metronidazole are effective in a first episode of CDI, this therapy remains suboptimal essentially due to the increased number of cases of resistance to metronidazole and vancomycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21-23 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】According to the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines, recurrence is the major challenge in the treatment of CDI, with up to 25% of patients with CDI suffering a recurrence of infection within 30 days after treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin and 45-65% of these patients present subsequent recurrences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 24 , 25 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】New drugs have emerged for the treatment of CDI, including fidaxomicin, a macrocyclic antibiotic, the first in its class. Fidaxomicin acts by inhibiting C. difficile ’s RNA polymerase, causing C. difficile cell death and presents selective bactericidal activity against C. difficile , which is in contrast to vancomycin that is only bacteriostatic against this agent. Fidaxomicin has a narrow spectrum of action, with minimal impact on anaerobic natural commensal colonic microflora. Gram-negative organisms are inherently not susceptible to fidaxomicin, whereby the fidaxomicin has a low risk of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) acquisition. This drug inhibits spore formation and toxin production by C. difficile 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26-28 \\]</u>. Fidaxomicin acts locally and has no cross-resistance with currently available antibacterial agents. According to the results of phase III trials, this drug not only showed comparable efficacy with vancomycin in the treatment of CDI, but also showed superior efficacy in reducing disease recurrence, providing a sustained clinical cure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 , 29 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】An 82-year-old woman with a history of liposarcoma, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease and gallstones had previously presented with PMC. Her medications were omeprazole (20 mg/day), furosemide (40 mg/day), pravastatin (20 mg/day), insulin detemir (40 units/day), bisoprolol (5 mg/day), losartan (100 mg/day), and oxygen delivered at 1 L/min for 16 h/day.\n\n【8】The patient was admitted on August 2, 2013 to the Internal Medicine Department of the Hospital Geral do Centro Hospitalar Universitario in Coimbra with recurrence of PMC (first episode occurred 2 months previously), cystitis and worsened chronic heart failure. Clinical laboratory tests revealed no leukocytosis, C-reactive protein (CRP) 3 mg/dL (reference value < 0.1 mg/dL), creatinine 110.4 μmol/L (reference range 46.0 - 92.0 μmol/L), urea 9.7 mmol/L (reference range 2.5 - 6.4 mmol/L), N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) 118 pg/mL (reference value < 300 pg/mL) and no myocardial necrosis markers. Urinalysis revealed the presence of 100 - 200 leukocytes/field, with bacterial growth. She received empiric treatment with intravenous cotrimoxazole (480 mg every 12 h) and oral vancomycin (125 mg every 6 h).\n\n【9】The patient was hospitalized for cystitis and worsening chronic heart failure, after which she received supportive therapy and cefuroxime 750 mg every 8 h for 7 days. At the end of the sixth day of hospitalization, she developed PMC. She had leukocytosis (leukocytes 17.6 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, reference range 4 - 10 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL), neutrophilia (neutrophils 14.3 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, reference range 2 - 7 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL), CRP increased to 4.2 mg/dL and worsening renal function (urea/creatinine ratio 17.8/148.9). A stool sample tested positive for C. difficile toxin initially by immunochromatographic rapid test GDH and then by PCR test.\n\n【10】The patient was treated with oral metronidazole (500 mg every 8 h) for 6 days, which was then discontinued because of persistent diarrhea. Antibiotic therapy was switched to oral vancomycin (125 mg every 6 h) for 14 days and the diarrhea resolved after 10 days of treatment. After 1 month in hospital, the patient was discharged without diarrhea.\n\n【11】Two months after being discharged, the patient was readmitted as an emergency case with diarrhea (seven liquid stools per day); a C. difficile toxin test of the stools was positive. Physical examination found a distended abdomen, no palpable masses, and increased bowel sounds. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed no remarkable findings. Clinical laboratory results indicated leukocytosis (leukocytes 17.0 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL), platelets 493 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL (reference range 150 - 400 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL), blood glucose 16.5 mmol/L (reference range 4.1 - 5.9 mmol/L), urea 14.5 mmol/L (reference range 2.5 - 6.4 mmol/L), creatinine 141.1 μmol/L (reference range 46.0 - 92.0 μmol/L) and CRP 34.5 mg/dL (reference value < 0.1 mg/dL). Treatment with oral vancomycin (125 mg, every 6 h) was initiated; however, profuse diarrhea and C. difficile toxin positivity in the stool persisted. In addition, colonoscopy and subsequent biopsy were compatible with PMC. Specifically, colonoscopy investigating the area from the anal margin to the descending colon revealed erythematous mucosa and inflamed areas, probably related to the resolution phase of colitis. Biopsies of two colonic mucosa samples showed cellular architecture changes consistent with PMC. Consequently, oral metronidazole 500 mg every 8 h was added to vancomycin therapy. After 12 days of dual therapy with vancomycin and metronidazole, there was no clinical improvement; therefore, both antibiotics were stopped and oral fidaxomicin (200 mg every 12 h) was administered for 10 days. There was successful resolution of symptoms (diarrhea and fever resolved after 5 days) and the patient was discharged from hospital on the 10th day of fidaxomicin therapy with no further symptoms. As yet, the patient has been free of PMC recurrence. Treatment with fidaxomicin was well tolerated and no adverse events were reported by the patient.\n\n【12】C. difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea in industrialized countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, and the incidence of CDI is on the rise in Europe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6-8 , 30 \\]</u>. The clinical presentation of C. difficile colonization and infection can vary greatly, ranging from asymptomatic carriage, to mild to moderate CDI or PMC; the latter is one of the most serious manifestations of CDI and associated with a high mortality rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15-17 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Our patient had a number of factors that contributed to her worsening condition and were predictive of PMC recurrence. These were treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, cefuroxime; concomitant treatment with a proton pump inhibitor; age over 75 years; comorbidities (liposarcoma, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperuricemia, dyslipidemia, chronic heart failure, and obesity) and multiple hospital admissions. Our patient was considered to be at high risk of PMC recurrence and indeed suffered a recurrence soon after completing first-line treatment with vancomycin.\n\n【14】Clinical management of suspected CDI relies on rapid and accurate diagnosis, and the initiation of appropriate drug therapy. Oral metronidazole is the first-line antibiotic therapy for non-severe/first episode CDI; however, response to metronidazole is often poor, possibly because of the attainment of poor concentrations in the gut 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>, necessitating the need for second-line treatment with oral vancomycin. Current European guidelines recommend the use of vancomycin over metronidazole as first-line therapy in severe CDI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 18-20 \\]</u>. Although vancomycin and metronidazole are effective in a first episode of CDI, therapy remains suboptimal essentially due to the high rate of recurrence with metronidazole and vancomycin treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21-23 \\]</u>. According to the ESCMID guidelines, recurrence is the major challenge in the treatment of CDI, with up to 25% of patients experiencing recurrence of infection within 30 days of metronidazole or vancomycin treatment, and of these, 45-65% of patients present with subsequent recurrences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 24 , 25 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Recently approved therapies for the treatment of CDI include fidaxomicin - the first-in-class macrocyclic antibiotic. It acts by inhibiting the RNA polymerase of C. difficile , causing cell death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. Fidaxomicin has selective bactericidal activity against C. difficile , which is in contrast to vancomycin’s bacteriostatic activity against this organism. Fidaxomicin has a narrow spectrum of action, with minimal impact on naturally occurring commensal anaerobic microflora in the colon. Gram-negative organisms are inherently non-susceptible to fidaxomicin, with a low risk of vancomycin-resistant enterococci arising from its use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26-28 \\]</u>. Fidaxomicin inhibits spore formation and toxin production by C. difficile 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26-28 \\]</u>. It acts locally and is not associated with cross-resistance with currently available antibacterial agents. According to the results of phase III trials, fidaxomicin was non-inferior to vancomycin for initial cure of CDI, but significantly reduced the rate of disease recurrence, contributing to an increase in sustained clinical cure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 , 31 \\]</u>. Considering these findings and the presence of risk factors predictive of recurrence, it may have been prudent to administer fidaxomicin for the treatment of the first recurrence of PMC in our patient. However, our case occurred in 2013, when access to fidaxomicin and clinical experience of its use were limited. Today, fidaxomicin has demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of CDI, including a previously published case study describing the successful treatment of severe CDI following prior failure of metronidazole and vancomycin in a 49-year-old patient undergoing peritoneal dialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. However, there are currently limited clinical data for fidaxomicin treatment of the more serious PMC. Our report of a complex case of PMC successfully treated with fidaxomicin following prior antibiotic treatment failure adds to the information available for this antibiotic in this setting. Of note in our case, there was successful resolution of PMC despite its late administration. Moreover, after clinical resolution of PMC at the end of treatment, there has been no recurrence of PMC in our patient since 2013. Therefore, fidaxomicin may be an appropriate alternative therapy in cases of recurrence, and may be appropriate even during the first episode of CDI in patient at high risk of recurrence.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Medical writing services were provided by Rhian Harper Owen on behalf of Astellas Pharma EMEA to assist with grammar and English translations.

We would like to highlight the importance of these differential diagnoses of cardiac masses in every individual case.\n\n【3】Co-existence of atrial myxoma with saddle pulmonary embolism (PE) and adenocarcioma of the colon can affect the heart by a number of different mechanisms; increasing cardiovascular demands on the heart, arrhythmias, structural change of the heart and promoting cardiovascular disease. As clinicians we need to manage clinical conditions in order of priority for best clinical outcome.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 64-year-old man presented to the local district general hospital with lethargy and generally feeling unwell. On examination, his right leg was swollen. The patient then developed chest pain, haemoptysis and atrial fibrillation (AF) and was referred to our institution. Past medical history is significant for Duke’s stage B colorectal adenocarcinoma treated 6 months earlier with anterior resection and chemotherapy. He was waiting for resection of two isolated liver lesions revealed on a follow-up staging computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET).\n\n【6】An ultrasound Doppler confirmed a right femoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT). An echocardiogram, performed due to the AF  showed a mass in the left atrium (LA). Of note no cardiac mass was detected on the previous PET or CT scan 6 months prior to this admission. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was done in view of the DVT and haemoptysis, and revealed a saddle pulmonary embolus (PE) with extensive thromboembolism affecting the pulmonary arterial tree to the periphery of the pulmonary circulation . The coronary angiogram was normal.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) showing saddle pulmonary embolism extending across both pulmonary arteries. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【9】Due to previous history of adenocarcinoma, the initial differential diagnosis consisted of secondary metastases, primary cardiac tumour or thrombus in the heart. It was difficult to establish whether the entire cardiac mass was a thrombus or a myxoma. Although the saddle PE was most likely an embolized thrombus related to his DVT, the possibility of an embolized tumour fragment had to be considered.\n\n【10】The patient’s AF (180 bpm) was rate-controlled, and he was started with unfractionated heparin intravenous (IV) infusion. Thrombolysis for the PE was not indicated in this case as circulatory collapse was not imminent. The saddle PE was no longer present after several days of heparin whereas the mass in the LA remained. Following discussion with the cardiothoracic team, surgery was postponed until the patient’s AF was adequately controlled and pulmonary circulation had improved. Cardiac surgery was undertaken 2 weeks later, and confirmed the presence of a rounded nodular brown and beige tumour 38 × 28 × 25 mm. Histology showed a rounded/polypoid lesion, comprising mainly laminated fibrin/necrotic matter. Towards the base of the lesion, and immediately above some myocardial tissue was an area of loose myxoid matrix with some vascular proliferation, strongly suggestive of a cardiac myxoma, although classic features were not seen. Local excision was regarded as complete.\n\n【11】The patient recovered well after surgery with no post-operative complications and was discharged a week later on warfarin. 5 months later the patient had successful resection of the liver nodules, confirmed as metastatic colon adenocarcinoma. At present the patient is currently free from myxoma, recurrence of the adenocarcinoma and further venous thromboembolism (VTE).\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】To our knowledge only one previous case of atrial myxoma with concurrent Duke’s B2 adenocarcinoma of the colon exists in the English literature. In 1997 Nuno et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> described a 56-year-old male who presented with nearly obstructing adenocarcinoma, AF and a LA myxoma prolapsing through the mitral valve into the left ventricle (LV). In this case, the patient was treated with digoxin and IV unfractionated heparin and underwent cardiac surgery prior to having a resection of the colon and a partial cystectomy. The patient was fitted with a permanent pacemaker following ablation for AF.\n\n【14】Primary cardiac tumours are rare (0.02-0.19%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\- 4 \\]</u>; myxoma is the commonest benign tumour in adults (45-50%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Myxomas present between the ages of 30 - 70 years, and occur more frequently in women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. The majority of myxomas (75-90%) originate in the LA from the fossa ovalis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\- 7 \\]</u>. Clinical features include dyspnoea, syncope, arrhythmias, oedema, haemoptysis, and sudden death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Systemic features of embolic phenomena (30-40%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> can result in pulmonary embolism, stroke and vasculitis and can mimic infective endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\- 8 \\]</u>. However, 10-15% of patients are asymptomatic when a mass is incidentally found on imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\- 9 \\]</u>. Myxomas are thought to arise from undifferentiated and totipotent mesenchymal stem cells通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>5 </sup></u> and have a quick growth rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Most tumours are 5 - 6 cm (1 - 15 cm) in diameter and weigh an average of 57 grams (8 - 450 g) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\- 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the first line investigation with sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 95% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. On echocardiography heterogenicity and small lucencies are consistent with myxoma whereas thrombi are homogenous and are usually found in the left atrial appendage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Myxomas carry a high embolic risk and surgical removal is the only curative option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 , 8 , 11 , 12 \\]</u>. There is a 3% chance of recurrence, which increases to 12-22% for familial types; either as another primary myxoma or more commonly due incomplete surgical resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 , 11 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Metastatic cardiac disease is more common than primary cardiac tumours. Autopsy-based studies show that between 1% and 20.5% of patients with extra-cardiac malignant tumours have metastases to the heart, most commonly occurring in widespread malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 13 \\]</u>. In up to 90% of these cases there would have been no clinical cardiac symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Cancer of the colon has been shown to give rise to sporadic cases of metastases to the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 14 \\- 17 \\]</u>. A literature search shows 14 known cases of cardiac metastases from colorectal adenocarcinoma, commonly to the right atrium/right ventricle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Colon cancer accounts for 12-14% of cancer cases in the UK and is mainly diagnosed in those over the age of 50 years, unless there is a genetic predisposition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. The majority are adenocarcinoma (95%) and arise from the left side of the colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. The liver is the most common site of metastases (45%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>. Overall survival from colon cancer is approximately 60% at 5 years. If metastases are present, then life expectancy is at an average of 12 - 18 months. However, attitudes towards liver resections for metastases have changed and if the metastases are isolated within one lobe or quadrant, then surgery is performed even if multiple metastases are present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. This improves the 5 year survival rates in those with liver metastases from 0% to up to 33% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Pulmonary embolism (PE) is common in those with underlying malignancy, with the risk of thrombosis increased by 4.1 fold 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 \\]</u>. Colon cancer has been shown to have risk of PE of 1-3.1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 23 \\]</u>. The highest incidence of a VTE is within the first 6 months of diagnosis compared to after 2 years; 5% and 0.6% respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Patients with metastatic cancer and three or more other co-morbidities have a higher rate of VTE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The main differential diagnoses for cardiac masses are tumour, both primary and secondary, thrombus and vegetation. In this case the possibility of multiple differential diagnoses existed; the patient had a known primary cancer of the colon with a metastatic nodule in the liver and a high risk of thromboembolism. Vegetations were less likely as there was no history of valvular lesions and imaging showed no significant regurgitation or vegetation. However endocarditis must be excluded for any cardiac masses.\n\n【20】In this case the PE was likely the result of the metastatic colon adenocarcinoma, and the myxoma was incidentally picked up on imaging. As the PE resolved and a mass, highly suspicious of myxoma, remained, surgical resection of the cardiac mass took priority over the liver nodules due to the risk of potentially fatal systemic circulatory embolism. However, before surgery the patient should be hemodynamically stable and in this case the ventricular response rate to AF was adequately controlled before attempting resection. After the cardiac myxoma was removed the patient’s liver nodules continued to be monitored and an adequate recovery time was given prior to resection of the nodules.\n\n【21】Patient Consent\n\n【22】Obtained.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Competing Interests</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical Approval</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:55:50", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:56:02", "cost": 11.778}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:55:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:55:41"}

No previous case reports have described spondylodiscitis due to Bacteroides fragilis that occurred after a spine trauma. We assume that spine trauma could represent a “ locus minoris resistentiae ” facilitating the initiation of a new focus of infection for Bacteroides fragilis from a primary intestinal infective focus.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 41-year-old white Caucasian man was admitted to our Operative Unit because of abdominal pain and fever. Past medical history revealed bilateral nephrolithiasis and depressive syndrome. One year before he had experienced a thoracic trauma, secondary to car crash, without any neurological consequences. His medications included an antidepressive drug (venlafaxine) and benzodiazepines.\n\n【4】On admission the patient presented a temperature of 38.8 °C and complained colicky abdominal pain. A thorough physical examination was performed. Abdominal examination revealed diffuse tenderness without signs of peritoneal irritation; Murphy’s sign, renal and appendicular punches were negative. Heart, neurological, and thoracic examinations were unremarkable. On laboratory tests, the cell count demonstrated 12,470 white blood cells per cubic millimeter, with 70% neutrophils. C-reactive protein (PCR) was 21.6 mg/dL. Hepatic, renal, coagulative function, and urinalysis were within normal limits. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Abdominal X-ray, chest radiography, and abdominal ultrasounds showed no abnormalities. The abdominal CT scan demonstrated sub-acute appendicitis. Surgical treatment was not indicated and an empirical antibiotic therapy with I.V. levofloxacin and antipiretic drug (paracetamol) and was started. After 7 days, the patient presented a complete remission of the symptoms; a control TC scan of the abdomen showed the regression of appendicular inflammation; nevertheless, within a few days fever accompanied by shivering recurred. Because of the persistent febrile status of unknown origin, blood culture specimens were further collected and a 2-\\[通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18 </sup></u> F\\]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) was requested. Contrast tomography (CT) attenuation images were used for PET correction (PET/TC). PET/TC revealed an intense FDG uptake in the intervertebral disc between thoracic vertebra 6 and 7; no abnormal FDG uptake was recognized in other areas and diagnosis of discitis was made . T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a hyperintense signal in T6 and T7 vertebral bodies and in the corresponding intervertebral disc , where post-gadolinium T1-weighted MRI demonstrated a strong enhancement associated with the presence of an extradural collection . These radiological findings were consistent with spondylodiscitis. Once blood cultures grow Bacteroides fragilis , the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis caused by Bacteroides fragilis was made. As expected on the basis of clinical course, Bacteroides fragilis strain was resistant to quinolones, while it was sensitive to metronidazole and piperacillin/tazobactam. A combined treatment with these drugs was started, while levoxacine was discontinued, with complete remission of fever. After 2 months follow-up, a thoracic spine MRI showed a complete regression of the inflammatory pattern.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The value of this case presentation is that it is extremely rare for an adult with aortopulmonary window not to develop heart failure or pulmonary vasculature disease; and in this presentation we strive to explain the mechanism responsible for this positive outcome. To our best knowledge this is the oldest asymptomatic patient with aortopulmonary window reported in the medical literature.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】We report here a case of a 27-year-old male patient who was admitted to our Cardiology Clinic due to palpitations and fatigue. He reported that he was active without major complaints until the palpitations began. He possessed medical documentation of early childhood from a different medical center that described a systolic murmur as a result of ventricular septal defect (VSD), which was not treated. The size and site of VSD were not described. Patient has not been visited by cardiologist since then. He has family history of congenital heart disease, as his mother was diagnosed with atrial septal defect and has been operated recently.\n\n【5】Physical examination of the heart revealed a harsh systolic murmur VI/VI, with punctum maximum at the left sternal border, at the third intercostal space.

The aortopulmonary window was 9 mm in diameter, with 7 m/s velocity across the defect and this is strongly believed to be the cause of the loud systolic murmur . Moderate pulmonary artery regurgitation was also detected . Heart chambers were not dilated and left and right ventricular function was within normal reference range. Tricuspid regurgitation was not seen, whereas pulmonary artery acceleration time was 105 ms. Pulmonary trunk diameter, measured at short axis parasternal view was 22 mm. Mild anterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse with trivial mitral regurgitation and mild aortic regurgitation were also seen.

At hospital discharge, he no longer had palpitations nor there were changes on ECG consistent with arrhythmias and he was feeling better.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Aortopulmonary window, a communication between ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk in the presence of two separate semilunar valves, causes a left to right shunt which leads to heart failure and pulmonary hypertension that usually evolves rapidly to pulmonary vascular disease. Surgical correction is indicated in all cases as soon as this disorder is diagnosed. If not surgically corrected, mortality is around 40% in the first year of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Thus, there are limited reports in medical literature of adults with aortopulmonary window 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\- 6 \\]</u>. It is exceptionally rare for heart failure or pulmonary vascular disease not to develop in an adult with aortopulmonary window, as it is the case with our patient. We believe that two factors may have contributed to our patient’s condition. Firstly, the defect size was not very large, although it is not a size to be underestimated. Secondly but more importantly, we believe that the main saviour for our patient was the moderate pulmonary artery regurgitation, as a large amount of the blood that enters the pulmonary artery trunk from aorta redirects to the right ventricle, thus not overloading the pulmonary vasculature. On the other hand, pulmonary regurgitation is well tolerated as it is a slow developing process, presenting with symptoms in 6% at 20 years of age and 20% by 40 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Pulmonary regurgitation is frequently manifested with ventricular tachycardia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, which may be the reason of ventricular tachycardia in our patient. Right ventricular dilatation due to pulmonary regurgitation is believed to be responsible for rhythm disturbances. In our case right ventricle size and function were still within normal reference range; however, pulmonary regurgitation jet, redirecting to the right ventricle a considerable amount of the high velocity flow arriving from aorta, may have been hitting the right ventricular outflow tract constantly thus provoking right ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【15】VSD diagnosed in childhood in our patient may have closed spontaneously, as it is not detected currently. However, the similarity of the murmur produced by VSD and aortopulmonary window may have satisfied, at that time, the physician with the diagnosis of VSD thus failing to notice the aortopulmonary window. Aortopulmonary windows are often misdiagnosed or overlooked, although as long as this very rare malformation it is kept in mind it can be easily diagnosed by echocardiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Furthermore, aortopulmonary window is known to be associated with other congenital cardiac disorders such as coarctation of aorta, tetralogy Fallot, transposition of the great arteries and so forth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Limitation of this case presentation is that cardiac catheterization and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have not been performed to confirm the diagnosis, although echocardiography is a reliable tool for diagnosing aortopulmonary window.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】This is an exceptional rare case of an adult with aortopulmonary window without symptoms or signs of heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary artery regurgitation may serve as a saviour in this rare asymptomatic adult patient with aortopulmonary window, since a large amount of blood that enters the pulmonary trunk from the aorta redirects toward the right ventricle thus not overloading the pulmonary vasculature. Ventricular tachycardia may be the sole clinical presentation in an adult patient with aortopulmonary window and moderate pulmonary window.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank all the medical personnel of Cardiology Clinic that were involved in diagnosing and treating this patient.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Support</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:04:04", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:04:51", "cost": 46.979}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:04:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:04:04"}

We present an 18-year-old patient with ulcerative colitis who presented for anesthetic care during liver biopsy. Due to concerns of obesity and delayed gastric emptying, succinylcholine was chosen to provide rapid neuromuscular blockade and facilitate endotracheal intubation. Postoperatively, the patient complained of bilateral calf pain. The etiology of muscle pain related to succinylcholine is discussed and potential strategies to reduce its incidence reviewed.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Institutional Review Board approval is not required for presentation of single case report at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH). The patient was an 18-year-old, 129.8 kg adolescent with a body mass index (BMI) of 41 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> who was scheduled for a liver biopsy for suspected non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). His past history was positive for ulcerative colitis which had previously required laparoscopic colectomy with colostomy. Other past surgeries included adenotonsillectomy and ventral hernia repair. There was no history of previous problems with general anesthesia during any of the procedures. Current medications included cholecalciferol (1,000 unit tablet) once daily and metronidazole 0.75% topical gel. The patient had known allergies to penicillin and cephalosporins. Due to obstructive sleep apnea, he used patient Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) at night. On the morning of the procedure, his physical examination and preoperative vital signs were unremarkable. The anesthetic plan, risks, benefits and alternatives to general anesthesia were discussed with the parent and informed consent obtained. The patient was held nil per os for 8 h and was transported to the operating room. Routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were placed. The patient was allowed to breathe 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen followed by placement of a peripheral intravenous cannula. Anesthesia was induced with propofol (200 mg) and neuromuscular blockade facilitated by the administration of succinylcholine (140 mg). Maintenance anesthesia included sevoflurane (2-3%) in air/oxygen with fentanyl (100 µg). Additional medications included dexamethasone (8 mg) and ondansetron (4 mg). The procedure lasted approximately 35 min. At the completion of the procedure, the patient’s trachea was extubated and he was transported to the post-anesthesia care unit. In the immediate postoperative period, he complained of pain in both his lower extremities, mainly in the calf muscles, for which he was offered various treatment options, which he chose to defer due to concerns related to the use of additional opioids. Over the course of the next 1 - 2 h, the calf pain slowly resolved and he was discharged home. The remainder of his postoperative course was unremarkable.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Succinylcholine is a NMBA with a very rapid clinical onset of action, making it an ideal agent for neuromuscular blockade when rapid securing of the airway is indicated. Despite its significant advantages, its use has been limited by concerns regarding its adverse effect profile including severe myalgias. The incidence of postoperative myalgia due to succinylcholine varies, being as high as 90% and generally thought to be approximately 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 9 \\]</u>. The myalgias have been described as similar to the pain or muscle soreness experienced after a significant physical activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The duration and intensity of this discomfort is highly variable.\n\n【7】The mechanism for the postoperative myalgia has not completely been elucidated. Postulated mechanisms include increased intracellular calcium concentrations, membrane phospholipid degradation, and release of free fatty acids and free radicals, which lead to increased membrane permeability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\- 13 \\]</u>. It has been proposed that the pain occurs due to muscle damage produced by shearing forces associated with the fasciculations at the onset of phase one block 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Studies demonstrating electromyographic spike trains of succinylcholine-induced fasciculations in patients have shown the possible development of microdamage at the extrafusal muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. While there is no correlation between the elevation of creatine phosphokinase and the development of muscle pain, the increase in the serum potassium concentration is greater in patients who develop myalgia than in those who do not 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】Although bothersome, myalgias following the administration of succinylcholine are generally self-limited although they may interfere with a rapid return to activities of daily life including return to work or school 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Various demographic risk factors have been identified. Myalgias occur less frequently in children and patients over 50 - 60 years of age, less commonly in females, and less commonly during pregnancy possibly due to hormonal influences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 19 , 20 \\]</u>. The state of training of the muscle has also been implicated, with a lower incidence and decreased severity of pain in patients with better muscular fitness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Patients who undergo minor procedures and those who are ambulated earlier are at higher risk for the development of postoperative myalgias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 21 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Various methods and regimens have been evaluated to decrease the incidence and severity of the myalgias. Pre-treatment with a small dose of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent prior to the administration of succinylcholine, remains the most commonly employed method, dating back to a 1957 report of the use of gallamine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Other methods including stretching exercises and supplementation of vitamin C, have been reported to be effective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 23 \\]</u>. Since it has been postulated that calcium influx enhances the intensity of muscle fiber contractions, inducing spindle damage and subsequent pain, pre-treatment with medications such as dantrolene which interfere with intracellular calcium release have been reported to be effective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. It has also been demonstrated that pre-treatment with calcium gluconate and lidocaine, which provide membrane stabilizing actions, are protective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 , 26 \\]</u>. Comparative studies between the inductions of anesthesia with propofol versus thiopental have shown a decreased association of myalgias after induction with propofol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】In summary, a high incidence of postoperative myalgia has been documented following the administration of succinylcholine. While generally self-limited, the myalgias can result in significant pain, resulting in a delay of return to work or school. As outlined above, demographic and clinical factors may increase the incidence and severity of the pain. Various techniques have been described to control the problem, the most commonly used technique being the administration of a small dose of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent 2 - 3 min before the administration of succinylcholine. While effective, this technique may delay the onset of succinylcholine and also increase the dose requirements. As such, it is not recommended in emergency situations when succinylcholine is used to rapidly secure the airway. Most importantly, controversy remains regarding the administration of succinylcholine.

The term thyrotoxicosis, rather than hyperthyroidism, should be used for this disorder, because it needs not to be associated with hyperfunction of the thyroid gland. The term hyperthyroidism is reserved for disorders that result from sustained overproduction and release of hormone by the thyroid gland. Current treatment of hyperthyroidism is based on drugs, surgery and radioactive iodine.\n\n【2】Methimazole is the anti-thyroid drug of choice because of its potency and infrequent side effects which are usually mild 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Methimazole is associated with cholestasis rather than hepatic necrosis, and the risk is increased with higher doses administered in older patients. Mild side effects occur in up to 20% of patients and include skin reactions, arthralgia, gastrointestinal symptoms, an abnormal sense of taste, and occasionally, sialadenitis. Other effects include thrombocytopenia, enlargement of lymph nodes, a lupus-like syndrome including the development of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive vasculitis and toxic psychoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】In this report, a case is presented with thyrotoxicosis and treated with methimazole, but the patient developed hepatotoxicity and anti-nuclear antibody (anti-ANA) positivity.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 56-year-old woman with a 2-month history of sweating and palpitations was admitted to the hospital.\n\n【6】Biochemical values were compatible with primary hyperthyroidism. Pre-treatment liver enzyme values were normal. She was taking the methimazole tb (30 mg/day) and nebivolol tb (5 mg/day) for 1 week. The liver enzyme values increased at the end of the first month of methimazol treatment . Patient was referred to our department with increased liver enzymes, normal upper abdominal MRI and MR cholangiography. Patient was admitted to our outpatient clinic with the symptom of weakness. On physical examination, BP was 120/80 mm Hg, pulse was 60/min and rhythmic, and sclera was sub-icteric. The other systemic physical examinations were normal. The laboratory results were as follows: sedimentation: 32 mm/h, all hepatic serology tests were negative, aPTT: 31 s, PTT: 12 s, INR: 0.83, ANA: (++), anti-dsDNA: 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>, AMA: 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>, cANCA: 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>, pANCA: 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> and TRAbs: 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>. The thyroid Doppler-ultrasonography showed that both thyroid lobes were normal size with lobulated borders, excessive heterogenic and decreased echogenic parenchyma, and minimally increased vascularity. On thyroid scintigraphy taken 20 min after intravenous administration of 4 mCi Tc-99m pertechnetate, thyroid gland localization was normal. Activity distribution was relatively homogeneous. Uptake was increased visually. Our differential diagnosis included autoimmune thyroiditis and drug-induced hepatotoxicity. For this reason, methimazol treatment was stopped. Patient’s liver enzyme values turned to normal on follow-up within 15 days . Patient who had no symptoms and normal thyroid hormone profile was advised to be followed up at outpatient clinic.\n\n| Table 1.

Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is difficult to diagnose, and some criteria are needed to make the diagnosis. In 1989, an international consensus was carried out at Paris and some criteria were introduced. Nowadays, CIOMS/RUCAM scale (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences/Roussel Uclof Causolity Assessment Method) is used for assessment  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Hung et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> documented a case of hepatotoxicity induced by methimazole treatment after 5 months of methimazole treatment. In our patient, it was 1 month after the beginning of methimazole treatment. The presences of risk factors for other liver diseases were excluded with clinical history and physical examination in our patient. The presented case had 11 points which was calculated using CIOMS scale, which suggested that methimazole-treatment-induced hepatotoxicity was high probability. The estimated incidence of hepatotoxicity induced by anti-thyroid drugs is 0.1-0.2%; however, actual incidence is unknown. The 25-50% of fulminant hepatic failure cases can be fatal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. A review of the literature has revealed around 22 cases of cholestatic jaundice due to both methimazole and carbimazole treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Thionamide-induced liver damage is an idiosyncratic reaction that can develop at any time, but usually occurs within the first 3 months of treatment. It occurs in about 1% of patients, with a predisposition for women younger than 30 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Methimazole treatment usually causes cholestatic type hepatotoxicity. Mechanism of hepatic injury caused by methimazole is not well known, but an immune mediated injury may play a role 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.

He had a history of renal transplantation when he was 12 years old. He had no history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking and family history of coronary artery disease. He had been diagnosed with FH. He has taken the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin (SANDIMMUN <sup>® </sup> Neoral 25 mg) and mycophenolatmofetil (Cellcept <sup>® </sup> 500 mg) due to renal transplantation and statin (Alvastin <sup>® </sup> 80 mg) due to hyperlipidemia.\n\n【7】His physical examination results showed no abnormalities. Vital findings were within normal range: fever 36.7 °C, blood pressure arterial 110/60 mm Hg with a regular pulse of 74 beats/min, respiration rate 14/min, and saturation with 94%/96% with pulse oximeter. In his physical examination, heart sounds were rhythmic and no additional sound murmur was detected. All peripheral pulses were palpable. Both hemithoraxes participated in respiration equally, and there was no ral-rhonchus. There was no distension, rebound or tenderness in abdomen. In local examination, there was the renal transplantation scar.\n\n【8】On laboratory investigation, cardiac markers were normal; GFR 79 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> (normal range > 60), blood urine nitrogen 20 mg/dL, creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, serum cyclosporin level 77 ng/mL, serum total cholesterol 596 mg/dL (normal range 130 - 200 mg/dL), HDL cholesterol 42 mg/dL (normal range 130 - 200 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol 533 mg/dL (normal range 60 - 130 mg/dL), and triglyceride 106 (normal range 50 - 160 mg/dL) were determined.\n\n【9】An electrocardiogram showed ST-T changes (common ST depression). Echocardiography showed normal ventricular function with no cardiac valve pathology. Coronary angiogram revealed over 75% stenosis at the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) , Cx coronary artery  and right coronary artery .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

RCA lesion. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【13】The patient was referred to cardiovascular surgery clinic for CABG surgery. The immunosuppressive and statin drugs were used until operation day. On-pump CABG surgery (LIMA-LAD, DI, Cx (OMI), and RCA (PD)) was performed. Because of the posssibility of renal failure that led to requirement of hemodialysis and AV fistula, safen vein conduit was preferred instead of radial vein. At the end of the operation, low-dose dopamine (3 µg/kg/dk) and nitroglycerin infusion were given and patient was taken to ICU. Because of the fast-track anesthesia, patient was early extubated. Mobilization on the first postoperative day was achieved. Drains were removed on second postoperative day. After routine CABG follow-up, he was discharged on eighth day postoperatively. The last follow-up was 5 months after the surgery and he was remarkably well.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】CABG is a cardiac surgery procedure which is usually applied over 50 years of age. Although risks and benefits are individualized and depend on surgical technique, cerebrovascular events and renal insufficiency are main complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】FH is a genetic disorder that clinically leads to an increase in plasma cholesterol levels. It increases three- to six-fold in homozygous carriers of FH mutations and two- to three-fold in heterozygous. FH patients often have coronary artery disease at second and third decades of their life; however, a 7-year-old FH patient had CABG as reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Development of atherosclerotic plaque deposition may also occur in the aorta at an early age in patients with FH, as in our case. Therefore, we think that importance of the good examination of the aorta during aortic cannulation in CABG operations should be emphasized in patient with FH. My opinion is that it is getting more value of cannulation in the appropriate area and the side clamping in once at the clean area in the patients that aortic plaque placement is probable just like our case who has aortic soft plaque.\n\n【18】We also thought that in our case, 19-year-old male undergoing renal transplantation, the CABG operation has a higher risk of renal damage compared to the normal individual. In literature, data on the long-term outcomes and risk factors in this population are scarce; however, transient deterioration of graft function has been reported. In our case, as the patient had a history of renal transplantation, and is administered immunosuppressants, he is susceptible to infection or rejection.\n\n【19】In our case, as the patient was in the acute phase after renal transplantation, prevention of rejection was thought to be of the utmost importance. Moreover, the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in open heart surgery causes renal function and levels of immunosuppressants to become unstable. In our case, the particular attention is focused on the method used for administering immunosuppressants to this patient perioperatively. Preoperative immunosuppression which continued until the morning of the surgery was restarted as soon as possible postoperatively. Drugs was administered orally the night after surgery.\n\n【20】Immunosuppressive agents taken until operation day and its starting to take medicine as soon as possible after extubation are good managements for prevention from rejection. Their negative effect on renal function cannot be denied. Attention is paid to hypervolemia and hyperpotassemia in patients undergoing standard on-pump CABG. However, in such patients with kidney transplant and FH, more care should be taken. I think that do not hesitate performing intraoperative ultrafiltration just as we did.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】On-pump CABG can be performed succesfully in patient with renal transplant. However, renal recipients have higher risk of infection and renal damage compared with patients without transplants. In addition, as in our case, FH would affect the clinical outcome negatively.\n\n【23】Our precautions to be taken into consideration to prevent renal damage and infection for the patient with a history of renal transplantation include mediastinal washing, achieving adequate hemostasis, intraoperative ultrafitration, using blood product as little as possible, for protection of infection avoiding unnecessary cautery, and multidisciplinary approach with nephrology department is also important to manage the treatment especially in perioperative period.\n\n【24】I would like to think the sensitivity and close follow-up in standard CABG cases, and it should be applied to the highest level in such patients.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:06:35", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:07:27", "cost": 51.636}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:07:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:06:26"}

Rarely, as in this case, it may be a presenting feature of lung malignancy, even in people whom have never smoked. Medical practitioners should be aware that HPOA is a rare cause of non-resolving limb pain and may exhibit classic or atypical features. This case shows how symptoms of HPOA may respond to treatment of the underlying condition or to more direct therapies and we discuss the current theories regards its causes and treatments.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 70-year-old Caucasian man presented to the accident and emergency department with a first episode of significant left foot pain on standing. He was a lifelong non-smoker with a background of mild asthma, prostatic hypertrophy and depression. Following a medical assessment and podiatry review he was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis and treated with a course of physiotherapy.\n\n【4】Six weeks later he consulted his GP with a persistent non-productive cough, after seeing the local cancer awareness campaigns. Chest radiography revealed a 4 cm pulmonary nodule behind the apex of the heart and bilateral pulmonary nodules. CT showed a large right lower lobe mass with bilateral pulmonary nodules.\n\n【5】At 8 weeks his left foot had become increasingly painful and swollen. This was diagnosed as acute tendonitis and treated with immobilisation of the foot. Further examination showed no lymphadenopathy, clubbing, or pain involving the upper limbs. CT guided lung biopsy confirmed a stage 4 pulmonary adenocarcinoma. At review by the oncologist he was asymptomatic with regards to his chest. However he had an acutely tender and swollen left leg, with pain on weight bearing causing him to be wheelchair bound. Inflammatory markers and bone markers were normal at this point. Referral to orthopaedic surgeons was made to exclude osteomyelitis prior to chemotherapy for the lung malignancy.\n\n【6】Orthopaedic review reported pain on palpation of the left heel and over the ankle joint line, with mild pain in the right foot. Ankle radiography revealed a periosteal reaction in the medial aspect of the distal left tibia  whereas radiography of the left foot showed degenerative changes only . Ultrasound showed significant subcutaneous oedema but no evidence of plantar fasciitis or Achilles tendonitis. An isotope bone scan showed linear increased uptake in the distal cortex of both tibias and some increased uptake in the cortex of the distal femoral shafts bilaterally . The appearance was diagnostic of hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA) affecting both legs secondary to carcinoma of the lung.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

There is also some increased uptake in the cortex of the distal femoral shafts bilaterally. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【8】As biopsy analysis was negative for mutations in the EGFR gene the patient was treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin chemotherapy. Following the first cycle, his leg pain and swelling had greatly improved allowing independent mobilisation. CT imaging after three cycles showed a good partial response. Repeat CT imaging after completion of 6 cycles showed disease progression but he remained free of chest symptoms. However, one month later his HPOA symptoms began to recur.\n\n【9】Docetaxel was elected for second line therapy. This resulted in stabilisation of the lung tumours but did not help to control his HPOA symptoms. However, the symptoms were partially alleviated by a successful trial of octreotide.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA) was first described in 1889 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> and can be split into primary (rare familial autosomal disease) and secondary causes. Secondary HPOA, also known as Pierre Marie-Bamberger syndrome accounts for 95% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Classically HPOA presents bilaterally and is described as a clinical triad of digital clubbing, ossifying periostitis of the long bones and arthralgia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. By contrast, this presentation was unilateral, and clubbing was absent, highlighting that other clinical symptoms such as constant pain, oedema and erythema in the extremities, are important diagnostic feature. HPOA is now widely agreed to be a paraneoplastic syndrome occurring in less than 1% of lung cancer patients but has been associated with other causes such as cystic fibrosis, cyanotic heart disease, and GI tract neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It is related to a primary lung cancer in 80% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, and of these over 50% are caused by an adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. HPOA can be a presenting feature and previous case reports have suggested chest radiography in all smokers and ex-smokers who present with synovitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This case demonstrates that it may be a presenting feature in non-smokers with lung cancer, highlighting the importance of routine chest x-ray in clinical assessment of atypical bone pain and synovitis.\n\n【12】Diaphyseal and metaphyseal periostitis is the radiological hallmark of HPOA on plain film, causing periosteal thickening and new bone growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Bone scintigraphy is the investigation of choice, revealing changes earlier and with a higher sensitivity than plain radiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Single-photon emission computed tomography may increase the confidence of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】The cause of HPOA remains poorly understood, but is thought to be due to the production of growth factors, such as growth hormone, oestrogen, adrenocorticotrophin or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by the lung lesion itself, or failure of the normal removal of these factors by pulmonary arteriovenous shunting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 7 , 9 \\]</u>. Shunting is thought to be dominant factor in non-cancerous lesions but may also play a role in lung cancers due to intratumour shunting. There is growing evidence that VEGF may play a central role in HPOA. Firstly, it is a powerful endothelial cell-stimulator factor and VEGF receptors are found in subperiosteal bone cells. Secondly, elevated levels have been found in many diseases associated with HPOA and it is known to be produced by many tumours as well as in response to hypoxia. Finally, VEGF is a platelet derived factor and platelet dysfunction in arteriovenous shunting is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of HPOA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Treatment of the lung condition, as in this case, is hypothesised to exert its effect by the reduction in the number of cells producing endogenous growth factor, although the degree of response to treatment is sometimes incomplete or absent. There is evidence that cisplatin and other chemotherapy agents such as doxorubicin directly reduce VEGF transcription in both hypoxic situations and at baseline levels suggesting an alternative pathway for the action of chemotherapy on HPOA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In contrast, docetaxel has not been shown to have any action on VEGF transcription 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, and the failure to provide symptomatic relief in this case may be a reflection of the lack of action on transcription in addition to failure to reduce tumour bulk.\n\n【15】The successful use of octreotide to provide pain relief in HPOA was first described by Johnson et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> in 1997 in a case of bronchial squamous cell carcinoma, but has since been reported in other causes of HPOA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The mechanism of octreotide is yet to be fully elucidated. It may have an intrinsic non-opioid analgesic effect or be related to the inhibition of an unknown hormone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. However more recently somatostatin analogues including octreotide have been shown to inhibit the production of VEGF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.

The resulting aganglionic segment of the colon fails to relax, causing a functional obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

The patient was surgically managed by subtotal colectomy with ileo-rectal anastomosis with an uneventful hospital course and was safely discharged. On present admission, one month later, he returned with three episodes of projectile vomiting of food and bilious material. Review of systems was positive for constipation, chronic in nature for our subject, as well as nausea. Abdominal X-ray showed distended bowel loops with a non-specific pattern, given the patient's history a CT scan of the abdomen with oral contrast was pursued , which showed massive dilation of the remaining rectum and Ileal loops filled with impacted stool. He was managed conservatively with rectal tube decompression of the bowel as well as an aggressive bowel regimen. The patient's presentation and imagery prompted us to review the literature and begin a workup for possible adult presentation of Hirschsprung Disease. Ano-rectal manometry demonstrated an absent recto-anal inhibitory reflex. From these suggestive findings we proceeded to perform a full thickness mucosal biopsy of the patient's remaining rectal mucosa, the gold standard diagnostic tool for HD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, which failed to show aganglionosis of the remaining rectal mucosa, therefore discarding Hirschsprung of our differential diagnoses.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Severely dilated rectum with impacted stool and fluid level. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【6】Our patient was treated symptomatically with an aggressive bowel regimen of stool softeners and bowel laxatives and he was again discharged safely to his skilled nursing facility.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Hirschsprung disease is a rare condition resulting in aganglionosis of the Meissner (submucosal) and Auerbach (myenteric) plexuses of the gut. In the majority of patients, the disorder affects a short segment of the distal colon, with a transition zone in the rectosigmoid colon. This condition was first described by Harald Hirschsprung in 1886 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The majority of patients with HD are diagnosed in the neonatal period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, and though adult onset HD was thought to be rare, Hirschsprung himself had suggested as early as 1900, that the disease was not confined to children and several cases of adult HD have been reported since then 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. About 5% of patients with less severe disease may not be diagnosed until early adulthood, most of them between the second and third decade of life, and are frequently misdiagnosed as chronic constipation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>, these may not be truly diagnosed until an acute presentation with complications such as obstructive colitis, sigmoid volvulus or sub-acute obstructions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Several cases have been diagnosed after presenting with a volvulus of the gut 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>, likely due to an aganglionic segment of gut below the sigmoid colon and a freely mobile mesosigmoid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】The above described clinical vignette in addition to manifest radiologic imagery similar to that described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> prompted the authors to consider Hirschsprung disease in the adult setting for this patient whose most likely problem is rather chronic constipation. Constipation is the most common digestive complaint in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>, with prevalence of 12 to 19 percent (average 15 percent) reported in most studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. It is of utmost importance to recognize and treat chronic constipation in a timely and effective fashion to avoid complications such as the ones described above. This can be especially relevant in patients with pervasive developmental disorders, psychiatric disorders, the elderly, or any other type of patient population which may not be able to express appropriately nor act upon such a common gastrointestinal complaint.\n\n【10】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors state no conflict of interest for the crafting of this manuscript.

Furthermore, lung cancer incidence is rising with adenocarcinoma leading the race with 38.5% of all lung cancers followed by squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.

Afterwards, pleural effusion drainage was done by the Pulmonology Department to relieve the symptoms and he was sent for cytology. Surprisingly, the lung computed tomography (CT) only showed a large left pleural effusion at the time with complete left lung collapse, no obstructive mass was present, and no signs of any lesion was reported . Meanwhile, the pleural effusion cytology showed atypical cells, vacuolated cytoplasm, and prominent nucleoli in a background of macrophages, lymphocytes and blood with suspicion of malignancy. Six weeks later, another pleural tap for a recurrent pleural effusion was performed with the pleural fluid cytology being negative for tumor cells. After complete full body workup, the Pulmonary Department discovered a thyroid nodule and transferred the case to the Otorhinolaryngology with a provisional diagnosis of thyroid nodule due to the progressiveness of hoarseness of voice with lung metastasis.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

A laryngoscopy showed a mobile left vocal cord and an immobile right vocal cord in the paramedian position with excessive pooling of hypopharyngeal secretions, most extensively in the right pyriform fossa. Further investigation of the thyroid showed a normal thyroid function tests (TFT) while a neck CT showed a right vocal cord paralysis with a right thyroid nodule about 1.5 cm  and an upper mediastinal lymph node enlargement at the right tracheoesophageal groove that was causing the nerve irritation . Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the thyroid nodule was performed and was negative. The patient’s hoarseness with the plural effusion was suspected to be related to a primary thyroid malignancy as primary source with possible lung metastasis.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

The mass effect at the right tracheoesophageal groove (arrow). |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【8】Subsequently, it was decided to perform a right hemi-thyroidectomy with frozen section and a possible total thyroidectomy with neck dissection for further evaluation of the hoarseness and plural effusion cause. As a part of the pre-operative evaluation, the cardiothoracic team evaluated the patient and a CT chest was requested to be repeated. It demonstrated a left hilar mass with obstruction of the left upper lobe bronchus and lung collapse with two suspicious pulmonary nodules at the lateral segment of the left lower lobe with no other lesions seen at the time which were not visible in the previous CT . According to the CT, the thoracic surgeon decided to do a flexible bronchoscopy with a possible biopsy from the left hilar mass concurrently with the right hemi-thyroidectomy. Even though a hemi-thyroidectomy was planned, the patient eventually underwent a total thyroidectomy with paratracheal lymph node biopsy without complications. The flexible bronchoscopy showed a completely obstructed left upper lobe by a mass with erythematous changes and white deposit on the entry. Multiple biopsies were taken, and bronchial washing was obtained and sent for cytology and histopathology. Post-operatively, he was started on levothyroxine 50 µg with follow-up TFTs and a review of the pathology specimens at a later follow-up. His post-operative course was uneventful and he was discharged home without any complications. Later, the pathology report indicated the presence of lung adenocarcinoma from the left upper bronchus aspirate and metastatic lung adenocarcinoma was noted in the thyroid and lymph node specimens. The case was discussed by the tumor board for a further follow-up CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis to check for other metastatic lesions followed by cardiothoracic assessment of the lung adenocarcinoma. Unfortunately, the patient was not able to be followed up later by the cardiothoracic team as he had passed away.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】The majority of malignant thyroid nodules are primary malignancies with only 1.4-3% being due to metastasis to the thyroid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Milovanovic et al described in the autopsies of 175 bodies the pattern of metastases of lung carcinoma that included liver, adrenal glands and bones as the most common form of metastasis from lung carcinoma while thyroid lesions were the least likely to occur with a rate of 1.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Del Ciello et al reported that 90% of the overall lung carcinoma was missed on chest X-ray, 5% were missed on CT scans and 5% were missed during other investigational modalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Such errors were categorized as observer error, and mainly found in cases where only one clinician is responsible for reporting the lesion. The second cause is related to the lesion characteristics, which was the most probable in our case, as 29% of lung lesions with a diameter less than 10 mm were undetectable with different studies reporting even larger diameters being missed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\- 13 \\]</u>. Lastly, the third reason for reporting errors according to Del Ciello et al is due to technicalities, whether it is picture quality or patient position 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Regardless, suspicion of thyroid malignancy is usually high with the presence of local symptoms, such as hoarseness of voice and choking spells, especially in cases of medullary carcinoma where the metastasis spreads to the lung as it is the third most common site of metastasis with 33% rate in such cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Therefore, inconclusive cytological pleural fluid analysis for such cases with no findings of a mass on the CT scan warrants further investigations. For example, Kaur et al reported that immunohistochemistry investigation of nuclear thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) with cytoplasmic positivity for cytokeratin-7 (CK7) can diagnose up to 71% of lung adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. In another case of metastatic thyroid cancer from non-small cell lung carcinoma, an immunohistochemistry of the fluid from the FNA of the thyroid showed positive TFF-1 with negative thyroglobulin which supports the diagnosis of a primary lung carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Conclusions\n\n【12】Thyroid metastatic lesions from lung adenocarcinoma are very rare and may occur in any smoker. Proper evaluation and investigation should be done thoroughly to pleural fluid and the thyroid aspirate as well as immunohistochemistry investigation to differentiate thyroid metastasis causes and not confuse it as a primary source of malignancy even in the cases where no presenting mass outside the site of the thyroid tumor is found.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the patient’s family to report the case.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MS, MR, SA, AA and MA contributed to data collection, writing, proofreading and final editing of this report.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Data Availability</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All the data supporting this report can be found in the text of the manuscript.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:36:41", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:36:49", "cost": 8.143}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:36:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:36:32"}

It has only been recognized since the last decade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Many encephalitis cases that were previously thought of as idiopathic or psychiatric in nature may have been due to the anti-NMDAR antibody 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. NMDA receptors are important in transmission of impulses at the synapse. Anti-NMDAR antibodies are IgG antibodies against the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor, and it results in a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms. It is often associated with an ovarian tumor, specifically teratomas. Treatment is by tumor removal and immunosuppression. Recovery is variable and can be prolonged, with episodes of relapse. We report four cases of anti-NMDAR encephalitis at a tertiary hospital in Singapore.\n\n【2】Case Reports\n\n【3】Case 1\n\n【4】A 22-year-old Indian woman presented with acute onset of bizarre behavior at work for 2 days. She was talking to herself, singing and dancing in her workplace. She was initially sent to a major psychiatric hospital for presumed psychosis, stabilized with intramuscular haloperidol and oral olanzapine, and transferred to a tertiary hospital to investigate for organic causes of her altered mental state. Two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms, she had a fever of 40 °C associated with headache, for which she saw the general practitioner and was given symptomatic treatment. She had no nausea, vomiting, photophobia or neck stiffness then, and recovered with symptomatic treatment only. On examination, her temperature was 36.7 °C, blood pressure was 129/77 mm Hg and heart rate was 93 beats per minute. She refused to open her eyes, does not respond to calling, and was moving all four limbs spontaneously, albeit randomly. There was no other neurological deficit.\n\n【5】Her full blood count, electrolytes, liver panel, and thyroid function tests were unremarkable. An urgent brain CT did not detect any abnormality. In view of her recent history of fever, she was started on empirical antibiotics (intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin) and antiviral (intravenous acyclovir). Serological tests for cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, herpes simplex, varicella zoster, measles, mumps, HIV, syphilis and hepatitis screen were negative, as were blood and urine cultures. Lumbar puncture yielded clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and CSF microscopy, culture, cytology and infection screen were negative. Brain MRI under sedation was normal as well.\n\n【6】Her behavior deteriorated in the high dependency ward. She had episodes of loud and incoherent talking and laughing to herself, outbursts of shouting and physical violence at the nurses, and non-purposeful movement. She developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures, extension of her neck and all four limbs, and uprolling of her eyes, requiring intravenous diazepam. Electroencephalography (EEG) showed seizure activity in the left temporal lobe, and she was put on intravenous levetiracetam, phenytoin and oral topiramate.\n\n【7】A panel of antibodies was sent, including anti-NMDAR, anti-VGKC, anti-GAD and paraneoplastic antibodies (Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, amphihysin and PNMA2/TA). Anti-NMDAR returned as positive, with a titer of 1:100 in serum and 1:10 in CSF. Intravenous methylprednisolone was given for a total of 5 days. CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis was performed to look for a teratoma; it reported the ovaries to be normal and no other pathology. There was no improvement of her neuropsychiatric status after 5 days of methylprednisolone, despite decrease in serum anti-NMDAR titer to 1:32. Transabdominal and transrectal ultrasound was done (patient was virgo intacta) and showed a left ovarian cyst 51 × 51 × 44 mm with 16 mm echogenic area and few fine striations. Impression was a benign cystic teratoma. Ovarian tumor markers were normal.\n\n【8】She underwent a laparotomy ovarian cystectomy on the 37th day from first onset of symptoms. Intraoperatively, the left ovary was enlarged with a normal appearance externally; a 2 cm dermoid cyst was apparent only upon incision and exploration of the ovary. Care was taken to avoid spillage of the cyst contents. Frozen section returned as mature teratoma. The right ovary was incised and explored and no cyst was found.\n\n【9】Postoperatively she was given routine analgesia and low molecular weight heparins for thromboprophylaxis. She had notable improvement within a few days: no seizures, no outbursts of aggressive behavior, transiently opens of eyes to calling. On the fifth day postoperation, she could respond to commands by squeezing fingers, wriggling of her toes, nodding and shaking her head. By 1 week postoperation, she could say her name and birthday, and could recognize her mother, and by 2 weeks, she could speak to her family and colleagues. However, she still had occasional abnormal behavior such as sitting on the floor during a physiotherapy session.\n\n【10】She was discharged home with her mother as caregiver. Final histology report showed a 1 mm focus of immature glial tissue and neuroepithelium, consistent with a grade 1 immature teratoma, stage 1. A multidisciplinary tumor board reviewed her case and recommended surveillance. By 6 weeks postoperation, she had no significant cognitive impairment and was back to her usual self. However, there was subtle difficulty in learning new information and she needed repeated exposures to learn. By 6 months postoperation, she had no more memory difficulties, and ultrasound pelvis showed normal ovaries.\n\n【11】Case 2\n\n【12】This is a 31-year-old Filipino female with no history of medical or psychiatric problems. She has a boyfriend of 4 years and a sister with her in Singapore.\n\n【13】She presented with 1-day history of abnormal behavior at work. She had incoherent speech, and was shouting loudly at patients and colleagues. She also had visual and auditory hallucinations as she talked of seeing computers and hearing strange sounds. On examination, she was agitated and restless. She had a temperature of 37 °C, blood pressure of 130/85 mm Hg and heart rate of 96 beats per minute. Her boyfriend who accompanied her reported altered behavior the night before. She was sending him incoherent text messages, at times total gibberish. He called her to ask if she had been drinking, but she seemed normal and relevant on the phone. However, subsequently she continued to send him messages that did not make sense.\n\n【14】She was given intramuscular midazolam and haloperidol to stabilize her in the emergency department and was admitted to the neurology ward. She developed seizures in the ward requiring benzodiazepine. There were frequent episodes of dyskinesia and purposeless movement, which resulted in her being restrained and sedated with phenytoin. Full septic workup, toxicology screen and infectious disease screen were negative. Full blood count, electrolytes, renal, liver and thyroid panels were normal. CT and MRI scans of the brain parenchyma and blood vessels were normal. Lumbar puncture was negative for infection and raised pressure. CSF histology showed T cell predominant activated lymphoid yield. EEG showed moderately severe diffuse encephalopathy.\n\n【15】Paraneoplastic antibody panel was sent, and anti-NMDAR was detected in both the serum and CSF, at titers of 1:32 and 1:100, respectively. CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis reported normal ovaries and no other pathology. Dedicated transvaginal ultrasound showed a 1 cm echogenic area in the right ovary, suspicious for a dermoid cyst. The uterus and left ovary were normal. Her case was discussed with the consultant gynecologist and it was decided for laparotomy exploration of bilateral ovaries. She was started on intravenous methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and she underwent the surgery 8 days from onset of symptoms. Intraoperatively, both ovaries were bisected with cold knife, and examined systematically for cysts. A 1 cm cyst was found in her right ovary. Frozen section returned as mature cystic teratoma.\n\n【16】Postoperatively, there was no significant change in her neuropsychiatric status. She remained intubated in the intensive care unit. A tracheostomy was created in view of prolonged intubation. She continued to have seizure episodes, which needed maintenance midazolam, levetiracetam and phenytoin infusions. Two weeks after operation, she was started on weekly intravenous rituximab, but even then, she had minimal improvement. She had repeat lumbar punctures at 1 and 2 months post-surgery. Anti-NMDAR serum and CSF titer were 1:320 and 1:32 at 1 month, and 1:100 and 1:32 at 2 months. In view of refractory encephalitis and persistence of anti-NMDAR antibody, monthly cyclophosphamide injections were started. She slowly improved to a maximum GCS score of 7, where she can open eyes spontaneously and trace movement with her eyes, and respond to verbal questions by nodding. However, she had relapses and fluctuating GCS levels. Repeat transvaginal ultrasound did not reveal any more dermoid cysts. After 3 months, she was transferred back to a hospital in Philippines at the request of her family.\n\n【17】Final histology was that of a benign cystic teratoma with a single focus of neural tissue. There was difficulty in interpretation of the focus of neural tissue because it was very small; it may be ependymal tissue or immature neural tissue, and if it was the latter then it was a grade 1 tumor owing to its small size and single focus. Meticulous examination of the whole sample did not turn up any more neural tissue.\n\n【18】Case 3\n\n【19】A 26-year-old woman was brought to A&E by her mother because of unresponsiveness to calling and one episode of involuntary jerking of upper limb. Her mother described her as being not herself for 2 days: constantly tearful, eating less and very forgetful. On examination, the patient was generally oriented, but she would get small details wrong. She could tell the time and date, but could not tell the year. She knew she was in hospital, but she gave the name of another hospital. Her temperature was 37.1 °C, blood pressure was 127/82 mm Hg, and pulse was 85 beats per minute. She had no obvious neurological deficit, but had blunted affect: slow to respond, poor eye contact, did not smile, had halting speech with frequent pauses and generally had no facial expressions. She was able to give a coherent history. For the past 2 days, she had been hearing voices at night but unable to discern what they were saying. There were no visual hallucinations but she pictured “bad” images in her head. She felt sad and emotional but she was not sure why she felt that way, and may even suddenly burst into tears. For the past week, she had difficulty in verbalizing and writing down her thoughts, and often spelled words incorrectly, but she was able to understand other people perfectly well. She also had memory impairment, and would forget things that were just heard a few minutes ago.\n\n【20】She had a history of twitching and fasciculations in her fingers and toes for 9 months for which she was managed conservatively. Electromyelography and nerve conduction studies were normal. She also had complaint of secondary amenorrhea for 6 months. Hormonal profile was normal, and ultrasound of pelvis showed a 1.9 × 1.2 × 1.1 cm echogenic avascular focus in the left ovary. Impression was that of either a dermoid cyst or a hemorrhagic cyst. She was given progestogen for withdrawal bleeding and advised to lose weight, as she had a BMI of 32. She had no previous mental or mood disorders, and no family history of psychiatric illness.\n\n【21】The patient had insight and was aware of her symptoms. She was anxious to be admitted and investigated. Blood investigations, septic screen, autoimmune screen and infectious disease screen were normal. CT and MRI scans of the brain were normal. A lumbar puncture was performed with an opening pressure of 10 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O. CSF microscopy revealed more than 2 g/L of protein; CSF culture, cytology and infection screen were normal. She was started on empirical intravenous acyclovir. An EEG showed intermittent slow, irregular activity over the left temporo-parieto-occipital region but no overt seizure activity. Her behavior was generally normal in the ward, even though she appeared quiet and withdrawn. A formal psychiatric referral was made.\n\n【22】Anti-NMDAR antibody returned as positive with a titer of 1:32 in the serum and 1:10 in the CSF. IV methylprednisolone was started and continued for 5 days. Transabdominal and transrectal ultrasound of pelvis showed an enlarged left ovary with an echogenic mass and central cystic area of 3.8 × 2.5 × 2.5 cm, likely a dermoid cyst. The uterus and right ovary were normal, and ovarian tumor markers were not raised. She underwent a laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy on day 7 from onset of symptoms. Intraoperatively a 4 cm dermoid cyst was found in the left ovary and endometriotic spots were present in the pouch of Douglas. The rest of the pelvis was normal. There was inadvertent spillage of the cyst contents during the cystectomy and the specimen was removed in a bag.\n\n【23】She was fed on the day of operation and made an uneventful recovery. There was gradual but noticeable improvement in her memory and speech, and she was discharged on the fourth day postoperation. Final histology showed mature cystic teratoma. Repeat ultrasound done 3 months postoperation showed a non-specific 1.3 × 0.9 × 1.1 cm hyperechoic area in the left ovary with no obvious vascularity. By this time, she had regained normal speech, memory and behavior.\n\n【24】Case 4\n\n【25】A 31-year-old lady presented to another hospital with headache and photophobia. She was diagnosed with meningitis and started on intravenous ceftriaxone, metronidazole and acyclovir. CT scan of the brain showed mildly increased leptomeningeal enhancement in both cerebral hemispheres but no focal rim-enhancing lesion. However, she declined lumbar puncture and discharged against advice after 3 days. She came to our hospital 2 days later with worsening symptoms of headache, photophobia, neck pain, nausea and vomiting. Her temperature was 37.5 °C, blood pressure was 128/74 mm Hg and pulse was 97 beats per minute. On examination, she was lucid but Kernig’s sign was positive. An urgent CT of brain showed similar finding of mild, equivocal leptomeningeal enhancement in the frontal basal regions, with no overt parenchymal lesion. Presumptive diagnosis of partially treated bacterial meningitis was made, with a differential being tuberculous meningitis, and she was restarted on intravenous antibiotics.\n\n【26】Despite IV antibiotics and anti-tuberculous treatment, her condition deteriorated. The next day, she developed bilateral sixth cranial nerve 6 palsies, diplopia and visual hallucinations. The following day, she became restless, uncooperative, and exhibited confused speech. Over the next few days, she became more and more drowsy and unresponsive to commands. MRI of brain showed mild sulcal FLAIR hyperintensity predominantly in bilateral parietal occipital lobes, associated with mild diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, in keeping with submitted history of meningitis. One week after admission, she was prophylactically intubated and transferred to intensive care unit as she became unconscious with a Glasgow coma score of 3.\n\n【27】CSF microscopy showed leukocytosis. Bacterial cultures, Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA, viral tetraplex, neurotrophic virus, herpes simplex virus DNA, Enterococcus RNA, Cryptococcus antigen, cytology, VDRL and fungal cultures were negative in the CSF. EEG was normal. She developed dyskinesia, evidenced by chewing on the endotracheal tube, and dysautonomia, with pulse fluctuating from 45 to 145 beats per minute, long periods of bradycardia at 50 beats per minute, and hyperthermia of 40 °C. She underwent a tracheostomy 1 week after transfer to ICU in anticipation of prolonged intubation.\n\n【28】CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis was performed to rule out paraneoplastic causes, as well as paraneoplastic antibody panel. CT was unremarkable for the pelvic organs, except for a 2 cm corpus luteal cyst in the left ovary. Anti-NMDAR antibodies returned as positive. A transvaginal ultrasound showed normal uterus, a 2 cm left ovarian corpus luteum and an 8.1 × 4.3 × 4.7 cm bilobulated mass with multiple echogenic foci in the right adnexa. Impression was that of a right dermoid cyst.\n\n【29】She was put on intravenous dexamethasone for 2 weeks and IVIG for 1 week, but there was no improvement in her condition. It was then decided for excision of the ovarian tumor. An uncomplicated laparotomy and salpingo-oophorectomy of the right adnexa was performed, 4 weeks after onset of symptoms. Intraoperatively, a 5 cm cyst with solid areas was found in the right ovary. Frozen section returned as benign cyst. There was no ascites, and the uterus and contralateral ovary were normal.\n\n【30】She had a stormy postoperative recovery, complicated by sepsis secondary to pneumonia and urinary candidiasis. There was no improvement in her conscious status initially; she remained unresponsive and was started on second line immunosuppressive agent (rituximab) 2 weeks after the operation. Three weeks after the operation, she started having gradual improvement. First the dyskinesia stopped, then she started responding to verbal stimuli, and subsequently she attempted to sit up in bed. She stayed for a further month in high dependency, and was monitored for another month in the general ward before being transferred to rehabilitation medicine facilities. Oral azathioprine was started and planned to be continued for 2 years as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy.\n\n【31】Final histology returned as grade 2 immature teratoma with intact capsule, containing immature neuroepithelium and neuroglial tissue. She was started on chemotherapy 3 months postoperation, after satisfactory neurological recovery. She completed six cycles of etoposide and cisplatin. At 4 months postoperation, she had recovered fully and at 5 years postoperation, she has had no relapse of her symptoms.\n\n【32】Discussion\n\n【33】Limbic encephalitis is a form of inflammatory encephalitis that affects the limbic system. Many antibodies have been found to cause this condition, and have been commonly associated with tumors of the lung, testis, ovaries, breast and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, hence the term paraneoplastic encephalitis. Anti-NMDAR has been found to be associated with ovarian teratoma. Onset of symptoms is typically abrupt, and they include memory deficit, seizures, dyskinesias and language dysfunction. Severe psychiatric symptoms are common and prominent, including behavioral change, anxiety, hallucinations and schizophrenia. Thus, majority of them are seen at first instance by a psychiatrist, and a smaller proportion are seen initially by the neurologist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Only when neurological symptoms surface such as seizures or dyskinesias are they then referred to the neurologist.\n\n【34】It was noted previously that these patients commonly have a prodromal viral-like illness a few weeks prior to the acute deterioration. A search for infective agents in the blood and CSF in our patients turn out negative. These symptoms could be an immune response to the endogenous antibodies from the ovarian teratoma. Another cause of anti-NMDAR antibodies is post-viral infections, most commonly herpes simplex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In this case, autoantibodies are formed presumably from viral mediated destruction/inflammation of neuronal tissue. Empirical antivirals are often started while investigating the cause.\n\n【35】This condition tends to affect young people, even the pediatric population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In a case series of 100 patients, the median age was 23 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The age range for our patient was from 22 to 31 years . CSF studies, EEG and MRI may have abnormal but non-specific findings. CSF may show leukocytosis, increased protein content or oligoclonal bands. EEG may show slow, disorganized activity or frank seizure activity. MRI FLAIR sequence may show abnormalities in certain brain regions. Definite diagnosis depends on isolation of anti-NMDAR antibody in either serum or CSF. As our case series demonstrates, laboratory and radiological findings may vary in affected individuals.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Comparison of Four Cases |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【37】Antibody titers appear to correlate with severity of symptoms and response to treatment. One study measured serum and CSF titers at pre-treatment phase, immediately post-treatment (treatment consists of unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, methylprednisolone and plasma exchanges), and 3 months post-treatment. They demonstrated that antibody titers decreased with time post-treatment, and CSF titers seem to correlate better with the symptomatology compared to serum titers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In our series, the patient with the mildest symptoms and most rapid recovery also had the lowest antibody titers (case 3). We do not repeat titers routinely post-treatment, except in cases of refractory encephalitis.\n\n【38】The tumors responsible for the symptoms may be very small in size. In our series, two of the teratomas were 1 and 2 cm each. They may be easily missed on imaging. CT scan is often the first line imaging modality to look for ovarian teratomas. However, if a CT scan is negative, we propose that a transvaginal or transrectal ultrasound scan be done. In the three cases where CT of thorax, abdomen and pelvis were performed to look for tumors causing paraneoplastic syndrome, ovarian teratomas were not seen on CT scan, but were subsequently diagnosed on ultrasound. Transrectal or transvaginal ultrasound scans may be superior to CT scans in detecting small ovarian tumors as the proximity of the ultrasound probe to the lesion allows careful and thorough examination of the ovaries. Ovarian teratomas also have a distinct appearance on ultrasound scan allowing them to be easily identified.\n\n【39】The small size of the tumors may make intra-operative recognition difficult. In the two cases with tumors of 1 and 2 cm, the external appearance of the ovary was normal, and the tumor was only found on incision and exploration of the ovary. One study reported bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy of radiologically and macroscopically normal ovaries in a patient refractory to treatment, and found a 0.7 cm mature teratoma on histopathology; the patient subsequently recovered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Ovarian teratomas causing anti-NMDAR encephalitis can occasionally be bilateral 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, so we suggest incising the contralateral ovary, even if it appears outwardly normal. Proper exploration of the ovary includes using palpation to detect small tumors. This will not be possible in laparoscopy. We use cold knife to bisect the ovary instead of diathermy devices. This minimizes thermal damage to the ovary and depletion of the follicular pool. Many of these women are in the childbearing age and future fertility is an important consideration for them. We use absorbable sutures for hemostasis and to reconstruct the ovary, and avoid diathermy coagulation for hemostasis.\n\n【40】In a systematic review of 174 cases of anti-NMDAR encephalitis with ovarian teratomas, 26% were immature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Generally, immature teratomas comprise less than 1% of all teratomas. They are malignant tumors and require proper surgical staging. Inadvertent spillage of cyst contents and dissemination of a potentially malignant tumor is also a concern. In view of the high incidence of immature tumors in this condition and the severe consequences of not removing even a small focus of tumor, we propose that laparotomy be the mainstay of treatment rather than laparoscopy. In our series, three out of four patients had immature teratoma. An alternative approach would be to do a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. This would avoid spillage of cyst contents and can be performed laparoscopically. However, most of these patients are young and conservation of ovarian tissue would be an important consideration. The risks and benefits of cystectomy versus salpingo-oophorectomy should be discussed in detail with the patient.\n\n【41】Our experience with frozen section in these cases has been unsatisfactory. The advantage of frozen section is twofold: it allows us to offer ovarian conserving surgery, and if frozen section returns as malignant, it allows us to do a staging procedure at the same instance without needing to undergo a second operation. However, in all our cases, the final histology was discordant with the initial frozen section. This could be due to the small size of the immature component; in our first two cases, the foci of immature neurotissue were 1 mm or less. One of our patients had to undergo adjunctive chemotherapy. More evidence is needed before frozen section can be recommended or discouraged in these cases.\n\n【42】Treatment of this condition includes excision of the ovarian teratoma and immunosuppressive therapy. Tumor removal in combination with immunosuppressive therapy results in better and more rapid recovery compared to immunosuppression alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In two of our cases, pre-operative intravenous methylprednisolone over at least 5 days did not elicit any improvement. The patients only started recovery after excision of the tumor. Recovery may be prolonged and recurrences have been documented, hence long-term follow-up is necessary. It is notable that three of our four patients made a full recovery. The remaining patient showed clinical improvement but had residual neurological deficits at the time when she was transferred to another institution.\n\n【43】Conclusion\n\n【44】Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is a rare cause of profound neuropsychiatric symptoms. Diagnosis is by isolation of anti-NMDAR antibodies in the serum or CSF and ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality to look for ovarian teratomas. We suggest laparotomy, ovarian cystectomy and proper exploration of bilateral ovaries in young patients. In older patients where fertility is not an issue, unilateral or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy should be considered. We believe laparotomy to be the better approach in most of these women compared to laparoscopy, as a significant proportion of these tumors have immature elements and are, hence, malignant. Laparotomy also allows careful palpation of the ovaries as complete removal of even small teratomas is the key to eventual recovery of these patients. Awareness of this entity is essential to ensure that a search for ovarian teratomas is performed and timely surgery, an important aspect of the treatment, is carried out.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:12:58", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:13:25", "cost": 26.224}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:56", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:13:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:12:49"}

Child was endotracheal intubation shortly after birth and maintained on mechanical ventilation throughout evolution to date November 23, 2012, when it was referred to a case. Three blood cultures were negative and that was evidenced Stahylococcus epidermidis, with 16 days of life. For evaluation, 12 blood samples to perform complete blood counts, and 10 of them showed leukocytosis ranging from 12,100 to 43,560/mm <sup>3 </sup> and most with bastonetose.\n\n【10】Of the 12 CBCs, 4 had thrombocytopenia smaller than 100,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> and 4 with platelets less than 142,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> and above 100,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> .

In the evolution of the child she developed cholestasis, jaundice becoming well and the levels of total and direct bilirubin were respectively: Day 08/11/2012: 15.58 mg% and 12.36 mg%. Day 9/11/2012 despite negative serology for cytomegalovirus, was conducted PCR (polymerase chain reaction) of urine specimen which was identified genomic sequences of CMV (cytomegalovirus). From the result of the PCR was started treatment with ganciclovir at a dose of 5.0 mg/kg/day on 12/11/2012, due to clinical severity. After this period the patient began to exhibit improved clinical response with reduction of ventilatory parameters and decreased jaundice: BT: 9.88 mg% and BD: 8.04 mg%.

The most common causes of the disease are infections, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and the situation of a newborn patient with cholestasis, one should think of CMV.\n\n【14】The specific treatment for cytomegalovirus is ganciclovir, which is a synthetic nucleoside analogue 2'-Deoxyguanine that inhibits replication of herpes viruses both in vitro and in vivo. It was observed that patients with cholestatic hepatitis have improved levels of direct bilirubin, AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), GGT (Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase) and ALP (alkaline phosphatase) using drug.

In these cases, six of 15 patients died, and most were reported between 1969 and 1993 when treatment differed from current protocols. Two cases involving patients with large cell anaplastic T-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma mentioned the use of prophylactic antibiotic therapy to guard against infection during the period of immunosuppression with chemotherapy. There were no reports of treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】We report the first case of treatment of CLL in a patient with CF. This patient was successfully treated with bendamustine chemotherapy concomitantly with prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). He obtained a complete remission (CR) without any infectious complications. Following this, he relapsed and was treated to near CR with ibrutinib and monthly IVIG, with manageable infectious complications.\n\n【6】The patient was a 51-year-old male with CF (delta F508 and R117H mutations, 5T allele) diagnosed at the age of 1. His disease course in childhood was asthma-like and he was discharged from CF follow-up until the age of 45 when he had an empyema prompting re-referral to a CF clinic. From a CF perspective, he was colonized with Staphylococcus aureus and Burkholderia multivorans , and had pancreatic insufficiency. He had CF pulmonary exacerbations one to two times per year treated on an outpatient basis with antibiotics. His FEV1 at time of presentation was 1.95 L (50% of expected). Functionally he was not limited. Other medical history included prior hepatitis A infection, chronic sinusitis, cholecystectomy, tonsillectomy, hernia repair, laparoscopic knee arthroscopy, and septoplasty. Medications included symbicort, ventolin, propecia, pancrelipase, and omeprazole. His family history was positive for a brother who passed away from testicular cancer.\n\n【7】He was referred to hematology after incidental lymphocytosis was identified on bloodwork in September 2010. At time of assessment in January 2011, he had no constitutional symptoms or history suggestive of cytopenias. His physical exam demonstrated a palpable liver and spleen 1 cm below the costal margin, and a 1 cm lymph node in the left axilla. His initial laboratory tests demonstrated a hemoglobin of 133 g/L, white blood cell count of 48 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L with a lymphocyte count of 39 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, and a platelet count of 141 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Creatinine was 86 μmol/L. Serum protein electrophoresis was normal. He had hypogammaglobulinemia with an IgG count of 7.14 g/L. Flow cytometry confirmed a diagnosis of CLL with 92% monoclonal B cells positive for CD19, 20, 22, 23, 5, kappa restricted, and negative for CD38. Cytogenetics demonstrated 13q deletion homozygosity, and were negative for the 17p deletion. Additional prognostic testing such as immunoglobulin variable chain mutations was not available.\n\n【8】The patient underwent active surveillance of his CLL and was monitored at 3-month intervals. He remained asymptomatic, with gradual growth of lymphadenopathy, one of which was biopsied and consistent with small lymphocytic lymphoma. Approximately 22 months after his original diagnosis, he developed thrombocytopenia (WBC 225 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, Hgb 122 g/L, and Plts 87 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). Beta-2 microglobulin was 3.1 mg/L. FISH for the IgH/CCND1 marker was negative, thereby ruling out a CD23 mantle cell lymphoma. CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated generalized lymphadenopathy with no conglomerate masses and a spleen size of 22 cm.\n\n【9】First treatment course\n\n【10】With progressive symptomatic lymphadenopathy and declaration of RAI stage IV CLL treatment was initiated. His original cumulative illness rating scale score was 6. Possible treatment regimens considered included fludarabine-based, bendamustine-based, and chlorambucil-based therapies with or without rituximab. He was excluded from clinical trials due to a history of empyema. Due to the infectious risk associated with fludarabine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>, this patient was placed on bendamustine monotherapy for six cycles. Rituximab was not given concurrently, as it was not covered with the government’s or patient’s private insurance plan.\n\n【11】With his progressive cytopenias at time of initiation of treatment (WBC 431 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> g/L, Hgb 89 g/L, and Plts 38 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), the patient received six total cycles of dose-reduced bendamustine which was slowly uptitrated to full dose, prophylactic antibiotics with septra, prophylactic antivirals with acyclovir, and monthly IVIG infusions for infection prophylaxis .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Treatment Protocol |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【13】Overall, the patient tolerated his six cycles of chemotherapy well from a symptomatic and CF perspective. He had no pulmonary exacerbations during his treatment course. Restaging CT scans at the end of six cycles of treatment showed significant interval reduction in the size of his spleen and lymph nodes to ≤ 1.5 cm. His CBC was normal. He achieved a CR for approximately 6 months.\n\n【14】Second treatment course\n\n【15】In January 2015, the patient presented to the hematology clinic with weight loss, night sweats, palpable lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. His laboratory parameters demonstrated an increased WBC 73 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, lymphocytes 64.3 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, Hgb 126 g/L, and Plts 94 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Declaring himself with relapsed CLL, repeat FISH cytogenetics obtained demonstrated 13q deletion and a new 17q deletion. Repeat CT scans revealed interval increase in neck, chest, and abdominal lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and periportal infiltration suspicious for leukemic infiltration, which was later confirmed with ERCP brushings. A lymph node biopsy ruled out the possibility of a Richter’s transformation.\n\n【16】With rapidly progressing CLL and a new 17p deletion clone, he was started immediately on ibrutinib monotherapy at a dose of 420 mg daily with IVIG monthly prophylaxis. Ibrutinib is a novel brunton tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently approved for patients with refractory or relapsed CLL or those with 17p deletion CLL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Within 5 days, the patient noted decreased head and neck lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly.\n\n【17】His treatment course was complicated by hospital admission in March 2015 with ascending cholangitis and enterococcus bacteremia requiring IV piperacillin-tazobactam therapy. Ibrutinib was continued during this time with all lymphadenopathy vanishing within 4 weeks of initiation.\n\n【18】Two months following initiation of ibrutinib in April 2015, he developed increasing green sputum and right-sided chest pain with no chest X-ray infiltrate. He was treated empirically with doxycycline to cover his known colonization with B. multivorans with good effect.\n\n【19】By April 2016, 14 months into treatment, he continued on daily ibrutinib therapy and prophylactic monthly IVIG, with a reduction in lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, and a stable respiratory status from a CF perspective. The patient’s most recent FEV1 was notably above his baseline at 2.06 L (56% predicted). He has sustained no adverse events that are now recognized with ibrutinib such as atrial fibrillation, bleeding and diarrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. His most recent CT imaging 6 months following initiation of ibrutinib shows all lymph nodes measuring < 1.0 cm with a spleen size of 13 cm.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first report of treatment of CLL in a patient with CF. We have shared this case with a view to contribute to the literature in this area. Respirologists and hematologists are often apprehensive to treat patients with CF with chemotherapy due to their inherent immunosuppression, leading to potential delays in treatment.\n\n【22】In this report, we have demonstrated that achieving CR without infectious complications is possible using bendamustine monotherapy, prophylactic antibiotics, and IVIG.

Despite very few trials have been performed during pregnancy to document the potential benefits of herbal products and data on their safety are limited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, many pregnant women use these products for a variety of conditions, often on a self-treatment basis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Echinacea extracts, among the most popular herbals available in the marketplace, exert immunomodulatory, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activity and are currently used for the prevention and treatment of common cold, flu and upper respiratory tract infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Echinacea ingestion during pregnancy is usually considered to be safe, even if there is insufficient knowledge concerning this use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】In this work, we report a case of anhydramnios and IUGR observed after maternal intake for 7 weeks of an herbal product containing Echinacea angustifolia .\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 34-years-old primigravida woman (70 kg, 160 cm) was admitted to the hospital for an emergency caesarean delivery at 35 weeks’ gestation due to anhydramnios and IUGR. The diagnosis was insufficient fetal development, antepartum complications, fetal weight at 5th percentile compared to gestational age.\n\n【7】At admission, laboratory investigations revealed normal haemoglobin and haematocrit values (10.4 g/dL and 32.9 mg/dL respectively). Platelet count, white blood cell count, plasma glucose, serum creatinine and liver enzymes were also all within normal limits. She was Rh compatible with the baby’s blood and she had no TORCH infection or chromosome abnormalities (amniocentesis revealed normal karyotype). Before the delivery, an artery Doppler study was performed: the blood-flow velocity measurement of umbilical artery and middle cerebral artery revealed respectively a pulsatility umbilical artery index of 1.08 (60° percentile for gestational age) and a pulsatility middle cerebral artery index of 0.91 (< 5° percentile for gestational age).\n\n【8】The placental histological examination revealed a weight of 270 g, a diameter of 14 × 13 cm, a thickness of 2 cm; an umbilical cord of 38 cm with a diameter of 1.5 cm with two arteries and one umbilical vein inside and covered by Warthon’s jelly. There was no evidence of acute or chronic amnionitis and villitis, but several placental infarctions (about 50%).\n\n【9】During her pregnancy, the diet was equilibrated (protein, lipids, glucides, vitamins) and maternal weight gain was 8 kg.\n\n【10】No risk factor potentially influencing pregnancy emerged from family history. On her maternal side, her father suffered from hypertension.\n\n【11】Before and during her pregnancy, she was a non-smoker and no alcohol drinker. She had no previous spontaneous abortions, she was not affected by a chronic disease (diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, allergies, neurological problems etc.) and throughout pregnancy she had no complication or problem, therefore no drug treatment was necessary. Only an iron supplement was taken.\n\n【12】At her booking visit at 27 weeks’ gestation, clinical examination was unremarkable (ultrasound fetal biometric measurements did not reveal any problem) and her body mass index was normal.\n\n【13】After this visit, she suffered from a chronic cold, therefore she decided to use a phytotherapic product, considering this less toxic than a traditional drug. She bought in a herbalist’s shop a commercial product called “Ekinflu e-82” (Forza Vitale Srl, Naple, Italy) containing hydro-alcoholic extracts of Echinacea angustifolia 0.96 g, devil’s claw 0.85 g and myrrh 0.16 g in association to other herbs in very small amounts (thyme 0.027 g, oregano 0.027 g and garden savory 0.027 g). She took one tablet of the herbal product (2.4 g) every day for 7 weeks, despite indications recommended one tablet three times daily for 1 - 2 weeks. She considered this treatment satisfactory and she did not observe adverse manifestations during the consumption. She did not develop any respiratory compromise with chronic cold and she did not undergo any serologic testing for viral infections such as EBV or adenovirus.\n\n【14】The newborn (birth weight 1,330 g) did not show serious complications at birth (respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocholitis). Suspected neonatal sepsis, hypoglycaemia (relatively common in an IUGR infant) and hyperbilirubinaemia were present and were the cause of hospitalization and prolonged stay in the nursery (for one month).\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】The development of the embryo occurs in close association with and in proximity to capillary ingrowth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The vast majority of cases of fetal growth restriction are the result of ischaemic placental disease, where normal angiogenesis (critically important to ensure adequate blood flow) is altered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】In this report, the development of anhydramnios and IUGR in a preterm newborn after the 27th week of gestation could be correlated with the assumption that an IUGR occurring in third-trimester pregnancy is characterized by impaired blood flows 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. IUGR occurs as a result of a failure of elongation, branching and dilatation of the capillary loops as well as a failure of terminal villi formation. Consequently, feto-placental blood flow is severely impaired and transplacental gas exchange is poor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, it is difficult to explain this on the light of a “physiological” pregnancy where diseases, drug treatments or other risk factors such as smoking and alcohol habits were absent, but overall routine ultrasound made at 27 weeks’ gestation did not reveal any problem. The only event that occurred during pregnancy was a chronic cold treated with regular consumption (for 7 weeks), longer than that recommended, of a herbal product containing Echinacea angustifolia, devil’s claw, myrrh and other herbal extracts in very small amounts. It is reasonable to exclude that the maternal common cold, probably due to an adenovirus, could be involved in the development of this serious IUGR. So, a possible role of these herbs in fetal growth needs to be elucidated.\n\n【18】Given the lack of data on the effects of devil’s claw and myrrh during pregnancy, the use of these herbs is not recommended during this period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In particular, there are no data on the effect of devil’s claw and myrrh on fetal angiogenesis in humans or pregnant animals. This is also true for the other herbs present in small amounts in the herbal product.\n\n【19】Instead, the role of echinacea could be more substantial. The score obtained using the Naranjo probability scale for the assessment of causality was 4 , showing a possible relationship between IUGR and anhydramnios development and echinacea intake for 7 weeks.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Causality Assessment Through the Naranjo Scale |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【21】Short-term use of echinacea is associated with a relatively good safety profile, with a slight risk of transient, reversible, adverse events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 \\]</u>. However, the use of echinacea products during pregnancy should be cautious on the light of the paucity of available data in this area.\n\n【22】Some data seem to indicate that fetal malformations do not occur in relation to the consumption of this herb during pregnancy, while conflicting is its implication on spontaneous abortion. Chow et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> found, in a murine model, a reduction in the number of viable fetuses after a daily consumption of Echinacea purpurea during early pregnancy. One prospective study on the use of different echinacea products at standard doses (from 0.25 to 1 g three times daily as tablets or tinctures for 5 to 7 days) during human pregnancy showed no statistically significant difference in spontaneous abortions or malformations between users and non-users, but a virtual doubling in the number of spontaneous abortions was observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. So, this study is not sufficient to document the safety of echinacea in pregnancy, since the herb was taken at a standard dosage (usually 1 g daily of dried herb is indicated) but overall for a too short period (5 - 7 days of treatment) to affect pregnancy outcome.\n\n【23】More interestingly in relation to our case, some experimental murine models suggest that echinacea products may influence fetal angiogenesis and then promote fetal growth restriction. Some authors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> suggested that the most important mechanism influencing fetal development in case of Echinacea sp. intake by pregnant mice might be its influence on angiogenic activity and pro-angiogenic cytokines content in developing tissues: in pregnant mice a highly statistically significant decrease in VEGF and bFGF (the most potential angiogenesis promoters) concentrations was observed in fetal tissues, suggesting that this may lead to a decrease in the angiogenic activity and therefore to developmental abnormalities such as fetal growth restriction.\n\n【24】Even if the amount of echinacea contained in the herbal product is considered standard for humans (0.96 g), our woman took the product for a long period with a possible cumulative effect on fetal development (in total 47 g of Echinacea angustifolia in 7 weeks, 0.67 g/kg) and in every case at higher doses compared to those used in experimental murine models 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 \\]</u>. So, if the experimental dose given to mice reduced VEGF and bFGF concentrations significantly, this could have also happened in our woman.\n\n【25】In conclusion, even if it is difficult to demonstrate a clear relationship between echinacea intake and IUGR, it is reasonable to hypothesize an influence of this herb taken for a long period on fetal angiogenesis since our pregnant woman did not show any other factor influencing fetal growth. The ultrasound examination was normal at 27 weeks’ gestation and a temporal correlation undoubtedly exists between prolonged echinacea intake from the 28 weeks’ gestation and the delivery at 35 weeks’ gestation of a preterm newborn with IUGR.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No external sources of funding were obtained for this work.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Declaration of Interest</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors report no conflicts of interest.

The causative agent of this infectious disease is the designated SFTS virus, which belongs to the genus Phlebovirus in the family Bunyaviridae and is carried by ticks ( Haemaphysalis longicornis ). The first case in Japan was reported in 2013, and as of April 27, 2016, 175 cases have been registered at the National Institute of Infectious Disease (Tokyo, Japan), with a mortality rate of 26.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Most patients have acute-onset fever and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia, and typical laboratory findings are thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Although proteinuria is generally detected in more than half of patients with SFTS, the clinical course of proteinuria has not yet been examined in detail.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】We herein present a case of a 68-year-old man who was referred to our hospital for a tick bite accompanied by acute-onset fever and general malaise. He was still being bitten by the tick on the skin of the left lumbar region at the time of his presentation. He obtained a bamboo shoot from a nearby bamboo grove 4 days before admission. General malaise, such as tired muscles, had developed 2 days before admission. On the day before hospitalization, he visited a nearby clinic with a high fever of 38.2 °C and nausea in addition to malaise. Gastroenteritis was suspected and, thus, he was prescribed stomach medicine. On the morning of his visit to our hospital, he noticed while he was defecating that a tick had attached to the skin of the lumbar region. The skin around the stab port of the tick was inflamed. Since the tick had strongly attached to the skin, the skin along with the stab port was incised to remove it. Laboratory data revealed decreases in white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT) counts .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Laboratory Findings on Admission |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【5】He had no previous history of major diseases and no blood cell abnormalities were detected in blood tests when he donated blood 1 month prior to admission. Since leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia in peripheral blood indicated a tick-borne infection such as Japanese spotted fever or SFTS, he was immediately hospitalized. At the time of admission, his consciousness was clear and he was mentally calm. Although he had a slight headache, other meningeal irritation signs such as a stiff neck and Kernig’s sign were negative. The lymph nodes in the neck were not palpated. He did not exhibit erythema, wheal, or petechial rash. On admission, his vital signs were as follows: height, 165 cm; weight, 65 kg; body temperature, 36.1 °C; blood pressure, 129/85 mm Hg; heart rate, 86 beats/min with a regular rhythm; respiratory rate, 14 breaths/min; SpO <sub>2 </sub> 97% (in room air). The administration of minocycline at a dose of 200 mg/day and levofloxacin at 500 mg/day was initiated immediately in anticipation of rickettsial infections such as Japanese spotted fever, which has frequently appeared in southwest Japan. Laboratory findings through the hospitalization course are shown in Table 2 .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 2. Clinical Course of Laboratory Examinations |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【7】Although liver and renal function tests showed no abnormalities at the time of admission, mild liver and renal dysfunctions (Cr 1.11 mg/dL, urine protein 2+) were detected on the third day of admission. WBC (1,500/μL) and PLT (8.9 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> /μL) counts on the third day of admission were lower than those at the time of admission. WBC and PLT counts continued to decrease each day. The lowest WBC and PLT counts were noted on the fifth and eighth days after admission, respectively. Serum levels of creatinine kinase (CK) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) continued to increase after admission, reaching 6,190 and 558 U/L on the seventh day, respectively. On the third day, we reported this suspected case of SFTS infection to a local public health center because SFTS was designated as a category IV infectious disease under the Infectious Disease Control Law in Japan in 2013 . On the fourth day, a definite diagnosis of SFTS was made by RT-PCR from his blood sample in the Tokushima Prefectural Public Health Institute. There is currently no standardized treatment for SFTS. Based on previous findings, severe cases of SFTS may quickly proceed to hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) or multiorgan failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Immediately after being diagnosed, the patient was started on ribavirin at 600 mg daily for a week and methylprednisolone intravenously at 500 mg daily for 3 days. Methylprednisolone was then sequentially administered at 250 mg daily for 2 days and 125 mg daily for 2 days, followed by oral prednisolone .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Clinical course of the patient. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【9】The administration of prednisolone was finished on the 14th day. On the 10th day, he developed an increasingly frustrated feeling, fell into a state of delirium, and removed the peripheral catheter by himself at night. Therefore, a mental intervention by a psychiatrist was initiated. His mental status gradually improved and he became mentally calm on the 14th day. His urinary protein level gradually increased with decreases in the PLT count, and then gradually decreased with the recovery of the PLT count . The time course of his urinary protein level and PLT count revealed that they inversely correlated. After the recovery of the PLT count, his urinary protein level improved to below the detection limit on the 14th day.\n\n【10】Although a qualitative immunochemical examination test of urine using reagent test strips showed a positive urinary occult blood test , the urinary sediments examined under a microscope were within normal range, which is five red blood cells per high power field (RBC/HPF) or less, through the hospitalization course. The time course of variations in CK showed that when his serum CK level acutely increased on the fourth day after admission, the urinary occult blood test became positive, and when his serum CK level subsequently improved to the normal range on the 14th day, the urinary occult blood test became negative . Therefore, a positive urinary occult blood test was attributed to a response to myoglobin, which occasionally appears with muscle damage due to viral infection, is excreted by the kidney, and concentrated in the urine. His serum ferritin level was elevated to 1,258 ng/mL on the fourth day, decreased to 550.7 ng/mL on the 14th day, and then normalized to 108 ng/mL in the follow-up 31 days later. His serum ALT level had returned to within normal range (ALT 20 U/L) in the follow-up 31 days later. Although a blood examination associated with nephritis was performed during hospitalization, there was no obvious abnormality .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 3. Blood Examination Associated With Nephritis |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【12】Since proteinuria was transient and improved without a specific treatment, renal biopsy was not performed. He was discharged on the 14th day with an improved condition and subsequently followed up as an outpatient at our hospital.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】SFTS is generally considered when a patient presents with fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytopenia together with a history of tick exposure in an endemic area. Although all patients with SFTS in Japan have so far occurred in the West, infected areas have gradually been spreading northward. Therefore, people living in infected areas need to take precautions and perform preventive measures against being bitten by an infected tick when gardening or landscaping. A laboratory diagnosis of the SFTS virus is based on a PCR using whole blood or antibody detection in the serum or plasma. In the present case, RT-PCR was performed at a Tokushima health center and a definite diagnosis of SFTS was made. SFTS begins with non-specific prodromal symptoms, including fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, dizziness, and malaise, which persist for approximately 1 week. After prodromal symptoms, patients may develop mucosal hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, multiorgan failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), and central nervous system manifestations such as confusion in severe cases. The present case was suspected of being infected with the SFTS virus at the time of his presentation to our hospital because he had a tick bite in an endemic area and the blood count depression of WBCs and PLTs in blood tests. Patients with SFTS have diverse medical conditions and disease severities. Based on the severity of the SFTS infection, which is generally considered, his medical condition was regarded to be mild to moderate through the hospitalization course. He did not have severe HPS or DIC, and, as a result, did not have prolonged thrombocytopenia or require a PLT transfusion. Therefore, a clear inverse correlation was observed between proteinuria and the PLT count.\n\n【15】There is currently no effective or available antiviral therapy or preventive vaccine against SFTS. Therefore, the main treatment consists of supportive care. Ribavirin, which is used as an antiviral agent to treat hepatitis C, has been reported as an antiviral activity against SFTS in vitro 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, it is not clinically valid when the drug is used as the sole regimen against SFTS infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. On the other hand, combination therapy with ribavirin and other therapeutic agents such as plasma exchange, antibiotics, interferon, and steroids is effective, although evidence for this has only been obtained from a small number of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Under the conditions described above, he was treated with combination therapy with ribavirin (600 mg per day for 1 week) and methyl prednisolone pulse therapy (500 mg per day for 3 days).\n\n【16】A recent study showed that elevated AST, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and CK levels, decreased lymphocyte percentages, and an older age correlated with the death of patients with SFTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Although thrombocytopenia is a key abnormal finding in SFTS, there have been conflicting findings on the relationship between the PLT count and disease severity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. A recent study showed that there was no significant difference in the lowest PLT count during the first week between 32 survival and deceased cases of SFTS in South Korea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Li et al also reported that the PLT counts between both cases were very similar 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. On the other hand, a study in northeast China showed that the lowest PLT count on admission or throughout hospitalization was associated with the severity of SFTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In the present case, his PLT count decreased to the lowest value of 41,000/μL on the eighth day, and, thus, he did not need a PLT transfusion. His PLT count then gradually recovered to within normal limits along with improvements in his clinical symptoms such as headache and muscle pain. An assessment of severity by the PLT count was considered difficult in this case because his clinical course was relatively smooth and his condition was non-life-threatening during hospitalization.\n\n【17】The level of SFTS viremia (viral load) has been reported to correlate with disease severity. Deceased patients had significantly higher viral loads than those of survivors when measured on days 7 - 9 after the onset of fever, and viral loads gradually decreased during the recovery phase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Since the microbiology laboratory of our hospital does not meet the facility criteria for dealing with the SFTS virus, we were unable to measure the viral load. Therefore, the relationship between the viral load and disease severity was not clear in this case. Since he was not complicated by severe HPS or DIC, we speculated that he did not have a markedly high viral load.\n\n【18】Virological and pathological examinations in Japanese patients with SFTS revealed that SFTS virus replicates in blastic cells in the local lymph nodes, but not in the major organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 12 \\]</u>. However, the kidney was not examined in these studies. In an infectious mouse model of SFTS in C57/BL6, viral RNA and histopathological changes were identified in the spleen, liver, and kidney, and viral replication was only detected in the spleen among those organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Although the spleen is the main target organ of the SFTS virus in a mouse model, it differs from the above-described autopsy findings in humans. A pathological examination of the kidney of the mouse model revealed glomerular hypercellularity, mesangial thickening, and the congestion of Bowman’s space. However, the infiltration of inflammatory cells was absent in the kidney. These pathological changes were maximized on the 14th day after infection, and recovered to nearly normal levels on the 28th day. The pathological changes observed in the kidney at the later stage of infection appear to be indicative of acute glomerular nephritis with self-limiting outcomes and are consistent with the clinical course of proteinuria in this case.\n\n【19】In the laboratory testing of patients with SFTS in China, proteinuria and hematuria were detected in 84% and 59% of patients, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Glomerulonephritis associated with several viral infections such as hepatitis B and C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is well known. In terms of its mechanism, glomerular injury may be due to the formation of circulating immune complexes involving viral antigens and antibodies, the formation of in situ antigen-antibody reactions, and autoimmune reactions to glomerular structures induced by the virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>. However, the mechanism of transient proteinuria associated with SFTS viral infections has not yet been investigated.\n\n【20】Dengue virus infection, the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease in tropical and subtropical countries worldwide that is typically accompanied by thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, has been associated with a number of renal disorders from acute renal failure to asymptomatic proteinuria or hematuria. Horvath et al reported that proteinuria was detected in as many as 74% of patients with severe dengue infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 17 \\]</u>. Although severe proteinuria such as nephrotic-range proteinuria is a rare complication in patients with dengue virus infection, there have been a few case reports that are similar to our SFTS case. Hebbal et al described an 8-year-old boy with severe dengue complicated by nephrotic-range proteinuria. Proteinuria and the PLT count inversely correlated, followed by spontaneous resolution with full recovery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Vasanwala et al also reported two Dengue hemorrhagic fever patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria (8.0 - 9.0 g/day) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. These patients did not have hematuria or elevated serum creatinine concentrations, and transient nephrotic-range proteinuria improved without specific treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 18 , 19 \\]</u>. Various types of dengue-associated glomerulonephritis have been reported in humans and mouse models of dengue infection. In most cases, dengue infection and its associated renal disorders are self-limiting. Possible mechanisms causing self-limiting proteinuria have been investigated pathologically and immunologically. Previous studies reported that mesangial proliferation and immune complex deposition are dominant histological features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. Self-limiting proteinuria associated with SFTS virus infection has not yet been examined. Based on the above-described mechanism, the pathogenic mechanism of SFTS-associated glomerulonephritis may also be autoimmune.\n\n【21】A recent study showed that the Dengue virus binds to human PLTs and replicates its viral RNA utilizing their translation mechanism. Since the Dengue virus has positive-sense single-stranded RNA ((+)ssRNA), it is speculated that other positive-sense ssRNA viruses may be similarly propagated within the anucleate cytoplasm of PLTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 21 \\]</u>. On the other hand, the SFTS virus, which belongs to family Bunyaviridae , is a negative-sense ssRNA virus (通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>ssRNA virus), and, thus, it currently remains unclear whether the SFTS virus replicates within the cytoplasm of PLTs. In the SFTS mouse model, the SFTS virus was shown to adhere to PLTs and the adhered PLTs enhanced phagocytosis by macrophages. In addition, the viral RNA of the SFTS virus was detected in the kidney. Although these findings obtained from the mouse model are circumstantial evidence, SFTS-associated glomerulonephritis may be caused by immunological mechanisms in glomerular cells after the SFTS virus has attached to PLTs and been incorporated into macrophages.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】We herein present a case of a 68-year-old man with SFTS accompanied by self-limiting severe proteinuria. Although it is not currently clear how immunological interactions among the virus, PLTs, and immunoglobulins affect the glomerulus or cause proteinuria, our results may contribute to elucidating the pathogenic mechanism of SFTS-associated glomerulonephritis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report showing an inverse correlation between proteinuria and the PLT count in a patient with SFTS.\n\n【24】Consent\n\n【25】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:24:48", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:25:19", "cost": 31.205}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:25:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:24:38"}

These patients were originally described to have critical stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). If untreated, it progresses to anterior myocardial infarction in the majority of the cases. We will present a variant case of Wellens’ syndrome.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】An 87-year-old female was admitted to the hospital for an elective skin grafting procedure by plastic surgery. She had recently fallen and subsequently developed a hematoma in the right lower extremity. Her medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on rivaroxaban), ischemic stroke without any residual deficits and malignant melanoma status post resection and axillary lymph node dissection. The patient had a remote smoking history. The patient denied any history of chest pain. Her admission blood pressure was 192/110 mm Hg. Examination on admission revealed normal S1 and S2 heart sound without any murmurs. The patient had a scar of a sternotomy, but she could not recall what type of surgery she had in the past. Hospital records did not have any information either. Admission electrocardiogram (EKG) showed atrial fibrillation with left axis deviation at heart rate of 84 beats per minute . The patient was admitted to telemetry floor, and her blood pressure was controlled with medications.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Repeat EKG was performed  which showed patient in sinus rhythm with a rate of 75 beats per minute with left axis deviation and T-wave inversions in lead V2 to V6, I and aVL. Less than 1-mm ST-segment depression was seen in V6 and lead I. Troponins were drawn and were negative two times. The patients’ EKG was concerning for Wellens’ syndrome, but the patient did not have a history of chest pain. Due to her risk factors and recent dynamic changes, it was decided that cardiac catheterization should be offered.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

The patient had 60-70% stenosis in mid LAD . Fractional flow reserve (FFR) without adenosine was calculated in the lesion, which was 0.83, and the cutoff used at our institution is 0.9. Hence the decision was made to stent the lesion. Two drug-eluting stents (DESs) were deployed in the lesions , and the patient was started on aspirin and ticagrelor.

Twelve patients out of this group did not undergo coronary revascularization and subsequently developed anterior myocardial infarction within a few weeks’ time. Later on, a larger sample was used (1,260 patients, 180 patients with Wellens EKG findings) and all of the patients who showed these EKG changes were found to have stenosis in the proximal LAD ranging from 50% to 100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The causes of T-wave inversion can be extensive and include coronary ischemia and pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, later stage of pericarditis, myocardial straining following ventricular hypertrophy, bundle branch block, pre-excitation syndrome, and digitalis effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Rhinehardt et al described the following diagnostic criteria for Wellens’ syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>: 1) deeply inverted or biphasic T waves in V2-3 (may extend to V1-6); 2) isoelectric or minimally elevated ST-segment (< 1 mm); 3) no precordial Q waves; 4) preserved precordial R wave progression; 5) a recent history of angina; 6) ECG pattern present in the pain-free state; 7) normal or slightly elevated serum cardiac markers.\n\n【12】Usually, two different patterns of T wave abnormality are seen in Wellen’s syndrome type A and type B. Type A has biphasic T waves with initial positivity and terminal negativity (it was seen in about 25% of the cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Type B has T waves which are deep and symmetrically inverted (it was seen in about 75% of the cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This syndrome was described to represent critical stenosis of the proximal LAD.\n\n【13】Throughout the years, many cases have been reported with typical and atypical features of Wellens’ syndrome. Kardesoglu et al reported a case where the patient had T-wave inversions in the lead II, III and aVF and the EKG changed from type B to type A pattern on serial EKGs. This patient also had the unusual finding that the critical stenosis was in mid LAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Taylor et al reported a case of 65-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder presenting with EKG of type A Wellens but cardiac catheterization showing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Others have tried to diagnose Wellens in the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB). Grautoff presented a case of LBBB and chest pain. Sgarbossa’s criteria were not met, and the patient was admitted for monitoring. Serial EKG showed type A Wellens. The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization showing mid LAD stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Kyaw et al reported an elderly female with throat pain as the presentation of an acute coronary syndrome and EKG findings of Wellens and revealing proximal LAD lesion on catheterization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Some cases of pseudo-Wellens have been described with the use of cocaine and marijuana 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Another case study described a case of Wellens with T-wave changes during the pain episode as well as the pain-free periods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The case we presented above highlights that there can be variants in Wellens’ syndrome. The patients’ presentation was atypical, and the lesion was in mid LAD instead of the classical proximal LAD lesion. She was admitted to the hospital for an elective procedure of skin grafting by plastic surgery. She did not have any chest pain or angina equivalent. Troponins drawn before catheterization were normal twice. EKG done on admission showed atrial fibrillation with left axis deviation at heart rate of 84 beats per minute. Second EKG done about 14 h later showed patient in sinus rhythm with rate of 75 beats per minute with left axis deviation, T-wave inversions in lead V2 to V6, I and aVL and less than 1-mm ST-segment depression in V6 and lead I. Third EKG was performed about 5 h later which did not show any T-wave inversions. Due to the concern for type B Wellens’ syndrome, the patient was taken for cardiac catheterization which showed two areas of significant stenosis around 60-70% in mid portion of the LAD. Left main coronary artery, left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery had no significant stenosis. FFR calculation being abnormal was a factor in the decision of stenting the lesion.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Wellens’ syndrome is a pattern of T-wave changes in the precordial leads that occurs in a subset of patients with unstable angina signifying stenosis of proximal LAD. It can have an atypical presentation, and our case highlights a patient with EKG characteristics of Wellens’ but stenosis of mid LAD instead of proximal.

AL amyloidosis is the most commonly diagnosed form of cardiac amyloidosis. It is associated with a B-cell dyscrasia and AL amyloid fibrils are composed of fragments of either kappa or lambda monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains. In some patients, overt multiple myeloma may co-exist and is associated with a poorer prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. One or many vital organ systems may be involved (commonly the kidneys, liver, peripheral and autonomic nervous systems and soft tissues). The heart is frequently the predominant organ affected by amyloid deposition and is the sole organ involved in a small proportion of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Although AL amyloidosis typically is viewed as a rare disease, its incidence is similar to that of Hodgkin’s lymphoma or chronic myelogenous leukemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It is estimated to affect 5 - 12 people per million per year, although autopsy studies suggest that the incidence might be higher 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】The condition usually presents as a restrictive cardiomyopathy that leads to death from heart failure in most patients. Diagnosis at early stages of the disease and prompt initiation of therapy are crucial.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 65-year-old Caucasian female was referred to our cardiology clinic with a history of exercise-induced retrosternal pain and dyspnea. She denied any history of smoking or alcohol/drug abuse and was not on any medications. On physical examination, vital signs were normal. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable, in particular no signs of heart failure. Laboratory values on admission revealed elevated inflammatory and cardiac markers. A 12-lead electrocardiography showed a bifascicular block and T-wave inversion in the anterior chest wall leads . A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global left ventricular systolic function, infero-lateral apical hypokinesis, impaired relaxation and elevated filling pressures. A coronary angiography was performed which revealed no epicardial coronary artery stenosis .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Therapy was therefore started with diclofenac. Cardiac amyloidosis was also considered; however, the protein electrophoresis was unremarkable, in particular no monoclonal gammopathy.\n\n【9】The follow-up took place 1 month later. The patient was still complaining of exercise-induced pectanginous symptoms. A two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a normal global left ventricular function (EF 58%) with persistence of inferolateral hypokinesis. For further investigation, a cardiac MRI adenosine stress test was carried out. This revealed no indications of myocarditis or myocardial fibrosis. A relevant infarction was excluded. The left ventricular myocardium showed borderline thickening and a detectable endocardial delay in perfusion in almost all sections of the wall . Microvascular dysfunction or cardiac syndrome X was initially postulated and a therapy was started with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blocker.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3. MRI adenosine stress test showing diffuse endocardial perfusion delay. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【11】Over the further course of treatment, the patient suffered relapses resulting in several hospitalizations due to cardiac decompensation. Over time, she developed a severe heart failure. A follow-up revealed an LVEF of 35% with diffuse hypokinesis. Impaired relaxation and elevated filling pressures with restrictive mitral inflow pattern were consistent with severe diastolic dysfunction. Also noted was moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. An additional coronary angiography was carried out. It still revealed normal epicardial coronary arteries with clear slow flow at the level of the intramyocardial vessels (myocardial blush) as a sign of possible microvascular dysfunction. No improvement of the symptoms was achieved in spite of intensification of the anti-ischemic therapy with nicorandil, nebivolol and isosorbide dinitrate.\n\n【12】Right heart catheterization with endomyocardial biopsy was performed during her last hospitalization, which took place about 15 months after the onset of symptoms. In addition to elevated pulmonary arterial pressures, it showed the dip-and-plateau sign noted on right ventricular pressure tracings. The biopsy revealed abundant AL amyloid deposits . The bone marrow biopsy revealed plasma cell infiltration of 70%, leading to the diagnosis of amyloidosis associated with AL kappa multiple myeloma. In addition, the amyloidosis was found to have affected the liver (hepatomegaly), kidneys (proteinuria), joints and soft tissue (macroglossia and suspected carpal tunnel syndrome). There was still no visible M component in the protein electrophoresis, but hypogammaglobulinemia was detected.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 4.

The patient opted for a supportive and palliative care and expired on the 45th day of hospitalization.\n\n【15】The autopsy of the patient revealed kappa-type plasmocytoma with moderate bone marrow infiltration and generalized systemic AL amyloidosis as cause of death .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 5. Postmortem endomyocardial histological samples show abundant interstitial, subendocardial (left) and small artery media (right) deposits of amyloid substance. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】The typical patient with heart failure resulting from AL amyloidosis frequently presents with rapidly progressive signs and symptoms. Progressive dyspnea is common, almost always associated with evidence of elevated right-sided filling pressure. Peripheral edema may be profound, and in late-stage disease, ascites is not uncommon. Weight loss, which is common, may represent the effects of the systemic disease or may be a manifestation of cardiac cachexia. Patients with cardiac amyloidosis may present with chest discomfort. Usually this is not typical of angina and is associated with congestive heart failure. However, typical angina can occur because of involvement of the small vessels of the heart. Characteristic electrocardiogram features include low voltage in the limb leads or loss of anterior forces consistent with anteroseptal infarction. There have been case reports of intramural coronary artery stenosis and obstruction in patients with amyloidosis and concurrent heart failure, angina, or arrhythmias, but many patients with infarct patterns on electrocardiogram do not have major underlying atherosclerotic disease. These infarct patterns may be caused by amyloid-mediated occlusion of smaller intramyocardial arteries. Atrial fibrillation and heart block are also common electrocardiogram findings. When present, symptomatic conduction system disease often follows the onset of congestive heart failure and may require pacemaker placement. Imaging studies may be positive, leading to cardiac catheterization with apparently normal epicardial coronary arteries on coronary angiography. Myocardial flow reserve in such patients is impaired because of the small vessel involvement, and a small but persistent elevation in serum troponin may be present, leading to a misdiagnosis of non-Q-wave infarction. Presumably, the troponin elevation represents ongoing myocyte necrosis and it has been shown to be a negative prognostic factor. Small vessel cardiac amyloid may occur in the absence of wall thickening on the echocardiogram, although there is often a mild elevation of left ventricular filling pressure suggesting diastolic abnormalities of the ventricle. This presentation of amyloidosis is rare; it is seen in only 1-2% of patients with cardiac involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The diagnosis of AL amyloidosis requires demonstration of amyloid in tissue and demonstration of a plasma cell dyscrasia. Tissue amyloid deposits demonstrate apple-green birefringence when stained with Congo red and viewed under polarizing microscopy. Once a tissue diagnosis of amyloidosis has been established, confirmation of AL disease requires demonstration of a plasma cell dyscrasia by a bone marrow biopsy showing predominance of λ- or κ-producing plasma cells or by the presence of a monoclonal light chain in the serum or urine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The recently introduced serum free-light-chain (FLC) assay, a nephelometric immunoassay, has a sensitivity for circulating FLCs that is reportedly > 10-fold that of immunofixation electrophoresis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】The treatment and prognosis of cardiac amyloidosis directly depend on the underlying etiology of amyloid deposition. However, in general calcium channel blockers are contraindicated due to case reports of worsening left ventricular function in patients with cardiac amyloidosis, thought to be related to their negative inotropic effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Beta blockers are often avoided for the same reason 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Digoxin should be used with caution because it is bound extracellularly by amyloid fibrils, which may cause patients with amyloidosis to be “hypersensitive” to its effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. ACE inhibitors or other vasodilating agents are of varying utility depending on the presence or absence of comorbidities such as the nephrotic syndrome or refractory orthostatic hypotension. Pacemakers may be required depending on the degree of conduction system disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Some clinicians also advocate treating patients with warfarin with a goal international normalized ratio of 2.0 - 3.0 because of the higher incidence of intrachamber thrombi seen in cardiac amyloidosis, even in the absence of atrial fibrillation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Several case reports and retrospective cohort studies have described a marginal benefit with the use of internal cardioverter defibrillators in patients with cardiac amyloidosis. Detection of early cardiac involvement and proper identification of patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death due to rapid progressive amyloidosis needs to be defined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】The prognosis for patients with AL amyloidosis is poor. Median survival is 13 months without treatment and can be extended to 17 months with cyclic oral melphalan and prednisone therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. However, such treatment rarely results in complete remission of disease or reversal of end organ dysfunction because of amyloid deposits. Only 5% of patients survive for more than 10 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Recently, high-dose intravenous melphalan has been combined with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation resulting in varying degrees of hematologic response, decreased end-organ dysfunction and prolonged survival in some patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 16 , 17 \\]</u>. High-dose thalidomide and dexamethasone have been tried as well, but few patients are able to tolerate the toxicity of this regimen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Cardiac transplantation has been used in some patients with AL amyloidosis, but long-term survival is less favorable than in patients transplanted for other conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19-22 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】This is an unusual case of cardiac amyloidosis with atypical clinical presentation and negative initial workup for amyloidosis, including serum/urine protein electrophoresis tests. Serum FLC assay was not performed as the index of suspicion for systemic amyloidosis was initially low. Both coronary angiography and CMR imaging showed evidence of microvascular dysfunction. This pattern may be caused by amyloid-mediated occlusion of smaller intramyocardial arteries.\n\n【24】In conclusion, patients with cardiac amyloidosis have very poor survival without therapy. Diagnosis at early stages of the disease and prompt initiation of therapy are crucial. Non-invasive diagnostic methods, such as echocardiography and cardiovascular MRI, are useful for diagnosis in patients with signs and symptoms of progressive heart failure, but some findings are not specific for cardiac amyloid and can be found in other restrictive cardiomyopathies.\n\n【25】A high index of suspicion for systemic amyloidosis warrants obtaining also a serum FLC assay as it can detect circulating FLC with 10-fold greater sensitivity than immunofixation in AL amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Endomyocardial biopsy is the only method by which the presence of cardiac amyloidosis can be directly verified but this method is invasive, expensive and not always available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】A rapid initial therapy mainly with diuretics is usually needed to stabilize patients with congestive heart failure. Conventional heart failure drugs are usually not well tolerated and the long-term benefits are uncertain. Chemotherapeutic agents could delay the progress of the disease and prolong survival in some patients, but rarely result in complete remission or reversal of end organ dysfunction. Cardiac transplantation, although still controversial, should be considered in highly selected cases.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>I would like to give special thanks to Prof. K.

Notably known for its wide range of clinical manifestations, Still’s disease often presents itself by non-remitting systemic signs and symptoms: fever, arthralgia, leucocytosis, marked inflammatory profile, etc.\n\n【2】The diagnosis of AOSD is derived from the application of different sets of clinical diagnostic criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\- 5 \\]</u>.

Yamaguchi Criterion for Adult Onset Still’s Disease\\ |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【4】Other manifestations of the disease may consist in arthritis, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly (especially liver and spleen), etc. Many rare case associations have been described with AOSD: pure red cell aplasia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolytic anemia. However, although many rheumatologic diseases are associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (systemic sclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>, CREST syndrome, systemic lupus erythematous, Sjogren’s syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, rheumatoid arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\- 14 \\]</u>), only a few reports have made a direct link between AOSD and PAH.\n\n【5】The following will present de case of AOSD associated with PAH.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】We present a case of a 36-year-old Vietnamese woman known for a 2-year course of an AOSD with frequent relapses treated with corticosteroids and an immunosuppressant agent (Mycophenolate Mofetil, Cellcept®).\n\n【8】The diagnosis of AOSD was based on the presence of non-remitting systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss) and the presence of 3 major criteria (fever, arthralgia/arthritis, persistent leucocytosis) and 4 of the minor criteria (lymphadenopathy, hepato-splenomegaly, elevated serum hepatic aminotransferases and the absence on multiple occasions of ANA, anti-DNA or RF) from the Yamaguchi criterions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. She did not initially present a salmon-pink rash or a sore throat. The exclusion of multiple systemic, infectious and neoplastic syndromes had been done prior to the establishment of the diagnosis. Of note, the patient often presented levels of ferritin > 100,000 ng/mL during her relapses.\n\n【9】She presented herself at the emergency ward of our university teaching hospital in late 2008 for acute dyspnea.\n\n【10】The patient had been experiencing slight dyspnea on exertion for the past 3 - 4 months. She denied any infectious symptoms and had been compliant with her medication. Two to three days before her hospitalization, she gradually noted an increase in her dyspnea without any other associated symptoms.\n\n【11】Her physical examination revealed a young woman with marked respiratory distress. The patient was tachypneic at a rate of 40/min and had a SaO2 of 80% on room oxygen. Oxygen via facemask was administered and her condition improved greatly. Empiric antibiotics were administered to treat what was thought to be pneumonia.\n\n【12】A ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy and a multibarret thoracic angioscan were performed to rule out a pulmonary embolism and were normal. There were no abnormalities upon reviewing the films. The lung parenchyma was normal. The heart did not display an abnormal left ventricle and pulmonary vessels were normal apart for a dilatation of the pulmonary arteries. To complete the investigation, a transthoracic cardiac sonography was performed. It revealed a normal left ventricle but a severely dilated right heart with a pulmonary artery hypertension, systolic reaching the 73 mmHg + CVP. Also noted was a severe tricuspid insufficiency. A year prior to this cardiac evaluation, the patient had undergone a cardiac sonography. Neither valve dysfunction nor elevated pulmonary artery pressure were noted at that time. The only abnormality was a small pericardial effusion without consequence on the ventricular dynamic.\n\n【13】Over the next few days, her condition stabilized and she was then referred to a specialized clinic of pulmonary artery hypertension. She was again evaluated for possible aetiologies related to her new pulmonary hypertension, but none were found. A repeat thoracic scan showed no abnormal parenchyma, only dilated pulmonary arteries; her right cardiac catheterization showed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 13mmHg and a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 43 (normal < 25 mmHg at rest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\- 18 \\]</u>. A left cardiac catheterization demonstrated a left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) of 15 mmHg. The patient’s final diagnosis was a PAH associated with AOSD.\n\n【14】A treatment with Anakinra, Kineret® had been started on her follow-up visits to try to prevent clinical worsening of her AOSD. She was also to begin treatment for her PAH. Unfortunately, the patient died of a septic shock a few weeks later. The family refused an autopsy.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】We have just portrayed a case of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) in the setting of an adult onset Still’s disease (AOSD). Lack of evidence toward any other etiology makes us believe that this PAH was a direct consequence of Still’s disease. Furthermore, the patient’s PAH developed a few years after the beginning of her AOSD. It is improbable that the patient would be diagnosed with two very uncommon diseases without their being an association between the two pathologies. Thus, idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension (iPAH) is, in our view, not a diagnosis to retain. As mentioned earlier, other causes (classification groups 2 through 5) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 19 \\]</u> of PAH had been excluded .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 2. WHO Classification of Pulmonary Artery Hypertension (PAH) |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【18】No pulmonary venous hypertension was detected on cardiac echography and right heart catheterization showed a normal pulmonary artery occlusive pressure. There was no evidence of left heart dysfunction on the left cardiac catheterization. Multiple contrasts enhanced thoracic scans and pulmonary ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy did not denote the presence of a chronic or acute thromboembolic process. A schistosomiasis infection had also been excluded to rule out a possible Katayama syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u> with a presentation of PAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\- 23 \\]</u>. No parenchymal abnormalities have been seen on all the thoracic scans and a nocturnal saturometry did not correlate with the presence of sleep apnea. No HIV infection or drug abuse was documented.\n\n【19】The diagnosis of group 1 PAH is based on the absence of other known or common causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>. In group 1, collagen tissue diseases are established causes of PAH, scleroderma being the most frequently cited. However, this association does not apply to AOSD. In actual medical literature, it is not a widely recognized etiology of PAH. This could probably be in part due to a weak incidence of both diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. Nonetheless, the association of both pathologies in the same patient must arouse suspicion as too whether it is only an uneventful situation or if there could be a direct causality between the two entities. In recent years, a few papers have made the case for this association 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\- 28 \\]</u>. Only five cases have now been described. This would be the sixth.\n\n【20】The pathologic hallmarks of idiopathic PAH are intimal thickening, media hypertrophy and plexiform lesions. Plexiform lesions are associated with a monoclonal proliferation of endothelial cells in the intralobular arteries of the lung and are associated to some extent with disease severity. On histological examinations, these lesions are also found in PAH associated with connective tissue diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 , 30 \\]</u>. Although many resemblances are found between iPAH and PAH associated with connectivitis, the exact mechanisms of pulmonary artery hypertension in the later are not completely understood. Infiltration of macrophages and T lymphocytes has been observed in the perivascular space of patients with iPAH and PAH induced by scleroderma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. The inflammatory process thus induced with the release of cytokines and growth factors by these cells may contribute to the vascular remodeling seen in these patients. Furthermore, some reports advocate a role of autoimmunity in the pathologic genesis of PAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. Cases of regression of PAH with treatment of the underlying inflammatory process gives more weight to this argument. However, inference of these histo-pathologic mechanisms to AOSD patient’s needs to be addressed with further studies; the main of the scientific data on PAH associated with rheumatic disorders coming from lupus and scleroderma patients.\n\n【21】As for our patient, a treatment of Anakinra had been initiated because of worsening symptoms. A decrease in her inflammatory profile was seen within the first days of the therapy. Within a week, the ferritin level dropped from over 100,000 to nearly 6,000 ng/mL. This is in line with some other reports showing a dramatic response to Anakinra within days of onset of therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>. Other reports show that Anakinra can be effective in treatment-refractory Still’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\- 36 \\]</u>. It would have been informative to observe the evolution of the PAH after a few weeks of treatment with this IL-1 antagonist. However, the patient died of septic shock shortly after the initiation of the Anakinra.\n\n【22】In conclusion, this patient presented a case of severe PAH in the setting of an adult onset Still’s disease. To our knowledge, this is the sixth documented case of such an association. Further studies are needed to better understand the causality between the two entities. We need to better characterize the epidemiologic profile of patients with severe adult onset Still’s disease to determine which patients are at risk of PAH. However, its infrequency may prove to be the major limitation in accomplishing this goal.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No grant support.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 13:33:00", "endTime": "2024/09/19 13:43:15", "cost": 614.786}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 21:43:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 21:32:59"}

During the 3-year follow-up of the case, only a reduction to 4,100 g in the right leg was maintained. Multi-segment bioimpedance showed the progression from subclinical systemic lymphedema to clinical systemic lymphedema throughout the 3-year follow-up, as displayed in Tables 1 , 2 and 3 . At the first evaluation, abnormally high intracellular and extracellular water, total body water as well as water in both lower limbs and one upper limb were found. Lymphedema detected by bioimpedance was found in the right leg. At the second evaluation, the patient had progressed to subclinical systemic lymphedema, with more water in all extremities and the trunk and bilateral lower limb lymphedema detected by bioimpedance. Three years after the original evaluation, multi-segment bioimpedance revealed clinical systemic lymphedema, with the increase in water in all extremities. The patient was instructed to lose weight and maintain treatment for lymphedema.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1.

The increase in intracellular and extracellular water as well as water in the extremities initially called attention to this condition, but there was no knowledge regarding the evolution of such cases. At the second evaluation 1 year later, the patient presented subclinical systemic lymphedema, which progressed to clinical systemic lymphedema at the 3-year evaluation, as determined by multi-segment bioimpedance.\n\n【20】We have been following patients with lipedema and lymphedema for approximately 8 years, after having included multi-segment bioimpedance in the evaluation of patients, but this is the first case of lipedema progressing to systemic lymphedema in a male patient. Obesity is the main aggravating factor of edema in these patients and the prevalence of subclinical systemic lymphedema increases with the increase in BMI.\n\n【21】With regard to the physiopathology of lipedema, the main changes in which we can interfere involve the lymphatic system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Using multi-segment bioimpedance, we have found that obesity is a major aggravating factor, as a higher BMI translates to greater lymphatic harm. Therefore, the main form of treatment for such patients is to address obesity through weight reduction, which is the only way we currently know to reverse this lymphedema and achieve standards of normality or near normality. Patients with lymphedema and obesity who lose weight experience an important reduction in the edema and, without an additional harm to the lymphatic system, can achieve normality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Lipedema is less frequent in men compared to women, but the increase in weight is an aggravating factor in both sexes. This condition initially affects the lower limbs, progressing to subclinical systemic lymphedema, followed by clinical systemic lymphedema determined using multi-segment bioimpedance, demonstrating that edema in patients with lipedema may be systemic.\n\n【23】Lipedema in women may have other aggravating factors such as idiopathic cyclic edema and esthetic cellulitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 \\]</u>. In men, these alterations were not identified. However, it is essential to identify in each patient with lipedema all aggravating factors of the edema and treat each of the pathophysiological aspects involved. However, weight gain is the most serious of all and these are factors that can interfere. Other alterations are described in lipedema of genetic causes, but we cannot interfere. At the moment, weight loss and lymphatic therapy to reduce edema are the main therapeutic bases.\n\n【24】In around 10% of women, the physical aspect of lipedema is detected, but rare in literature in men; as long as they remain thin, the appearance of edema and symptoms is less frequent, a fact that characterizes the lipedema syndrome. Therefore, the patient in the present study has lymphedema and lipedema syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Learning points\n\n【26】Lipedema is less frequent in men compared to women, affects the lower limbs, and can progress to subclinical systemic lymphedema.\n\n【27】Weight gain is one of the most aggravating factors of lipedema.\n\n【28】Lipedema in women may have other aggravating factors such as idiopathic cyclic edema and esthetic cellulitis, but in men, these alterations were not identified.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no financial support or funding for study.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict Interest</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient’s informed consent for publication of this report was obtained.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>JMP Godoy: design, analysis and interpretation of data, data collection, article writing, critical review of the text, statistical analysis, and overall responsibility for the study.

In the report, we will present a case of PGL (a carotid body tumor) that we initially evaluated as a thyroid nodule, and then diagnosed as a PGL.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 74-year-old woman was admitted due to a mass in the right side of neck growing rapidly within the last 1 month. The case reported no complaints of dysphagia or dysphonia. The family history of the case revealed no carcinoma and thyroid disease. While no history of flushing, hypertensive attacks, diarrhea, and other symptoms related to catecholamines hypersecretion was detected, hypertension was present in her personal medical history. She was lack of the history of neck irradiation. Physical examination revealed a hard and painless mass with smooth surface, extending from right thyroid lobe level to angulus mandibula and measuring 8 cm without palpable cervical lymph nodes. Indirect laryngoscopy showed normal mobile vocal cords. Thyroid stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine and free tetraiodothyronine were within normal ranges, and anti-peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies were found to be negative. Ultrasound (US) examination showed two hypoechoic and non-homogeneous nodules deplaced the trachea to left in the right thyroid lobe, one in size of 46 х 37 mm and the other in size of 44 х 38 mm, and a isoechoic nodule in size of 23 х 15 mm in the left thyroid lobe. For 3 nodules, a US-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was performed, and the nodules were reported to be benign. On neck magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) , a mass of 7 х 5.5 cm with intense pathologic contrast, extending from right thyroid lobe level to angulus mandibula, and deplaced larynx and trachea to left was observed. Because of the existence of rapidly growing thyroid nodules in the case, core needle biopsy was performed for the nodules in right thyroid lobe due to suspected thyroid malignancy, and histopathologic findings were found to be consistent with neuroendocrine tumor. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that synaptophisin and chromogranin A were positive, but calcitonin, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and thyroglobulin (Tg) were negative. The level of serum calcitonin was 2.8 pg/mL (normal range 0-11.5 pg/mL), fractionated urinary catecholamine levels were normal, and on positron emission tomography (PET)-computerized tomography (CT), increased 2-\\[fluorine-18\\]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) involvement was observed in thyroid (SUVmax 7.8) and right paratracheal, aortopulmonary, subcarinal and bilateral hilar regions (SUVmax 15.5). The excision of mediastinal lympnodes and bilateral total thyroidectomy were performed. During the surgery, a mass of 4 х 3 cm was seen in the right carotid artery bifurcation and excised. Macroscopically, the mass was encapsulated, yellowish-white and soft. Microscopically, the tumor cells were arranged in well-defined nests (Zellballen) and encircled by a thin layer of S-100 protein and GFAP positive, spindle-shaped sustentacular cells . Tumor cells vary in size and shape, and have a finely granular cytoplasm. The nuclei were round to oval with coarsely granular chromatin with a so-called salt-and-pepper appearance. No definite pleomorphism, necrosis or mitosis was witnessed. In tumor cells, immunohistochemical CD56, synaptophisin , neuron specific enolase (NSE) and chromogranin A  were positive, but calcitonin, TTF-1 and Tg were negative. The proliferation index of Ki-67 was lower than 1%. In light of these findings, the case was diagnosed with PGL, and the histopathologic findings of other thyroid nodules were consistent with colloidal nodules. In addition, the histopathology of mediastinal lymph nodes was evaluated as reactive hyperplasia.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

PGLs are seen at many sites in head and neck areas, including carotid body, jugular-tympanic region and vagus nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Unlike pheochromocytomas, PGLs in head and neck regions are usually non-functioning tumors.\n\n【11】The classic radiographic features are homogeneous or heterogeneous hyper-enhancing soft-tissue mass as shown by CT scan, multiple areas of signal void interspersed with hyperintense foci (salt-and-pepper appearance) within a tumor mass as shown by MRI, and as an intense tumor blush with enlarged feeding arteries by angiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Histopathologically, PGLs have a characteristic growth pattern often referred to as a “zellballen” growth pattern. Tumor cells are predominantly chief cells with round, hyperchromatic nuclei, a dispersed chromatin and abundant granular cytoplasm ranging from eosinophilic to basophilic in color. Neuromelanin pigment may occasionally be seen, and amyloid deposition has also been described in PGLs. Like the pheochromocytes of adrenal pheochromocytomas, tumor cells demonstrate reactivity to chromogranin and synaptophisin stains by immunohistochemical techniques, as well as other markers of neuroendocrine differentiation such as CD56 and NSE. The population of sustentacular cells can usually be identified at the periphery of nests and are thought to be modified Schwann cells and to be spindle-shaped, and can be highlighted with S-100 protein staining.\n\n【13】Among the disorders most easily mistaken for cervical PGLs, particularly those arising within larynx or thyroid, are neuroendocrine carcinomas, such as atypical carcinoids and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\- 15 \\]</u>. Another disorder that may be confused with PGLs is hyalinizing trabecular adenoma, a benign thyroid neoplasm showing a prominent nesting pattern resembling a PGL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 16 , 17 \\]</u>. This rare entity is usually negative for chromogranin and positive for Tg and cytokeratins.\n\n【14】In literature, PGLs are generally reported as slowly growing neck masses without pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 18 \\]</u>. Rarely, they may attain large size and infiltrative growth, and the local recurrence of PGLs may lead to death. Our case was admitted due to a mass growing rapidly in the neck region, and multinodular guatr was determined on US imaging. Although the first FNAB was benign, we performed core needle biopsy due to the suspicion of thyroid malignancy. The fact that the core needle biopsy was consistent with neuroendocrine tumor suggested the likelihood of MTC or an intrathyroidal PGL. The case exhibited a normal level of serum calcitonin, and the negativity of staining with calcitonin decreased MTC likelihood. However, the positivity of synaptophisin and chromogranin A in immunohistochemical staining, and normal levels of urinary catecholamine were evaluated in favor of a non-functional intrathyroidal PGL. Even so, interpreted first as a thyroid nodule on US imaging, a carotid body tumor was observed in the right carotid artery bifurcation during the operation; on the other hand, thyroid histopathology was benign.\n\n【15】FNAB can be performed on numerous occasions to establish a diagnosis of PGLs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\- 24 \\]</u>. However, the exact role of FNAB in the diagnosis of these tumors currently remains controversial. The main concern in performing a pre-operative FNAB on suspected PGLs is the risk of hemorrhage and hematoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 24 \\]</u>. In our case, carotid body tumor suggested the impression of a thyroid nodule, so FNAB was performed, but no complication was seen as a result of biopsy.\n\n【16】Malignancy cannot be determined by cytology or even by histologic findings and can only be defined when the tumor metastasizes to regional lymph nodes or more distant sites. Nuclear pleomorphism, neurovascular invasion, high mitotic index and necrosis have been described in both benign and malignant types of tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In literature, the ratio of proven cervical malignant PGLs is low ranging from 2 to 10% for carotid and vagal body tumors and is less than 2% for laryngeal PGLs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. In our case, the determination of mediastinal lymphadenopathies on PET-CT suggested the likelihood of a malignant PGL; however, no malignancy was encountered in the histopathology of mediastinal lymph nodes.\n\n【17】In conclusion, cervical PGLs are uncommon tumors, so healthcare providers should take the likelihood of PGLs into account in the differential diagnosis of neck masses.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:10:49", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:11:07", "cost": 17.877}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:11:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:10:48"}

However, most intraspinal epidermoid cysts are subdural and extramedullary, and they are rarely found within the spinal cord.

There was no history of trauma or any mediacal procedure on the spine. Clinical (neurological) examination revealed spastic paraparesis with the grade 1 muscle power (Medical Research Council grading scale) on both lower limbs. Sensory examination revealed loss of all sensation below T11-L1 segments. Sacral dermatomal sensations were preserved. Deep tendon reflexes decreased in both lower limbs. MRI study of the thoracic and lumbar spine was performed. An intramedullary cystic mass measuring 16 mm (transverse plane) and 66 mm (cranio-caudal diameter) at the T11-L1 levels was found. The lesion was hypointense on T1-weighted sequence  and hyperintense on T2-weighted sequence. Turbo inversion recovery magnitude (TIRM) sequence, T2 fat sat and T1 fat sat  show minimal peripheral enhancement following intravenous administration of gadoteric acid . The patient underwent T11-L1 laminectomy with removal of the tumor. The slices obtained during histopathology examination showed a fibrous wall lined with stratified cerotic epithelium surrounding a cyst, consistent with an intramedullary epidermoid cyst . After surgical removal of the tumor, the pathology diagnosis confirmed the MRI diagnosis of spinal epidermoid cyst.

They are slow-growing benign tumors, and represent less than 1% of all intraspinal tumors. Epidermoid cysts most commonly occur in the third to fourth decade, and predominantly in men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The vast majority of epidermoid cysts are localized at subdural and extramedullary spaces. Thoracic region is the most favorite site of intramedullary epidermoid cysts and the lumbar region is the next common area of occurence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Histologically, epidermoid cysts have a fibrous wall lined with stratified squamous epithelium surrounding a cyst containing waxy squames 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It can be either congenital or acquired.\n\n【17】As for the epidemiology, the incidence of the epiderrnoid cysts among other intracranial tumors in most of the large series of cases is estimated to be from 0.2% to 1%; in the spinal canal, the incidence is even lower 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Halcrow et al reported a series of 90 intraspinal epidermoid cysts collected from the literature, with 39 being acquired and 51 being congenital. Acquired epidermoid cysts have been found years after single or multiple lumbar spinal punctures and are thought to result from iatrogenic penetration of skin fragments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. It is generally believed that congenital epidermoid cysts originate from displaced ectoderm inclusions arising in early fetal life and may be associated with defective closure of the dural tube 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. In our case, the patient denied the history of trauma or puncture. Also, it is unreasonable to puncture at so high level during usual medical procedures. The old age of symptom onset is less possible for a congenital lesion, except for a very slow-growing lesion. Finally, we have supposed that our case was caused either by a congenital lesion with an extraordinary slow-growing pattern or by subtle trauma event with unaware puncture of the cord. Intramedullary epidermoid cysts showed hypointensity on T1-weighted sequence and hyperintensity on T2-weighted sequence. The margins of the lesions had an irregular or a shaggy appearance possibly because of chronic inflammatory response to the squamous tissue leak through the capsule and variable gliosis along the margin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The inner structure of the intramedullary epidermoid cyst was heterogenous with a high-intensity portion on T2-weighted images. Intravenous injection of gadoteric acid demonstrated peripheral enhancement on T1-weighted images. The acquired cauda equina epidermoid cyst, which is isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, reveales faint peripheral enhancement in the post-contrast images 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Generally, on MRI examination, the epidermoid cysts have heterogeneous hypointense signal on T1-weighted images and hyperintense signal intensity on T2-weighted images with no contrast enhancement or minimal peripheral enhancement following intravenous gadolinium administration (in our case, the periferal enhancement was stronger than usual). The differential diagnosis depends on the signal intensity of the content of the cyst and the enhancement pattern of cyst’s wall. However, because of the similar imaging features, it is not easy to make differential diagnosis between epidermoid cyst, dermoid cyst, ventriculus terminalis and arachnoid cyst on MRI examnination. Dermoid cysts contain mature tissues of ectoderm with predominance of fatty components, characterized by heterogeneous hyperintensity on all sequences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The high signal intensity on T1-weighted images makes the diagnosis easier as a result of the fatty content of the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The ventriculus terminalis, also known as the fifth ventricle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, is a small ependyma-lined cavity in the conus medullaris, and it is usually in continuity with the central canal of the rostral spinal cord 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The ventriculus terminalis is ovoid, smooth-walled and has no internal septum. The intracystic fluid follows the signals of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), characterized by low signal on T1-weighted and high signal on T2-weighted sequences. In the eight (72.7%) of 11 cases the contrast gadoteric acid was administered intravanously.\n\n【19】Epidermoid cysts are generally characterized on MRI images by an important variability of signal intensity among different cases and, sometimes, between the different parts of the same cyst; other features include the absence of edema in surrounding tissue, well-defined limits, and the presence of calcifications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Conclusions\n\n【21】Epidermoid cysts should be included in the differential diagnosis when encountering an intramedullary cystic mass with the abovementioned MRI features.\n\n【22】Complete microsurgical excision is the treatment of choice and complete excision or near total excision of this benign tumor can cure the patient with the expectation of normal life.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:03:39", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:03:59", "cost": 19.306}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:03:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:03:30"}

Following investigations, biliary colic and acute coronary syndrome were excluded. His PD, diagnosed 17 years ago, was managed with selegiline, stalevo, and a self-administered subcutaneous apomorphine pump. Upon admission, he remained febrile and his inflammatory markers were elevated. A chest radiograph demonstrated left basal consolidation and intravenous co-amoxiclav was initially commenced but subsequently switched to intravenous tazocin when blood parameters failed to improve.\n\n【4】During inpatient stay, he continued having intermittent episodes of pyrexia. A previously described back pain, initially attributed to muscular spasm secondary to dyskinesia, had now become severe and constant with lumbar spine tenderness without neurological deficit. Plain films of the spine demonstrated lower thoracic and lumbar scoliosis. An ultrasound followed by a contrast CT abdomen and pelvis, initially undertaken to investigate an episode of coffee ground vomit, demonstrated severe spinal degenerative changes with mild spondylolisthesis at L4-L5.\n\n【5】Blood cultures obtained during admission had isolated Streptococcus intermedius . Following microbiological advice, infective endocarditis and brain abscess were excluded following transthoracic and trans-oesophageal echocardiograms and a CT brain scan. Furthermore, a minimal-preparation CT abdomen and pelvis was performed to exclude liver abscess, which incidentally identified an acute destructive process at T11-T12, highly suggestive of discitis. Subsequent MRI scan demonstrated vertebral body destruction, an epidural collection at T11-T12 and grade 1 spondylolisthesis, in keeping with intervertebral spondylodiscitis .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The patient was treated with intravenous meropenem and gentamicin for 6 weeks followed by oral antibiotics for a further 3 months. A thoracolumbar brace was recommended for stabilization of the spine, but was intolerable due to frequent dyskinesia. Within a few weeks, he improved clinically, his inflammatory markers had normalized, and he continued his rehabilitation at a community hospital achieving preadmission functional state.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Back pain in older people is rarely associated with spondylodiscitis, with the incidence increasing due to spinal surgery, an ageing population, and increased numbers of intravenous drug users and immunocompromised patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Spondylodiscitis, a spinal infection encompassing spondylitis, discitis, and vertebral osteomyelitis, shares a bimodal age distribution peaking at less than 20 years and those aged 50 - 70 years and is twice more common in men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Our patient was male and between 50 and 70 years of age sharing common demographics described in literature.\n\n【10】Due to the high frequency of back pain, insidious onset, and rarity of the disease, early diagnosis of spondylodiscitis is challenging and often completely missed.\n\n【11】Patients present with non-specific symptoms such as back or neck pain, occasional red flag features, and radicular pain radiating to the chest and abdomen, often leading to misdiagnosis and unnecessary investigations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Initially our patient presented with radicular pain and his lower back pain was initially attributed to dyskinesia. Pyrexia is least commonly elicited by patients with spondylodiscitis, with only half of patients eliciting fever in two studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>. However, our patient remained febrile despite being on intravenous tazocin for his chest infection, possibly attributed to his spondylodiscitis.\n\n【12】In pyogenic spondylodiscitis, pathogens commonly enter hematogenously and frequently target the lumbar (58%) and thoracic spine (30%). In our case, spondylodiscitis had targeted the T11-T12 thoracic region. Spondylodiscitis is predominantly caused by Staphylococcus aureus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In a study of 1,368 spondylodiscitis patients, the causative agent was identified in 85% of cases, with 48% attributed to Staphylococcus and only 10% to Streptococcus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Gouliouris and co-workers reported a 5-20% prevalence of streptococci species (viridans type and β-hemolytic streptococci) in pyogenic spondylodiscitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These studies demonstrate that streptococcus, the causative organism in our patient, is an uncommon cause of spondylodiscitis.\n\n【13】Common sources of infection for spondylodiscitis include the genitourinary tract (17%), infective endocarditis (12%), and skin and soft tissue (11%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Infective endocarditis, brain and liver abscesses were excluded in our patient. Furthermore, the self-administered subcutaneous apomorphine pump was the likely source of infection, augmented by difficult handling during dyskinesia and infrequent replacement of needles.\n\n【14】Elevated inflammatory markers have been reported in the majority of spondylodiscitis cases, with levels normalizing following treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Despite intravenous tazocin, inflammatory markers remained persistently elevated in our patient. However, upon alteration to intravenous meropenem and gentamicin, inflammatory markers had normalized within a few weeks.\n\n【15】Due to its high sensitivity (96%), specificity (93%), and accuracy (92%) in delineating anatomical structures, MRI is the modality of choice for identifying spondylodiscitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The MRI scan was diagnostic of spondylodiscitis in our patient as previous radiological investigations failed to accurately assess the anatomical structures within the spinal canal.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】We present an unusual presentation of back pain caused by spondylodiscitis in an elderly gentleman with PD. The patient initially presented with radicular pain followed by low back pain and blood cultures isolated Streptococcus intermedius , an unlikely causative agent in pyogenic spondylodiscitis. Furthermore, we propose the likely source of infection to be the subcutaneous apomorphine pump, augmented by difficult handling due to dyskinesia and infrequent replacement of needles during self-administration. These factors highlight the importance of clinical suspicion, early diagnosis and management of patients with spondylodiscitis in order to prevent disease progression and to achieve restoration of functional activity.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:12:32", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:12:44", "cost": 12.046}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:12:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:12:22"}

The milk lines normally disappear, except in the thoracic region where the normal breast tissue develops. However, when regression of the milk line remnants fails during embryogenesis, the breast tissue develops in the ectopic area. Ectopic breast tissues can also arise outside the milk lines. Ectopic breast tissues have been reported in the axillae and vulva and less commonly in the buttock, neck, face, flank, arms, hips, shoulders, and back 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Van der Putte proposed the normal existence of mammary-like anogenital glands and dismissed the traditional theory of ectopic breast tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. However, this theory seemed not to be universally accepted, with some authors suggesting the presence of both mammary-like glands and ectopic breast tissues in the anogenital region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Atwal et al recently demonstrated a vulval fibroadenoma with adjacent supernumerary breast tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. This finding added further evidence to the existence of ectopic breast tissues in the anogenital region, perhaps in combination with anogenital mammary-like glands.\n\n【3】Here, we describe a case of a vaginal ectopic breast tissue found after normal vaginal delivery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of vaginal ectopic breast tissues.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 30-year-old pregnant woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 37 weeks gestation was referred to our hospital for a Cesarean section because she had a history of laparoscopic right ovarian cystectomy and myomectomy at Sanggye Paik Hospital in Seoul, Korea the previous year. Her operation record showed that she had subserosal myomectomy and ultrasound examination revealed a vertex presentation and placental location at the anterior wall of uterus. Given that the risk of uterine rupture is low in patients who have undergone subserosal myomectomy, we decided to attempt a vaginal delivery. Moreover, she complained that she had recently started experiencing pain in the posterior vaginal wall.\n\n【6】At 38 weeks and 3 days of gestation, she was sent to the delivery room due to complaints of regular abdominal pains and watery vaginal discharge. Labor augmentation was performed with oxytocin, and the patient delivered a healthy male infant, who weighed 3,235 g, by vaginal delivery. In the inner side of the hymen at the median episiotomy site, approximately 2 cm of grayish-brown soft tissue was noted. A clinical provisional diagnosis of inclusion cyst was made. Excision of the cyst was performed. Postoperative histology showed simple or complex glands lined by luminal columnar epithelium surrounded by myoepithelial cells in fibrocellular stroma . Immunohistochemical testing result was positive for CK5, CK6, p63, pancytokeratin, CD10, and progesterone receptor  but negative for CD34 and estrogen receptor. The pathological features were those of breast tissues.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Histologic findings of anogenital mammary-like glands. (A) Simple or complex glands lined by luminal columnar epithelium surrounded by myoepithelial cells in fibrocellular stroma (H&E, × 100).

CD10 (C) and p63 (D) immunostaining was positive in myoepithelial cells. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】The primitive embryological milk line appears in the fifth week of gestation when the embryo is 7 mm in length and extends from the axilla to the medial aspect of the groin. Soon thereafter, the milk line involutes, except in the mid-thoracic region where it forms band-like epidermal thickening and develops as a mammary ridge and then into the breast. Incomplete involution of the mammary streak gives rise to ectopic mammary tissues along the embryonic milk line. Mammary glands are modified sweat glands that develop from the mammary ridges, which extend from the axilla to the groin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Accessory mammary glands occur more frequently in women than in men, and are generally sporadic, although familial forms have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The traditional theory of ectopic breast does not support the presence of the vulvar and perineal ectopic breast tumors as seen in this case. Van der Putte suggested that specialized glands identical to the mammary glands normally exist in the anogenital area and have a close relationship with the eccrine glands. These glands are called mammary-like anogenital glands which are present in the anogenital region and are thought to be adnexal glands similar to mammary glands. Van der Putte’s theory also states that the formation of these lesions does not require the existence of normal breast tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】In 2006, Atwal published a case of previously documented supernumerary mammary tissue-originating vulvar fibroadenoma, describing a lesion that histopathologically mimicked a fibroadenoma with positive estrogenic receptors on immunohistochemistry and with healthy mammary tissues surrounding the lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The presence of ectopic mammary tissue that is characteristically normal and surrounds a lesion, described as fibroadenoma, supports the theory of ectopic mammary tissue and shows that not all fibroadenomas are derived from anogenital glands similar to the breast, as van der Putte confirmed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 10 \\]</u>. Currently, a distinction is made between ectopic breast tissues and mammary-like anogenital glands, which are located at a more medial site proximal to the labia minora. These structures are simpler and present in greater numbers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. However, differentiation between the two entities is very difficult due to their remarkable similarities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The immunohistochemical profile of mammary-like anogenital glands is also very similar to that seen in normal breast tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Given that the tissue, in our case, was found at the posterior vaginal mucosa, just inside the hymenal ring, it more likely originated from mammary-like anogenital glands.\n\n【11】Ectopic breast tissues are subject to hormonal response and undergo physiologic changes, such as enlargement and milk secretion, during pregnancy. In addition, these tissues may develop various pathological changes, such as fibroadenoma, fibrocystic changes, sarcomatous changes, and carcinoma. However, carcinoma secondary to accessory breast tissue is rare, accounting for approximately 0.3% of all breast carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. There is no evidence that these changes are more frequent in accessory breasts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. For vulvovaginal lesions, differential diagnosis includes carcinoma, Bartholin gland disorders, epidermal inclusion cyst, and crural hernia. Excision is recommended for the pathologic confirmation and treatment of vulvovaginal lesions as well as of other lesions in ectopic breast tissues; however, liposuction has also been used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Needle biopsy can be considered for histologic confirmation before excision.\n\n【12】We report the first case of a vaginal ectopic breast tissue in a parturient woman. Differential diagnosis of vaginal lesions should include this entity, especially given that it changes its size cyclically with menstruation and during pregnancy and lactation. The lesion itself should be excised, as this is a general consensus for vulvar and other ectopic breast tissues. No guidelines exist regarding follow-up in these patients in terms of whether to screen for ectopic breast malignancy or recurrence of ectopic tissue. Although the incidence of malignancy or recurrence is quite rare, ectopic breast tissues should also be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially during delivery.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:38:20", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:40:53", "cost": 152.828}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:40:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:38:20"}

No previous history of atrial fibrillation has been reported. She was on clopidogrel, indapamide, captopril, bisoprolol, transdermic nitroglycerine, levodopa/carbidopa and olanzapine. She was admitted because of right hemiparesis and motor aphasia (National Institute Health Stroke Scale Score (NIHSSS) = 6), 50 minutes after symptoms-onset. There was no previous or concomitant history of physical or psychological stress. CT scan on admittance showed no acute ischemic or hemorrhagic lesions. The patient was treated with i.v. t-PA one hour and 30 minutes after symptom-onset. EKG on admittance showed sinus rhythm, ST elevation and negative, symmetric T waves in I, AVL and V2-V6 .

The cerebral MRI performed on the 7th day documented a large acute ischemic lesion in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) and multiple small ischemic lesions in the left MCA and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere . In the same day blood chemistry showed normal cardiac biomarkers. The transesophageal echocardiogram showed no embolic sources and documented left ventricular function and myocardial kinetics normalization, supporting the diagnosis of left ventricle’s transient dysfunction. The remaining tests performed (namely carotid triplex scan and transcranial color coded duplex) were normal. Considering the probable cardioembolic etiology of stroke, and despite normalization of left ventricle’s function, it was decided to start hypocoagulation with warfarin. Regarding complications during admission, transitory hypotension requiring no specific therapeutical measures, during the first five days, has to be mentioned.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

No complications, cardiac or neurologic were observed during the one-year period of follow up. It was decided to stop hypocoagulation after echocardiography reevaluation performed 9 months after discharge, that showed normal left ventricle function and no embolic sources.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】The morphological features documented in the ventriculography, without evidence of coronariopathy, strongly suggest the diagnosis of Takotsubo’s cardiomyopathy. Although early administration of t-PA could be responsible for dissolving some thrombi or emboli, precluding their identification in the coronariography, complete normalization of left ventricle function in a patient with anterior wall myocardial infarction would be unlikely. Furthermore, the contractility changes documented in the ventriculography involved different coronary vascular territories making it improbable. Only multiple vessel embolization could explain this situation and this is also not likely to happen in coronary vessels.\n\n【14】Takotsubo’s cardiomyopathy is a spontaneously reversible condition that most often requires only general support measures. More than 95% of the patients recover completely and recurrence is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 10 \\]</u>. Cardiogenic shock, acute pulmonary edema, pulmonary thromboembolism, cardiac (atrial and ventricular) arrythmias and stroke are the most severe acute complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> and the mortality rate associated with this condition is calculated between 1 and 10%. The pathogenic mechanisms are not completely understood. Proposed mechanisms include diffuse coronary vasospasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>, changes in coronary microvascular function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, catecholamine mediated cardiotoxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, or myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Acute left ventricular dysfunction is a potential mechanism of cardiac embolism. Thrombi formation in left ventricular apex is calculated to happen in about 2.5% of these patients, justifying a 0.8% incidence rate of thromboembolic complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Although, in this particular case report, there was no reference to a preceding physical or emotional stress situation, the past medical history of humor disturbance requiring chronic antidepressants treatment may represent a contributing factor to the cardiomyopathýs development. This hypothesis is strongly supported by documentation of electrocardiographic and cardiac biomarker changes immediately after hospital admission (about two hours after symptoms onset). In fact, it is well known that troponine T levels take about three to four hours to become pathologically increased even in patients with transmural myocardial infarction, therefore corroborating the proposed sequence of events. Data published in a literature review by Yoshimura et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u> in 2008 support this hypothesis. In fact, in most of the reported patients, with stroke preceding the cardiomyopathy documentation, the clinical, laboratorial and especially electrocardiographic manifestations appeared mostly between two and a half hours and twelve days after stroke diagnosis.\n\n【17】The imagiological documentation of ischemic lesions in multiple vascular territories, suggesting and embolic mechanism, is another argument favoring the etiological relation between left ventricular dysfunction and stroke, even if no visible left ventricular thrombi was identified and, especially, in the absence of atrial fibrillation or other embolic sources.\n\n【18】Stroke associated with Takotsubo’s cardiomyopathy is usually severe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. As well as in our case report, more than 30% of all strokes reported in the literature, as a cause or consequence of Takotsubo’s cardiomyopathy, were associated with major neurological deficits (NIHSSS equal or superior to 15). This is true either for anterior or posterior circulation strokes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Another finding reported in the literature, and observed in our patient, is the common presence of ischemic lesions in the insular area in patients with Takotsubo’s cardiomyopathy. This fact has been hypothesized to be of etiological relevance, with insular lesions probably contributing to the development of the cardiomyopathy and justifying the association between both entities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Another finding to be highlighted in our case report is the significant increase in cardiac biomarkers (namely pro-BNP), especially when compared to the usual values reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. This is particularly relevant once it is presently discussed the relation between the magnitude of this increase and the severity of the ventricular dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Regarding the therapeutical approach, and considering the potential risk of embolic events, many authors advocate the use of hypocoagulants, at least until complete normalization of the left ventricular function. The use of these pharmacological agents is mandatory in case of intraventricular thrombus documentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 15 \\]</u>. In our patient, it was decided not to initiate hypocoagulation immediately considering the extension of the ischemic brain lesions and the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Treatment was started by the end of the first week. Considering the potential risk of recurrence and the fact that the patient was bedridden it was decided to maintain warfarin despite complete recovery of the left ventricular function and the absence of intra-cardiac thrombus. This treatment was stopped nine month after discharge after echocardiographic reevaluation and mild functional improvement.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflict of interests related to this manuscript.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:18:23", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:19:04", "cost": 40.972}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:19:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:18:22"}

Following the skin lesions, she developed inflammatory signs on the left ankle with pain in passive and active motion and tenosynovitis involving the left plantar extensors and the right arm flexors. A closer examination of the patient’s hand revealed a necrotic papule with a surrounding rim of erythema at the proximal phalangeal of the third digit. She denied any painful urination, urethral discharge nor genital lesions.

Her partner was referred for counseling and treatment. During 3 months of follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】STIs represent an increasingly relevant public health problem. More than one million STIs are acquired every day, and gonorrhoeae is among the most common STIs worldwide, with an estimated 87 million new cases in 2016 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA), gonorrhoeae is the second most notified STI after chlamydia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The sexually transmitted pathogen N. gonorrhoeae is regarded as being on the way to becoming an untreatable superbug due to emerging AMR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】N. gonorrhoeae is transmitted during vaginal, oral, or anal sex with an infected person, and during childbirth. Urethral infections caused by N. gonorrhoeae among men can produce symptoms that cause them to seek curative treatment soon enough to prevent sequelae. Among women, gonococcal infections are commonly asymptomatic or might not produce recognizable symptoms until complications have occurred, which was the case in our patient. N. gonorrhoeae can spread through the bloodstream resulting in DGI, which occurs only in 0.5% to 3% of patients infected with N. gonorrhoeae . The likelihood of the organism spreading to the joints and other tissues depends upon host, microbial, and possibly immune factors. Presenting signs and symptoms may include fever, chills, malaise, polyarthralgia of small and/or large joints, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis; this panoply of symptoms were present in our patient. Symmetrical polyarthralgia is uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The number of cases is increasing, and the largest increases (> 15 cases/year) were reported by France and Portugal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】As described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 3 \\]</u>, arthritis-dermatitis syndrome corresponds to the classic findings of joint disease (86% of DGI), cutaneous lesions (60% of DGI) and tenosynovitis occurring in unison and is primarily a clinical diagnosis, consistent with the case presented. If untreated, progression to pyogenic septic arthritis occurs in less than a third of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, which did not happen in our patient given the rapid diagnosis and initiation of treatment. The differential diagnosis can include bacterial endocarditis with septic embolization, chronic meningococcemia, erythema multiforme, rat-bite, rickettsial disease, and secondary syphilis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Although pustules are thought to be the result of bacterial embolization, cultures tend to be negative since N. gonorrhoeae is fragile and requires unique conditions to grow. NAAT and cultures from mucosal sites, urine polymerase chain reaction test and biopsy of cutaneous lesions are all plausible diagnostic methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Growing concern for antibiotic resistance in recent decades has presented a new challenge in treating patients with local and DGIs. The majority of clinical isolates are resistant to penicillin, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones; thus, these drugs are no longer recommended for treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Susceptibility testing now focuses on emerging resistance to cephalosporins and azithromycin. Currently, the DGI gold standard treatment is parenteral ceftriaxone (1 g) for a duration of 7 - 14 days alongside with a single dose of azithromycin for combination therapy to reduce the emergence of resistance and treat possible C. trachomatis coinfection, which was the scheme performed in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】We report the case of a 27-year-old woman presenting with DGI. DGI is rare and the presentation with classic triad tenosynovitis, dermatitis, and polyarthralgia without purulent arthritis is even rarer. Diagnosis was confirmed by urine probe NAAT from mucosal and blood cultures, although positive blood cultures are found only in 50% of patients with DGI that present with arthritis-dermatitis syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】It is imperative that healthcare providers are educated on the clinical signs and symptoms of this condition, including its cutaneous and articular manifestations.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent has been signed by the patient.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MDC wrote the manuscript and conducted patient interviews; NZP wrote the manuscript; RM conducted patient interviews and took the skin lesions photo; RVF conducted patient interviews; MO provided Figures 1 , 2 ; All authors reviewed the final manuscript.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:29:30", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:30:11", "cost": 41.54}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:30:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:29:30"}

It is usually detected incidentally by esophagography. As diagnostic techniques for thyroid cancer have become more sensitive, the incidence rates have continued to increase for thyroid cancer in Korean people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Therefore, recently, thyroid ultrasonography (US) examination was widespread in health surveillance in Korea. Many cases of Zenker’s diverticula have been detected because they appeared similar to a thyroid nodule on a US 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\- 8 \\]</u>. Some of Zenker’s diverticula look like microcalcification on US. Therefore, it is important to be able to differentiate between Zenker’s diverticula and malignant thyroid nodules.

The sonographic findings of Zenker’s diverticula can be similar to those of thyroid nodules because the Zenker’s diverticulum is also present at the thyroid level projecting toward the thyroid. Therefore, it is useful to know about the US findings of Zenker’s diverticulum. Lixin et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> proposed four types of US features of that are suggestive of a Zenker’s diverticulum: 1) an isoechoic mass with a hypoechoic rim and internal small, punctuate, echogenic foci; 2) a mass containing a central hyperechoic area associated with a comet-tail artifact; 3) a hyperechoic and heterogeneous mass with stronger echoes anteriorly but no acoustic shadowing or reverberation artifacts; and 4) an oval-shaped mixed nodule with an unclear border and relatively multiple punctuate strong echoes. Our case showed oval-shaped mixed nodule, with unclear border and relatively multiple punctuate strong echoes. Furthermore, it had punctuate microcalcifications similar to those frequently seen in papillary thyroid cancer. Microcalcifications on US are useful for the diagnosis of malignant thyroid nodules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Walts el al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> also suggested clues that are helpful in establishing the diagnosis of Zenker’s diverticulum by ultrasound include the following: 1) changes in sonogram elicited with emptying of the diverticulum by compression or by repositioning the patient during sonography, 2) presence of air fluid levels within the lesion, 3) movement of contents with swallowing, 4) changes in sonographic appearance of the lesion on repeat exam, 5) presence of a multilayered structure suggestive of digestive tract within the border of the nodule. Two previous cases of Zenker’s diverticula diagnosed by ultrasonography had been observed in our center. The lesions of these two cases were located at the posterior medial aspect of the left lobe of the thyroid. This history led us to initially suspect Zenker’s diverticulum in this case. We asked that the patient frequently swallow before US-guided FNA. However, no shape change was observed.\n\n【14】FNA of a Zenker’s diverticulum initially thought to be a thyroid nodule has been very rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\- 12 \\]</u>. Smears of FNA of Zenker’s diverticulum contained combinations of mature squamous cells, associated bacteria (cocci and bacilli), and birefringent material. Our case also showed mature squamous epithelial cells with numerous bacilliform bacteria and some vegetable debris.\n\n【15】Currently, FNA of thyroid is most accurate and cost-effective method for evaluating thyroid nodules and also is associated with minimal complications. However, before aspiration, the cytologist should be aware that Zenker’s diverticulum may be initially misdiagnosed as thyroid nodule, especially when it located posterior medial aspect of the left thyroid gland.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:21:53", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:22:13", "cost": 19.84}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:22:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:21:52"}

It represents approximately 3-7% of all primary bone tumors and 20% of the benign bone neoplasms with a malignant phenotype in 5-10% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 7 \\]</u>. It is most commonly seen in the fourth or fifth decades of life with a slight female predominance with a ratio of 3:2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 8 \\]</u>. Usually it arises in the long bones, such as distal radius and femur and proximal tibia and fibula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Skull is a rare location for GCT, with the sphenoid bone being the most common site followed by the temporal bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>. There are three theories in relation to origin of the GCT: neoplastic, inflammatory and traumatic; none of them has been confirmed in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Histologically, GCT has three cells types: osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells, round mononuclear cells, and spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like mononuclear cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. There is no atypical mitosis, which supports its benign nature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, other tumors are also rich in giant cells such as chondroblastomas, aneurysmal bone cysts and giant-cell reparative granulomas, which makes it difficult to make a correct pathological diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】On the temporal bone, GCT is usually silent growing until attaining a large size before clinical symptoms develop, often delaying the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The symptoms are associated with conductive hearing loss, vertigo, and tinnitus, fullness of ear, otalgia, facial weakness and obstruction of the eustachian tube 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】GCT does not have specific radiological characteristics. On temporal bone CT appears, because of its vascular nature, as an enhancing expanding lytic and destructive lesion, sometimes it shows soap bubble appearance which may extend to adjacent soft tissues, dura mater or intracranial extension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>. MRI images demonstrated an intermediate signal on T1-weighted images and low signal in both T2 and diffusion-weighted images, and heterogeneous enhancement after intravenous contrast administration (gadolinium) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Complete and radical resection is the treatment of choice, but is often difficult in the temporal bone if there is intracranial extension and due to intimate relationship to vital structures and morbidity associated with their sacrifice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. So, adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated, which however, is still controversial because some authors state that it may trigger malignant transformation on residual tumor tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 7 \\]</u>. Chemotherapy could be used in cases of unresectable tumor or when surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity. Denosumab demonstrated efficacy in disease and symptom control of GCT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Bisphosphonates can be used to mitigate bone destruction and prevent local recurrence following surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In our case, adjuvant radiotherapy was not required because the tumor was completely removed by surgery itself.\n\n【15】GCT is benign tumor with a good prognosis after complete resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In case of a partial resection, rates of recurrence increase to 40-60% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It has potential malignant transformation commonly to fibrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, or malignant fibrous histiocytoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 \\]</u>. In nearly 3% of the cases it presents as spontaneous primary malignant tumors with potential to metastasize in about 5-10% of the cases, principally to the lung by hematogenous dissemination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The differential diagnosis includes giant-cell reparative granuloma, both with similar radiographic appearance. In the middle ear lesions we must consider cholesteatomas, paragangliomas and Langerhans cell histiocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】GCT of the temporal bone is an uncommon entity with clinical and radiographic features nonspecific, even with currently available imaging tools, therefore the diagnostic and treatment are challenging. A deep knowledge about clinical, radiologic, and histopathology examinations, benign nature and the probability of malignant transformation, leads to better treatment for each case, always aiming to the complete resection of the tumor and total control of the disease.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>I.

At that time, he had several minutes of syncope, but he had no relevant past medical history. Also, he did not have any noticeable nasal, ocular or facial symptoms. Physical examination of both nasal cavities and the eyes was normal except for eyelid laceration, so he received primary repair of the laceration in the ER. Then, he underwent paranasal CT, and an abnormal finding was detected in his CT scan.

However, if the patient loses consciousness due to the trauma or has an asymptomatic foreign body in the cavities, the exact diagnosis can be delayed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】A CT scan, which demonstrates a foreign body’s location, size, shape and composition, is considered as the most beneficial imaging study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Especially in the case of an injury caused by penetration of the orbit, an imaging study is essential for determining the presence of an intraorbital foreign body and its location. However, identifying the exact location of nonmetallic objects such as those made of wood, plastic or glass on a CT scan is problematic. Therefore, an MRI which gives clear pictures of the soft tissue structures would be a better imaging tool. Therefore, if a foreign body fails to be diagnosed using an X-ray in a patient suspected to have a foreign body and who has a facial injury, MRI would be a useful diagnostic tool for this patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In this case, even though the object, which was suspected to be a foreign body, did not appear on a contrast-enhancing CT scan, we were able to diagnose the foreign body in the orbit and nasal cavities by visualizing an air-filled tubular structure on the CT scan.\n\n【14】In order to give appropriate surgical treatment for a patient with a foreign body, clinicians need to obtain detailed medical information on the foreign body, including its location, size, shape and composition, prior to the operation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Moreover, clinicians need to conduct minimal invasive surgical procedures when removing a foreign body in the orbit, orbital tissue, or nasal cavities. In the case of a patient who has a laceration or fistula, clinicians usually remove any foreign body present through the wound site. In the case of a patient whose laceration has healed, clinicians can remove the foreign body by approaching the region of the laceration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In this case, we attempted to remove the patient’s foreign body by using an endoscopic approach, and not by approaching the region of the laceration because the foreign body was positioned over the ethmoid sinus and the sphenoid sinus. In addition, foreign body removal was safely performed in the patient without any specific complications. In the case of a patient who has ocular symptoms due to penetration of the orbit or who has an accompanying intracranial injury, he or she should undergo surgical removal under the collaboration of specialists from other clinical departments, such as ophthalmologists and neurosurgeons.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Disclosure</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors significantly contributed to and agreed upon the content of the manuscript and also there is no financial and material support or funding.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:52:30", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:52:54", "cost": 23.136}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:52:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:52:30"}

Recently, one case of colitis cystica profunda indefinite for dysplasia in Crohn’s disease was reported as a potential diagnostic pitfall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. But neoplastic involvement of enteritis cystica profunda in Crohn’s disease has not been reported in the literature. Herein, we report the first case of dysplasia involving enteritis cystica profunda in the setting of Crohn’s disease. Our report highlights the diagnostic rarity and difficulty of this entity.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 68-year-old female with a long history of Crohn’s disease presented to our hospital for further evaluation of abdominal pain of 1-year duration. She had an exploratory laparotomy in 1979 for a pelvic cyst and abdominal pain and was found to have Crohn’s disease of the terminal ileum and underwent an appendectomy and isolated small bowel resection (10 - 12 cm) with handsewn end-to-end anastomosis sparing the ileocecal valve. After surgery, she felt well, and had an average of 3 - 4 bowel movements per day with minimal pain on no Crohn’s therapy. She was not feeling well for some time, but did not seek medical attention until the year prior to surgery. She began having increased cramping abdominal pain and borborygmi and returned to the gastroenterologist. She underwent colonoscopy and was found to have a stricture at the anastomosis. She had occasional diarrhea, but overall continued having 4 - 5 bowel movements per day. She reportedly had lost some weight and weighed 100 lb at the time of surgery. She had not tried Crohn’s medications other than prednisone and budesonide in the past year. Budesonide helped with the bloating and pain but was too expensive. Lialda and azathioprine were not helpful in symptom relief in the past.\n\n【5】The patient’s past medical history was remarkable for ovarian failure, thyrotoxicosis (Grave’s disease, status post ablation), calculus of kidney (calcium oxylate), osteoporosis, benign essential hypertension, cholelithiasis, and thrombocytosis. The patient’s social history was remarkable for being a former smoker (20 pack years), quit 17 years ago.\n\n【6】On physical examination, she was very thin, but appeared well nourished. Her abdomen was soft and flat without distension. There was right lower quadrant tenderness without rebound or rigidity. No hepatomegaly or masses were noted. Her bowel sounds were normal. Laboratory tests showed slight hypoalbumin at 3.4 g/dL, slightly low total protein at 5.9 g/dL, normal ALT at 16 U/L and AST at 28 U/L, and normal total bilirubin at 0.4 mg/dL. Her hemoglobin was normal at 12.1 g/dL and white cell count (WBC) was at 5,260/μL.\n\n【7】Colonoscopy did not reveal Crohn’s disease in the colon; however, terminal ileal intubation was not possible. Computed tomography (CT) enterography with oral contrast showed dilated proximal small bowel with fecalization and air fluid levels with a 10 cm edematous and thick walled stricture of the terminal ileum. Inflammation of the fat adjacent to the terminal ileum and enlarged ileocecal lymph node were also present. There was neither abscess nor pneumoperitoneum. There was no colonic thickening or pericolonic inflammation.\n\n【8】The patient underwent a single incision laparoscopic ileocolic resection. There were few adhesions from her prior surgery, and the terminal ileal disease was easily identified and dissected from the retroperitoneum. The small bowel was run and significant strictures at the prior anastomosis site as well as 10 cm proximal to that were identified. The remainder of the small bowel and colon appeared normal. An end to side stapled anastomosis was performed. The mesentery was taken close to the bowel wall to avoid mesenteric hematoma in the inflamed Crohn’s mesentery.\n\n【9】Macroscopic findings\n\n【10】The specimen consisted of a segment of ileum and colon measuring 27.0 cm in length. There was mild fibrous adhesion on the serosa of the small bowel. The serosal aspect of the colon was smooth and glistening. An area of stricture was present between the segment of ileum and colon and the bowel circumference at this point measured 2.0 cm. Proximally, the bowel appeared dilated measuring up to 12.0 cm in circumference. No areas of induration, hemorrhage, or abscess cavities were identified. The mucosal surface particularly within the area of the stricture demonstrated areas of ulceration and hemorrhage. No masses or lesions were identified macroscopically. Polyps were not present. The muscularis propria appeared thickened, particularly within the area of the stricture, measuring up to 0.7 cm in thickness. The colon was macroscopically unremarkable. The stricture segment was entirely submitted for histologically examination.\n\n【11】Microscopic findings\n\n【12】As shown in Figure 1A , sections from the stricture showed chronic active enteritis with extensive ulceration, submucosal and mural fibrosis, hypertrophy of muscular wall, transmural inflammation including prominent lymphoid aggregates, neural hypertrophy, and fibrous adhesions. Most remarkably, there were many, variably sized, cysts or diverticulum predominantly lined by small bowel type mucosa. Some of the cysts were seen in the deep portion of the muscularis propria and in the subserosa . Rare cysts were partially ulcerated and lined by granulation tissue.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

However, these cuboidal cells were monotonous, had relatively high nucleus to cytoplasm (N/C) ratio, and did not show surface maturation . Some of the cells had thickened nuclear membranes and a single prominent nucleolus. Focal nuclear pleomorphism and loss of nuclear polarity were also noted . Mitotic figures were readily identifiable. The mucosa overlying the strictured segment showed marked chronic active enteritis with high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal adenocarcinoma of gastric type . The mucosa from the area adjacent to the stricture showed chronic active enteritis with focal pyloric gland metaplasia  and areas of low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia resembling the epithelial lining of the enteritis cystic profunda .

Similarly, enteritis cystica profunda can occur as a rare complication of Crohn’s disease, clinically and radiographically mimicking Crohn’s disease-associated adenocarcinoma. Histologically, both are characterized by glands infiltrating beyond the muscularis mucosae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 10-12 \\]</u>. Differentiation of these two entities is usually straightforward in most cases but can be challenging in rare cases. Dysplasia involving enteritis cystica profunda has not been reported, and would potentially complicate the diagnosis.\n\n【25】One case of colitis cystica profunda indefinite for dysplasia in Crohn’s disease had been reported previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In this case report, the authors reported the presence of a stricture associated with a multilocular cystic lesion containing colonic-wall dissecting mucin-filled glands which had lobulated architecture and were invested by lamina propria. However, the glandular epithelium within this cystic lesion showed focal nuclear crowding, enlargement, and hyperchromasia, with increased N/C ratio, but with largely preserved polarity. By immunohistochemistry, this atypical glandular epithelium showed focal positivity for CK7 and p53 with increased MIB-1 staining. The case report was reported as colitis cystica profunda indefinite for dysplasia in Crohn’s disease. Although one case of intramucosal adenocarcinoma involvement of diverticula in Crohn’s disease has been reported, enteritis cystica profunda with dysplasia has not been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Here we present the first case of enteritis cystic profunda with dysplasia in a patient with long-term Crohn’s disease as an unexpected diagnosis. Clinically, the patient was thought to have a benign stricture due to Crohn’s disease. Grossly, the involved segment showed stricture and thickening of small bowel but without obvious cysts or mucin pools. However, sections through the stricture clearly showed cysts and diverticula lined by chronically and actively inflamed small intestinal type mucosa including appreciable lamina propria in the muscularis propria and subserosa. The overall configuration of the cysts and diverticula was round and lobular. In addition, the cysts and diverticulae-lining epithelium showed uniform cuboid cells with high-grade dysplasia of gastric differentiation, both histologically and immunophenotypically. The presence of dysplasia and intramucosal adenocarcinoma of gastric type in the overlying mucosa and the adjacent mucosa further supported the interpretation of neoplastic involvement of enteritis cystic profunda in this case. The neoplastic/dysplastic nature of this lesion was further supported by the diffuse nuclear immunoreactivity for p53, which had been reported previously in Crohn’s enteritis-associated dysplasia/adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 13 \\]</u>. The major differential diagnosis for this case included a deeply invasive, well-differentiated, adenocarcinoma (the so-called “intestinal low-grade tubuloglandular adenocarcinoma” in inflammatory bowel disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u> and an endometriosis-like adenocarcinoma) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Importantly, the lobular contour of the lesion and the presence of lamina propria in these deeply situated cysts/diverticula provide reassurance that this is not an invasive adenocarcinoma.\n\n【27】It can be argued that this case may not represent an enteritis cystica profunda, commonly described as cysts lined by mucinous epithelium with or without mucin pool. However, the current case had many variably sized cysts deeply situated in the muscularis propria and subserosa. These findings fit a broad definition of enteritis cystica profunda, i.e. the presence of misplaced glands deep to the muscularis mucosae of the small bowel and yet still lined by lamina propria. The lack of mucin may be due to the neoplastic replacement of the cyst lining epithelium which may have less mucin-secreting capacity.\n\n【28】This case shows several points of interest. First, this high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal adenocarcinoma occurred in a patient of an older rather than young age. The mean age at onset of Crohn’s disease-associated small bowel adenocarcinoma in one report is 48 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Second, this neoplastic process extensively involves the enteritis cystica profunda. Third, the neoplastic epithelium shows marked gastric differentiation, both histomorphologically and immunophenotypically. This finding is consistent with previous observations and reports that Crohn enteritis-associated small bowel dysplasia and adenocarcinomas tend to exhibit gastric differentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 7 \\]</u>. The lobular contour of the lesion and the presence of lamina propria in the deeply situated cysts and diverticula helped rule out invasive adenocarcinoma. In addition, a finding of pyloric gland metaplasia, dysplasia of gastric type, and intramucosal adenocarcinoma (in the mucosa overlying and adjacent to the enteritis cystica profunda) supports a gastric metaplasia-carcinoma hypothesis in Crohn’s disease-associated small bowel tumorigenesis, as suggested in previous case reports or series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 7 , 15 , 16 \\]</u>. Finally, an awareness of this unique form of small intestinal dysplasia, i.e. gastric type, may help avoid underdiagnosing this as non-neoplastic epithelium on frozen sections when the surgeon submits tissue from the strictured small bowel segment before performing strictureplasty, an alternative management option for some Crohn’s patients with stricture.\n\n【29】In summary, we report the first case of enteritis cystica profunda involved by high-grade dysplasia of gastric type in one patient with Crohn’s disease presenting with small bowel obstruction. Adequate sampling of the strictured area and the adjacent mucosa as well as an awareness of this rare entity is essential for the correct diagnosis. Attention to the overall configuration and the composition of the deeply situated cysts and diverticula help avoid misdiagnosing it as a deeply invasive adenocarcinoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:19:08", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:19:27", "cost": 18.975}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:19:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:19:07"}

This case report exams this progressive process and aims to expand on early recognition, timing and prevention of these complications.\n\n【2】Learning objectives\n\n【3】1) Raise awareness for cardiac screening in patient with myotonic dystrophy for primary care providers, cardiologist, and neurologist.\n\n【4】2) Consider primary prevention in patients with myotonic dystrophy and conduction abnormalities.\n\n【5】3) Treatment of severe conduction abnormalities in myotonic dystrophy.\n\n【6】4) Demonstrate the range of electrocardiogram abnormalities in myotonic dystrophy.\n\n【7】5) Recognize signs and symptoms of myotonic dystrophy.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 58-year-old Caucasian male with significant past medical history of myotonic dystrophy and no significant cardiac history presented to emergency department with intermittent atypical chest pain while endorsing associated palpitations, weakness, and fatigue for 2 weeks. Previous medical records confirmed a diagnosis of Mobitz type I second degree AV block on EKG performed the previous week. During his admission, cardiac enzymes including troponin I and proBNP were within normal limits. Multiple episodes of sinus bradycardia were noted on telemetry with a follow-up EKG revealing first degree AV block. Over the course of 7 h, the patient became symptomatic with dizziness and altered mental status, while his vital signs showed a heart rate of 32 and blood pressure of 64/32. Serial EKGs were performed showing a conversion into complete heart block and junctional escape rhythm. The patient was resuscitated with dopamine for hemodynamic stability. Emergent permanent pacemaker placement was performed without complication. Following an uncomplicated recovery, echocardiogram and nuclear stress testing showed no structural or identifiable ischemia.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Myotonic dystrophy is a rare condition from a triplet expansion on chromosome 19q13.3 with reported incidence in around 1 in 8,000 worldwide. The chromosomal expansion mutation results in a gain of function mutation for involved cells. This gain of function is expressed as the common features associated with this rare disease. The disease is slowly progressive with physical features of increased muscle weakness and muscle atrophy commonly involving distal, smaller muscle groups. This clinical presentation can be congenital, juvenile, adult or late onset depending on the severity of the disease.\n\n【12】Cardiac conduction abnormalities in myotonic dystrophy range from benign first-degree heart block to malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Subsequent studies found that 20-30% of patients die of cardiac causes and 33% are sudden cardiac death. Recent data suggest that myocardial fibrosis and infiltrative adipose tissue involving the myocardium affects the electrical conduction system. The rates of EKG abnormalities are significantly higher than the general population. Multiple abnormalities include widening of the QRS complexes, abnormal Q waves, bundle branch blocks and bradycardia. Given the progressive nature of the disease and identifiable findings, regular cardiac monitoring and yearly monitoring with EKG is recommended.\n\n【13】Abrupt appearance of heart block may contribute to sudden cardiac death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. It has been established that sudden cardiac death may occur despite pacemaker implantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Electrophysiological studies with prophylactic pacemaker placement and ICD is recommended for those at risk for severe bradycardia, high degree AV block or malignant ventricular arrhythmia. There is a class I recommendation for device placement for the high risk patients but unfortunately prophylactic pacing is rarely pursued, even though lower mortality and increased survival rates have been shown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\- 9 \\]</u>.

Neurological examination showed mild paraparesis, lower limb hyporreflexia, absent superficial abdominal reflexes, hypoesthesia and hypopalesthesia bellow D12 level and inability to walk without bilateral assistance.\n\n【7】Blood analytical evaluation revealed mild normocytic normochromic anemia. CSF examination showed a slight increase in protein count without neoplastic cells. There were no significant changes in computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain and spine.\n\n【8】The patient was admitted to the neurology ward with the diagnosis of transverse myelopathy of undetermined etiology. Treatment was immediately initiated with high doses of steroids (intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g for 5 days); nevertheless, his neurological condition kept deteriorating and he became paraplegic in less than a week. He also developed lower limb neuropathic pain and urinary and fecal incontinence 3 days later.\n\n【9】Thoracic spinal cord MRI demonstrated an oval intramedullary lesion causing medullary mild expansion in the level of D12 associated with extensive hypersignal from the medullary cone to approximately D3 .

The patient completed five spinal cord radiotherapy (20 Gy/F5/1S) treatments associated with oral corticotherapy to relieve severe pain in the lower limbs. Later, the patient underwent laparotomy but the primary tumor was considered unresectable and only a derivative colostomy was performed. In a further multidisciplinary team meeting, adjuvant palliative chemotherapy was proposed but never carried out because of the patient’s poor general condition.\n\n【15】The patient attended a convalescence home for 3 months and his clinical condition continued worsening with multiple infectious complications until he died 4 months after ISCM diagnosis.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】ISCM represents only 1-3% of spinal cord tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and CRC is one of the less frequent tumors associated with it.

Our patient had no indication for neurosurgical intervention, even for biopsy, and the ISCM diagnosis was made by MRI confirmed by PET-18-FDG, which can be used to evaluate this clinical situation when MRI is unavailable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The presence of ISCM usually appears associated with widespread metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>, including brain involvement in 61% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, with 80% mortality rates in first 3 - 4 months after the onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Our patient had already lung and pelvic but not brain metastasis at ISCM diagnosis.\n\n【20】As far as the treatment is concerned, there is no consensus because of the rarity of this entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 12 \\]</u> and the lack of controlled studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The main objective is to try to preserve motor function in patients with rapid neurologic deterioration, considering conservative approach for patients with little or no cord function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 12 \\]</u>. There are three main therapeutic tools: radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. Radiotherapy with or without corticotherapy represents the gold standard to reduce edema in radiosensitive tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The conservative treatment is often chosen because of advanced stage of disease and poor clinical condition of patients. On the other hand, we can consider surgery in certain patients, accordingly to their age, physical condition, location and severity of the primary tumor, other metastasis and surgical risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and may offer some improvement in neurologic condition and quality of life in some patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 10 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Despite an early diagnosis, our patient had already advanced disease, with disseminated metastasis and irreversible neurological deficits and so a very poor prognosis. He was in no condition to undergo neurosurgical intervention. Thus, only palliative approach to control his pain was performed.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】ISCM from CRC is a rare condition, but thanks to therapies’ improvement, cancer patients are living longer. This, associated with more advanced imaging methods, explains the fact that ISCM is being increasingly diagnosed. It is of uttermost importance to consider this diagnosis even in patients whose primary tumor is not usually associated with ISCM, such as in CRC, or even in undiagnosed primary tumors, as demonstrated by our case report. The management of these patients needs a multidisciplinary approach, requiring early spinal cord MRI and whole-body imaging for tumoral staging, in order to achieve timely diagnosis and treatment. The aim is to avoid irreversible neurologic deficits, preserving patients’ quality of life.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:48:57", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:49:06", "cost": 8.421}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:49:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:48:57"}

More than 90% of patients with depression are thought to visit primary care physicians and the departments such as general medicine first instead of psychiatrists. Therefore, primary care physicians need to be vigilant for signs of depressive disorder to prevent suicide. Elderly individuals may be easy to fall into a depressed state because of biological changes in the brain and body aging; experiences of loss of a spouse, friend, etc.; and need for stable biopsychosocial status in health and financial aspects. In fact, the rate of suicide is higher in older age groups than in the other generations. The incidence of dementia also increases with aging. Although depression and dementia are common in the elderly age group, recognition and diagnosis of such diseases in the clinical setting might be difficult.\n\n【2】Eating disorders occur most commonly in adolescents and are rarely newly diagnosed after the age of 40 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, anorexia is also one of the major symptoms of depression in the elderly. In addition to an impact on quality of life, significant morbidity and mortality are associated with anorexia. Individuals diagnosed with an eating disorder may suffer from osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, altered gastrointestinal motility, hormonal shifts, leukopenia, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmia. Japan is currently an aging society with a huge proportion of elderly citizens. Consequently, the incidence and severity of anorexia and depression are predicted to increase in the future. In fact, at present, anorexia is common in the elderly. The social burdens, financial strain, and the high level of physical and cognitive intactness required for meal preparation all contribute to decreased appetite and food intake in older people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Anorexia can also be a symptom of physical illness or above-mentioned depression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Anorexia tardive, a related disorder specific to the elderly, is marked by loss of appetite and significant weight loss, but has more depressive symptoms, less disturbed body image, and preoccupation with eating behavior compared with anorexia nervosa. This condition may be secondary to complicated bereavement as a variant of a geriatric depressive episode 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】In this report, we present a case of an elderly woman who visited a primary care physician first and was eventually diagnosed as anorexia due to depression.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】An 84-year-old woman started to gradually lose appetite. About a month later, she consulted her local doctor and was noted to have only superficial gastritis after a series of tests, including blood examinations, endoscopy, and abdominal ultrasound. She was prescribed a lansoprazole 15 mg/day and regularly followed up at the hospital. She gained her appetite temporarily, but again lost her appetite and stopped having meals altogether after about a week. Because of this, she was advised admission by her local doctor.\n\n【6】Past medical history included total hysterectomy due to myoma at the age of 50 years. She was the oldest female of seven siblings, but was adopted and raised by her aunt since birth, with very little interaction with her biological parents and siblings. After graduating high school at the age of 21 years, she married an office worker. Moreover, she obtained a degree and managed a barbershop until the age of 74 years. Currently, she lives in a household of three with her son and his wife.\n\n【7】She was advised by her local doctor and visited our hospital at first on September 2. On physical examination, she was alert and conscious and had no apparent cognitive dysfunction. She was 150 cm tall, weighed 38 kg, and had a body mass index of 16.9 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . Blood pressure was 102/64 mm Hg, pulse rate was 60 beats per minute, body temperature was 36.5 °C, and oxygen saturation was 96%. The breasts and stomach area were unremarkable. Her hips were slightly bent and caused her to lean forward, but she could walk on her own. There was no anarthria or dysphagia. Mini-mental status examination score was 24/30 points. Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> was 17/50 points . There was no obvious suicidal ideation. Laboratory findings showed no abnormalities. Thyroid hormone levels were also normal. Chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and chest computed tomography (CT) showed no apparent abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed minimal diffuse white matter ischemic changes that were suggestive of atrophy in the frontal lobe, but this was expected of her age . She was subsequently discharged and was advised to follow-up as an outpatient. On her outpatient visit, the patient mentioned that she did have any internal need or desire to eat. Although she was drinking 500 mL of milk every day, she lost 5 kg within the past month. Upon assessment, we noted that her physical strength was gradually getting weaker and that her ability to walk was declining due to disuse. As an outpatient, there was not enough time for the staff to talk and communicate fully with the patient. In addition, we judged that it was difficult to continue following her progress with tests as an outpatient and admitted her to the hospital on September 26. Repeat upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy did not reveal any anatomic abnormalities. We continued to track her progress along with administration of vitamin tablets, fluid replacement, and physical rehabilitation to prevent muscle disuse.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

MRI of the head (T2-weighted sequences) showed some light scattering of ischemic changes in the white matter of the deep parts of the frontal lobe, but the atrophy is expected of someone her age. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【10】During this admission, she started talking with us and we learned that the patient started to become emotionally unstable since the 2011 earthquake. She would get frightened of aftershocks during the night, became scared of being alone during the day, and would have sleepless nights because of persistent thoughts about the earthquake. She visited psychiatrists a few times and was prescribed sleep-inducing pills. About 2 years ago, she joined a senior club by a non-profit organization and started participating in activities, such as haiku, playing the harmonica, and using the computer, which were held four times a week. She recalled looking forward to each meeting until about 4 months before her hospitalization, when she was invited to attend a school reunion. Although she always looked forward to reunions, she did not think that it would be fun because only two of her best friends will be able to attend. She was unmotivated and decided not to attend. Later, at the senior club, she started feeling that her mind was not functioning as quickly as before and she grew impatient toward herself. Although her facial expressions were normal and conversations were smooth, it seemed as if she lacked the will to live and often blamed herself. After discussing with psychiatrists, we diagnosed her as having an eating disorder from geriatric depression.\n\n【11】We started administering the patient with 5 mg of mianserin, 20 mg of mirtazapine, and 25 mg of dogmatyl. Subsequently, she was discharged from the hospital and was asked to continue to visit as an outpatient. About a month after discharge from the hospital, her appetite improved gradually, she started enjoying rehabilitation, and even started snacking. She no longer lacked the ability to enjoy experiences. About a month after she left the hospital, she came to the hospital on a silver car, was walking on her own, smiled often, and became her healthy self. At this time, she claimed that meals tasted good and was even eating a little too much. Thereafter, she continued to visit the hospital on a regular basis for checkups. About half a year after discharge from the hospital, her weight returned to 50 kg.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】This was a case of an 84-year-old elderly woman who complained of loss of appetite and weight, but with no cognitive functional disorders and no apparent signs of emotional stress. The female presented in this report anorexia can be a symptom of depression and the treatment plan was devised accordingly. After multiple tests, it became apparent that she was suffering from an eating disorder. The biopsychosocial model has increased popularity not only in the medical and psychiatric fields but also in other various medical fields recently due to its consideration of multiple forms of etiological risks when determining how to most effectively understand and treat individuals for physical and mental illness. This model, in regard to depression, takes into account biological and psychological or cognitive, and social risk factors/contributors to depression when making diagnosis and treatment. The evidence regarding the cause of late life depression is addressed from a biopsychosocial perspective. Thorough understanding of the biopsychosocial model enabled diagnosis and appropriate treatment of early-onset geriatric depression. The individual-focalized and humanized approach, assisting the patient as singular being, was the best one achieving her biopsychosocial needs in this clinical practice. The successful outcome after a typical biopsychosocial model of psychotherapeutic intervention for eating disorders provided additional indirect evidence that she was indeed suffering from anorexia.\n\n【14】At an old age, there are various experiences of loss, including loss of health, social roles, and personal relationships. By listening carefully in this case study, it was apparent that the patient experienced much loss. Moreover, in geriatric depression, patients have few negative emotions, such as feeling depressed, sad, or any other subjective drops in mood; this implies that elderly individuals might find it difficult to explain their symptoms to others, and that the people around them might hardly notice any symptoms of depression. Moreover, patients with this condition might experience several physical malfunctions, such as pain, numbness, loss of appetite, etc. At an old age, many people experience loss of spouses, friends, status, health, and financial assets, in addition to biological changes in the brain and body. In other words, from the biopsychosocial perspective, elderly individuals might easily become depressed. Moreover, looking at the suicide rates by age group, older people have a higher tendency to commit suicide than people in the other age groups. In elderly individuals with depression, complaints about a depressed mood are often few, and the symptoms are atypical. Compared with young people, older people have few symptoms that are characteristic of intrinsic depression, such as desperate ideation, decreased sexual desire, guilt feeling, and depressed mood. Physical discomfort and anxiety symptoms, such as hypochondria, general physical symptoms, impatience, and digestive system symptoms have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Elderly people with depression have less frequent symptoms of depressed mood, guilt feelings, and diligent thought, which are considered to be common in intrinsic depression; instead, excessive anxiety to physical symptoms and feeling of frustration are frequent.\n\n【15】This is thought to be one of the causes of the actual increase in the number of diseases with aging. Some common co-morbid conditions associated with depression are coronary artery disease in about 10-20% and endocrine disorders in 20-60%. Additionally, the prevalence rate of anorexia is approximately 66% in patients with advanced cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Furthermore, the mortality rate of depression has been reported to be high; this was true even in central nervous system diseases, such as dementia in about 10%, Parkinson’s disease in about 30%, and stroke in 20-30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In the overwhelming majority of cases that appeared in literature, disordered patterns of eating, weight, and body image in the elderly were accompanied by co-morbid conditions of anxiety, depression, grief, or dementia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. There have been cases of presumed anorexia that have actually been due to hypothalamic tumors and dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, but there was no evidence of any mass on CT or MRI. MRI is usually used to rule out organic causes for psychiatric symptoms. Specially, it is usefulness for diagnosis by exclusion of vascular depression or vascular dementia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Therefore, MRI was very useful in our case . In addition, anorexia and refusal to eat disorders in the elderly have several differential diseases . There is also a need to carefully exclude these diseases and situations.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Factors That Influence Refusal to Eat in the Elderly |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【17】About 10% of the elderly who receive primary medical care have been diagnosed with depression. Untreated geriatric depression could heighten the risk of cognitive function disorders, physical complications, and death; therefore, it is extremely important to test and diagnose this condition. Anorexia has proven to be an independent predictor of mortality in elderly people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Therefore, it is important to note that depression is a treatable disease even in the elderly and that patients require appropriate social support, as well as medical and mental therapies. In addition, depression in the elderly is an influential risk factor for suicide; in this sense, differences in depressive symptoms between young people and older people should be known and not overlooked.\n\n【18】In conclusion, this case report highlighted that in atypical populations, such as the elderly, there is a need to be aware of the possibility of eating disorders to decrease risks to health and even life due to a delay in the diagnosis. People suffering from geriatric depression often do not volunteer feelings of sadness, depression, or other negative emotions. The elderly have a tendency to get depressed due to biopsychosocial causes. More than 90% of patients with depression are thought to visit primary care physicians and the departments such as general medicine first instead of psychiatrists. Therefore, the effectiveness of primary care will become more important in the future and primary care physicians need to be vigilant for signs of depressive disorder to prevent suicide. We think that general medicine will have an more important part in medical practice in the future in Japan.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors especially thank the doctors of the Department of Psychiatry, Hospital of International University of Health and Welfare for their clinical advices and supports.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Competing Interests</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 09:44:31", "endTime": "2024/09/19 09:46:14", "cost": 102.609}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 17:46:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 17:44:28"}

It has been suggested that a substantial subgroup of these patients have in fact paradoxical embolism (PDE) as a result of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO). This theory has been strongly criticized partially due to the scarce documentation of impending paradoxical embolism (IPDE) in which a venous thrombus extends from the right atrium through a PFO into the left atrium.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 73-year-old woman with chronic atrial fibrillation, presented with DVT of the right lower limb and transient ischaemic attack. Echocardiography revealed the presence of a large, longitudinal, thrombus crossing the PFO, protruding into the left atrium and through the mitral valve into the left ventricle during diastole .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

At operation under cardiopulmonary bypass and cardiac arrest, right atriotomy was performed. A 2 - 3 cm long thrombus was protruding through the PFO . The foramen was carefully enlarged and the entire thrombus, 15 cm long, delivered through. Its shape and size indicated the lower extremities veins as the most probable source  (T <sub>1 </sub> ). In addition, apparently due to the long standing atrial fibrillation, old wall thrombus was found in the left atrium. This was inadvertently detached from the atrial wall and therefore peeled off and completely removed  (T <sub>2 </sub> ). Fragments of thrombi were looked out for, picked up and removed  (T <sub>3 </sub> ). The left atrial appendage was ligated from the inside and the PFO primarily closed with a double layer suture. The patient made a full recovery and remains well 4 years later on anticoagulation, without further embolic episodes.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. A).

Investigators suggest, based on the high incidence of PFO and the fact that as many as 50% of DVT cases remain undiagnosed, that a large number of cryptogenic strokes might be attributed to thrombi crossing from the venous to the systemic circulation via a PFO. This is particularly true in young individuals and may account for as many as 47,000 cases a year in the United States alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Furthermore, paradoxical embolism may be responsible for a significant minority of acute peripheral arterial occlusions in the absence of a clear cardiac or proximal arterial source 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Impending paradoxical embolism remains the hard evidence of the association of PFO and arterial embolism, yet it is difficult to document. The diagnosis of IPDE has been termed definitive when made at autopsy or in the rare instance when thrombus is seen crossing an intracardiac defect during echocardiography in the face of an arterial embolus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>. We herein present a case of IPDE supported by echocardiographic and surgical evidence where the causative factor was actually “caught in the action”.\n\n【10】Consequently it has been suggested that the diagnosis of PDE could be established, should the following 4 criteria were fulfilled: 1). presence of DVT, or pulmonary embolism; 2). abnormal communication between the right (venous) and left (systemic) circulations; 3). clinical, angiographic, or pathologic evidence for systemic embolism, and 4) presence of a favourable pressure gradient promoting right to left shunting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In line with these guidelines several reports have shown up in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Conversely, however, controlled studies failed so far to demonstrate the hypothesised association while PFO closure studies did not show a clear benefit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】In the rare occasion of an IPDE urgent surgical intervention is mandatory 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Currently, secondary stroke prevention after initial ischemic event in young patients with a PFO and atrial septal aneurysm should be based on medical treatment.

Flushing had increased in intensity over the past several months and had been occurring up to 10 times daily without any provocative factors. She denied diarrhea, wheezing, headache, palpitations or facial erythema. Her home medications were aspirin, omeprazole, levothyroxine, and raloxifene. The patient reported no improvement in flushing on stopping raloxifene.\n\n【4】Physical examination was unremarkable with no erythema, lymphadenopathy, wheezing or murmurs. On blood testing, she was noted to have mildly elevated serum CgA of 18.8 ng/mL (range 1.9 - 15 ng/mL). Electro-chemiluminescence (ECLIA) method was used for the testing. Other endocrine tests including serum tryptase, 24-h urine N-methyl histamine, 24-h urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), metanephrines, catecholamines, serum calcitonin, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen were unremarkable.\n\n【5】She returned for a follow-up visit a month later due to persistent symptoms of flushing. Serum CgA was repeated and markedly increased from 18.8 to 128 ng/mL. She underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan chest/abdomen/pelvis and an octreotide scan. The octreotide scan showed uptake in the right axillary and subcarinal regions. She subsequently underwent endoscopic bronchial ultrasound and mediastinal biopsy of two lymph nodes in the area of uptake on the octreotide scan. Biopsy was negative for any pathological process. Echocardiogram was normal. PET scan was done to rule out occult malignancies and was negative. She was also seen by neurology with an unremarkable workup.\n\n【6】The patient was found to have persistently elevated serum CgA levels over a period of several months that ranged from 126 to 182 ng/mL. She continued to have flushing. After a comprehensive workup, she underwent a trial discontinuation of her proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Her repeat serum CgA levels after two weeks of PPI cessation dropped to 24 ng/mL. The patient resumed omeprazole due to worsening gastroesophageal reflux. She continued to have symptoms. Venlafaxine and paroxetine were tried but she could not tolerate these medications due to side effects. Serum CgA level three months later on omeprazole was noted to be 18 ng/mL .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1.

Additionally, the more serious medical conditions include carcinoid syndrome, mastocytosis or medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Serum CgA and urine 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid are considered the most useful biochemical markers in evaluation of carcinoid tumors in diagnosis and follow-up after treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The number of patients using acid suppressive medications has increased significantly since their introduction in the 1980s, prescription as well as over the counter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It had been previously established that medications which stimulate neuroendocrine cells, particularly PPIs could lead to falsely elevated CgA levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The mechanism of CgA elevation is unclear, with some studies suggesting that gastric acid inhibition causes proliferation of the enterochromaffin cells and elevated release of gastrin which in turn causes elevated CgA levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】The interesting aspect in this case is the magnitude of increase in CgA levels (more than 10-fold) and the marked variation in serum CgA levels while on omeprazole (18 - 182 ng/mL). Braga and group looked at biological variation of serum CgA in 22 healthy volunteers (men and women) not taking any medications every two weeks for two months. The study showed variation of CgA (less than five-fold) on repeated testing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In this patient who was taking a PPI, the range of results was more widespread.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】There is marked variability in serum CgA levels in presence of proton pump inhibitors as seen in our case.

It was first described in Japan in 1990 by Hikaru Sato, MD, Ph.D. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The condition’s hallmark is a transient acute left ventricular (LV) dysfunction associated with apical ballooning, without evidence of acute coronary artery pathology. Increasing evidence suggests that microvascular myocardial ischemia and catecholamine excess play a central role in the disease’s pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Despite all the proposed mechanisms, the exact pathogenesis of TCM remains a mystery.\n\n【2】Despite the long-term favorable prognosis and transient nature of the condition, some cases of TCM exhibit more life-threatening conditions, such as intermittent asystole, sudden cardiac death, and ventricular tachycardia (VT) (2-10%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]</u>. The association between TCM and transient QT prolongation has been well described in prior literature, with an estimated prevalence of around 26% to 51% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. It is postulated to result from the reduced repolarization reserve, which reflects the transient myocardial insult of TCM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Bradycardia-induced QT prolongation is amplified by the occurrence of TCM, which is a combination that carries a significant risk for torsade de pointes (TdP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, polymorphic VT in the setting of QT prolongation (TdP) was thought to be uncommon and occurs only in 1.2% of early studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The prognostic significance of QT prolongation in TCM remains uncertain, with conflicting reports in the available literature.\n\n【3】Atrioventricular (AV) conduction defects are rarely associated with TCM, with a prevalence of about 2.9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 9 \\]</u>. Very few reports have described third-degree heart block requiring pacing as a complication of TCM.

The conduction normalized for some patients who were reassessed during a long-term follow-up period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The best method for managing AV blocks associated with TCM remains unclear.\n\n【4】We present a unique case of an 80-year-old female with TCM-related cardiac arrest associated with third-degree AV block, sporadic long QT syndrome, and bradycardia-induced TdP. Furthermore, we conducted a thorough literature review of this rare presentation and will discuss the tremendous therapeutic challenges encountered in such patients.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】Investigations\n\n【7】An 80-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension on hydrochlorothiazide was brought to the emergency department (ED) after a cardiac arrest. She lost consciousness at a live baseball game, following which the bystander’s started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), lasting for 10 - 15 min. Automated external defibrillator (AED) showed a shockable rhythm, and she received two shocks. The rhythm was noted to be VT. She regained consciousness on her way to the hospital.\n\n【8】Upon arrival to the ED, the patient was alert and oriented to time, place, and person. She denied any complaints of chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or dizziness. She reported no history of similar episodes, syncope, myocardial ischemia, angina, or stroke in the past. She denied any family history of sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. On exam, she was afebrile, and her blood pressure was 147/46 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 42/min. The respiratory rate was 18/min, and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air, point of maximal impulse (PMI) nondisplaced, normal first and second heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs were clear on auscultation bilaterally. No Jugular venous distension or lower extremity edema.\n\n【9】Laboratory investigations revealed normal hemoglobin 12.2 g/dL (reference range (RR): 12.0 - 16.0 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count 10 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL (RR: 3.3 - 10.7 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL) and platelets count 286 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL (RR: 150 - 400 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL). The serum potassium was 3.9 mmol/L (RR: 3.5 - 5.2 mmol/L), serum calcium was 8.9 mg/dL (RR: 8.6 - 10.8 mg/dL), and serum magnesium was significantly decreased at 1.3 mg/dL (RR: 1.6 - 3.0 mg/dL). Patient had anion gap metabolic acidosis with elevated lactic acid of 3.7 (RR: 0.5 - 2 mmol/L) and elevated serum creatinine of 1.34 mmol/L (RR: 0.5 - 1.2 mmol/L). The high-sensitivity troponin I was elevated at 17 ng/mL and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level was 249 pg/mL (RR: < 450 pg/mL). Laboratory results obtained on admission and their reference ranges are shown in Table 1 .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Laboratory Results on Presentation and Their Reference Ranges |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【11】The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 47/min and corrected QT (QTc) prolongation to 509 ms . Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60-65% with normal LV function and no regional wall motion abnormalities. The chest X-ray showed no congestion, consolidation, or effusion.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. ECG on admission demonstrated a junctional escape rhythm with right bundle branch block, 47 beats/min ventricular rate, and QTc of 509 ms.

Lactic acid continued trending down to 1.8 mmol/L. The second set of high-sensitivity troponin I was 85 ng/mL and subsequently the patient received aspirin 325 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, statin, as well as therapeutic heparin drip. The third set of troponin I trended up to 206 ng/L. Two hours later, a repeat ECG showed wide complex bradycardia with QTc of 545 ms and a heart rate of 41 beats/min. This was interpreted as a junctional escape rhythm with a right bundle branch block.\n\n【14】Diagnosis\n\n【15】The patient was waiting transfer to the cardiac critical care unit when she developed ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The episode happened coincidently when the patient requested to use the commode for micturition. The patient immediately received cardiac defibrillation with 200 J and CPR was continued for 6 min. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved, and the patient mentation returned quickly. She denied having any chest pain, palpitations, or lightheadedness prior to the event. ECG obtained thereafter revealed a complete heart block (CHB) with an accelerated junctional rhythm of 67 beats/min, QTc of 407 ms, and no acute ischemic change was noticed  . She underwent temporary venous pacing (TVP) with a programed lower rate limit (LRL) of 70 beats/min. A repeat TTE showed a newly reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25% with mid to apical segment severe hypokinesis  通用删除1(英):<u>( Supplementary Materials 1 , 2 , www.journalmc.org)</u>. Contractility was relatively preserved in the basal segments. The distribution of regional dysfunction raised the suspicion of TCM. Diagnosis was confirmed when no obstructive coronary lesions were seen on coronary angiography.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

The clinical examination showed oxygen saturation of 90% on room air, regular pulse of 69 beats/min, and the jugular venous was elevated. The chest examination showed bilateral inspiratory crackles on auscultation. The lower extremity examination showed bilateral pitting edema. The chest X-ray was consistent with features of bilateral pulmonary edema. Laboratory workup revealed worsening serum BNP to 2,984 pg/mL. The patient was started on 3 L of oxygen via nasal cannula, IV diuretics, and goal-directed heart failure therapy. On day 3 of admission, she underwent an electrophysiologic (EP) study with the removal of TVP and insertion of a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (BiV/ICD) to prevent further episodes of ventricular arrhythmia.\n\n【21】Postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient’s symptoms continued to improve, as well as her clinical examination. The heart rate was within the normal limit, and she was weaned from the supplemental oxygen. She was discharged home on day 10 of her hospital stay on oral torsemide, atorvastatin, aspirin, losartan, spironolactone, and oral magnesium supplements.\n\n【22】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【23】Three months after the pacemaker placement, the patient had no new complaints. The ECG showed resolution of the QT prolongation and the persistence of high-grade AV block. The repeated TTE showed EF of 55-60% with a resolution of the regional wall motion abnormality as well as LV dysfunction.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】Various types of arrhythmias have been described in the acute phase of TCM, which constitute a significant determinant of patient outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Arrhythmias associated with TCM include sustained VT (1.2%), non-sustained VT (1%), VF (2.2%), atrial fibrillation (4.7%) and sinus node dysfunction (1.3%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The International Takotsubo Registry has demonstrated that on admission ECG, the prevalence of QTc prolongation is higher in patients with TCM compared to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The prevalence of QTc prolongation in TCM is variable, ranging from 26% to 51% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. It is postulated to result from the reduction in repolarization reserve and intra-myocyte calcium overload. Thus, it was proposed that this temporary QT prolongation might reflect the acute disturbances in cardiac autonomic function and the transient myocardial insult of TCM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Abe et al described 17 patients, most of whom had a prolonged QTc interval in the acute and subacute phases of the condition. The QT interval normalized in all cases between 97 and 191 days from the onset of symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】The prognostic significance of QT prolongation in the setting of TCM remains uncertain with conflicting data in the literature. In earlier studies, polymorphic VT is considered uncommon and occurs only in 1-1.5% of cases with acquired long QT due to TCM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Hohneck et al retrospectively analyzed 105 patients with TCM and concluded that QT interval prolongation is a negative independent predictor of adverse outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. In a prospective cohort study, Imran et al have shown that TCM patients with a long QT interval, or developed acquired long QT syndrome, are more likely to be intubated, require vasopressor support, develop cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias, and death than those with a normal QT interval 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Santoro et al further described that TCM patients with prolonged QTc interval on admission had a higher risk of cardiovascular rehospitalization. In contrast, patients with a dynamic increase in QTc intervals after admission tend to have a better prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. This indicates a difference in outcome between TCM-induced QT prolongation and patients with underlying long QT syndrome. This critical distinction could explain the significant heterogeneity in literature.\n\n【27】Severe repolarization abnormalities in TCM are expected to manifest within 24 - 48 h of presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, in our case, severe QTc prolongation was present on admission, thus indicating an underlying long QT syndrome that was unmasked by ventricular slowing in the setting of an AV nodal insult. This likely resulted in an R over T phenomenon, which precipitated the VF with sudden cardiac arrest. The occurrence of TCM amplifies QT interval prolongation in multiple similar literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 18 , 19 \\]</u>. Additionally, hypomagnesemia and the administration of ondansetron likely contributed to the QT prolongation. The negative genetic analysis indicated that our patient had acquired a sporadic long QT syndrome.\n\n【28】AV conduction defects in the TCM setting have been previously described, with a prevalence of about 2.9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The exact association between AV block and TCM is unclear, but the continuous ischemic status can explain it due to the microvascular dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 8 \\]</u>. On the other hand, previous AV block and its interventions, such as temporary or permanent pacemaker implantation, have been described as triggers of TCM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 21 \\]</u>. Myocardial abnormalities associated with AV nodal dysfunction, such as fibrosis and edema, are believed to create ventricular stimuli and contractile dysfunction leading to TCM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 22 \\]</u>. However, the definitive demonstration of a cause-and-effect relationship between myocardial edema and electrical abnormalities is still lacking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Thus, it is difficult to know whether AV block is the cause or the result of TCM.\n\n【29】A handful of reports have described TCM patients presenting with third-degree AV blocks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 20 , 23 \\- 25 \\]</u>. Most cases of complete AV block associated with TCM have been described in elderly individuals, who are more prone to have a degenerative conductive system disease. Among those reports requiring pacemaker placement, AV node dysfunction persisted long after the recovery of the LV function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, conduction normalized for some patients over a long-term follow-up period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 25 \\]</u>. Therefore, the best method for managing high-grade AV block associated with TCM is difficult to discern at the time of diagnosis and remains uncertain due to the lack of robust literature. Stiermaier et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> assessed the treatment strategies for arrhythmias in a cohort of 286 patients with TCM. Patients who had complete AV block or ventricular asystole on presentation, and did not undergo pacemaker implantation, had a higher likelihood of sudden death. They recommended that the bradyarrhythmia in the acute setting of TCM may require permanent pacemaker implantation. In contrast, polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias may be managed with a temporary approach (e.g. wearable cardioverter defibrillators) until the recovery of repolarization time and LV function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Because the specific degree of damage in the AV conduction system in TCM is unknown, along with recurrent VTs and cardiac arrest, we opted for temporary pacing followed by the implantation of a BiV-ICD. Due to the patient’s age and the presence of the third-degree AV block on the diagnosis of TCM, it is difficult to discern whether the TCM was the cause or result of the third-degree AV block itself. In our review of the literature, we were able to identify five reports similar to our case  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 19 , 24 , 26 , 27 \\]</u>. Cases occurred in middle-aged or elderly females. All patients exhibited the ominous triad of CHB, acquired long QT, and bradycardia-induced TdP, resulting in either near cardiac arrest or cardiac arrest within the first 48 h of admission. Including our case, it is unclear whether TCM is the cause or effect of the arrhythmia, considering the evolution of TCM echocardiographic findings both immediately before and after the discrete episodes of TdP. All cases demonstrated the persistence of an AV nodal conduction defect, despite improvements in the LV function, requiring permanent pacing and a single or dual-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ICD. The rapid progression to TdP and VF suggests that TCM patients with a high-grade AV block, along with a QT prolongation of > 550 ms at the time of presentation, should receive a temporary pacemaker without delay.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 3.

Patients with an underlying long QT syndrome represent a particular subset of patients predisposed to TdP early during TCM and are at a higher risk of adverse outcomes. It is crucial to monitor the QTc in patients with TCM, correct electrolyte abnormalities, and minimize QT-prolonging medications. The recognition of AV conduction defects in patients with TCM is critical, especially if associated with a significant QT prolongation. Such situations are underrecognized but are potentially fatal, necessitating close monitoring and timely intervention.\n\n【34】Learning points\n\n【35】   TCM could precipitate or worsen underlying AV conduction defects.\n   Bradycardia-induced QT interval prolongation is amplified by the occurrence of TCM, a combination that potentially fatal and carries a significant risk for TdP.\n   The recognition of AV conduction defects and long QT interval in patients with TCM is critical. Close monitoring and timely interventions are key in preventing catastrophic outcomes.\n   CHB associated with TCM may require permanent pacing.\n\n【36】删除2:<u>Supplementary Material</u>\n\n【37】删除3:<u>Suppl 1.

Cancer cells likely have characteristics that enable them to deposit within microvasculature systems because neoplastic spread is thought to most frequently occur via the hematogenous route and the lung is the most common site for metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Initial symptoms of TE to the lungs are often similar to those of non-malignant pulmonary venous thromboembolism (VTE) including shortness of breath, varying degrees of hypoxemia, and normal or minimally abnormal chest radiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Involvement of a significant portion of the pulmonary microvasculature can result in progressive pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale, although the classic signs of right heart failure may be seen in only a minority of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Most reported cases of TE are associated with breast, lung, or gastric adenocarcinomas, the same tumor types that put individuals at increased risk for VTE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Discerning TE from non-malignant VTE is further complicated because VTE is approximately twice as common in patients with malignancy as in those without 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】The utility of advanced imaging for revealing TE is largely unknown. Most cases of documented TE to the lungs have not shown any significant parenchymal abnormalities on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest although “dilated and beaded” subsegmental pulmonary arteries have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy can reveal multiple peripheral and subsegmental mismatched defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

Treatment for his cancer included a right upper lobectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and taxol. Surgical margins of the resected lobe were clear of malignancy and follow-up surveillance imaging had not revealed any clear evidence of recurrence. A persistent non-productive cough began six weeks prior to admission (PTA). Chest radiograph obtained one week PTA revealed vague patchy infiltrate in the right superior lung field and right perihilar areas . Non-contrasted chest CT obtained at the same time demonstrated only ground glass opacities in the right middle and lower lobes . Bronchoscopy at that time revealed scant hemorrhage from the right lower lobe. All cultures and cytology from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were negative.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Notable findings included diminished breath sounds in both lung bases, and crackles over the right superior lung field.\n\n【11】White blood cell count was 21 500 /mL with 88.5% neutrophils. Hemoglobin concentration was 14.4 g/dL. Serum lactate concentration was 4 mmol/L. Troponin level was 0.07 ng/mL and reached a peak of 0.53 ng/mL. Arterial blood gas demonstrated a pH of 7.49, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> of 22.9 mmHg, PaO <sub>2 </sub> of 67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 4 L/minute of supplemental oxygen. Liver tests were notable for an aspartate aminotransferase of 96 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase of 101 IU/L, and an alkaline phosphatase of 414 IU/L. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) tests were negative.\n\n【12】CT angiogram on admission revealed a pulmonary embolus to the left upper lobe . Two large, thick-walled cavities in the right middle and lower lobes, bilateral ground glass opacities, and a small right pleural effusion were also seen . The locations of the cavities corresponded to the ground glass opacities seen on the CT obtained only one week prior .\n\n【13】Hospital Course\n\n【14】The patient was begun on intravenous heparin for venous thromboembolism (VTE) as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible necrotizing bacterial pneumonia. Echocardiogram demonstrated normal left ventricular function but right ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal flattening consistent with elevated right ventricular pressure. Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was estimated to be 37 mmHg but may have been under-estimated due to poor tricuspid articulation.\n\n【15】On the second hospital day, increasing oxygen requirement and markedly-increased labor of breathing necessitated endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. All sputum and blood cultures were negative for bacterial pathogens. On the seventh hospital day, he became obtunded despite adequate oxygenation and blood pressure. Noncontrast CT of the brain revealed multiple hypodense areas with lesions in the right frontal lobe and right cerebellar lobe . Given the grave prognosis, comfort care was instituted after family members conveyed his wishes to the medical team. The patient died shortly thereafter.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

Sectioning of the lungs did not demonstrate any gross VTE in the main pulmonary arterial branches. Examination of hematoxylin and eosin stained lung tissues demonstrated innumerable TE throughout both lungs including prominent TE in vessels leading to the cavitary lesions . Cell morphology and focally-positive staining for mucin and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) was consistent with lung adenocarcinoma. Acid-fast and Grocott’s methenamine silver (GMS) stains of the lung tissues around the cavities were negative for acid-fast organisms or fungi. There were two foci of intrapulmonary metastases, one in the left lower lobe and one in the right lower lobe. Neither of these metastatic foci showed significant tumor necrosis and the right lower lobe focus was separate from the cavitary lesions of the right lung. TE also invaded the splanchnic circulation with widespread hepatic involvement, causing portal vein thrombosis and parenchymal metastasis causing centrilobular necrosis. Although post-mortem examination was not performed on the brain, cerebral TE with brain infarctions were likely responsible for the obtundation and the abnormal brain imaging.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

It illustrates that in someone with a history of a malignancy, this unusual complication of cancer (i.e. TE), which can mimic other disorders and is difficult to diagnose pre-mortem, should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Since our patient did not have evidence of VTE to the right lung on CT angiogram or at autopsy, and there was no evidence of an infectious etiology for his rapid deterioration, we posit that embolic infarction from widespread TE caused the rapidly developing cavities; this complication of TE, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously reported.\n\n【22】The overall prognosis of critically ill patients with TE is grave, despite treatment with chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Because the diagnosis of TE is frequently not considered and is difficult to confirm pre-mortem, the diagnosis is often revealed at autopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Both TE and VTE may simultaneously occur in the pulmonary capillary beds 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>; we believe that in our patient, however, TE was the cause of the lung cavities and respiratory failure. Additionally, the presence of TE in the lung likely indicates diffuse involvement elsewhere in the body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 7 \\]</u>. Because microthrombi may simultaneously occur with TE, optimal treatment may require therapy for both types of clot burden with anticoagulation as well as chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Treating both processes early and aggressively may prolong survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】In summary, we propose that extensive TE can rarely cause cavitary infarction of the lungs and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of rapidly-developing cavities, particularly in patients with a known history of malignancy. Early recognition of atypical manifestations of TE may allow more effective therapies and ultimately improve outcomes.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:19:31", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:20:13", "cost": 42.25}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:20:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:19:30"}

The patient reported that 12 h prior to admission, he had used stones to clean his anus after defecation, and that these stones had become impacted in the anal canal. On digital rectal examination, FB was found to be palpated at 8 cm from the anal verge. There were two FBs seen on plain X-ray of abdomen around rectosigmoid region .

Various objects have been described as retained rectal FBs, such as bottle, eggplant, vibrator used for sexual or erotic purposes, thermometer while applying medical treatment (as accident), irrigation catheter and enema container. Mouth reception types include dental prosthesis, needle and wood stick. Rectal pain and bleeding are the two main symptoms associated with rectal FB. It may cause perforation and acute abdominal pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Sometimes, it can also be related with rectal and vulvar abscess. Migration of FB to urinary and genital tract has been reported. Ooi et al reported that atypical gender behavior, lax anal sphincters and bloody or mucoid rectal discharge are the factors which raise the suspicion for FB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】The majority of FBs can be palpated at the middle rectum. If it is not possible to palpate, endoscopic and radiologic investigation should be performed. Plain abdominal X-rays are indicated in almost all cases; CT scans should be reserved for those with potential sepsis or equivocal peritoneal signs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Unless there is a sign of peritonitis, it may be appropriate to wait several hours for spontaneous removal. In all cases, an appropriate tetanus prophylaxis and a prophylactic antibiotic are indicated. The genitourinary tract should also be examined for trauma and, if indicated, treatment. If possible, retrieval of FBs below the rectosigmoid region should be conducted transanally under sedation in the lithotomy position, using forceps and anal ecartors if necessary. If the patient cannot tolerate the pain, spinal or general anesthesia may be administered.\n\n【9】Often, use of the hand is the most convenient and easiest means of retrieving FBs from the rectum. In some cases, use of a Foley catheter, colonoscope, or Sengstaken-Blakemore tube may be necessary for retrieval. The main principle is to retrieve the FB transanally; if fails, it is better to retrieve it transanally after laparotomy with the assistance of the milking maneuver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Bak et al described a novel approach to retrieval and removal of a rectal FB utilizing a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Colotomy is the last option in the retrieval of FBs. If blood is detected during rectal examination, a sign of mucosal injury, the grade of injury must be evaluated after retrieval by performance of rectosigmoidoscopy or contrast studies.\n\n【10】It has been reported that primary repair, proximal loop colostomy, sigmoid end-colostomy and the Hartmann procedure, in combination with administration of wide-spectrum antibiotics according to the severity of peritoneal contamination, can be performed for the treatment of perforation. The mortality and morbidity rates of patients presenting with perforation above the peritoneal reflection have been reported to range from 2.5 to 20.0% and 20.0 to 40.0%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】It is important to consider that FBs in the rectosigmoid region may cause perforation, peritonitis, pararectal abscess, fistulisation and genitourinary system injuries. It is also important to remember that complications may occur during FB retrieval. Thus, unless there is a sign of peritonitis, the use of less invasive techniques is preferred for FB retrieval.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:27:47", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:29:10", "cost": 82.656}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:29:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:27:47"}

Portal hypertension due to liver cirrhosis is the most common mechanism. Other causes are portal hypertension due to non-cirrhotic etiologies, peritoneal diseases, lymphatic obstruction, hypoalbuminemia and intra-abdominal organ leak (such as pancreatic acites).\n\n【2】Ascites is a common manifestation of hepatic venous outflow obstruction, i.e. Budd-Chiari syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, ascites due to external compression of the hepatic veins is a rare situation. It has been reported in adults in cases of abdominal trauma, solid tumors, cyst or abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2-4 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】A hiatal hernia causing ascites by compressing the hepatic veins has been rarely reported in newborns with congenital diaphragmatic pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, it was never reported in adults. We present a case report of an adult patient in whom a huge hiatal hernia contributed to formation of refractory ascites that improved significantly after surgical repair.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 57-year-old male was referred to the emergency room due to recurrent vomiting that started on the same day. Lately an increasing abdominal swelling was observed. The patient had moderate mental retardation and was a resident of a nursing home. His medical history included chronic constipation and a hiatal hernia. His regular medications were clothiapine, valproic acid and promethazine.\n\n【6】Few days previous to his admission, he was examined in the emergency room due to abdominal swelling and was diagnosed as suffering from an inguinal hernia. At that time his chest and abdominal X-rays showed bilateral pleural effusion, with small bilateral atelectasis and a large hiatal hernia without signs of gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation. An abdominal X-ray following oral contrast material administration revealed normal passage. The inguinal hernia was reduced and the patient was discharged.\n\n【7】On the day of his admission, the abdominal swelling increased and he started to vomit. On his arrival to the emergency room, his blood pressure was 145/70 mm Hg, heart rate was 120 beats/min, body temperature was 37.2 °C and the respiratory rate was 20/min. On physical examination, he was dyspneic, the jugular veins were mildly distended and the heart sounds were normal without murmurs or a friction rub. The lung examination was normal. The abdomen was swollen without guarding sings. An averted umbilicus was observed and shifting dullness was found. There was no leg edema and the peripheral arterial pulses were normal.\n\n【8】ECG showed low voltage sinus tachycardia of 120 beats/min, the axis was undetermined and otherwise there were no QRS or ST-T abnormalities. Blood electrolytes were normal, creatinine level was 0.78 mg/dL, total bilirubin was 0.7 mg/dL, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were 59 and 23 IU/L respectively. Alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were 89, 128 and 813 IU/L respectively. Pancreatic enzymes were normal, and albumin and globulin levels were 3.4 and 4.4 g/dL respectively. The hemoglobin level was 14.5 g/dL, and the total white blood cell (WBC) and platelets count were 10,800 and 428,000/μL respectively.\n\n【9】His chest and abdominal X-rays were as described above. The patient was hospitalized for further investigation. Due to dyspnea and large abdominal swelling, a large volume abdominal paracentesis, draining 7 L of ascetic fluid was conducted. The total cell count of the ascetic fluid was 460 cells/μL with 33% neutrophils. The albumin level of the peritoneal fluid was 1.8 g/dL, hence the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) was 1.6 g/dL. Fluid cultures were negative, and the cytological examination was normal.\n\n【10】Anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were negative, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) were negative, and compliments levels were normal. The alphafetoprotein level was 14.1 ng/mL, and protein electroforesis showed a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.\n\n【11】Echocardiography showed a normal left ventricular systolic function, without any valvular abnormalities. The right ventricle was normal in size and function. An extra cardiac lesion compressing the atria was identified.\n\n【12】A chest and abdominal contrast enhanced CT showed a huge hiatal hernia, compressing the thoracic inferior vena cava . The hepatic veins were patent, the liver and spleen were normal in texture and size, and the abdominal cavity contained a large amount of free fluid. A gastroscopy revealed a large hiatal hernia, with mild hypertensive gastropathy. Esophageal varices were not observed.\n\n|  Figure 1. Multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) - coronal view without IV contrast media showing huge hiatal hernia compressing the inferior vena cava in proximity to the confluence of hepatic veins. |\n| --- |\n\n【14】The wedge and free hepatic venous pressures were 17 and 13 mm Hg respectively, thus the hepatic venous pressure gradient was 4 mm Hg. A needle liver biopsy revealed a nodular pattern with venous congestion without significant fibrosis .\n\n|  Figure 2.

Dilated sinusoidal spaces are present. |\n| --- |\n\n【18】A right-sided heart catheterization was conducted. The mean right atrial was 17 mm Hg and a pressure gradient between the inferior vena cava and the right atrium was found. The other measurements were within normal limits and no signs of pericardial constriction were observed.\n\n【19】Following abdominal paracentesis, a temporary improvement in the respiratory distress was observed. However, accumulation of ascites was rapid despite salt restriction and diuretic therapy and repeated procedures of large volume paracentesis were indicated.\n\n【20】At that point we concluded that obstruction of hepatic venous outflow, due to compression of the supra hepatic inferior vena cava by the huge hiatal hernia, contributed to the formation of the intractable ascites. Thus, a laparoscopic hernioplasty was performed.\n\n【21】During the first 2 months after surgery, despite salt restriction and diuretic therapy, the patient needed three more procedures of large volume paracentesis. On the third postoperative month, ascites accumulation was dramatically decreased without any need for further therapeutic paracentesis.\n\n【22】We followed the patient up to 3 years later. There were no signs of ascites on physical examination. Nevertheless, ascetic fluid was still detectable by abdominal ultrasound.\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】The presented patient had ascites with a high serum - ascites albumin gradient, indicating that portal hypertension was the underlying etiology. A large ascites without the presence of esophageal varices implied that the mechanism was post sinusoidal obstruction.\n\n【25】The major cause of intrahepatic post sinusoidal obstruction is the hepatic “sinusoidal obstructive syndrome”. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia may rarely present as ascites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The histological findings were compatible with nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Nevertheless, this condition cannot explain the congestion of the jugular vein. Moreover, the rapid accumulation of ascetic fluid, recent to his admission, suggested another etiology. The cardiac echocardiogram and catheterization did not support a myocardial, valvular or pericardial pathology. Normally, there is no measurable pressure gradient between the inferior vena cava and the right atrium. The finding of an external pressure on the right atrium combined with a pressure gradient between the inferior vena cava and the right atrium led to the conclusion that the findings are due to external compression by the huge hiatal hernia. Therefore, hernioplasty was performed.\n\n【26】The hiatal hernia, most probably, was not the cause for the ascites formation but it was the cause of worsening ascites. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the hiatal hernia was known for many years, and that the ascites formation reduced dramatically following hernioplasty.\n\n【27】After the operation, the improvement had not evolved immediately but rather after few weeks. This sequence of events is not surprising. First, the patient had probably an underlying intra-hepatic post sinusoidal liver pathology that was not cured by the hernioplasty.

To the best of our knowledge, it was never reported in adults. We present a case report of an adult patient in whom a huge hiatal hernia contributed to formation of refractory ascites that improved significantly after surgical repair.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 57-year-old male was referred to the emergency room due to recurrent vomiting that started on the same day. Lately an increasing abdominal swelling was observed. The patient had moderate mental retardation and was a resident of a nursing home. His medical history included chronic constipation and a hiatal hernia. His regular medications were clothiapine, valproic acid and promethazine.\n\n【6】Few days previous to his admission, he was examined in the emergency room due to abdominal swelling and was diagnosed as suffering from an inguinal hernia. At that time his chest and abdominal X-rays showed bilateral pleural effusion, with small bilateral atelectasis and a large hiatal hernia without signs of gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation. An abdominal X-ray following oral contrast material administration revealed normal passage. The inguinal hernia was reduced and the patient was discharged.\n\n【7】On the day of his admission, the abdominal swelling increased and he started to vomit. On his arrival to the emergency room, his blood pressure was 145/70 mm Hg, heart rate was 120 beats/min, body temperature was 37.2 °C and the respiratory rate was 20/min. On physical examination, he was dyspneic, the jugular veins were mildly distended and the heart sounds were normal without murmurs or a friction rub. The lung examination was normal. The abdomen was swollen without guarding sings. An averted umbilicus was observed and shifting dullness was found. There was no leg edema and the peripheral arterial pulses were normal.\n\n【8】ECG showed low voltage sinus tachycardia of 120 beats/min, the axis was undetermined and otherwise there were no QRS or ST-T abnormalities. Blood electrolytes were normal, creatinine level was 0.78 mg/dL, total bilirubin was 0.7 mg/dL, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were 59 and 23 IU/L respectively. Alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were 89, 128 and 813 IU/L respectively. Pancreatic enzymes were normal, and albumin and globulin levels were 3.4 and 4.4 g/dL respectively. The hemoglobin level was 14.5 g/dL, and the total white blood cell (WBC) and platelets count were 10,800 and 428,000/μL respectively.\n\n【9】His chest and abdominal X-rays were as described above. The patient was hospitalized for further investigation. Due to dyspnea and large abdominal swelling, a large volume abdominal paracentesis, draining 7 L of ascetic fluid was conducted. The total cell count of the ascetic fluid was 460 cells/μL with 33% neutrophils. The albumin level of the peritoneal fluid was 1.8 g/dL, hence the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) was 1.6 g/dL. Fluid cultures were negative, and the cytological examination was normal.\n\n【10】Anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were negative, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) were negative, and compliments levels were normal. The alphafetoprotein level was 14.1 ng/mL, and protein electroforesis showed a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.\n\n【11】Echocardiography showed a normal left ventricular systolic function, without any valvular abnormalities. The right ventricle was normal in size and function. An extra cardiac lesion compressing the atria was identified.\n\n【12】A chest and abdominal contrast enhanced CT showed a huge hiatal hernia, compressing the thoracic inferior vena cava . The hepatic veins were patent, the liver and spleen were normal in texture and size, and the abdominal cavity contained a large amount of free fluid. A gastroscopy revealed a large hiatal hernia, with mild hypertensive gastropathy. Esophageal varices were not observed.\n\n|  Figure 1.

The mean right atrial was 17 mm Hg and a pressure gradient between the inferior vena cava and the right atrium was found. The other measurements were within normal limits and no signs of pericardial constriction were observed.\n\n【19】Following abdominal paracentesis, a temporary improvement in the respiratory distress was observed. However, accumulation of ascites was rapid despite salt restriction and diuretic therapy and repeated procedures of large volume paracentesis were indicated.\n\n【20】At that point we concluded that obstruction of hepatic venous outflow, due to compression of the supra hepatic inferior vena cava by the huge hiatal hernia, contributed to the formation of the intractable ascites. Thus, a laparoscopic hernioplasty was performed.\n\n【21】During the first 2 months after surgery, despite salt restriction and diuretic therapy, the patient needed three more procedures of large volume paracentesis. On the third postoperative month, ascites accumulation was dramatically decreased without any need for further therapeutic paracentesis.\n\n【22】We followed the patient up to 3 years later. There were no signs of ascites on physical examination. Nevertheless, ascetic fluid was still detectable by abdominal ultrasound.\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】The presented patient had ascites with a high serum - ascites albumin gradient, indicating that portal hypertension was the underlying etiology. A large ascites without the presence of esophageal varices implied that the mechanism was post sinusoidal obstruction.\n\n【25】The major cause of intrahepatic post sinusoidal obstruction is the hepatic “sinusoidal obstructive syndrome”. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia may rarely present as ascites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The histological findings were compatible with nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Nevertheless, this condition cannot explain the congestion of the jugular vein. Moreover, the rapid accumulation of ascetic fluid, recent to his admission, suggested another etiology. The cardiac echocardiogram and catheterization did not support a myocardial, valvular or pericardial pathology. Normally, there is no measurable pressure gradient between the inferior vena cava and the right atrium. The finding of an external pressure on the right atrium combined with a pressure gradient between the inferior vena cava and the right atrium led to the conclusion that the findings are due to external compression by the huge hiatal hernia. Therefore, hernioplasty was performed.\n\n【26】The hiatal hernia, most probably, was not the cause for the ascites formation but it was the cause of worsening ascites. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the hiatal hernia was known for many years, and that the ascites formation reduced dramatically following hernioplasty.\n\n【27】After the operation, the improvement had not evolved immediately but rather after few weeks.

Atypically primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) involving various soft tissues like the chest wall, lungs, visceral pleura, oral cavity, and perineum have been described, which together with Ewing sarcoma, are classified as Ewing’s family of tumors. It is mostly curable in children. However, the prognosis is poor with increasing age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. We describe a rare case of extraskeletal PNET initially presented as a local lung tumor that rapidly involved the adjacent spine, causing paraparesis in a young adult. We also described how sepsis posed a challenge in treating this locally aggressive tumor, making prognosis grim.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 27-year-old gentleman with no significant past medical history presented with hoarseness of voice for 1 month. He was diagnosed with laryngitis and was prescribed antibiotics. His symptoms continued to worsen with cough and upper back pain, and decided to come to the emergency room. He has not had a significant cough but had an episode of “tar-like” mucus once associated with nasal congestion and hoarseness. He denies fever, chills, hemoptysis, body aches, nausea, vomiting, or other symptoms. He denies sick contacts or recent travel. He had no prior surgeries. His family history was significant for breast cancer in grandmother and colon cancer in grandfather. He smoked cigarettes on and off for the last 10 years and quit 2 weeks ago. He denies alcohol use but admits to occasional marijuana use.\n\n【4】On admission, his vitals are temperature 37.4 °C oral, heart rate of 108 beats per min, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per min, blood pressure of 146/101 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 100% on 2 L via nasal cannula. On examination, he is an alert, well-built young gentleman with a body mass index (BMI) of 24. On auscultation of the chest had decreased breath sounds at the left base. Otherwise, the rest of the exam is unremarkable. Admission labs are summarized in Table 1 . Chest X-ray showed left lower lobe effusion vs. mass.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1.

He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotic vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and blood cultures obtained. He was admitted for further management. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax was done that revealed large multilocular cystic and solid left upper lobe mass concerning neoplasm with left to right mediastinal shift and compressive atelectasis . There is also evidence of large pleural effusion on the left side with ongoing respiratory compromise and concern for hydropneumothorax. A chest tube was placed, fluid from the Fuhrman catheter sent for analysis. Based on light’s criteria, fluid was determined to be exudative. Although cytology was negative for malignant cells, cardiothoracic surgery was consulted. They performed a thoracoscopic examination, finding pleural studding in addition to the mass had undergone Left video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and pleural biopsy with preliminary pathology confirming poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm with the final pathology pending. He was presumed to have local lung cancer. The chest tube was changed to Pleurx. It was recommended to follow up outpatient with a positron emission tomography (PET) scan scheduled. He completed an antibiotic course. He also developed left upper extremity swelling during hospitalization, confirming cephalic vein thrombosis, and was discharged on low dose Eliquis.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The patient reports that he has lost the ability to plantar/dorsiflexion in his right lower extremity. His sensation was intact and denied incontinence of bowel or bladder. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic and lumbar spine was done, which revealed metastatic lesion to the thoracic area with substantial spinal cord compromise . The patient was started on dexamethasone. Neurosurgery was consulted, and he underwent posterior decompression and removal of the tumor from thoracic vertebrae 2 - 3 with partial T1 - T4 decompression.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

Immunohistochemically stained slides show that the tumor is positive for pan-keratin. Vimentin, synaptophysin, cluster of differentiation 99 (CD99), friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (FLI1), AE1/AE3 (anti-cytokeratin antibody, scattered cells) and negative for CD45, smooth muscle actin (SMA), CD20, cytokeratin 7 (CK7), CK20, SRY-related HMG-box 10 (SOX10), P40 and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1).

The T cells show normal expression of the pan T-cell antigens and have a normal CD4: CD8 ratio. The natural killer (NK) cells account for 4.8 % of the total lymphocytes. A CD45-negative non-hematopoietic cell population is detected. Thoracic tumor biopsy again revealed small round blue cells, the FISH study eventually reported as tumor consistent with Ewing sarcoma.\n\n【15】Discussion in multidisciplinary tumor board radiation oncologists recommends starting palliative radiation to T1 - T3 as soon as possible to 3,000 cGy in 10 fractions while inpatient. Since Ewing sarcoma is primarily treated in the pediatric population, a pediatric oncologist was consulted. He then underwent bilateral bone marrow biopsy for further staging. Bilateral bone marrow aspirate smear, clot section, and core biopsy revealed normocellular marrow (40%) with trilineage hematopoiesis and no morphological evidence of involvement Ewing sarcoma. Flow cytometry showed no immunophenotypic evidence of B-cell or T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, and no monoclonal plasma cell population identified, confirming no evidence of distant metastatic disease. Due to its locally aggressive nature, a multimodal approach was recommended that involved chemotherapy, local control with surgery, and radiation. Urology was consulted for fertility preservation and echocardiogram to document baseline cardiac function was done before chemotherapy.\n\n【16】The patient was discussed in the tumor board. The plan was to administer multidrug chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (VDC) for cycle 1 followed by about six cycles of VDC, ifosfamide, and etoposide (VDC/IE) every 2 weeks followed by local control to include surgery along with radiation to hemithorax and spine. This will be followed by consolidative chemotherapy with eight more cycles of VDC/IE. Repeat imaging of the tumor to be planned after cycle 5 or 6 so that surgery/radiation can be planned accordingly. Neurosurgery recommended physical therapy with a thoracic-lumbar-sacral orthosis (TLSO) brace.\n\n【17】After the first chemotherapy, the patient started to develop sepsis-like syndrome. Infectious disease was consulted, and the patient was started empirically on antibiotics. Blood cultures were positive for staphylococcus with source likely thought to be post-operative wound infection. Chemotherapy was held, and infection was aggressively managed by local incision and drainage, wound vac placement followed by wound care, and prolonged intravenous vancomycin and Bactrim for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis. The patient was able to complete cycle 1 and part A of cycle 2 and was discharged home to return for cycle 2, part B (IE).\n\n【18】Chemotherapy, radiation, or any surgical management were held because of sepsis, which is concerning, especially in this aggressive local tumor. A careful multisystem approach is necessary to improve outcomes that otherwise can make prognosis poor.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Ewing sarcoma family of tumors includes classic Ewing sarcoma, PNET, extraosseous Ewing sarcoma, and Askin’s tumors (chest wall) have been described in the 1900s. They are aggressive sarcoma of bone and soft tissue. Classically they arise in long bones with a characteristic “onion peel” appearance on plain radiographs. It may occur in other bones and extraskeletal soft tissues. Ewing sarcoma tumors are a rare entity that is more common between 10 and 15 years of age, with an average annual incidence of 2.9 per million children younger than 20 years of age, slightly higher in males compared to females with a 6-fold higher incidence in white children than black children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Reciprocal translocation of FLI1 gene on the long arm of chromosome 11 and EWSR1 on chromosome 22 is the primary cytogenetic abnormality believed to be involved in tumorigenesis. The biopsy is essential for definitive diagnosis, which shows small round blue cells that must be differentiated from lymphoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and small cell carcinoma.\n\n【22】Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain shows glycogen-filled cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical marker CD99 is sensitive, FLI1 fusion, and NK2 homeobox 2 (NKX2-2) are relatively sensitive, and specific to Ewing sarcoma.\n\n【23】Management is multimodal, involving surgery and radiation for local treatment of primary tumor and systemic chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the mainstay often used in multiple cycles before and after surgery and radiation. A multidisciplinary team approach involving a combination of surgery, radiation, and multidrug chemotherapy have improved the 5-year survival rates to 60-73% in patients with localized disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and 37-60% in patients with metastatic disease compared to 10% with surgery or radiation alone before the advent of multi-agent systemic therapy as per the literature review by Valdes et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The 5-year overall survival for patients with isolated pulmonary metastatic disease is higher than patients with other sites of metastatic diseases, approximately 50% and less than 30%, respectively. Once the disease recurs, the patients tend to have a dismal prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】In a retrospective review done by Valdes et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> involving 18 patients older than 19 years of age who received systemic therapy, the median overall survival for the entire group was approximately 21 months. The overall survival for patients with localized disease at 1, 2, and 3 years were 90%, 80%, and 70%, respectively. Their 1-year survival for patients with metastatic disease was 40%. These patients have Ewing sarcoma family of tumors with known extremity primaries with predominant soft tissue involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In another retrospective review by Argon et al. involving 25 patients who are over 15 years, 20% of them have metastatic disease at presentation. The reported 2-year overall survival was 32.7% with poor prognosis in patients with localized pelvic primaries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】One of the strongest prognostic factors is a patient presenting with metastatic disease at diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Several prognostic factors determine the intensity of therapy, including age, location of the primary tumor, localized or metastatic disease, chromosomal translocations, and response to therapy. For patients presenting with localized disease, primary tumors arising from the axial skeleton tend to have a worse prognosis than those arising from the extremity. In a series by Cotterill et al, the 5-year relapse-free survival was 61% and 40% with primary tumors arising from extremity and axial skeleton, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The induction therapy responses, as well as complete surgical resection, are also important prognostic factors. Patients who have a significant amount of residual disease in the resected specimen following treatment with neoadjuvant therapy have a poor prognosis compared to those with minimal or no evidence of disease in the pathological specimen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Children have a better prognosis compared to adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, the greater tumor burden in adults, use of lower doses of alkylating agents, and the timing of local therapy may explain the difference between the two groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. There are multiple different structural possibilities for gene fusions in these tumors. Specific cytogenetic and molecular alterations such as p53 mutations, deletions of CDKN2A gene coding P16, P14ARF and deletion of 1p36, or all are associated with worse prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\- 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Multidisciplinary approach coupled with risk-adapted intensive neoadjuvant and adjuvant multi-agent chemotherapies along with other modalities such as radiation and surgery for control of the primary site and metastatic disease if needed. Since Ewing sarcoma family of tumors is usually rare, it does require referral to sarcoma specialists. The primary treatment will involve multidrug chemotherapy with alternating cycles of VDC and IE given every 2 weeks with growth factor support in patients with localized disease. This was based on a randomized phase 3 clinical trial where patients were randomized to the above regimen compared to VDC and dactinomycin (VDCA) 5 years event-free survival was 69% in the containing IE compared to 54% in VDCA arm. The overall survival was also significantly better, and the experimental arm containing IE versus VDCA at 72% and 61%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Local control can be achieved either with surgery or radiation or both. For patients with metastatic disease, the management depends on the site and the number of metastatic lesions. Patients with limited pulmonary metastatic disease are generally treated with a curative intent to undergo multi-agent intense chemotherapy and pulmonary resection with or without radiation, with improved survival compared to other sites of metastatic disease. The addition of IE to the VDC backbone did not change patients’ outcomes with the metastatic disease; however, it showed significant improvement in nonmetastatic disease and is the commonly used regimen in the USA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Patients with the relapsed disease tend to have a poor prognosis. Generally, systemic therapy involves either topotecan/cyclophosphamide or irinotecan/temozolomide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>. Surgery and radiation can be used in selective cases such as local recurrence. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors such as cabozantinib have shown activity in a phase 2 trial with a progression-free survival of 5 months and an overall response rate of 26% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Conclusions\n\n【29】We described a young adult patient with locally aggressive extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma causing cord compression and paraparesis, which initially masqueraded as a local lung mass. This presentation is extremely rare and emphasizes the importance of knowing the aggressive nature of the tumor. The case also describes the challenges in management while, in this case, sepsis can prolong the initiation or continuation of management owing to the prolonged course of recovery and poor prognosis.\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Both verbal and written consents were obtained.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MP, VS collected and reviewed patients’ chart.

Choriocarcinomas are highly vascular epithelial tumors that arise from villous trophoblasts and produce human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). These tumors can occur at any time during or after any type of gestation, with an incidence of 1:50,000 deliveries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Metastasis of the disease is very common with spread outside of the pelvis to the lungs, liver and brain. Pulmonary metastasis is most prevalent. Diagnosis is made by measuring elevated hCG values and pelvic ultrasound to ascertain pregnancy status. This is followed by full body computed tomography (CT) imaging, with emphasis on the lungs and brain, to evaluate for metastatic spread. Treatment is primarily chemotherapy and surgery, with excellent long-term outcomes in the setting of an early diagnosis and close monitoring of hCG levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Here we describe a case of a primigravid female at 30 weeks and 5 days of gestation presenting with new-onset seizures who was found to have a pial arteriovenous malformation (AVM).\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】We present the case of a 26-year-old Caucasian female, gravida 1, para 0, at 30 weeks and 5 days of gestation whose care was transferred to our tertiary academic medical center due to persistent headaches, new-onset tonic-clonic seizures, and a brain CT scan at the outside hospital showing acute intracranial hemorrhage . The patient had no prior medical problems, no prior surgeries, a negative family history, and took no medications. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain on arrival was concerning for a left intraparenchymal hematoma, a 5 mm midline shift, and multiple foci of restricted diffusion throughout the brain.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Brain MRI showed left temporal occipital intraparenchymal hematoma  measuring 3.4 × 2.4 × 3.2 cm with surrounding edema, and rightward midline shift with subfalcine and uncal herniation. MRI: magnetic resonance imaging. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【6】Neurosurgery was consulted, and the patient underwent an angiogram with neurointerventional radiology. A left posterior pial AVM remnant with stagnant venous flow was the presumptive diagnosis from this procedure. An interdisciplinary meeting was held including critical care, neurosurgery, obstetrics, and anesthesia. The decision was made to start the patient on anticonvulsants, repeat the cerebral angiogram in 4 weeks, and proceed with cesarean delivery at 37 weeks to avoid peri-delivery Valsalva maneuver.\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】On hospital day 7, the patient reported worsening headache. She was taken emergently for brain MRI which showed increasing hemorrhage with 9 mm midline shift and uncal herniation. She underwent embolization of a bleeding left dural AVM under general anesthesia with invasive blood pressure monitoring. The patient tolerated anesthesia well and was hemodynamically stable throughout. She was extubated and taken to the neuro-intensive care unit (ICU) at the conclusion of the procedure.\n\n【9】Treatment\n\n【10】On post-embolization day 1 (at 31 weeks and 5 days of gestation) the patient had increased lethargy and repeat imaging revealed continued hemorrhage of the AVM. A family meeting was held, and goals of care for the mother and baby were discussed at length. In light of non-reassuring fetal heart tracings and in accordance with the family’s wishes, the decision was made to proceed with emergent cesarean delivery. Mother and baby both tolerated the procedure well under general anesthesia and, following extubation, the mother was taken again to the neuro-ICU. Later in the evening the patient once more demonstrated worsening mental status with repeat imaging that showed increasing hematoma and cerebral edema. For the fourth time in her hospital stay, the patient was emergently taken to the operating room, this time for a left craniectomy and hematoma evacuation. She underwent general anesthesia, tolerated the procedure well, and was extubated without apparent anesthetic sequela.\n\n【11】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【12】Her hospital course over the following weeks was complicated by weakness and aphasia that progressively improved. Additional repeat imaging revealed stable hematoma. She was discharged on hospital day 21 to a rehabilitation facility. One day after discharge, placental pathology returned showing the malignant gestational trophoblastic disease, choriocarcinoma. The patient was readmitted, and a new brain MRI confirmed new areas of brain infarction along with new evidence of post-embolization dural AVM bleeding. Concern for metastatic hemorrhagic choriocarcinoma prompted full body imaging which revealed lung, labial, and brain metastases .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. Chest CT showed left upper lobe lesion measuring 2.7 cm with prominent feeding vessel . CT: computed tomography. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【14】The hCG values were measured and trended throughout this admission. Initial values were greater than 225,000 mIU/mL and trended down to 30 mIU/mL after two cycles of treatment with etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D and cisplatin. She underwent two more neurosurgical procedures and extensive chemotherapy, but her condition deteriorated further. Increasing cerebral edema and midline shift required prolonged intubation and subsequent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastric (PEG) tube placement. Unfortunately, her neurologic exam continued to decline. In light of a poor prognosis, the patient was made “allow natural death” and after consulting with palliative care, the family eventually decided to pursue comfort care. The patient died 3 months after initial presentation despite aggressive surgical intervention, multidrug chemotherapy, and progressively decreasing hCG levels.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Treatment of choriocarcinoma largely depends on how aggressive the disease is and generally has very good outcomes. Mild disease without metastasis may only require long-term surveillance. More aggressive disease with metastasis generally requires multidrug chemotherapy with or without the addition of surgery and/or radiation treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Earlier diagnosis can lead to treatment with multidrug chemotherapy before the disease becomes overwhelming, and 5-year survival can be upwards of 90%. This rate drops drastically as metastatic disease burden grows before treatment can be initiated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. By the time of diagnosis and chemotherapy initiation, our patient’s disease was very advanced with chest, liver, labial, and brain metastases.\n\n【17】While a diagnosis of choriocarcinoma is rare, the intraoperative anesthetic approach to our patient was complicated by urgency and the myriad of challenges presented by performing non-obstetrical operations on a parturient. Induction of general anesthesia, particularly after 16 weeks’ gestation, is complicated by physiologic changes of pregnancy including rapid desaturation, respiratory mucosa engorgement, progressively more difficult airway, and higher likelihood of vomiting and aspiration. Neuraxial/regional anesthesia should be considered if possible. Positioning the patient is challenging secondary to breast tissue engorgement, weight gain, and aortocaval compression. The anesthetic must be tailored to both the mother and the fetus.\n\n【18】Operations during pregnancy are generally reserved for urgent and emergent surgeries with elective procedures delayed until after delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Ideally, cases are performed in the second trimester, beyond organogenesis yet before a higher chance of preterm labor in the third trimester. Depending on gestational age, there can be increased morbidity due to delays and uncertainty of when to perform a non-obstetrical procedure.\n\n【19】For this case, there were no delays in treatment as all of the procedures performed were emergent, since any delays would have resulted in increased maternal morbidity or mortality. The decision to have fetal monitoring and potential intervention must also be made prior to operating. Continuous fetal monitoring was utilized for each procedure performed for our patient so that appropriate action could be taken to optimize uteroplacental perfusion and fetal oxygenation. There is no data at this time regarding morbidity and mortality for pregnant patients undergoing neuroendovascular procedures, but general surgery appears to be as safe for pregnant women as it is for nonpregnant women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】As previously mentioned, a diagnosis of choriocarcinoma is exceedingly rare. It develops in approximately one in every 50,000 otherwise normal deliveries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Molar disease, spontaneous abortion, and ectopic pregnancy can precede choriocarcinoma. Choriocarcinoma can be localized to the placenta or produce highly vascular metastasis. One large systematic review reported that metastatic disease occurred in 52% of identified cases with pulmonary metastasis being most common, followed by uterine, brain, and then vaginal sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. These metastases can produce hematuria, hemoptysis, hematemesis, hematochezia, seizure, stroke, or vaginal bleeding. Other clinical presentations include headache, lethargy, as well as severe and intractable back pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Given these potential nonspecific presenting symptoms, the differential can be quite long and delay the diagnosis of choriocarcinoma.\n\n【21】Typically, the diagnosis is made based on history, imaging studies, and serum hCG level. In pregnancy serum hCG levels are already elevated. Elevated hCG levels are not pathognomonic for choriocarcinoma. However, a significantly elevated serum hCG along with appropriate history is highly suggestive of choriocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Our patient’s first presenting sign was seizure with subsequently diagnosed intracranial bleeding. It was not until 3 weeks after cesarean delivery (4 weeks after her first seizure) that the diagnosis of choriocarcinoma was made from pathology of the placenta and a labial hematoma that was later found to be a metastasis. In addition, she had a seemingly clear cause for her intraparenchymal bleed. AVM and aneurysms are among the most common causes of intracranial hemorrhage in pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. An arteriovenous fistula of the posterior cerebral artery was initially suspected and successfully embolized in our patient, thus leaving the concern for metastatic disease low on the differential.\n\n【23】Learning points\n\n【24】Choriocarcinoma is extremely rare in viable pregnancies, but it should be considered when a parturient presents with intracranial bleeding. A high level of suspicion and serial serum hCG levels may lead to early and potentially life-saving multidrug chemotherapy. Unfortunately, in the case presented, the disease was advanced, and diagnosis delayed. Our patient’s disease resulted in several intracranial bleeds leading to devastating brain injury and ultimately death despite aggressive treatment. With a broader differential, earlier hCG measurement, and earlier treatment our patient may have survived.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors do not have any additional contributors to acknowledge.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors did not receive any specific funding, and the writeup of this article was performed of their own volition while working at Medical University of South Carolina in the department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Medicine.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article.

The etiology and mechanism of heterotopic bone formation in the colon are still unclear. Therefore, we present a case of cecal cancer with ossification.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A healthy 45-year-old man was referred to our hospital for severe anemia (hemoglobin level, 4.8 g/dL).

Cross-sections cut from the fixed tissue revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with mucus collection. The tumor extended into the subserosal tissue, with absence of necrotic tissue. The white solid lesion comprised an ossification tissue with normal osteoblasts completely surrounded by the benign fibrous tissue. No histological evidence of venous or lymphatic invasion was observed.

Colon cancer with ossification has been reported as a slowly progressive, moderately to highly differentiated tumor that is not invasive to vessels or lymph nodes. Mucosal and necrotic tissues often coexist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Heterotopic bone formation has been observed within the tumor stroma associated with necrosis and within pools of mucus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\- 9 \\]</u>. However, most colon cancers with necrotic tissue are not associated with ossification, and not all colon cancers with ossification present with an associated necrotic tissue (similar to the tumor in our case). The association between tissue necrosis and bone formation is unclear; however, it is clear that the presence of necrosis is not a prerequisite for bone formation.\n\n【15】Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of heterotopic bone formation: osteoblastic metaplasia of cancer cells and pluripotent mesenchymal cells, both under the influence of factors generated by the cancer cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Electron microscopic studies in two cases of lung cancers have reported a lack of intermediate stages between tumor cells and osteoblasts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Werner et al have demonstrated the transition from osteoblasts to fully differentiated osteocytes in gastric cancer of rats 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. These reports suggest the osteoblastic metaplasia of normal mesenchymal cells. In our case, the ossification tissue with osteoblasts was completely surrounded by the benign fibrous tissue, suggesting that the osteoblasts were derived from the pluripotent mesenchymal cells and not the cancer cells.\n\n【16】There is no difference between colon cancer with and without ossification with respect to the course, management, and prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Apart from colon cancer, osseous metaplasia has also been reported in association with benign polyps of the colon, carcinoids of the stomach, and mucoceles of the appendix 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Osseous metaplasia in colon cancer should not be confused with carcinosarcoma because although the latter is extremely rare, it has a much worse prognosis due to its more invasive nature and high recurrence rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Colon cancer with ossification can be differentiated from carcinosarcoma because the osseous metaplasia in colon cancer is always associated with benign bone formation, similar to this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】As they have totally different prognoses, colon cancer with ossification needs to be differentiated from other benign lesions and carcinosarcomas. Only few colon cancer cases with ossification have been reported in the literature, and the pathophysiology is not well known. Further studies are needed to find the etiological, epidemiological, and pathophysiological factors associated with osseous metaplasia in colon cancer.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no potential conflict of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:09:05", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:09:26", "cost": 20.138}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:09:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:09:04"}

WBC differential showed 4% myelocytes and 2% metamyelocytes. A diagnostic bone marrow performed in January 2018 showed a markedly hypercellular marrow (almost 100% cellularity) characterized by marked granulocytic hyperplasia consistent with a diagnosis of CML. Cytogenetics showed abnormal male karyotype with loss of Y chromosome and t(9;22) detected in all cells examined. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for BCR-ABL1 on peripheral blood and marrow identified presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript e1a2 involving minor 通用删除11(英):<u>(p190)</u> breakpoint. He was started on imatinib in mid-January 2018. He achieved a complete hematological response soon after initiation of TKI therapy, but his BCR-ABL transcript levels over the following 6 months raised concerns for TKI-resistant disease. ABL1 kinase mutation analysis did not show any resistance-associated mutations. He was switched to the second generation TKI therapy with dasatinib in June 2018. BCR-ABL1 transcripts level by qRT-PCR on peripheral blood was 61.726% by international scale (IS) prior to dasatinib. Follow-up result in October 2018 was 17.046% by IS, with a log reduction of 0.706. There was response to dasatinib noted at 3 months with more than 50% decrease from baseline levels . Although he was still above the desired 10% mark, we decided to continue treatment and revaluate again in 3 months. Unfortunately, the patient was lost to follow-up after that office visit.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

In a MD Anderson Cancer Center study, P190 <sup>BCR-ABL </sup> CML represented only 1% of patients with CML and it was associated with an inferior outcome to therapy with TKI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. P190 <sup>BCR-ABL </sup> CML is often associated with peripheral monocytosis, absence of splenomegaly and bone marrow morphologic features that are intermediate between CML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. It has also been associated with frequent additional cytogenetic abnormalities. A recent study presented at the 2019 American Society of Hematology meeting recommended P190 <sup>BCR-ABL </sup> CML to be considered as a high-risk group. The authors from Helsinki University demonstrated that p190 activates specific cancer pathways, notably Src signaling and interferon pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Management of these patients requires strict TKI response monitoring and early consideration of stem cell transplant in eligible patients. Frontline use of the second generation TKI in patients with P190 <sup>BCR-ABL </sup> CML should be strongly considered.\n\n【10】Case 2: primary imatinib resistance with ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations\n\n【11】A 37-year-old African American male was initially admitted to our center for persistent headache and fatigue. His CBC showed WBC of 323 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, Hb of 6.7 g/dL, and platelets of 1,120 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL. WBC differential showed 28% myelocytes and 4% blasts. He underwent a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy in September 2017 which showed a markedly hypercellular marrow (100% cellularity) with myeloid hyperplasia and increased atypical megakaryocytes. Chromosome analysis showed 46XY karyotype with translocation (9;22). BCR-ABL by qRT-PCR was detected at 42.369% by IS involving the major break point 通用删除11(英):<u>(p210)</u>. Molecular profiling showed ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations. He was started on imatinib at time of hospitalization. He achieved a complete hematological response with imatinib, but no molecular response. ABL1 kinase mutation analysis was done in January 2018 with no mutations detected. He was then switched to dasatinib 100 mg daily in May 2018 with eventual dose reduction to 70 mg due to grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity with diarrhea. He failed to achieve a molecular response to dasatinib. In January 2019 he was switched to ponatinib and referred for allogeneic stem cell transplant evaluation. BCR-ABL1 transcript level by qRT-PCR prior to initiation of ponatinib was 38.848%. Fluctuating transcript levels were attributed to issues with treatment adherence. Latest qRT-PCR results in December 2019 (11 months after ponatinib initiation) showed a BCR-ABL1 level of 2.350% by IS with a 1.485 log reduction .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. Percentage of p210 BCR-ABL1 via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) over time according to TKI choices. TKI: tyrosine kinase inhibitor. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Patients with CML diagnosed in the chronic phase can be triaged into initial TKI treatment choice based upon prognostic scoring systems, such as Sokal or European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS), with higher risk patients generally being offered frontline second-generation TKIs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Our patient was high risk based upon the Sokal system, but unfortunately was not a candidate for the second generation TKI due to cost and insurance issues. The patient achieved a complete hematologic response with imatinib but did not show any signs of molecular response with rising BCR-ABL1 transcript levels. Primary imatinib failure in chronic phase CML is not an uncommon scenario, and patients in this category may still achieve a response to the second and third generation TKI with a 72% overall survival at 3 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Our patient was tested for ABL1 kinase mutation and found to be negative, which is seen in about 50% of patients who are non-responders to TKI medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Next-generation sequencing performed at the time of diagnosis revealed ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations. It has been previously described that the development of clonal evolution is associated with decrease in both response and overall survival with the use of imatinib 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. More recently there has been growing evidence that both ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations are associated with TKI resistance and progression to more advanced stages of CML 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Next-generation sequencing for common myeloid somatic mutations may be helpful to determine the risk of initial TKI failure in patients with chronic phase CML.\n\n【15】Case 3: primary imatinib resistance with c.1424 35-NT mutation\n\n【16】A 45-year-old female was admitted to our center in June 2017 with hyperleukocytosis. Her initial CBC showed WBC of 334 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, Hb of 8.7 g/dL and platelets of 268 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL. WBC differential showed 23% myelocytes, 12% metamyelocytes, 3% promyelocytes, and 4% blasts. She underwent a diagnostic bone marrow in June 2017 showing a hypercellular marrow with 100% cellularity. Cytogenetics showed 46XX karyotype with positive t(9;22). The FISH studies confirmed t(9;22). She had some delays in starting treatment due to financial barriers but was eventually started on imatinib 400 mg once a day. She achieved a complete hematological response rapidly. However, she continued to have persistent detection of BCR-ABL mutation at 12.7% with log reduction of 0.773 at 6 months . A mutation analysis was performed showing an ABL kinase domain mutation, specifically a c.1424 35-NT insertion. By the end of January 2018, she was started on bosutinib 500 mg per day. The patient developed significant gastrointestinal toxicity and required a dose reduction to 400 mg per day. She achieved a major molecular response 12 months after bosutinib initiation, which has sustained so far with latest qRT-PCR in July 2019 showing 0.016% by IS with log reduction of 3.571 . The patient continued to have major molecular response after bosutinib dose reduction.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3. Percentage of p210 BCR-ABL1 via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) over time according to TKI choices. TKI: tyrosine kinase inhibitor. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】This case highlights another instance of failure to achieve an adequate response with frontline imatinib. The patient was initially treated with imatinib with an increase in BCR-ABL transcripts nearly two-fold from baseline. A prior study has indicated that two-fold rises in consecutive samples of BCR-ABL transcripts predicts a greater than 60% possibility of identifying a kinase domain mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. The patient had ABL1 kinase mutation analysis that showed a c.1424 35-NT insertion. Point mutations are generally thought to confer resistance to imatinib therapy and nearly 100 different types have been documented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Interestingly, this patient’s point mutation has conflicting reports as to its contribution to TKI resistance. One group reported that a 35-base pair insertion alters the tyrosine kinase in a manner similar to the T315I mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Another group concluded that the 35-NT insertion did not correlate with TKI resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. The patient was ultimately transitioned to bosutinib with an excellent response achieving a major molecular response (MMR). Our case demonstrates that 35-NT insertions can lead to imatinib resistance and may respond to the second generation TKIs.\n\n【20】Case 4: positive fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for t(9;22) with negative RT-PCR for BCR-ABL1\n\n【21】A 72-year-old female initially presented to our center for evaluation of leukocytosis. Her CBC showed WBC of 73 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, Hb of 12 g/dL and platelets of 464 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL. WBC differential showed 3% myelocytes, 14% metamyelocytes and 1% blasts. The cytogenetic analysis on peripheral blood showed an abnormal female karyotype, with t(9;22) on all cells examined. FISH analysis confirmed t(9;22) in 95.5% of analyzed nuclei (normal < 1.5%). BCR-ABL by PCR was negative, including standard p210, p190 testing and non-standard BCR-ABL PCR testing for p230. She was started on the frontline treatment with imatinib in July 2018. She achieved a complete morphologic response but soon after developed grade 3 skin rash and was unable to tolerate imatinib further. She was then switched to dasatinib. FISH analysis on peripheral blood was reported as negative in February 2019 (6 months after initiation of therapy). FISH has remained undetectable since then, except for a one-time low level positive at 2% during a temporary TKI-treatment interruption. She has been reluctant to have a bone marrow biopsy performed from time of initial diagnosis. We have provided frequent education regarding its importance for morphological evaluation, and for the subsequent assessment of cytogenetic response. Most recent peripheral blood FISH in September 2019 remains undetectable.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Peripheral blood studies for detection of t(9;22) or BCR-ABL1 are not considered enough for diagnosis of CML. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is required for all patients in whom CML is suspected. It will confirm the diagnosis and provide information needed for staging in terms of the blast and basophil percentages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Our patient was informed in detail of the rationale behind a diagnostic bone marrow examination, but she still refused. To further complicate the situation, although cytogenetics and FISH on peripheral blood were both positive, molecular testing for BCR-ABL1 transcripts by RT-PCR was negative making response assessment challenging. Possible reasons for discordance between FISH and RT-PCR testing were discussed with molecular pathologist. Standard commercial testing included reverse transcription of extracted sample ribonucleic acid (RNA) to complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) for BCR-ABL1 fusions e13a2, e14a2 通用删除11(英):<u>(p210)</u> and e1a2 通用删除11(英):<u>(p190)</u>. Additional non-standard testing for e19a2 通用删除11(英):<u>(p230)</u> was also performed. A false-negative PCR result was considered initially, but repeated testing was consistently negative making sampling or procedural errors unlikely. We believe the discordant results in this case could be explained by the presence of an atypical fusion transcript. Rare breakpoints having junction configurations other than e13a2, e14a2, e1a2 or e19a2 have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Management of these cases is challenging, especially when access to advanced molecular testing is limited. Most practices rely on standardized send-out testing using commercially available products. After extensive discussion with the patient, it was agreed to initiate TKI therapy and to monitor using FISH on peripheral blood. For correlative purposes, a complete cytogenetic response was considered equivalent to a negative FISH test (± 2%), given the lack of a marrow examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Conclusions\n\n【25】Upfront treatment with imatinib although attractive from a cost benefit standpoint has limitations for selected patients with unusual BCR-ABL1 transcripts or presence of specific mutations. The second generation TKIs are appropriate in these situations as frontline therapy. Close monitoring, transition to ponatinib if no response to the second generation TKIs and consideration of bone marrow transplant evaluation in eligible patients is recommended.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received.

Compared with adriamycin, pirarubicin is more rapidly taken up by bladder tumor cells and is able to exert an antitumor effect on a bladder tumor in a shorter time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. However, this procedure is not always harmless. When a bladder perforation or near perforation occurs during or after TUR, the immediate instillation of a chemotherapeutic agent may cause extravesical leakage such as leakage into the retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. We report a case wherein the patient died because of acute respiratory failure associated with systemic tumor seeding after the immediate postoperative instillation of pirarubicin through a bladder injury caused by intravesical explosion.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】An 82-year-old man with type 2 diabetes presented with multiple papillary tumors on the posterior bladder wall and in the dome of the bladder . He underwent a TUR under general anesthesia. The transurethral resection in saline (TURis) system was used for TUR with a 24 Fr sheath. The cutting and coagulation powers were set to 280 watts and 100 watts, respectively. During the resection of papillary tumors, an intravesical explosion of the air bubbles at the bladder dome occurred with little sound. However, bladder perforation was not detected. The surgery time was 59 min and the amount of bleeding was very minimal. A three-way 20 Fr Foley catheter was placed inside the bladder. An immediate postoperative instillation of 30 mg pirarubicin in 30 mL saline was maintained in the bladder for 5 min. He received continuous saline bladder irrigation after the TURis. When he returned to the general hospital room after surgery, he complained of severe abdominal pain. On examination, he was afebrile (36.0 °C) and had a blood pressure of 117/50 mm Hg and a pulse rate of 53 beats per minute. Oxygen saturation was 100% under 5 L of oxygen. He did not have gross hematuria under manual bladder irrigation. Bladder injury was suspected because a noncontrast abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a collection of fluid in the abdominal cavity. A second CT cystogram showed extravasation of the contrast agent from the dome of the bladder . He had been scheduled for an exploratory laparotomy; therefore, he was moved again to the operating room. However, his abdominal pain had disappeared. Ultrasonography revealed the loss of fluid from the abdominal cavity, and his laparotomy was consequently postponed.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

On examination, he was afebrile (36.5 °C) and had a blood pressure of 102/56 mm Hg and a pulse rate of 63 beats per minute. Oxygen saturation was 95% in room air. He was diagnosed as having an extensive intraperitoneal bladder injury caused by intravesical explosion during TURis after the immediate postoperative intravesical instillation of a single dose of pirarubicin. Eight days after surgery, a cystogram showed no extravasation of the contrast agent . Nine days after surgery, the patient was discharged in good condition because he could urinate after the removal of the urethral catheter. Histologic examination confirmed G2 pTa urothelial carcinoma.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3. Eight days after surgery, a conventional cystogram shows no extravasation of the contrast agent from the bladder dome. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【8】After discharge, he received 30 mg pirarubicin intravesical instillation therapy four times. Three months after surgery, he underwent cystoscopy because of the recurrence of gross hematuria. A hemorrhagic ulcerous tumor was found near the perforated area. Therefore, he underwent a second TURis 3.5 months after the first TURis. Pathological findings were urothelial carcinoma (G2, pT1).\n\n【9】After discharge, gross hematuria also recurred. Therefore, he underwent bladder magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Bladder wall invasion in the bladder dome was suspected . Dyspnea and chest pain appeared 4.5 months after the first TURis. Positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) showed abnormal accumulation in the right superior supraclavicular fossa, left rib , bilateral lungs , right pleura, left internal iliac lymph node, lumbar spine, sacrum , bilateral pubic bone , and right femur.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 4.

On examination, he was afebrile (36.7 °C) and had a blood pressure of 108/52 mm Hg and a pulse rate of 86 beats per minute. Oxygen saturation was 91% in room air. The next day, he died because of acute respiratory failure.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】A small intravesical explosion, which usually manifests as a “pop” sound, would be experienced during transurethral surgery. Damage to the bladder because of a major intravesical explosion can range from small mucosal tears to bladder rupture, which can be intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal. Intravesical explosions occur because of the production of explosive gases during use of diathermy on human tissues. Hydrogen is formed by the pyrolysis of bladder tissue caused by diathermy, and it collects under the dome of the bladder. Hydrogen alone is not explosive; it only becomes explosive when admixed with oxygen. Oxygen is not produced in sufficient quantity during diathermy to cause explosions but it can enter the bladder from the atmosphere during endoscopic procedures. Once hydrogen combines with oxygen, it becomes explosive and can be ignited by spark generated during electrosurgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】In this patient, a small explosion occurred while resecting the dome tumor, but the surgeon did not care. A near perforation was observed in the bladder, but a clear perforation was not detected with cystoscopy. Therefore, pirarubicin was immediately instilled postoperatively. Symptoms of peritoneal irritation such as abdominal colic and abdominal distension were severe because pirarubicin, which had been injected immediately after surgery, had leaked out of the bladder. Bladder extravasation was confirmed by cystogram CT examination and the patient was diagnosed as having peritonitis caused by bladder perforation. Repair surgery for bladder perforation was urgently scheduled. However, the patient’s symptoms were relieved by analgesics and catheter placement; therefore, his operation was postponed.\n\n【16】It is important that physicians recognize abdominal symptoms such as peritonitis and ileus in patients who have received intravesical chemotherapy immediately after TUR of bladder tumor (TURBT). Transurethral surgery is often performed under spinal anesthesia to help confer good postoperative analgesia and to reduce the stress response to surgery. The early detection of hyponatremia associated with TUR syndrome is facilitated in a conscious patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. If transurethral surgery is continued without the surgeon’s being aware of a bladder perforation in a patient during general anesthesia, then hyponatremia due to TUR syndrome may be aggravated because the patient is unconscious. However, the TURis procedure is less likely to cause TUR syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Poor postoperative analgesia after general anesthesia may have aided the appearance of prominent lower abdominal pain due to bladder perforation in the patient. This factor may have led to the early detection postoperatively of the bladder perforation.\n\n【17】It has been reported that bladder perforation during TURBT does not substantially increase the risk of extravesical tumor seeding, and that surgical repair of a bladder perforation during TURBT somewhat increases the risk of extravesical tumor cell recurrence and negatively affects a patient’s prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Owing to the low rate of tumor seeding resulting from bladder perforation during TURBT, extravesical seeding of a tumor may not have occurred during TURis in our patient. In the TURis system, fine air bubbles generated by plasma discharge will accumulate in the bladder dome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Bubbles make it difficult to recognize a top dome tumor. The accumulated air bubbles will need to be removed to reduce the possibility of intravesical explosion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Pirarubicin is more rapidly taken up by bladder tumor cells and can exert an antitumor effect on a bladder tumor in a shorter time. Therefore, immediate postoperative intravesical treatment with a chemotherapeutic agent after TUR for nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer is the standard of care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 4 \\]</u>. Systemic dissemination would unlikely occur in the early postoperative period because of the antitumor effect by the immediate postoperative intravesical instillation of pirarubicin. The pathological diagnosis confirmed G2, pTa urothelian carcinoma. However, the patient achieved systemic dissemination early after TURis. Systemic dissemination may result from the extravasation of tumor cells that may have remained, along with pirarubicin, in the bladder immediately after TURis. When bladder perforation is suspected during TUR, an immediate postoperative intravesical instillation of pirarubicin should be avoided.\n\n【18】Conclusions\n\n【19】Intravesival explosion is a rare complication, but it can lead to a serious condition. Urologists should pay attention to intravesical explosion, and must remove air bubbles during the resection of tumors in the bladder dome. For most patients with superficial bladder cancer, the benefits of immediate intravesical chemotherapy after TUR exceed the risk of serious complications. However, an immediate postoperative instillation has to be avoided when there is an obvious or suspect bladder perforation. Low-grade superficial bladder cancer has the possibility of tumor seeding. Therefore, it should be observed strictly after perforation.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was received for the publication of this study.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest associated with the work described in the manuscript.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The patient has provided permission for us to publish the features of his case, and the identity of the patient has been protected.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors were involved in patient care.

Though some patients may be asymptomatic, others present with rapidly progressing symptoms such as a cough, hoarseness, dyspnea, dysphagia, airway damage, vascular damage, or B symptoms (i.e. fever, night sweats, weight loss). Symptoms are typically due to the rapidly enlarging mass in the mediastinum, causing a mass effect on adjacent structures in the mediastinum including, but not limited to, the lungs and superior vena cava. The symptoms can also be due to pleural or pericardial effusions, which are rare complications of this malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.

At the onset of his symptoms, he described a sore throat, accompanied by a dry cough, and dyspnea in the supine position. These symptoms progressed towards early satiety and postprandial hidrosis. The patient denied fever, night sweats, vision change, chest pain, or unintentional weight loss. Family history was notable for thyroid and lung cancer on the paternal side of his family. Social history was significant for cigarette smoking and occasional alcohol consumption. The patient’s initial vital signs included a blood pressure 124/85 mm Hg, pulse rate 94, temperature 36.4 °C, respiratory rate 18, and oxygen saturation of 96% on ambient air. Physical exam revealed an obese male, audible S1 and S2 heart sounds, diminished breath sounds at the right lung base, and normal mentation. The physical exam did not demonstrate distended neck veins or pericardial friction rub.\n\n【5】Diagnosis\n\n【6】Laboratory evaluation was significant for mild normocytic anemia and an elevated D-dimer . A basic metabolic panel and serum troponin-I were within normal limits. Chest X-ray showed a density bordering the aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, and upper portion of the left heart . Subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest with intravenous (IV) contrast revealed a large anterior mediastinal mass with mass effect on adjacent structures, bilateral pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes . A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, revealing a large circumferential pericardial effusion with evidence of echocardiographic tamponade physiology, evidenced by less than 50% collapse of inferior vena cava and significant respiratory variation in the mitral and tricuspid inflow. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia (heart rate of 104) without evidence of electrical alternans or ischemia.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1.

The next day, an additional 260 mL of serosanguinous fluid was removed. Cytology and flow cytometry studies of the pericardial fluid were negative for malignancy. Due to a suspicion for malignancy, our medical oncologist was consulted, who recommended a biopsy of the mediastinal mass and bone marrow biopsy. A needle biopsy of the mediastinal mass was thus obtained by our interventional radiology specialist, and the sample was sent for review by our pathologist. Over the next 7 days, the patient continued to drain over 100 mL of fluid into the pericardial drain, so a repeat echocardiogram was obtained, showing re-accumulation of moderate amounts of pericardial fluid with continued signs of hemodynamic compromise. Consequently, the cardiothoracic surgeon was consulted and performed a successful pericardial window. Five days after the pericardial window, another echocardiogram was obtained, demonstrating resolution of cardiac tamponade.\n\n【11】At this point in time, the mediastinal mass biopsy results returned, demonstrating primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, as the tissue was positive for CD20, CD79a, B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)6, Bcl2, multiple myeloma 1 (MUM1), cellulary myc (c-myc), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), CD30, and nuclear protein Ki-67 (Ki-67). The bone marrow biopsy results also demonstrated rare isolated atypical lymphoid cells. Additional laboratory studies were obtained, showing a lactate dehydrogenase level of 2,158 U/L (normal range: 120 - 230), normal serum alpha fetoprotein level, and normal serum human chorionic gonadotropin level.\n\n【12】Treatment\n\n【13】Based on results of the diagnostic workup, our oncologist suggested starting R-EPOCH therapy (rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin). The patient was also started on allopurinol 300 mg oral daily and monitored for signs of tumor lysis syndrome, which he never developed. The day before hospital discharge, 20 days into admission, the pericardial drains were removed. The patient was also given filgrastim for a 7-day period with close follow-up in the outpatient oncology, cardiology, and primary care clinics.\n\n【14】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【15】To date, he is alive and well, and completing the remainder of his chemotherapy regimen. He has not had recurrence of cardiac tamponade and is tolerating chemotherapy well. He is also being followed closely in the medical oncology clinic.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】PMBCL derives from medullary thymic B cells and typically affects females in the third and fourth decades of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Previously, it was thought to be a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; however, it is now recognized as its own entity based on molecular features and represents approximately 2-4% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Symptoms at the time of diagnosis are attributed to the location of the mass in the anterior mediastinum, including cough, chest pain, and dyspnea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Although PMBCL typically is confined to the mediastinum, it may also involve surrounding structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Involvement of structures, such as the heart, bronchial tree, and superior vena cava may pose life-threatening risks to patients, representing an oncologic emergency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. PMBCL may present with pleural and pericardial effusions in up to approximately 50% of cases; however, cardiac tamponade as the primary manifestation of PMBCL is exceedingly rare. Only several case reports have noted cardiac tamponade as the primary diagnosis at the time of hospital admission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\- 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】The standard diagnostic workup for PMBCL includes complete hematologic examination, total body CT, mediastinal mass biopsy, and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Consistent with the current literature, our patient’s mediastinal mass biopsy results demonstrated positivity for CD20, CD79a, Bcl6, Bcl2, MUM1, c-myc, PD-L1, CD30, and Ki-67 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\- 12 \\]</u>. Additionally, PMBCL classically does not involve the bone marrow, as is the case for our patient. Clinically, the patient did not present with hypotension or electrical alternans; however, echocardiography demonstrated significant respirophasic changes of the inferior vena cava and disruption of mitral and tricuspid inflow, representing clinical cardiac tamponade. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis, but due to large pericardial output, he ultimately underwent a pericardial window for definitive pericardial drainage. Repeat echocardiography demonstrated resolution of tamponade and the patient was initiated on chemotherapy with rituximab, etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin (R-EPOCH). R-EPOCH therapy has become more popular since 2013 and has been shown to have high rates of complete response (84%) as opposed to an alternative regimen of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (R-CHOP), which showed 70% complete response. Additionally, R-EPOCH patients had less exposure to radiation when compared to patients undergoing R-CHOP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. As such, our oncologist decided to utilize R-EPOCH. He was safely discharged home with close outpatient primary care and oncology follow-up appointments, and he has not had any further re-admissions for cardiac tamponade.\n\n【19】This case is unique for several reasons. First, PMBCL is more common in females, and this patient is of male sex. Second, cardiac tamponade as the primary manifestation is rare, as previously mentioned. Third, the patient’s clinical exam did not demonstrate typical signs of cardiac tamponade, as in distended neck veins, pericardial friction rub, and hypotension; further, his electrocardiogram did not show evidence of electrical alternans. The diagnosis of cardiac tamponade was made through a transthoracic echocardiogram, which was obtained due to CT imaging demonstrating compression of the heart. Careful clinical consideration was made in the evaluation of this patient, and we believe that this is one of the major strengths of our case study. Another strength is that he underwent prompt therapeutic interventions and has had excellent outpatient follow-up with a primary care physician, cardiologist, and oncologist. The major limitation to our case report lies in the fact that there is a dearth of information in the current literature citing cardiac tamponade as a manifestation of PMBCL; despite this limitation, we believe that our case contributes well as an addition to the limited body of literature.\n\n【20】Conclusions\n\n【21】PMBCL is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and is currently defined as its own entity, separate from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This case highlights the rare instance in which PMBCL manifests primarily as cardiac tamponade. Additionally, PMBCL is uncommon in males, and we would like to contribute to the body of evidence citing a male patient afflicted by PMBCL. When presented with a patient that has a mediastinal mass, clinicians should remain vigilant for any signs or symptoms of cardiac tamponade, as this condition may progress towards a medical emergency if left untreated. Further investigation will need to be pursued into elucidating risk factors predisposing patients with PMBCL to cardiac tamponade and if there are any specific chemotherapeutic agents best suited for patients with tamponade.\n\n【22】Learning points\n\n【23】Our case report aims to contribute to the limited current body of literature citing cardiac tamponade as the primary manifestation of PMBCL. Clinicians should maintain a high degree of suspicion for PMBCL when a patient presents with cardiac tamponade and a large anterior mediastinal mass. Moving forward, future studies should collect larger patient sample sizes of PMBCL to identify risk factors associated with cardiac tamponade and if there are any specific chemotherapeutic agents best suited for patients who present with cardiac tamponade.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank and express their gratitude to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center’s exceptional nursing staff and unit managers for their expert clinical support.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no financial or funding disclosures.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare there is no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained from the family of the patient.

It has been reported that methylphenidate could rarely cause visual hallucinations, paranoid, somatic or reference delusions in with therapeutic doses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】The emergence of hallucinations has been attributed to a chronic increase at dopamin levels in synaptic cleft while the pathophysiological mechanisms are not clearly known. In some cases, hallucinations emerged after taking the first and low dose medication has been thought an effect of idiosyncratic mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Stimulants cause an increase of the releasing of catecholamines and a blockage of their getting back.

Sometimes suicidal thoughts, struggling in relationships with her mother. She had lost her father when she was 2 years old. Mother described that it is hard to get along with her for childhood period. Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-R) verbal score was 107, performance score was 120, total intelligence score was 114. In history there was no any psychotic symptom, no existence in any psychotic symptom or disorder in her family. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder plus generalised anxiety disorder plus oppositional defiant disorder was diagnosed with the Kiddie-schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia - present and lifetime version-Turkish version (K-SADS-PL-T) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> and treated with long-acting methylphenidate 36 mg per day. With the first day of the treatment, the tought which chased by a man continuously who saw him and came eye to eye for just one second with him in a market, watched via a candid camera by him when she was in her home, he wants to harm. During the two weeks period, although had never seen a more, when she was walking she was looking at behind frequently. The evaluation of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction (ADR) probability scale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> was 8. This symptom was evaluated as an adverse effect of methylphenidate. Methylphenidate were discontinued and began the atomoxetine and it was gradually increased. One week later, the delusion disappeared.\n\n【8】Case 2\n\n【9】A boy, 7.5 years of age, first grade student. While he was taking the first school again he still could not literary. He was hyperactive and fightfull and highly talkative. St Binet IQ was 85. He had never psychotic symptom, there was no family history regarding any psychotic symptom or disorder. DSM-IV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> criteria it was diagnosed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder and was began long-acted methylphenidate 18 mg per day treatment. With first dose, the fear which he can be able to harm himself was began. He was seeing the objects as larger-than-life, and also big flies. He has been timid. He was talking to himself, was doing meaningless gesture as if there someone was in the face of him. ADR probability scale score was 7. At the 4th day of after the discontinuation, the fears disappeared. Family did not accept another medication.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Both cases have complicated ADHD. In both, long-acted methylphenidate treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> were discontinued because it has caused the psychotic symptoms and after discontinuation, symptoms disappeared in a few days.\n\n【12】During the progress of ADHD, bipolar affective disorder or other psychiatric disorders can emerge as comorbid situation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In both cases, comorbid disorder diagnosis was excluded because of the psychotic symptoms has immediately appeared after the methylphenidate treatment and disappeared after discontinuation of it.\n\n【13】Ross showed that the prevalance of the psychotic or manic symptoms emerging after stimulant treatment was 0.25% (or a four hundredth) while some methodological problems. But, it has been argued that reports are insufficient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Kraemer et al. reported that 3 adult cases who had methylphenidat-induced psychotic disorder. After discontinuation and beginning the antipsychotic treatment, all of three patients’ symptoms disappeared 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Kraemer et al. argued that the less frequency of psychotic adverse effects due to methylphenidate is stem from the ignorence of this effect by science 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In the literature, it has been adressed that the paranoid psychosis can emerge during the treatment of narcolepsia with methylphenidate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> and it might be possible that the psychotic symptoms can occur because of the abuse of the methylphenidate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. In our country, a case emerging visual hallusination after the beginning the methylphenidate and fluoxetine treatment has been reported by Abali ve Mukaddes, in 2007 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Psychotic symptoms emerging after using the methylphenidate treatment is not very frequent and after discontinuation, it can immediately disappear. But this situation, sometimes can be fearful for family and it might be harmful for patient’s compliance to the medication. For all these reasons, clinicians should be aware of psychotic symptoms during the methylphenidate treatment of patient with ADHD, before thinking the any comorbid disorder, clinician should evaluate the methylphenidate adverse effect. Thus, it would gain to clinician the right way of the effective treatment.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors have declared that there is not any conflict of interests.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:42:47", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:42:56", "cost": 9.442}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:42:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:42:37"}

Despite this, a large proportion of patients with ESKD receive long term dialysis using tunnelled dialysis catheters. Right atrial thrombus related to dialysis catheters is well recognised complication and the mortality rate due to thrombus associated complications reaches 100% in untreated patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. In light of this, prompt diagnosis and treatment are vital for good patient outcome.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 49-year-old patient was admitted with clinical signs and symptoms of small bowel obstruction. His past medical history was notable for ESKD and 2 previous cadaveric renal transplants, 15 and 13 years ago respectively. Post transplant course was complicated by chronic allograft nephropathy. The patient had re-commenced haemodialysis (HD) four months prior via a right internal jugular vein tunnelled catheter. A peritoneal catheter was in place with a plan to transfer to peritoneal dialysis. He remained on low dose cyclosporine to minimise the risk of late rejection.\n\n【4】Four months before this presentation, the patient had a trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) prior to permanent catheter insertion, which did not demonstrate any intra- atrial lesion with a structurally and functionally normal heart. Since initiation of HD the patient did not experience any problems related to his vascular access; blood flows on HD averaged 300 - 350 mls/minute and Kt/V was adequate. He remained in his usual health until the night of admission when he presented with distended painful abdomen, nausea and vomiting.\n\n【5】As a part of clinical evaluation, the patient underwent CT abdomen and pelvis which incidentally revealed a 4.1 × 2.8 cm low attenuation filling defect within the right atrium, adherent to the inter-atrial septum, just opposite to the tip of the tunnelled catheter . TTE revealed a large inhomogeneous mass with echogenisity and echolucency typical of myxoma arising from inter-atrial septum . The patient was subsequently anti-coagulated with a plan to proceed to sternotomy and cardiotomy for mass removal.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The patient subsequently underwent excision of the right atrial mass. The mass was adherent to the inter-atrial septum necessitating excision of a small rim of right atrial muscle. The defect formed in the atrial wall was repaired with bovine pericardial patch. The dialysis catheter remained intact and was not removed. The intra-operative finding was of an ovoid 3.8 × 2.5 cm, shaggy mass with papillary surface, grey and brown attached to the inter-atrial septum on a broad stalk . Histological examination revealed fibrin layers and aggregates of platelets; characteristic of thrombus with no evidence of tumours cells .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

According to tumour registry database, the incidence of lymphoma and skin cancer is increased, while the incidence of solid organ cancer remains unaffected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Cases of cardiac malignancy have been described in patients following bone marrow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, cardiac 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> and kidney-pancreas transplant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The patient received immunosuppression for 17 years, therefore intra-cardiac malignancy was considered in the list of differential diagnoses. Additionally, the echographic findings, the location of the mass and the specificity of attachment were highly suggestive of myxoma. Cardiac tumours are rare with an incidence of 0.001-0.33%. Approximately 25 to 40% are myxomas and almost a quarter of these originate within the right atrium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Morphologically they can be polypoid, oval or round. They are more common in women, aged between 30 and 60, and approximately 10% are familial. The symptoms can vary from constitutional to serious complications such as pulmonary embolus and mitral valve obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The incidence of right atrial myxoma in HD patients with permanent dialysis catheters is not very well described and the incidence is not felt to be higher than the general population. TTE examination usually gives accurate visualisation of the right atrial mass. The patient also underwent TOE for precise location and detailed examination of stalk insertion; information which is invaluable in differentiating between cardiac myxoma and thrombus. Echocardiographic findings, gross appearance of the mass, and its characteristic location were all highly suggestive of right atrial myxoma rather than thrombus.\n\n【16】In contrast to this, right atrial thrombus in HD patients with long term catheter is a well recognised complication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Right atrial thrombus can also present as a mass and can be easily mis-diagnosed as a myxoma. According to Kurisu et al up to 6% of catheter-dependent patients have catheter related right atrial thrombus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. As many patients remain clinically asymptomatic; the incidence of right atrial thrombus may be even higher, as suggested by Ducatman et al who reported that up to 29% of HD patients with permanent catheter were found to have intramural thrombi based on post-mortem examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Pulmonary embolism is the most serious complication of intra-cardiac thrombi with mortality rate as high as 45% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Our patient received Cyclosporine for over 17 years. Cyclosporine has pro-coagulant properties causing release of von Willebrand Factor and P-selectin from the endothelium and increases Factor VIII levels which may have contributed to thrombus formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The location of the tip of dialysis catheter has another role to play. As mentioned by Latif T et al the optimal location for the catheter tip is at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium, but not within the atrium itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. This study showed that approximately 12.5% of the patients with the permcath tip within the right atrium developed thrombus at 1 week interval from insertion. The majority of thrombi were adherent to the interatrial wall, opposite to the tip of catheter, as seen in our patient.\n\n【18】The mechanism of thrombus formation at this site can be explained by the continuous mechanical trauma to the cardiac endothelium by the catheter tip with each cardiac beat. In addition, high blood flow during the haemodialysis adds to the endothelial damage. All above activate the coagulation cascade, which result in clot formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】As the diagnosis was uncertain prior to surgery, the patient was fully anti-coagulated with low molecular heparin to minimise the risk of local complications and systemic embolic events. Despite this, HD delivery became problematic due to poor blood flow through the tunnelled catheter.\n\n【20】The optimal management of catheter-associated right atrial thrombus is not well described. It has been suggested previously that management is dependent on the size of the thrombus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\- 21 \\]</u>. If thrombus is under 2 cm, removal of the catheter is probably adequate, although Ghani et al suggest systemic anticoagulation for at least 2 weeks prior to catheter removal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. The most serious complication of a large right atrial thrombus is pulmonary embolism. According to Edward et al the mortality rate from this complication can reach 45% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In light of this, it is suggested that if the thrombus is larger than 2 cm, an immediate surgical thrombectomy should be considered along with the removal of the catheter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 21 \\]</u>. The selection of patients for surgery is generally based on extent and severity of comorbid disease. Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy may be a reasonable treatment alternative in high-risk patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, clear guidelines regarding the management of catheter related thrombus are not available. In our patient, the nature of the mass wasn’t clear and although asymptomatic initially, his clinical condition deteriorated rapidly. In this case surgical approach was inevitable and the only correct option.\n\n【21】In conclusion the case highlights that right atrial thrombus related to tunnelled dialysis catheter can be mistaken for right atrial myxoma even with adequate echocardiography.

The purpose of this study was to investigate an adverse drug event and its associated black box warning of pericardial effusion. I hypothesized that minoxidil was the cause of recurrent pericardial effusion in a patient whom underwent a pericardial window. I reviewed multiple studies consisting of observational studies, prospective observational studies using search words such as “pericardial effusion”, “drug related pericardial effusion”, “minoxidil and pericardial effusion”, “minoxidil black box warning” in PubMed, UptoDate, and Journal of American Medical Association.\n\n【2】Although the cause of the pericardial effusion in the patient discussed here is uncertain, malignancy, uremia, MI and autoimmune disease were ruled out. It is important to note that despite undergoing a pericardial window, the effusion did not resolve until minoxidil was discontinued.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 60-year-old Caucasian male with a medical history significant for hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, abdominal aortic aneurysm, polycystic kidney disease status post right nephrectomy, sick sinus syndrome status post St. Jude pacemaker placement and diet controlled diabetes, presented to the emergency room secondary to elevated blood pressure reading greater than 200/100 at home. He reported medication compliance, except for his minoxidil, which he had not taken for 1 week. Patient also reported sharp, non-radiating chest pain exacerbated by movement. He stated that he had experienced chest pain similar in quality in the past, and that he did not believe his current pain to be cardiac in origin. Patient was admitted to the cardiac service and his minoxidil, as well as his other home medications were restarted. Blood pressure returned to baseline. A chest X-ray was obtained at the time of admission and showed enlargement of the cardiac pericardial silhouette with clear lungs and no evidence of consolidation or effusions. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was found to be 987 and a two-dimensional cardiac echo was obtained which showed a moderate pericardial effusion with some signs of early tamponade physiology: diastolic right atrial collapse (< 50% of diastole), mild respirophasic variation (< 25% mitral inflow variation) and dilated non-collapsible inferior vena cava (IVC), although the patient was hypertensive at the time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. A consult was placed to cardiothoracic surgery for consideration of a pericardial window. The following morning the pericardial window was performed and approximately 550 cc was evacuated. Fluid was sent for cytology and cultures. Cytology was negative for malignancy and there was no growth of microorganisms. A pericardial biopsy was obtained without evidence of tumor or inflammation. Serum histone Ab, anti-DS DNA, SS-B, and SS-A were negative. C3 and C4 were within normal limits, as was myeloperoxidase AB and proteinase AB. Patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit for observation. He remained stable with blood pressures well controlled. He was discharged home with a refill of minoxidil.\n\n【5】Nine days later, the patient returned to the emergency room with reported shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and increased chest pain. Repeat two-dimensional echocardiogram was performed and demonstrated a large, free flowing pericardial effusion, circumferential to the heart with moderate atrial chamber collapse. Ejection fraction was estimated to be 55%. There was evidence for increased right ventricle-left ventricle interaction demonstrated by respirophasic changes in tricuspid velocities. Features were consistent with mild tamponade physiology. A large residual pericardial effusion was identified. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for recurrent pericardial effusion. CT angiogram of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolus, but significant for a large pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left. Right thoracotomy was performed, as well as a pericardial window and biopsy. The patient’s systolic blood pressure was increased by 10 mm Hg upon drainage of the pericardial collection. Cytology was non-revealing as was cytometry. The patient’s creatinine throughout the hospital course ranged from 1.0 to 2.0 with appropriate urine output and a BUN of 11 - 28. Minoxidil was discontinued at that time due to high suspicion that the medication was the culprit for the recurrent pericardial effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4-6 \\]</u>. Repeat echo on post operation day 7 of pericardial window showed the estimated ejection fraction to be in the range of 55%. Compared to prior transthoracic echocardiogram, there was interval resolution of large circumferential pericardial effusion. There was a small loculated inferior effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Minoxidil is a direct acting vasodilator used for the treatment of hypertension. Side effects observed with the drug are peripheral edema (7%), pericardial effusion with tamponade (3%), pericardial effusion without tamponade (3%), angina pectoris, heart failure, pericarditis, rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and sodium and water retention. Patients with renal impairment are at higher risk for developing pericardial effusions, although this adverse effect has been documented in patients with normal renal function as well. The exact mechanism behind pericardial effusion in patients taking minoxidil is not clearly understood. Pericardial effusion in minoxidil-treated patients has been attributed to uremia, as well as the salt and water retention consequent of the vasodilatory effect of the drug. Review of the literature suggests that pericardial effusion is uncommonly observed in patients treated with minoxidil unless accompanied by cardiac or renal failure.\n\n【8】The patient reviewed in this case had underlying renal disease; however, renal function during hospitalization was within normal limits and at his baseline. His creatinine on discharge was 1.2, with a glomerular filtration rate of greater than 60, despite having a diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease. Literature has hypothesized that the increased incidence of minoxidil-associated pericardial effusion is higher in the renal disease population due to their susceptibility for uremia and salt and water retention; however, that did not appear to be the explanation for our patient’s adverse effect. Although the cause of the pericardial effusion in the patient discussed here is uncertain, malignancy, uremia, MI and autoimmune disease were ruled out. It is important to note that despite undergoing a pericardial window, the effusion did not resolve until minoxidil was discontinued, underlying the importance of acknowledging the link between minoxidil and pericardial effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7-11 \\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:35:16", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:36:04", "cost": 47.797}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:36:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:35:16"}

The personal background of the patient includes gallstones and cholelithiasis. The patient has a family history of colon cancer (two brothers). At physical examination the patient had good general condition, no fever without spontaneous pain. On palpation, she showed a globular abdomen at the level of right upper quadrant, with tenderness in the right iliac fossa. Blumberg's sign was negative. Laboratory tests showed 12,000 leukocytes without neutrophilia or eosinophilia. The other values were normal. Radiological techniques demonstrated a thickening of the right bowel wall without occluding the light with ascitic fluid. With suspicion of intestinal cancer in the right colon, colonoscopy was performed, which demonstrated no tumor process that emerges from the intestinal mucosa. Since the patient remained in severe pain, along with clinical suspicion and family history of bowel cancer, right hemicolectomy with ileocolic anastomosis was performed. The macroscopic study and the opening of the surgical specimen showed an increase in thickness of the wall. We show the level of the mucosa in an area slightly eroded, with the presence of an elongated structure, 1 cm in length, which penetrated the mucosa intestinal (we suggested a parasite) . Histological study of intestinal thickening showed a slightly eroded mucosa, edema at the level of the submucosa with vascular congestion. At the level of deep and superficial muscle layer, an intense acute inflammatory infiltrate with abundant eosinophils was identified. At the level of blood extravasation, there was serous mesothelial hyperplasia . Histological examination of the filamentary structure corresponded with a parasitic nematode, showing a thick cuticle, neural cord, and gastrointestinal structure . With all these findings the diagnosis was made of Anisakiasis of the colon. No evidence of malignant tumor process was seen. The patient reported taking fish in the last month.

These crustaceans are eaten by a fish or cephalopods such as octopus or squid, staying the nematode in the gut wall, into the muscle or under the skin. Humans become infected by eating raw or undercooked fish 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 8 \\]</u>. Three species of Anisakis larvae are pathogenic to humans: Anisakis simplex, Pseudoterranova decipiens, and Contracaecum. The areas with the highest incidence of cases caused by Anisakis are Japan, Netherlands and South America, although in recent years there has been a surge in non-endemic countries caused by an exchange of food cultures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】The highly variable clinical manifestations, digestive disorders are more common as right iliac fossa pain, obstruction, abdominal pain, vomiting, epigastric pain and bleeding. They may also have allergic skin reactions in the form of generalized papular erythema. These symptoms are caused by local action of the parasite causing gastrointestinal disturbances and hypersensitivity reactions mediated by IgE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\- 12 \\]</u>. According to laboratory values, the eosinophilia is not usually present in the gastric or intestinal Anisakiasis as showing in most cases, and leukocytosis is not usually present in the intestinal involvement as in our case. Serological diagnosis and skin testing are important in acute and chronic cases. Elisa Western Blott, monoclonal antibodies, eosinophilic cationic protein and IgE determination to Anis 1 are used.\n\n【11】The differential diagnosis should be performed with numerous processes such as eosinophilic enteritis, appendicitis, diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, ischemia, tuberculosis and malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】There are studies to control the growth of the disease and control mechanisms and prevention. It was found that before taking fish kept at -20 degrees for 24 hours or 60 degrees for 10 minutes the larva is not viable. Treatment of Anisakiasis is the administration of anthelmintics for 1 - 2 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】We think that with a good clinical history detailed in food intake after a good box accompanied, abdominal radiologic and endoscopic study is crucial for the diagnosis of Anisakiasis.

The onset of symptoms is usually marked by severe pain and swelling of the extremities with symmetrical induration. Progressively the patient will present orange peel skin with hyperpigmentation that develops to an extreme induration with corky thickening, disabling him in its full mobility.\n\n【3】Visceral involvement is rare on this disease, although some cases are described with pulmonary involvement. Eosinophilic fasciitis is also associated with hematologic malignancies, including lymphoproliferative disease, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, as well as certain drugs (namely statins).\n\n【4】Eosinophilic fasciitis as scleroderma-like syndrome, although uncommon, has an increasingly diverse spectrum of clinical manifestations, not only expressed by skin thickening or edema, making more alluring the diagnosis of this entity.\n\n【5】The diagnosis is based on clinical features and confirmed by skin and/or muscle biopsy showing inflammation, deposition of collagen fibers and lymphocytic infiltration or plasma cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 3 \\]</u>. Analytical peripheral eosinophilia, increased sedimentation rate and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia could be present.\n\n【6】The differential diagnosis with other entities that present with skin sclerosis and peripheral eosinophilia is essential, such as scleroderma, polymyositis, hypereosinophilic syndrome and Churg-Strauss vasculitis.\n\n【7】Treatment of Eosinophilic Fasciitis is based on corticosteroids at high doses, as described in literature. However, in refractory cases, the use of hydroxychloroquine and immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine or azathioprine are described.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 52-year-old woman, without antecedents of relief or chronic medication, presented to our hospital with a four months evolution of diffuse and symmetric cutaneous induration of limbs and trunk, sparing only the fingers. Associately she referred a decreased mobility of the acral skeleton by the skin induration, however without joint involvement. No history of Raynaud's phenomenon or other extra-cutaneous symptoms were reported. Physical examination showed orange peel skin in thighs and grade 3 thickening skin in the upper and lower limbs and trunk  without sclerodactyly. Laboratory data asserted absence of eosinophilia, increased sedimentation rate and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Immunological study just revealed a positive antinuclear antibody (1/320) titer. Nailfold capillaroscopy did not show scleroderma pattern. Other diagnostic exams, including chest and abdominal imaging, documented absence of visceral involvement or neoplasia. The patient underwent skin biopsy that showed atrophic epidermis and thickened dermis with fibrosis and little inflammatory activity. Muscle biopsy showed fibrotic involvement of muscle and fascia, with few inflammatory infiltrates . All the clinical history, analytical and imagiological data corroborated the diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis, therefore the patient started prednisolone 1mg/kg/day, with partial regression of skin lesions. Twelve months after the beginning of this treatment, the patient achieved full mobility to perform all basic tasks, such as dressing and eating. At the moment, she presents a normal skin on the trunk and thighs and maintains grade 3 skin thickening on the legs and grade 2 on upper limbs, and with analytically normalized inflammatory parameters. The patient is still taking a low dose of corticosteroids without any intercurrence.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Many times, it’s possible to identify a \"trigger\" that causes this entire cascade. It is described in the literature its association with trauma, strong physical exercise and some infections, but its reproducibility is poor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Eosinophilic Fasciitis is a rare disease and its diagnosis is not always easy. The skin sclerosis is a common manifestation to several diseases, including the scleroderma (systemic and local) and scleroderma-like syndromes. Eosinophilic Fasciitis or Shulman syndrome should be part of differential diagnosis in the management of these patients. Thus the combination of clinical history with physical examination findings, such as symmetrical induration of the skin, swelling, pain or redness associated with peripheral eosinophilia, and aided by a muscle or skin biopsy, allowed us to confirm the definitive diagnosis of Eosinophilic Fasciitis.\n\n【15】Eosinophilic Fasciitis is a disease which appears initially with erythema and edema of the members associated with cutaneous induration that progressively limits the patients’ mobility. In the initial phase of the disease, peripheral eosinophilia and infiltration of skin and muscle are usually present. However, when the patient seeks medical help very late, eosinophilic blood count is normal and the tissue infiltration is rare, usually showing sclerosis and lymphocytic infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\- 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The imaging methods are more and more precious in clinical diagnosis. The biopsy of the skin or muscle tissue is essential, although, actually Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of soft tissues has played a major role in assisting the diagnosis of this disease, not only for monitoring the disease, but also to assess the most appropriate place for biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. MRI of the lower limbs in T1 and T2 weighted with gadolinium injection may show diffuse thickening of the inflammatory nature of the muscle fascia, as well as the preservation of hypersignal of the muscles in the absence of myositis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\- 12 \\]</u>. The patient in our clinical case was not submitted to this diagnostic exam because it wasn’t available in utility time compared with the biopsy. This imaging method is being used increasingly as an instrument of great accuracy for the diagnosis of Eosinophilic Fasciitis. It contains specific alterations of this disease and will be very important in the differential diagnosis of other scleroderma-like diseases.\n\n【17】Steroid therapy is the first line treatment of this disease as the main aim is the resolution of fibrotic manifestations in the tissues. Treatment with prednisolone or its equivalent should be initiated with doses of 0.5 – 1 mg/kg/day that should be maintained until clinical improvement and decreased slowly until the complete clinical remission. In some cases, where the disease is more aggressive at presentation, with particular involvement of skin of the neck, trunk or a consumptive board, the dosage of corticosteroids should be greater or a combination of immunosuppressive agents should be done 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 \\]</u>.

In general, ezetimibe has less effect of lowering serum LDL-Cho levels than those of statins. Therefore, ezetimibe is usually prescribed with statins or fibrates to reduce serum LDL-Cho levels sufficiently in most cases, and is seldom prescribed alone.\n\n【3】We experienced a case of hypercholesterolemia resistant to statins, but well responsive to ezetimibe. Accelerated absorption of cholesterol in the intestine, rather than increased LDL-Cho synthesis, seemed a major cause of hypercholesterolemia in this case.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】The case was a 58-year-old female with hypercholesterolemia that had been repeatedly pointed out by the health check for the past several years. Although the patient had received one of a strong statin, pitavastatin, from an outpatient clinic, serum LDL-cholesterol levels had not been suppressed sufficiently, and stayed above 200 mg/dl. Then the patient visited Toride Kyodo General Hosptial to undergo further examinations for finding out more effective treatments against her hypercholesterolemia. The patient had no past history of any disease other than hypercholesterolemia, which was not found in her family and relatives. The patient counseled dietitians on cholesterol-restriction diet, and any unusual eating habit was not identified. She did not receive any other kinds of drugs and supplements.\n\n【6】The patient was 159 cm tall and weighed 54.4 kg (BMI 21.5). The blood pressure was 96/64 mmHg. Heart sounds were normal and rhythm was regular. The lungs were clear. The bruit was not audible in the neck and the abdomen. Any xanthoma-like lesion was not found in her conjunctiva and ankles.\n\n【7】According to the health check done in September 2009 when the patient did not receive any drugs, serum total cholesterol (T Cho) and LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-Cho) of the patient was 315 and 209 mg/dl, respectively . On the first visit, serum total cholesterol (T Cho) and LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-Cho) of the patient was 303 and 204 mg/dl, respectively . Any other abnormal findings were not noted in the routine blood examination . By initiating another strong statin, 2.5 mg/day of rosuvastatin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, these levels were suppressed to 279 mg/dl in T Cho and 193 mg/dl in LDL-Cho, but these effects seemed unsatisfactory. The drug adherence of the patient was repeatedly ensured during the counseling at the outpatient unit. Since similar ineffectiveness of pitavastatin prescribed before was noted, an inhibitor of cholesterol-absorption, ezetimibe (10 mg daily), was added to losuvastatin. A month later, her serum T Cho was decreased to 167 mg/dl, along with reduction of LDL-Cho to 90 mg/dl. The serum lathosterol, campesterol, sitosterol, and cholestanol were 320, 230, 150, and 360µg/dl, respectively under co-administration of losuvastatin and ezetimibe.

However, any known diseases or conditions related to increased cholesterol absorption were not identified in this case. Remarked effect of ezetimibe on serum cholesterol in this case suggested that accelerated cholesterol absorption, rather than increased cholesterol synthesis, subsequently elevated serum LDL-cholesterol levels. Since the amount of cholesterol absorption is regulated by the balance of excretion through ATP-binding cassette hetero-dimeric transportes G5/G8 (ABCG5/G8) and absorption through NPC1L1, genetic polymorphisms of either ABCG5/G8 or NPC1L1 affect serum LDL-Cho levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>, responses to ezetimibe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\- 18 \\]</u>, absorption of plant sterols 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>, and a consequent risk for coronary heart disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.

The incidence continues to slowly increase with improvements in diagnostic capabilities. Unfortunately cases detected and treated at early stages are rare. Clinical symptoms usually appear late and, signet-ring cell carcinomas are commonly detected at advanced stages. In this case report, we present our experience with a signet-ring cell carcinoma of the duodenal bulb with metastasis to the colon and ovary detected at a late stage in a 25-year-old Hispanic female along with a review the literature.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 25-year-old Hispanic female was admitted to the Howard University Hospital with four weeks complaint of epigastric, peri-umbilical pain, nausea, vomiting, early satiety and ten pound weight loss. The patient also reported a two day history of jaundice. Past medical history included pancreatitis and a history of recently diagnosed ovarian mass. She had a family history significant for a cousin diagnosed with leukemia. The patient denied tobacco, alcohol or any illicit drug use. On physical examination, the patient was found to have icterus, bilateral cervical adenopathy more prominent on the left, and bilateral lower quadrant tenderness. Pelvic examination revealed a ballottable right adnexal mass.\n\n【4】Laboratory study results showed a total bilirubin of 19.0 mg/dL with a conjugated picture, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels of 131 and 116 MU/ML, respectively (normal < 55 MU/ML) and alkaline phosphatase 914 MU/ML (normal 30 - 165 MU/ML). Amylase and lipase were 354 U/L and 468 U/L respectively (normal 28 - 100 and 22 - 51 U/L). Hemoglobin levels during admission ranged between 8 - 10 g/dL (normal 12 - 15 g/dl).Tumor markers obtained revealed an elevated cancer antigen-125(CA-125) at 458 U/mL (normal < 20 U/mL), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9 526), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 85 ng/mL (normal < 2.5 ng/mL) and alpha fetoprotein level of 55.8 ng/mL (normal < 6.1 ng/mL).\n\n【5】Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated moderately diffuse ascites, mild hepatomegaly with moderately diffuse heterogeneity of the parenchyma without evidence of a solid mass. There was extra-hepatic ductal dilatation without evidence of intrahepatic ductal dilatation. Transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated an enlarged right ovary. Subsequent computerized tomography of abdomen and pelvis confirmed moderate ascites, a diffusely heterogenous liver with numerous ill-defined foci. Bilateral heterogeneous adnexal masses with the largest being on the right measuring 5.5 × 4.0 cm were observed. A heterogeneous large kidney with decreased function was noted. There was small to moderate diffuse adenopathy.\n\n【6】Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of the right adnexal mass revealed poorly differentiated mucin producing adenocarcinoma with focal signet ring features . Immunostains revealed expression of CK7, CK20 and CDX2 which suggested a site of origin in the upper gastrointestinal tract . Bidirectional endoscopy was then performed. Upper endoscopy revealed an exophytic mass lesion extending from the duodenal bulb and obstructing distally appearing to involve the ampulla and causing jaundice . No obvious mass was noted in the stomach. Colonoscopy revealed multiple masses in the ascending, transverse, descending and sigmoid colon the largest being a 5 cm exophytic lesion. There was no evidence of familial adenomatous polyposis.

Chemotherapy was not recommended secondary to the patient’s overall poor performance status and significantly elevated liver tests. Biliary stenting and ureteral stenting was suggested for palliation. Unfortunately, the patient died before within a few days of admission.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Signet ring carcinoma of the duodenum was first described by Sekoguchi et al in 1979 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Histologically, the origin of signet-ring cells remains unknown. One theory regarding the etiology is that the signet cells are thought to originate in ectopic gastric mucosa found in the duodenum. Another theory is that the signet ring cell carcinoma arises from gastric type metaplastic epithelia. These metaplastic changes are considered to be a protective response to acid production and can usually be seen in the duodenal bulb 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In our case the endoscopy revealed a mass extending from the duodenal bulb and obstructing the ampulla. This was histologically consistent with poorly differentiated signet ring cell adenocarcinoma.\n\n【14】Signet ring cell tumors generally carry a poor prognosis regardless of site of origin with greater that 80% of SRC diagnoses present with advanced (stage III or IV) disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Duodenal cancers commonly occur in the ampullary or periampullary regions of the descending duodenum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>; however, these tumors are occasionally found in other portions of the duodenum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. If caught early, the preferred treatment for resectable lesions in the second and third portions of the duodenum is a pancreaticoduodenectomy with en bloc resection of adjacent tissues, including regional lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The most frequent clinical findings of duodenal cancer include epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, postprandial bloating, weight loss. There can be signs of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, such as guaiac-positive stool and iron-deficiency anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 , 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Unfortunately, most symptomatic patients with duodenal cancer have advanced lesions at presentation. As a result, these patients have a poor prognosis, with overall 5-year survival rates ranging from 20% to 40% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Factors affecting patient survival include the histologic grade of the tumor (the degree of differentiation and the nuclear grade), depth of invasion, presence or absence of nodal or distant metastases, duration of symptoms, and location of tumor in the duodenum (distal lesions have a better prognosis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Ovarian metastases occur in about 3% of all CRC patients and make up between 5% and 10% of all CRC metastases. The best known tumor of this type is the signet-ring adenocarcinoma (Krukenburg tumor) of gastric origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Carcinomas of the colon, appendix and breast are the next most common site of origin. This case is unique in that the small intestine (duodenal bulb) is not a frequent site of origin of Krukenburg tumor.\n\n【19】The limited number of cases of signet cell cancer reported in the duodenal bulb precludes any conclusions about survival associated with this histological variant.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflict of interests.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:54:09", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:54:37", "cost": 27.851}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:55", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:54:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:53:58"}

Panoramic radiograph  demonstrated that the tooth is displaced superiorly toward the maxillary sinus. Axial computed tomography (CT) scan showed that the tooth is located in the ITF between the maxillary sinus and the zygomatic arch . Alternatives of treatment, either surgical or conservative were discussed with the patient, who prefered to go ahead with the surgical. Then, under local anesthesia, via the extended intraoral incision, the tooth was retrieved through the incision and the displacement tract, using a curved hemostate.

Once it is suspected, the exact anatomic location is very important to be determined radiographically. The maxillary third molars may displace either palatally, into the antrum or buccaly into the ITF.\n\n【9】For the radiographic work-up, panoramic, occlusal, occipitomental radiographs can be used. However, CT-scan is the most useful technique, as it provides 3-D anatomical localization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Therapy attitute is based on clinical signs and symptoms, on surgeon skills and on patient decision. The complex anatomy of the ITF, the potential surgical morbidity, and the difficulty to obtain a good surgical exposure are among the limiting factors to initiate surgical treatment. However, as complications, such as infection, foreign body reaction or trismus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, may increase if the retrieval is delayed , speaks toward immediate surgery.\n\n【10】On the other hand it was claimed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\]</u> that the displaced tooth may migrate downward into the oral cavity vestibule, allowing an easy surgical removal, which argues toward the delayed surgical approach.\n\n【11】Regradless the timimg of the surgery, several surgical approaches have been used succsessfuly , such as; coronal, Gillies, Caldwell-Luc or resection of the coronoid proces 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>.

Nevertheless, even today, it may be useful to be aware of this sign that helps to further define opacity evident on conventional radiographs.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 74-year-old man presented with acute chest pain with enlarged left chest muscles.

The assessment of chest radiological observations is important in diagnosing and planning therapy in patients with chest-wall abnormalities. We report a case with metastatic tumors to soft tissue in chest wall with unique radiological observation of the incomplete border sign. To my knowledge, this sign on radiographs of the abdominal wall masses such as inguinal and femoral hernias, and chest wall masses such as metastatic prostate carcinoma, lipoma, and skin grafts, was first described by Mendelson in 1964 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This sign of extra-pleural masses of a chondrosarcoma of the rib was described by Ellis in 1977 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Recently, this abdominal incomplete border sign of an umbilical lipoma was reported by Catalano in 2002 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The classical example of this sign is the female breasts, which on the posteroanterior view is sharply defined inferiorly but indistinct superiorly where it blends with the chest wall. Indeed, the female breasts are readily apparent on physical examination. In contrast, the extra-pleural sign is a conventional radiographic finding that can be visualized on chest radiograph. Expanding lesions of structures in the chest wall, which is convex towards the lung, give rise to this sign, as a mound-like protrusion arising from the chest wall, border at its base than in height, and having obtuse angles with chest wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. As is evident, chest wall masses can arise from any of these component tissues, and may be located in the subcutaneous fat or within the chest wall muscles, or they may insinuate through the ribs to become subpleural or intrathoracic masses. These findings demonstrate the incomplete border sign or the extra-pleural sign on the chest radiograph.\n\n【9】In our case, the chest radiography of posteroanterior view revealed a radio-opaque lesion in the left lung field. The soft-tissue mass was characterized by a sharp, well-defined edge on the left lateral side. The ill-defined edge on the other side along at least one portion of its contour blends with the chest wall. Oblique view showed an extra pleural mass with a sharp margin. The incompleteness of the border of the mass was due to the fact that the site of anchorage of the mass abutted the musculus pectoralis, affording no radiographic contrast. Clearly, recognition of a mass arising from the chest wall is not difficult on physical examination. It is useful to be aware of the relationship existing between the mass and the X-ray beam on conventional radiographs.\n\n【10】The clinical distinction between a metastatic carcinoma to soft tissue and a primary soft-tissue sarcoma is critical because treatment and prognosis are markedly different. Malignant chest wall tumors are a heterogeneous group of tumors including invasive tumors, primary tumors, and metastatic tumors. Invasive chest wall tumors are relatively common, and the majority of the tumors in this group originated from the lung, breast, soft-tissue tumors, and skeletal tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Primary chest wall tumors account for less than 1% to 2% of all primary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These tumors develop in the bone, skins, and soft tissues of the thoracic cage. Metastatic chest wall tumors presenting as soft tissue masses are relatively rare, and the majority of the tumors reported in this group originated from the lung, breast, and head and neck tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In our case, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography was not performed, however, neither inspection of skin nor whole-body CT scan could detect any primary lesions. The site of origin was unknown. Squamous cells may arise from luminal epithelial cells, myoepithelial cells, or ductal metaplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】A remarkable treatment response was seen in our patient, who received platinum-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The therapeutic strategy for metastatic cancer of unknown primary site should always be individualized according to the clinical subset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Loco-regional management is the primary recommended treatment. The treatment of our type of patient should follow guidelines for locally advanced head and neck cancer or non-small cell lung cancer.

In the previous days, at home, he received treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid without clinical improvement.\n\n【7】On arrival to our attention, physical examination revealed blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate of 140 beats per minute, body temperature of 40 °C and oxygen saturation of 90%, so non-invasive ventilation was initiated. Blood samples showed high inflammatory markers with raised white blood cell count (WBC, 15.59 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL), neutrophilia (14.64 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL), lymphopenia (0.51 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL) and increased C-reactive protein values (401 mg/L) .

Bilateral interstitial pneumonia with thickening and interstitial infiltrates suggestive of viral pneumonia was observed in chest X-ray and then samples of swab, taken from his upper respiratory tract, detected SARS-COV-2 through real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay (real-time PCR). The patient was then admitted to infectious disease ward with a treatment regime that consisted of oxygen therapy at 10 L/min with non-rebreather mask, hydroxychloroquine and ceftriaxone (patient allergic to macrolides).\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1.

The domiciliary therapy with aripiprazole (20 mg once daily) was regularly fed. Bedside echocardiography showed an enlarged left ventricle (56 mm), diffuse myocardial hypo-akinesia along with severe left ventricular ejection systolic dysfunction (LVEF, 15-20%) and decrease in right cardiac function. The chest computed tomography (CT) ruled out acute pulmonary embolism and revealed cardiomegaly. Blood test showed elevation of myocardial injury markers such as high-sensitivity troponin T (1,033 ng/L), creatine kinase myocardial band (30 µg/L) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (47,650 ng/L), so that a diagnosis of acute myocarditis was formulated. Additional tests for common cardiotropic agents were negative, so we evinced that COVID-19 was the leading cause of our patient’s myocarditis complicated by cardiogenic shock.\n\n【10】After a few days, the patient was weaned off mechanical ventilation, and adrenalina was replaced by dobutamine. He was discharged from ICU after 2 weeks and transferred to cardiologic unit where the patient’s clinical conditions gradually improved. Chest radiography showed improvement of the radiologic findings, LVEF recovered to 50% without kinetic disorders and two-dimensional global longitudinal strain (2DGLS) was 12% at the transthoracic echocardiography performed on day 20 and markers of myocyte necrosis progressively stabilized and reduced .\n\n【11】During the hospitalization, low doses of ramipril (2.5 mg) and bisoprolol (2.5 mg), for evidence of sinus tachycardia, were started and well tolerated. We decided not to perform cardiovascular magnetic resonance or an endomyocardial biopsy due to the important patient’s comorbidity and the poor compliance. After 3 weeks, the patient was discharged, hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Herein we describe a case of acute myocarditis with rapid occurrence of cardiogenic shock. In literature, recently published case reports have shown that COVID-19 can be responsible for myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> and even fulminant myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. One study suggested that up to 7% of COVID-19-related deaths were due to myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The underlying pathogenetic pathways can be related to either direct myocardial injury due to viral load or the effect of systemic inflammation. High viral loads and mononuclear infiltrates were detected in autopsies of some patients with COVID-19 and myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Tavazzi et al recently described the first biopsy-proven acute cardiac injury directly linked to myocardial localization of the SARS-CoV-2 rapidly degenerating into cardiogenic shock. Endomyocardial biopsy demonstrated low grade myocardial inflammation and viral particles in the myocardium, suggesting either a viremic phase or alternatively infected macrophage migration from the lung. They observed viral particles in interstitial cells of the myocardium, but did not observe viral particles in cardiac myocyte. Cardiac cells showed nonspecific damage mainly represented by myofibrillar lysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Other studies are so needed to confirm viral cardiotropism.\n\n【14】To our knowledge, in literature there are not reports of cardiogenic shock in a so young population. In contrast with infected adults, children and young people appear to have a milder clinical course as reported by data available from China and United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 11 \\]</u>. These findings are largely consistent with the Coronavirus Infection in Pediatric Emergency Departments (CONFIDENCE) Study performed by an Italian research group in order to determine the spectrum of disease in children in Italy. CONFIDENCE Study involved a cohort of 100 Italian children younger than 18 years of age with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who were assessed in March in 17 pediatric emergency departments. The median age of the children was 3.3 years, 21% were asymptomatic, 58% had mild disease, 19% had moderate disease, 1% had severe disease and 1% were in critical conditions. Severe and critical cases were diagnosed in patients with coexisting illnesses. No deaths were reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Nowadays extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) represents the best choice for the management of cardiogenic shock in adult patients with minor or no comorbidities. Among paediatric population, ECMO is less frequently employed and extracorporeal life support (ECLS), delivered to neonates (0 - 28 days) for respiratory support, is the largest subcategory of ECLS among children < 18 years. This is described by a report that analyzes data from children aged 0 - 17 years in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) registry between 2009 and 2015 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】ELSO registry, through guidelines development, research and data management, is the largest available resource to provide support to institutions delivering extracorporeal life assistance. In our young patient, ECMO was not used even due to its potential neurological complications. The case report, in fact, deals with a serious cardiovascular complication in an autistic patient raising the question whether the virus can be more aggressive in neuropsychiatric disorders. To date we know that SARS-CoV-2 is a neurotropic virus that penetrates the central nervous system (CNS) through several routes, most notably through intranasal inoculation and through peripheral nerves using trans-synaptic pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Long-term neuropsychiatric disorders following COVID-19 infection are currently not known and only in the next months or years it will be even possible to know them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Potential mechanism of neuropsychiatric manifestation in COVID-19 can be due to the neuroinvasive potential of COVID-19 but also to the peripheral cytokines involved in the host antiviral response that may compromise blood-brain interface integrity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】Currently it is recognized that COVID-19 can be localized in tissues other than the lung, mainly in heart and CNS. We can consider COVID-19 an eclectic virus with different clinical presentations in the myocardium, ranging from mild abnormalities in markers of myocardial injury to cardiogenic shock.\n\n【19】Our case report discusses a potential life-threatening complication of COVID-19 in a young patient without previous cardiac history, highlighting that even young people can be severely affected. Clinicians, in our opinion, should so maintain a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 infection in children and young people, particularly among those with underlying comorbidities.\n\n【20】Additional studies are required to better understand the exact cardiotropic relevance of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus and the potential aggressiveness in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The manuscript has been successfully de-identified to protect the patient.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors contributed to the editing of the manuscript.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Data Availability</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; LVEF: left ventricular ejection fraction; COVID-19: coronavirus disease 2019; AMI: acute myocardial infarction; VTE: venous thromboembolic event; WBC: white blood cell count; PCO <sub>2 </sub> : partial pressure of carbon dioxide; PO <sub>2 </sub> : partial pressure of oxygen; SaO <sub>2 </sub> : oxygen saturation; RT-PCR: real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay; ICU: intensive care unit; HFN: high-flow oxygen; LMWH: low molecular weight heparin; CT: computed tomography; NT-proBNP: N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide; 2DGLS: two-dimensional global longitudinal strain; ECMO: extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; ELSO: Extracorporeal Life Support Organization; CNS: central nervous system</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:10:38", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:11:06", "cost": 27.182}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:10:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:10:29"}

But, because of its serious side effects like severe neutropenia and necrotizing vasculitis, it was withdrawn from the market 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Levamisole is postulated to potentiate the effect of cocaine by increasing the number of D1 dopamine receptors in the brain. According to the reports from CDC, levamisole adulteration is found in up to 70% of the cocaine seized at the borders of the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Since more than 1.5 million people in the United States use cocaine and more than 70% of the cocaine in US is adulterated with levamisole, the incidence of levamisole-induced vasculitis will continue to rise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. As the history of drug use is not always provided by patient and the manifestation of levamisole toxicity overlaps with other medical conditions, strong clinical suspicion with appropriate test is needed for prompt diagnosis and appropriate management. We report a case of vasculitis rash in a female with intravenous (IV) drug abuse which was suspected as infective endocarditis at admission and finally turned out to be levamisole-induced vasculitis.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 53-year-old African American female with a past medical history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, polysubstance abuse and hepatitis C presented to emergency department with the complaints of fever, chills, diaphoresis, and body ache for 1 week and rashes for 2 days. Five days after the onset of fever, she developed dark and painful skin lesions that appeared first on the ears followed by upper arms and both thighs over a period of 2 days . She reported burning pain and itching without bleeding, oozing or blisters around the rashes. She denied any recent travel, tick bites, use of new medication or weight loss. Systemic review was negative for headache, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, hematuria or joint pain. She reported smoking cigarettes half pack a day for last 40 years. She also reported IV drug abuse including cocaine and the most recent cocaine use was 2 days prior to onset of rash. The history of drug use was inconsistent when asked by multiple providers. She would say she quit the drug many days ago at times and once said that she took cocaine few days ago. Physical examination in emergency department revealed elevated blood pressure 217/131 mm Hg, HR 115/min, temperature 99 °F, and RR 15/min. Skin examination revealed dusky deeply violaceous well-demarcated patches on the bilateral ear helices . Small dark violaceous to necrotic appearing purpuric patches on the bilateral upper arms were present . Extensive involvement of the bilateral anterior thighs from the groin to the knees with dark retiform purpuric patches with erythematous borders and central erosive lesions was also noted . No abnormalities were noted on CNS, cardiovascular, respiratory and GI systems. In the context of IV drug use and presence of fever with rashes, a diagnosis of infective endocarditis was suspected with the differential diagnosis of tick borne illness, vasculitis and autoimmune disorders. The hypertensive urgency was treated with hydralazine and nifedipine. Lab tests revealed leukopenia with WBC of 2,590/mm <sup>3 </sup> with 43% neutrophils and 50% lymphocytes. Hemoglobin was 12.8 g/dL with platelet count of 146,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . DIC panel showed normal fibrinogen, normal PT/INR and slightly increased APTT of 44. Antibiotics were started empirically for infective endocarditis but were discontinued after blood cultures were negative and echocardiogram did not show vegetation. Over next few days, the lesions started developing blisters with oozing and crusting. Dermatology, wound care and general surgery were consulted. Supportive care with pain management, wound care and nutrition management was started. Investigations for tick borne illnesses were negative for Rocky Mountain spotted fever IgM/IgG and Ehrlichia/anaplasma polymerase chain reaction. With the background of chronic hepatitis C infection, cryoglobulinemia was also suspected but serum cryoglobulin test was negative. Hepatitis C polymerase chain reaction showed 688,593 copies/mL but hepatitis B and HIV tests were negative. The skin lesions showed some improvement with wound care management, dressing changes and application of emollients. Vasculitis workup showed negative antinuclear antibody (ANA) with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) factor was mildly elevated to 26. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) IgG antibody was markedly elevated to 1:10,240 and perinuclear-ANCA (p-ANCA) was normal with cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) markedly elevated to 208. Complement studies showed normal C3 and C4 levels. The admission urine drug screen was positive for cocaine and opiate. Biopsy of the skin lesions showed ischemic necrosis of epidermal, dermal and subcutaneous tissue. The dermis and subcutaneous tissue demonstrated numerous occlusive fibrin thrombi within small vessels with focal leukocytoclasis and vascular damage suggestive of levamisole-induced vasculitis. After 2 weeks of hospital stay, she was discharged with plan to follow-up in burn unit for the skin grafting. At the time of discharge, the WBC count had increased to 5,190/mm <sup>3 </sup> and platelet count of 41,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> with Hb 9.1 g/dL. Skin grafting was done at the burn unit and pain management was done with opioids. After skin grafting, the skin lesions healed well. Patient was on continuous follow-up for physiotherapy, pain management and wound care.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

It has been a common practice to adulterate the cocaine with levamisole for potentiating the effects of cocaine. Since the first report of adulteration in 2002, the percentage of cocaine adulterated with levamisole is rising steadily to as high as 70-82% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. This case describes a patient with neutropenia, skin rashes and vasculitis secondary to use of cocaine adulterated with levamisole. Levamisole was originally approved for use as an immunomodulatory drug in various diseases including nephrotic syndrome and other autoimmune diseases. There are case reports of vasculitis associated with levamisole when it was used for RA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> and in children with nephrotic syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In all these cases, neutropenia and skin lesions resolved after the discontinuation of levamisole. The drug was finally withdrawn from the human market in 1999 because of serious side effects including leukopenia, agranulocytosis, and skin vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In our patient, after the patient stopped taking cocaine, leucopenia and neutropenia improved with improvement in skin lesions.\n\n【10】Levamisole is believed to act by two mechanisms to increase the effect of cocaine. Firstly, it inhibits monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase activity resulting in prolonging the action of catecholamine in the neuronal synapse and increasing the reuptake-inhibition effect of cocaine. Levamisole also enhances euphoric and addictive properties of cocaine by increasing dopamine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Levamisole-induced vasculitis syndrome presents with typical findings of vasculopathic purpuric rash involving mainly the ears but can involve nose, cheeks and extremities diffusely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 \\]</u>. In our patient, the rash appeared first on earlobes and finally involved the other parts of body. Histopathological examination of the levamisole-induced vasculitis may show a mixed pattern of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, thrombotic vasculitis or vascular occlusion. In our patient, the microscopic examination of the tissue revealed the features consistent with levamisole-induced vasculitis.\n\n【11】Levamisole-induced vasculitis has interesting laboratory findings. Leukopenia, lymphocytosis and presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies are seen because of immunomodulatory effects. Presence of ANCA is variable. p-ANCA is found in 86-100% of cases and c-ANCA is found in 50% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In our patient, p-ANCA was negative but c-ANCA was found to be positive.\n\n【12】The skin lesions usually resolve spontaneously within a few weeks of the discontinuation of levamisole. No therapies other than discontinuation of levamisole have been found to be effective. The use of corticosteroid is controversial and its use has not been found to improve or accelerate healing and is not routinely recommended. Furthermore, since the most reported cases do not have internal organ involvement, the steroid is not needed and may in fact be harmful because of serious side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. There are reports of the use of plasmapheresis in case reports but we currently have no enough data to support or preclude its use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In our patient, no corticosteroid or plasmapheresis was used and the skin lesions improved with the discontinuation of cocaine. Since the damage to skin was extensive with involvement of dermis and subcutaneous tissue, skin grafting was done. Patient has continued to improve on follow-up.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Levamisole-induced vasculitis is a cutaneous vasculitis syndrome associated with the use of cocaine adulterated with levamisole. With the increase in cocaine abuse and adulteration of cocaine with levamisole, the rate of levamisole-induced vasculitis seems to be increasing. When a patient presents with purpuric skin rashes including involvement of ear lobes, levamisole-induced vasculitis should be suspected. Appropriate investigations for vasculitis, drug screen test with skin biopsy should be done to diagnose it for timely and appropriate treatment. Although corticosteroids and plasmapheresis have been tried in case reports, no definitive benefit has been demonstrated. The therapy is mostly supportive with pain management, wound care and discontinuation of cocaine adulterated with levamisole.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:50:08", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:51:26", "cost": 78.11}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:51:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:50:07"}

The heterotopic pancreas lacks any continuity with the main body of the orthotopic pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 , 11 \\]</u>. Pancreatic acinar heterotopia is unusual in the esophagus, but has been more commonly described in other areas of the gastrointestinal tract such as the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 11 , 12 \\]</u>. In general, patients with pancreatic acinar heterotopia are asymptomatic and as a result, most go undiagnosed.

For the cases in which patients develop symptoms such as dysphagia or abdominal pain, these symptoms are due to the mass effect and relative location of heterotopia to esophageal mucosa.\n\n【2】In any patient who presents with dysphagia and concomitant alarming symptoms similar to this index case, guidelines recommend the use of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in the initial evaluation. This has diagnostic benefits such as distinguishing between a benign or non-benign cause, as well as therapeutic benefits through interventions such as esophageal dilation. In this case report, we present a 57-year-old man who was diagnosed with EPAH, after esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy, revealing the challenge of the symptom presentation and the appropriate diagnostic workup and management thereafter.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】The patient was a 57-year-old man with known medical history of degenerative joint disease (DJD), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease and chronic constipation who presented to the gastroenterology clinic for evaluation of difficulty swallowing. The patient reported a progressive worsening of this symptom over the preceding 4 months. He reported dysphagia to solids, further described as a sensation of food being stuck in his throat. He denied dysphagia to liquids. He endorsed associated abdominal pain characterized as an occasional burning sensation that was localized to the epigastric region. He also experienced 30-pound unintentional weight loss during the 4 months since onset of symptoms. He denied nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, odynophagia, hematochezia or melena.\n\n【6】He had history of a colonoscopy 1 year prior, which documented findings of internal and external non-thrombosed hemorrhoids, as well as a single tubular adenoma. He had a significant family history of colon cancer. Social history was significant for a 10-pack-year tobacco smoking history and alcohol use socially. His current medications included hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, lisinopril, gabapentin, acetaminophen, naproxen, cyclobenzaprine, atorvastatin and esomeprazole. He had no known allergies.\n\n【7】On presentation to the gastroenterology clinic, he had a body mass index (BMI) of 30.92 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> and his blood pressure was 149/75 mm Hg, with other vital signs within normal limits. His physical examination revealed no acute abnormalities for his general, neurological, cardiopulmonary or musculoskeletal systems. In regards to his abdominal examination, he had benign findings including normoactive bowels sounds and a non-tender abdomen.\n\n【8】Diagnosis\n\n【9】His laboratory tests from a month prior to his gastroenterology clinic were reviewed. These included hemoglobin of 14.7 g/dL, white blood cell of 6.4 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, platelet of 160 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen of 7 mg/dL. All other values for hematology and metabolic panel were within normal limits.\n\n【10】Given the presence of alarming features associated with our patient’s dysphagia on this initial presentation, he was scheduled for an elective upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in 2 weeks. He was also prescribed polyethylene glycol and psyllium for constipation.\n\n【11】Treatment\n\n【12】Follow-up EGD was completed 2 weeks after the clinic visit, and was significant for findings of an approximately 5 × 3 cm raised pink rubbery mass with overlying irregular mucosa at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. This was partially resected for biopsy . There was also irregular gastric mucosa visualized during the EGD and additional biopsy samples were taken.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Review of systems was significant for improvement in constipation with the use of the medications as prescribed. For this visit, he was prescribed antibiotics for H. pylori infection and scheduled for continued surveillance.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】Dysphagia, an upper gastrointestinal symptom, refers to the sensation of impaired passage of food from the mouth to the stomach that is caused by structural or neuromuscular conditions of the esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 7 \\]</u>. It has been estimated to affect 8-22% of persons above 50 years of age, with a higher prevalence in nursing homes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. The prevalence of dysphagia in adults at least weekly was previously found to be 3% for men and women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Based on the anatomical site of the esophagus that is primarily affected, dysphagia can be grouped as oropharyngeal or esophageal. The patient in this index case presented with esophageal dysphagia which may result from benign or malignant pathologies.\n\n【22】Benign causes of esophageal dysphagia include gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic strictures, esophageal rings, eosinophilic esophagitis, diffuse esophageal spasm, achalasia and hypomotility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 5 \\]</u>. It is important to exclude a premalignant or malignant etiology during the initial patient evaluation by conducting a thorough history and physical examination. The clinical suspicion for malignancy should be heightened by the presence of alarming features such as unintentional weight loss, dysphagia more for solids than for liquids, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, odynophagia, vomiting and onset age older than 50 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]</u>. The patient in this index case presented with dysphagia with concomitant alarming features of weight loss, dysphagia to solids and older age. This increased the urgency to rule out a non-benign etiology of his gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n【23】Guidelines recommend an empiric trial of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for patients who have esophageal dysphagia and reflux, the absence of the aforementioned alarming features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]</u>. For patients who have alarming features on their initial presentation or who have persistent gastrointestinal symptoms after empiric PPI therapy, endoscopy is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]</u>. An EGD plays a diagnostic and therapeutic role in the evaluation of dysphagia. EGD allows for direct visualization of the esophageal lumen and stomach. Mucosal biopsies can also be taken for histopathology. It has been shown that EGD has a diagnostic yield of 54% when used in the initial evaluation of patients older than 40 years of age who present with dysphagia with associated heartburn, odynophagia or weight loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】EGD in this index case revealed a raised area with abnormal mucosa at the GE junction. Histopathology was consistent with focal EPAH. EPAH refers to histologically confirmed pancreatic tissue, or pancreatic rests, located within the esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\- 12 \\]</u>. EPAH lack any anatomic, neural or vascular connections to the main body of the orthotopic pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 , 12 \\]</u>. EPAH has been rarely reported in the literature. Pancreatic acinar heterotopia has been more commonly found in other areas of the gastrointestinal tract, with over 90% of previously reported cases occurring in the gastric antrum, duodenum, jejunum and ileum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>. Pancreatic acinar heterotopia, of any location in the gastrointestinal tract, has been incidentally discovered in 0.5-13.7% of autopsies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>, and 0.2-0.5% of laparotomies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Though the exact pathogenesis of EPAH is not well-known, there have been suggested mechanisms. This includes theories such as the “migration theory” which supports an embryonic origin of EPAH. The formation of the pancreas begins at about 5 weeks into organogenesis when the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds, which arise from the duodenal aspect of the foregut, rotate and fuse together 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 16 \\]</u>. It has been postulated that the detachment of branching pancreatic buds during rotation of the foregut gives rise to heterotopic pancreatic tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. This may account for the prepyloric region, followed by other derivatives of the primitive foregut, being the most common location for these pancreatic rests 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>. The stomach accounts for 25-38% of cases, followed by the duodenum and jejunum which account for 17-21% and 15-21%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Uncomplicated heterotopic pancreatic rests present in the gastrointestinal tract do not typically cause gastrointestinal symptoms or manifestations. However, this pathology has been incidentally found in up to 24% of patients undergoing elective EGD for evaluation of upper gastrointestinal symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. On direct visualization with endoscopy, the involved area of esophageal mucosa may often appear normal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, if the area of heterotopic pancreatic rest is large, it may then appear as a non-specific mass within the wall of gastrointestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The appearance has also been described as a submucosal lesion with an associated central umbilication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. In regards to the radiological appearance, on computed tomography imaging, the heterotopic pancreas has been described as an oval intramural mass with an endoluminal growth pattern and micro-lobulated margins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】For the existing cases of EPAH reported in the literature, it is twice as common in men which is similar to the patient in this case . Further, it is usually discovered in the fifth or sixth decade of life which is also consistent with this case presentation of 57-year-old man 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. In most EPAH cases, the pancreatic rests are found in the distal third of the esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, and in our index case, the endoscopy revealed irregularities at the GE junction.

Gastrointestinal symptoms may include dysphagia, the presenting symptom of this index case, as well as abdominal pain localized to epigastric or right upper quadrant region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. However, the presence of dysphagia to solids only and unintentional weight loss were unusual clinical features. These symptoms usually suggest more sinister disorders of the esophagus such as malignant pathologies.

Malignant transformation of EPAH is reported to be uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 11 \\]</u>. The heterotopic pancreas is thought to be as susceptible as the orthotopic pancreas to premalignant changes such as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 15 \\]</u>. However, to date, there has been only one reported case each of adenocarcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma arising from EPAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 22 , 23 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Management of EPAH has varied in the previously reported cases. Treatment options described in the literature have ranged from a conservative approach with clinical observation to a radical approach with surgical resections such as Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy. A minimally invasive surgical approach with left video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) was described in a case report in which the preceding esophageal biopsy specimens were non-diagnostic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. Surgical modalities have been recommended when endoscopy or imaging does not provide a pre-operative diagnosis. In these cases, complete surgical resection allows for tissue diagnosis. For malignant EPAH radical excision has been recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 27 \\]</u>. Enucleation has also been described for benign EPAH. In our index case, the EGD with biopsy was diagnostic. There were no endoscopic or histologic findings of malignancy. Further, endoscopic resection was therapeutic given the resolution of patient reported upper gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n【32】Learning points\n\n【33】This case presentation serves to highlight EPAH as an uncommon cause of dysphagia, which is a common upper gastrointestinal complaint. Resection of EPAH during EGD treated the mass effect and associated gastrointestinal symptoms that were experienced by this patient. Current knowledge about the management for EPAH is limited due to its rare occurrence. Surgical resection has been recommended but this index case supports the effectiveness of endoscopic removal of EPAH. The presence of intestinal metaplasia on histology raises the question of whether this finding is to be considered a benign or premalignant finding in patients. Continued surveillance with the patient in our case will allow for monitoring of symptoms, including any concerning for a malignant transformation. Continued research on the endoscopic findings and histological findings of EPAH may better characterize this condition and the likelihood of risks such as malignant transformation.\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This case was submitted for the American College of Gastroenterology Annual Scientific Meeting 2019; Abstract published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology 114(Supplement):S1664.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no potential conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for his anonymized information to be published in this article.</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>KM, TS and TG: manuscript planning and preparation, literature review, and editing of subsequent revisions.

We present a case of native valve infective endocarditis caused by Corynebacterium propinquum that presented with an acute visual field defect. To the best of our knowledge, only four cases of infection by this organism have been reported since the first one in 1994, with just two of them being infective endocarditis. We hope that this case contributes to what little we know of this entity, and perhaps help clinicians make treatment decisions if encountered by a similar presentation.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 63-year-old Caucasian male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was admitted in early December with complaints of 9 days of fevers up to 38.3 °C, chills and rigors, and headache of 3 - 4 days duration. He initially felt like he had a viral infection. He woke up one day noticing that the entire right half of his visual field was obscured. This prompted him to come to the emergency department. He reported no neck stiffness or body aches, respiratory, or urinary symptoms. His headache was dull and diffuse. He endorsed several episodes of watery, non-bloody stools over the last few days prior to presentation. He also reported contact with a neighbor who had a persistent cough for the past month.\n\n【4】On presentation, he was found to be afebrile, with a normal white cell count of 9,400/mL. His basic metabolic panel (BMP) was only remarkable for a sodium of 132 mEq/L. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast was unremarkable. Neurology service examined the patient in the emergency department and assessed that his vision loss was consistent with a right homonymous hemianopsia. The remainder of his physical exam including cardiovascular and skin exam was completely normal.\n\n【5】After admission, a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) of the neck was performed which was unremarkable with normal carotid arteries. MRI of the brain revealed a 4 cm acute infarction involving the calcarine cortex of the left occipital lobe. Blood cultures on admission were negative, showing no growth at that time and patient had no further episodes of diarrhea or fever since admission. His white cell count remained in the normal range. A transthoracic echocardiogram was done on hospital day 4 as part of workup for embolic stroke. This showed moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an estimated ejection fraction of 35-40%, moderate hypokinesis of the inferior and inferoseptal wall, dilated inferior vena cava with normal respirophasic variation, grossly thickened and calcified aortic valve with mild aortic stenosis, dilated aortic root (4.2 cm), mild aortic regurgitation, normal mitral and tricuspid valves, and a small very late right to left shunt (14th cardiac cycle) on bubble study consistent with a possible pulmonary arterio-venous malformation. His blood cultures then turned positive from two separate sites, growing gram positive bacilli. The organism was eventually identified as C. propinquum .\n\n【6】A trans-esophageal echocardiogram performed the following day (hospital day 5) showed a bicuspid aortic valve with oscillating echodensities on the aortic surface of the valve (3 × 3 mm), anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (4 × 4 mm), and posterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve . Repeat bubble study was consistent with a small patent foramen ovale as bubbles were seen in the left atrium on the third cardiac cycle. There was no obvious atrial septal defect noted.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Trans-esophageal echocardiogram revealed echodensities on the aortic 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> and mitral 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> valves. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【8】Infectious diseases, cardiothoracic surgery, and cardiology services were consulted. There was no indication for valve surgery. The patient was initially treated with 3 days of intravenous vancomycin until the bacterium was identified and the susceptibility pattern established. An Etest (bioMerieux) was performed looking at susceptibility to penicillin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin . The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were thought to be acceptable (< 0.016 for penicillin, 0.032 for ceftriaxone, and 0.38 for vancomycin). Antibiotic therapy was changed to intravenous ceftriaxone monotherapy. The patient was successfully treated with 6 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

He was doing well with visual adaptation. However, this was complicated by Charles Bonnet syndrome. He was seen in clinic 3 months after initial presentation and noted to be doing well.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】This case was noteworthy for two reasons - one being the unusual presentation of infective endocarditis with an acute visual field defect secondary to an embolic infarct of the occipital lobe; and the second being the infective organism - a saprophyte that has previously only been reported to be pathogenic in four other cases.\n\n【13】Infective endocarditis caused by corynebacterial species is rare, more so by non-diphtheria corynebacterium in native valves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-4 \\]</u>. C. propinquum was previously called CDC group ANF-3. The current name was proposed by Riegel et al in 1993 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. C. pseudodiphtheriticum and CDC group ANF-1 are distinguished from the phylogenetically related C. propinquum by the fact that it is urease negative and reduces nitrates, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 \\]</u>. It is considered a saprophyte and has been isolated infrequently from skin, throat, and nasopharynx 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 \\]</u>. An extensive search revealed only four prior reported cases of infection by this organism. Two of them were cases of infective endocarditis. One developed in the tricuspid valve of a 7-year-old girl with ventricular septum defect and ventriculoatrial communication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, and the other in a 52-year-old man with a severely calcified, stenotic aortic valve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second reported case of infective endocarditis in an adult caused by C. propinquum .\n\n【14】The other two cases included a disseminated infection with both bone marrow and blood cultures growing the organism in a 76-year-old man with pulmonary tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, and empyema in a 70-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】There are no established guidelines regarding antibiotic therapy in these infections. It is thus recommended to report MIC results without interpretative criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The resistance pattern in each of the reported cases varied and is summarized in Table 1 .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Sensitivity Patterns of All Reported Cases of Corynebacterium propinquum Native Valve Endocarditis |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【17】In case 1, the patient was initially treated with penicillin G for 6 weeks followed by valve replacement and cleaning out of an aortic root cavity with a thrombotic mass. He then received penicillin G for another 2 weeks and was successfully treated. In case 2, a chest tube was placed and the patient was started on intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole. However, given his underlying malignancy, the focus of management was switched to palliative care. He expired shortly after. In case 3, the patient was successfully treated with 6 weeks of intravenous vancomycin in addition to anti-tuberculous regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide). Case 4 required a more complex approach. The patient was first treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 3 days till sensitivity testing was completed. The patient was then treated with intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin for 4 and 2 weeks, respectively. A follow-up revealed persistently elevated C-reactive protein and persistent vegetations on echocardiogram. Due to concern for acquired penicillin resistance, she was treated again with 6 weeks of intravenous cephazolin and 3 weeks of intravenous gentamicin, with resultant resolution. In our case, we used 6 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone as described above. This case highlights the lack of reliable treatment guidelines and the importance of continued reporting of infections by this rare organism as more cases of corynebacterial infective endocarditis are identified.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:27:23", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:27:45", "cost": 21.792}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:27:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:27:23"}

Its main sypmtoms are pain, sensory deficits, motor deficits, sphincter deficiency, reflex defects (hyperreflexia and pathologic reflexes) and spasity. Because they are generally slow growing tumors, their sypmtoms emerge slowly rather than acute onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】There is a special classification for the evaluation of patients with spinal meningiomas. McCormick classification or other functional neurologic classifications have been used for spinal meningiomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】The best radiologic modality for spinal meningiomas is spinal MRI. They are seen as isointense at T-1 weighted and T-2 weighted MRI sequences. Sometimes they may be seen hypointense at T-1 weighted MRI and hyperintense at T-2 weighted MRI. These masses are homogeneously contrasted in MRI.\n\n【19】The timing of surgical treatment varies according to patient’s clinical picture as emergent or elective intervention. Meningiomas’ surgery is planned according to tumor localization and size, and generally tumors localized in posterior or postero-lateral part of the spinal canal can be removed with posterior approach by hemilaminectomy, laminectomy or costatransversectomy. Simpson’s intracranial meningiomas classification can be used for surgical resection classification of the spinal meningiomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】It was reported that the surgical resection of psammomatous type among the spinal meningiomas was more difficult and neurologic deterioration after the surgery could be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】When looked at retrospective series in literature, its recurrence rate varies between 1 and 15% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 10 \\]</u>. The recurrence is seen generally in high grade meningiomas (grade III-IV).

Patient denied tobacco or alcohol habits. She presented to the emergency department with complaints of facial swelling and facial redness that was intermittent in nature for 1 year duration which was treated as an allergic reaction without improvement. Associated to original complaints, patient also reported unintentional weight loss of approximately 25 pounds during the previous 8 months, progressive shortness of breath and dry cough for the previous 2 months prior to arrival.\n\n【4】Physical examination findings were remarkable for bilateral jugular vein distention and facial swelling. Electrocardiogram (EKG) was remarkable for a normal sinus rhythm, and there was no evidence of ischemia with low voltage criteria . Chest X-ray was remarkable for a round opacity of 3.8 × 3.7 cm at the right hilar region . Further evaluation with chest computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a well-defined mass measuring 7 × 5.7 cm in the right atrium producing extrinsic compression and infiltration into the right atrioventricular valve and the proximal aspect of the right ventricle . The mass infiltrated the right hilar region invading the pericardial fat . In addition, the mass was producing a complete obliteration of the superior vena cava (SVC) . Laboratories were remarkable for mild leukocytosis and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. Echocardiogram was remarkable for an ejection fraction (EF) of 50-55%, mild enlargement of right and left ventricle, dilated inferior vena cava (IVC) and increased “echo signals” from the right atrium due to a mass effect. In view of previous findings, a myocardial biopsy was performed which yielded a positive result for a spindle cell sarcoma.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Those options were: 1) conventional resection under cardiopulmonary bypass that may include resection of the total right atrium with tissue homograft or prosthetic reconstruction; 2) excision of the heart under cardiopulmonary bypass, ex vivo excision of the tumor and autotransplantation; and 3) total heart transplantation. These options, after a lengthy and detailed discussion with the patient, were all rejected for several anatomical and medical considerations. There are only very few reports in the literature that can sustain these approaches, all with dismay results. Moreover, on this patient, the tumor reaches beyond the confines of the SVC - in the case of the SVC, both the SVC and the innominate vein were thrombosed - and in relation to the IVC, the tumor reaches to the limit of the IVC - atrial junction. Due to the aggressive nature of these tumors, heart transplantation and immunosuppression were not considered feasible. Accordingly, the patient was referred to a specialized center where we believe a combined approach of chemoradiation may make the lesion surgically treatable but unfortunately, patient perished before starting therapy.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】The first case report of a cardiac tumor dated back to 1562, but Barnes et al described the first ante mortem diagnosis in 1934 through a biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9-11 \\]</u>. The first successful surgery removing a primary cardiac tumor was reported in 1952 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Since then, there have been cases of malignant tumors but nevertheless the management of these patients is not well defined and there are no evidence-based guidelines. Most of the data come from experience with few cases reported. The most common malignant tumor is the angiosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The biopsy performed on our patient was positive for spindle cell sarcoma of the right atrium. This type of undifferentiated sarcoma is rare, with only four cases reported in the literature, which usually affects the left atrium, can infiltrate the pericardium and has a mesenchymal origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The spindle cell sarcoma is a highly aggressive tumor that metastized quickly and patients have a poor prognosis with a median survival of only 3 months to a year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Cardiac sarcomas have symptoms by different mechanisms including obstruction, local invasion, and embolisms and in some cases the first manifestation could be a sudden cardiac death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 14 \\]</u>.

Also if there is extension into the vena cava, an SVC syndrome can occur as in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Infiltration of the heart wall may occur as a restrictive or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Thirty to 40% of patients may present an embolic event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Up to 20% can cause cerebral ischemic stroke by cardiogenic embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Other less specific symptoms are weight loss, fever, chest discomfort and syncope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】The diagnosis of primary cardiac tumors depends on the use of multiple modes of imaging techniques, including 2D echocardiogram, cardiac CT and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】2D transthoracic echocardiography is the first modality for the screening and diagnosis of a cardiac tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. The sensitivity of 2D transthoracic echocardiogram is 93.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Unlike echocardiogram, cardiac CT and cardiac MRI (CMRI) allow evaluation of additional major cardiac involvement and identify the presence of metastasis and infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. MRI has the advantage over CT to evaluate the myocardium and pericardial involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. It also surpasses CT in the evaluation of tumor mass volume and tumor response to chemotherapy or surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Despite the imaging technology available, definitive diagnosis of cardiac tumor is made through a tissue biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The biopsy may be percutaneous or transvenous, through endoscopy, mediastinoscopy or thoracotomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This allows us to evaluate the histology and malignant potential, which is important to establish a proper treatment and prognosis.\n\n【14】Whenever possible, a complete surgical resection in combination with chemotherapy is still the best treatment for primary cardiac tumors because the survival rate of these patients doubles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. However, both adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not been very effective in the treatment of cardiac sarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Although it is known that the resection with negative borders is the best option, it is unfortunately plausible in less than 50% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Incomplete resection of the tumor in most cases results in recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】There are different types of surgery in terms of primary cardiac tumors. Regarding malignant tumors, complex resection can be performed when the tumor is confined to heart and has not infiltrated other adjacent tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Other techniques are “ Ex situ resection” or “auto-transplantation” when the tumor involves the posterior wall of the left atrium or dorsal great vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 14 \\]</u>. With this surgical method, the heart is extracted outside the body for better anatomical visualization and re-implanted after tumor resection in the heart is repaired 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 14 \\]</u>. Heart transplantation is an option for patients with inoperable sarcomas as an alternative therapy in case of no evidence of metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, it is associated with recurrence of malignancy and new tumors stimulated by immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The prognosis of cardiac primary tumors, especially spindle cell sarcoma, is poor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. At the time of diagnosis, up to 80% of spindle cell sarcomas have evidence of metastasis, which worsens their prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. These tumors may have few symptoms and remain silent until they reach an advanced stage, thus limiting the therapeutic options available. To the best of our knowledge, only four reported cases exist in the literature and there are no guidelines for treating this condition. It is recommended that once the diagnosis is made, these patients should be transferred to a specialized center for an early and aggressive treatment.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to express their gratitude to Patricia Gonzalez BS, MBA, for the time and effort it took to correct and edit our work.

The majority of patients are males in late middle age with predisposing hepatic cirrhosis (of varying etiology) or chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Although a global challenge for healthcare being the fifth most common cancer worldwide, the majority of the burden of HCC falls on developing nations where endemic hepatitis B virus infection and aflatoxin exposure rather than hepatitis C virus and alcoholism drive most cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】HCC in childhood is very rare and accounts for less than 0.5% of all pediatric malignancies. However, it is the second most common malignant liver neoplasm after hepatoblastoma in children. Its relative frequency is 0.5 to 1.0 cases per million children. It is commoner in adolescents than in infants. There may be some evidence that neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves the R0 resection rate in pediatric cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Unlike hepatoblastoma, pediatric conventional HCC usually develops in the presence of underlying liver disease and this may include chronic hepatitis B infection, metabolic disorders such as tyrosinemia, Wilson’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and glycogen storage diseases, structural problems such as biliary atresia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and infantile cholestatis. However, in children as compared to adults, there are more de novo cases arising in non-cirrhotic livers. The prognosis in HCC is poor and this may relate to the intrinsic resistance of HCC to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy certainly compared with hepatoblastoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】A subtype of HCC is fibrolamellar carcinoma. Its distinguishing features histologically include abundant fibrous collagenous bands, eosinophilic tumor cell cytoplasm and enlarged nucleoli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Fibrolamellar HCC predominantly occurs in young patients without underlying hepatitis or cirrhosis. Serum α-fetoproteins are not elevated in most cases and the male/female ratio is approximately equal. Although many early studies suggested a better prognosis with the fibrolamellar variant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, it is increasingly being appreciated that this may well not be the case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The 5-year survival rate was 76% for resected fibrolamellar HCC versus 37% for resected HCC in one study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】The typical presenting symptoms of HCC may include upper abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting, and constitutional symptoms such as poor appetite, lack of energy and unintentional weight loss. In patients with a history of chronic liver disease, HCC may first be suspected when de-compensation of cirrhosis occurs manifesting with variceal bleeding, worsening ascites associated with peripheral oedema, jaundice and encephalopathy. HCC is also increasingly detected in asymptomatic individuals who are undergoing serological (AFP) and ultrasound surveillance in view of their liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B virus infection.\n\n【6】Treatment for HCC is largely determined by the stage of the tumor at presentation and the Barcelona Liver Clinic staging system is widely used for this purpose. It incorporates patient-related factors such as co-morbidities, symptoms and performance status, tumor-related factors including size and number of tumor nodules on imaging and the presence of nodal metastases and extra-hepatic spread and also the severity of any underlying cirrhosis as assessed by the Child-Pugh score and degree of portal hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Patients with early stage disease may be treated with curative intent with ablative techniques, partial hepatectomy or liver transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.

Advanced stage HCC is treated with sorafenib, a multi-targeted small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, cKIT, RAF and Flt3 ligand, as standard-of-care. The survival benefit is demonstrable but modest with an increase of 2.8 months in median overall survival in a European population with predominantly hepatitis C virus infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> and 2.3 months in an Oriental population with mainly hepatitis B virus infection and more advanced cirrhosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】Here, we present a case of fibrolamellar HCC, diagnosed in childhood in the absence of underlying liver disease with a protracted course, multiple resections of metastatic deposits and dramatic response to radiation therapy.\n\n【9】A 14-year-old girl, without any significant past medical history except for meningococcal septicaemia at the age of 5 years, presented for further evaluation with a 3-month history of profound fatigue and lethargy. She also described amenorrhoea for 1 year and a recurrent rash on the bridge of her nose. She did not complain of bowel symptoms, loss of appetite, abdominal pain or jaundice.\n\n【10】On clinical examination, she was slightly hirsute over her trunk and was slightly tachycardic with pulse of 100 and a blood pressure of 125/80 mm Hg. On abdominal examination, she had an enlarged liver, 4 - 5 cm below the right costal margin. She was also hyperpigmented around her neck but no other abnormalities were noted. There was no family history of liver disease or malignancy.\n\n【11】Her laboratory investigations showed a slightly raised alanine aminotransferase at 51 IU/L, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 88 mm/h and C-reactive protein of 44 mg/L with no other abnormal results. Abdominal ultrasound showed a solid echogenic lesion measuring 17 × 18 × 10 cm displacing hepatic and portal veins within her liver. A localized lesion was confirmed on CT imaging: there was no evidence of metastasis. Serum alpha-fetoprotein level was within the normal range.\n\n【12】She underwent laparotomy and extended right hemi-hepatectomy with caudate lobe resection and there was complete macroscopic clearance of visible disease. Histopathology confirmed a primary fibrolamellar HCC, measuring 28 cm diameter, with no histological evidence of fibrosis or steatohepatitis in the background liver and no evidence of infective or metabolic liver disease as shown in Figure 1 . Figure 2 shows the typical fibrocollagenous bands of fibrolamellar HCC. Following surgery, she received adjuvant systemic therapy in the form of chemotherapy with intravenous doxorubicin and sorafenib for a period of 6 months. However, 9 months following the completion of adjuvant therapy, routine surveillance imaging detected a seemingly isolated recurrent lesion in the remnant liver. This was resected with a non-anatomical resection with clear margins and histomorphological appearances identical to the primary lesion, with evidence of focal lymphovascular invasion as shown in Figure 3 . A follow-up CT scan 6 months later demonstrated multiple lung lesions. At this point, after an informed discussion with the patient and her family regarding the relative paucity of evidence for sorafenib in fibrolamellar HCC, sorafenib was re-instituted at a dose of 800 mg daily and this was later reduced to 600 mg daily in view of grade 1 - 2 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia and generalized dry skin. Over the next 3 years, she underwent multiple video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical wedge resections for asymptomatic small pulmonary nodules (one in the right lung and three in the left lung) detected on routine surveillance thoracic and abdominal imaging. Histology confirmed metastatic fibrolamellar HCC in all nodules (with evidence of bile production by tumor cells), one resected nodule had positive resection margins and a hilar lymph node was involved with tumor. Histomorphological appearances resembled those of the primary lesion in the liver . She continued with sorafenib 600 mg during this period with reasonably good tolerance.\n\n|  Figure 1.

Top right: metastatic tumour cells; bottom left: normal alveoli. |\n| --- |\n\n【17】Six months after her last VATS lung resection, imaging revealed concerning enlargement of a left hilar lymph node. This was kept under surveillance and sorafenib was continued. However, 8 months later (5 years after initial diagnosis of fibrolamellar HCC in the liver) there was unequivocal enlargement of the left hilar node with a new enlarged right hilar node as shown in Figure 5a, b At this point, her sorafenib dose was increased back to 800 mg daily. Once again, a thoracic surgical opinion was sought and due to proximity of the left-sided lymph node to the inferior pulmonary vein and the right-sided node to the pulmonary artery, surgical resection was deemed inappropriate. Therefore, in a patient with an excellent performance status and no respiratory co-morbidity, an opinion regarding radical radiotherapy was sought. She underwent tomotherapy to bilateral mediastinal lymph nodes with a dose of 50 Gy in 20 fractions. Sorafenib was continued during radiotherapy and following completion of radiotherapy, she developed oral mucositis which had never been experienced with sorafenib previously. A follow-up CT scan 7 months after radiotherapy confirmed complete resolution of the bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and no evidence of recurrence elsewhere . Six months after this, despite remaining well and free of cancer-related symptoms, she developed grade 2 palmar-plantar erythrodysasthesia despite supportive measures. Due to the adverse effects on her quality of life, after an informed discussion she discontinued sorafenib and was kept under regular surveillance. At most recent follow-up, she remains well with no clinical or radiological evidence of active cancer.\n\n|  Figure 5. CT imaging of hilar lymphadenopathy. (a) Right hilar lymphadenopathy prior to radiotherapy. (b) Right hilar region post radiotherapy. (c) Left hilar lymphadenopathy prior to radiotherapy. (d) Left hilar region post radiotherapy. |\n| --- |\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】We believe this case is highly unusual and potentially educational in several ways including the protracted disease course with multiple metastectomies, good tolerance of sorafenib treatment over several years and the dramatic response to radiotherapy.\n\n【21】Although there is no evidence for chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting for resected fibrolamellar HCC, this patient received adjuvant treatment with both sorafenib and doxorubicin in view of her complete resection, young age and potential to benefit from such treatment. The evidence for efficacy of either treatment in this setting is lacking in HCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u> although the use of sorafenib after liver resection or ablative treatment is being investigated in the STORM study of sorafenib versus placebo until recurrence or intolerance of treatment. In fibrolamellar HCC, various case series have advocated aggressive resection of recurrent lesions to improve survival of young patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Even in these cases documented median survival after second resection is in the range of 24 - 27 months.\n\n【22】It can be speculated that since sorafenib is predominantly cytostatic, its concurrent use with chemotherapy may have blunted the potential cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy which targets dividing cells. This potential cytostatic effect of sorafenib also formed the rationale for restarting the drug when metastatic disease was detected despite its use in the adjuvant setting. The sorafenib-doxorubicin combination is currently being studied in the randomized, phase III setting for advanced HCC in the NCT01015833 study. In patients with inoperable HCC, it was reported that sorafenib and doxorubicin were tolerable, although rates of G/3 diarrhea and leukopenia were 17% and 45% respectively, with a disease control rate of 70% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】This patient underwent pulmonary metastectomies via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and wedge resections for metachronous oligometastatic disease in the lungs. Notably, although there was no evidence of metastatic disease outside of the thorax, the lung lesions were multiple not solitary. Again, there is a paucity of published scientific literature on this topic. Three studies, each with less than 50 patients, reported on outcomes from case series of patients who had pulmonary metastectomies for metachronous disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19-21 \\]</u>. The rate of overall survival ranged from 24% at 3 years to 26-37% at 5 years. Solitary metastasis and longer time from resection of primary cancer to detection of metastases were associated with better survival outcomes. Clearly, such case series do not include a comparison group and therefore the favorable outcomes described may relate to intrinsically indolent disease as in this case rather than reflect any therapeutic benefit of the surgical resection.\n\n【24】Although HCC has long been known to be an intrinsically radiosensitive tumor, as evidenced by for example the 70-80% pain relief rate after irradiation of symptomatic skeletal metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>, its role in fibrolamellar HCC is unknown. Our case does demonstrate good therapeutic effect of radical dose RT in keeping with recent findings of the therapeutic efficacy of radiation therapy whether delivered externally in the form of stereotactic radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>, sparing normal liver tissue, or internally for example with yttrium beads 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】This patient received concurrent radiotherapy and sorafenib and whilst not an extensively studied combination in the literature, there is emerging evidence that it is a safe and feasible combination treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u> and, in fact, there may well be synergistic effects between anti-angiogenic therapy and radiotherapy with the former potentiating the effect of the latter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>, although this may be very dependent on dose and scheduling of radiation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】This patient has survived for over 5 years, with evidence of local recurrent disease for 4 years and metastatic disease for 3 years and her tumor-related symptomatology has been minimal. However, having received a prolonged course of sorafenib which at best may have reduced her disease velocity and also having received 50 Gy of thoracic radiotherapy, her options for future systemic treatment are limited. These options may include further anti-angiogenic therapy with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1, 2 and 3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor regorafenib, which has shown evidence of limited overall survival benefit in heavily pre-treated advanced colorectal cancer, and which is being studied for advanced sorafenib refractory HCC in the phase III, randomized, placebo controlled setting in the NCT01774344 study. Brivanib, another multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has additional effects on fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling, has shown promise in advanced HCC although in the first-line setting, it was inferior to sorafenib and was less well tolerated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. In the post-sorafenib setting, brivanib did not improve overall survival compared to placebo but there was a radiological response rate of 10% and median time-to-progression was 1.5 months longer for brivanib than placebo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Moving away from targeted therapies, immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors is emerging as a potentially highly effective therapy for cancers which were once considered non-immunogenic such as non-small cell lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. In particular, there is evidence that the anti-cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-antigen-4 (CTLA4) monoclonal antibody tremelimumab can generate potent anti-tumor and anti-viral immune responses in patients with HCV-associated HCC and in the clinical setting, tremelimumab achieved a partial response rate of 18% with a median progression free survival of 6.5 months in patients with advanced stage HCC and Child-Pugh B cirrhosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. Of particular relevance to this case, it is well known that radiation therapy to a particular metastatic lesion may lead to “abscopal” regression of distant (non-irradiated) lesions due to radiotherapy inducing immunogenic cell death and immune priming 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u> which may be potentiated by subsequent immune checkpoint blockage.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgement</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr Rachel Brown for her histopathology review of slides and helpful comments on the manuscript.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Figure 1.

Sorafenib was continued during radiotherapy and following completion of radiotherapy, she developed oral mucositis which had never been experienced with sorafenib previously. A follow-up CT scan 7 months after radiotherapy confirmed complete resolution of the bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and no evidence of recurrence elsewhere . Six months after this, despite remaining well and free of cancer-related symptoms, she developed grade 2 palmar-plantar erythrodysasthesia despite supportive measures. Due to the adverse effects on her quality of life, after an informed discussion she discontinued sorafenib and was kept under regular surveillance. At most recent follow-up, she remains well with no clinical or radiological evidence of active cancer.\n\n|  Figure 5. CT imaging of hilar lymphadenopathy.

In fibrolamellar HCC, various case series have advocated aggressive resection of recurrent lesions to improve survival of young patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Even in these cases documented median survival after second resection is in the range of 24 - 27 months.\n\n【22】It can be speculated that since sorafenib is predominantly cytostatic, its concurrent use with chemotherapy may have blunted the potential cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy which targets dividing cells. This potential cytostatic effect of sorafenib also formed the rationale for restarting the drug when metastatic disease was detected despite its use in the adjuvant setting. The sorafenib-doxorubicin combination is currently being studied in the randomized, phase III setting for advanced HCC in the NCT01015833 study. In patients with inoperable HCC, it was reported that sorafenib and doxorubicin were tolerable, although rates of G/3 diarrhea and leukopenia were 17% and 45% respectively, with a disease control rate of 70% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】This patient underwent pulmonary metastectomies via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and wedge resections for metachronous oligometastatic disease in the lungs. Notably, although there was no evidence of metastatic disease outside of the thorax, the lung lesions were multiple not solitary. Again, there is a paucity of published scientific literature on this topic. Three studies, each with less than 50 patients, reported on outcomes from case series of patients who had pulmonary metastectomies for metachronous disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19-21 \\]</u>. The rate of overall survival ranged from 24% at 3 years to 26-37% at 5 years. Solitary metastasis and longer time from resection of primary cancer to detection of metastases were associated with better survival outcomes. Clearly, such case series do not include a comparison group and therefore the favorable outcomes described may relate to intrinsically indolent disease as in this case rather than reflect any therapeutic benefit of the surgical resection.\n\n【24】Although HCC has long been known to be an intrinsically radiosensitive tumor, as evidenced by for example the 70-80% pain relief rate after irradiation of symptomatic skeletal metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>, its role in fibrolamellar HCC is unknown. Our case does demonstrate good therapeutic effect of radical dose RT in keeping with recent findings of the therapeutic efficacy of radiation therapy whether delivered externally in the form of stereotactic radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>, sparing normal liver tissue, or internally for example with yttrium beads 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】This patient received concurrent radiotherapy and sorafenib and whilst not an extensively studied combination in the literature, there is emerging evidence that it is a safe and feasible combination treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u> and, in fact, there may well be synergistic effects between anti-angiogenic therapy and radiotherapy with the former potentiating the effect of the latter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>, although this may be very dependent on dose and scheduling of radiation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】This patient has survived for over 5 years, with evidence of local recurrent disease for 4 years and metastatic disease for 3 years and her tumor-related symptomatology has been minimal. However, having received a prolonged course of sorafenib which at best may have reduced her disease velocity and also having received 50 Gy of thoracic radiotherapy, her options for future systemic treatment are limited. These options may include further anti-angiogenic therapy with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1, 2 and 3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor regorafenib, which has shown evidence of limited overall survival benefit in heavily pre-treated advanced colorectal cancer, and which is being studied for advanced sorafenib refractory HCC in the phase III, randomized, placebo controlled setting in the NCT01774344 study.

The majority of patients are males in late middle age with predisposing hepatic cirrhosis (of varying etiology) or chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Although a global challenge for healthcare being the fifth most common cancer worldwide, the majority of the burden of HCC falls on developing nations where endemic hepatitis B virus infection and aflatoxin exposure rather than hepatitis C virus and alcoholism drive most cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】HCC in childhood is very rare and accounts for less than 0.5% of all pediatric malignancies. However, it is the second most common malignant liver neoplasm after hepatoblastoma in children. Its relative frequency is 0.5 to 1.0 cases per million children. It is commoner in adolescents than in infants. There may be some evidence that neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves the R0 resection rate in pediatric cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Unlike hepatoblastoma, pediatric conventional HCC usually develops in the presence of underlying liver disease and this may include chronic hepatitis B infection, metabolic disorders such as tyrosinemia, Wilson’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and glycogen storage diseases, structural problems such as biliary atresia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and infantile cholestatis. However, in children as compared to adults, there are more de novo cases arising in non-cirrhotic livers. The prognosis in HCC is poor and this may relate to the intrinsic resistance of HCC to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy certainly compared with hepatoblastoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】A subtype of HCC is fibrolamellar carcinoma. Its distinguishing features histologically include abundant fibrous collagenous bands, eosinophilic tumor cell cytoplasm and enlarged nucleoli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Fibrolamellar HCC predominantly occurs in young patients without underlying hepatitis or cirrhosis. Serum α-fetoproteins are not elevated in most cases and the male/female ratio is approximately equal. Although many early studies suggested a better prognosis with the fibrolamellar variant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, it is increasingly being appreciated that this may well not be the case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The 5-year survival rate was 76% for resected fibrolamellar HCC versus 37% for resected HCC in one study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】The typical presenting symptoms of HCC may include upper abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting, and constitutional symptoms such as poor appetite, lack of energy and unintentional weight loss. In patients with a history of chronic liver disease, HCC may first be suspected when de-compensation of cirrhosis occurs manifesting with variceal bleeding, worsening ascites associated with peripheral oedema, jaundice and encephalopathy. HCC is also increasingly detected in asymptomatic individuals who are undergoing serological (AFP) and ultrasound surveillance in view of their liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B virus infection.\n\n【6】Treatment for HCC is largely determined by the stage of the tumor at presentation and the Barcelona Liver Clinic staging system is widely used for this purpose. It incorporates patient-related factors such as co-morbidities, symptoms and performance status, tumor-related factors including size and number of tumor nodules on imaging and the presence of nodal metastases and extra-hepatic spread and also the severity of any underlying cirrhosis as assessed by the Child-Pugh score and degree of portal hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Patients with early stage disease may be treated with curative intent with ablative techniques, partial hepatectomy or liver transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Intermediate stage disease is treated with loco-regional therapies including transarterial chemo-embolization (TACE) typically with doxorubicin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> and latterly radioembolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u> leading to a median survival of 20 - 24 months. Advanced stage HCC is treated with sorafenib, a multi-targeted small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, cKIT, RAF and Flt3 ligand, as standard-of-care. The survival benefit is demonstrable but modest with an increase of 2.8 months in median overall survival in a European population with predominantly hepatitis C virus infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> and 2.3 months in an Oriental population with mainly hepatitis B virus infection and more advanced cirrhosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】Here, we present a case of fibrolamellar HCC, diagnosed in childhood in the absence of underlying liver disease with a protracted course, multiple resections of metastatic deposits and dramatic response to radiation therapy.\n\n【9】A 14-year-old girl, without any significant past medical history except for meningococcal septicaemia at the age of 5 years, presented for further evaluation with a 3-month history of profound fatigue and lethargy. She also described amenorrhoea for 1 year and a recurrent rash on the bridge of her nose. She did not complain of bowel symptoms, loss of appetite, abdominal pain or jaundice.\n\n【10】On clinical examination, she was slightly hirsute over her trunk and was slightly tachycardic with pulse of 100 and a blood pressure of 125/80 mm Hg. On abdominal examination, she had an enlarged liver, 4 - 5 cm below the right costal margin. She was also hyperpigmented around her neck but no other abnormalities were noted. There was no family history of liver disease or malignancy.\n\n【11】Her laboratory investigations showed a slightly raised alanine aminotransferase at 51 IU/L, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 88 mm/h and C-reactive protein of 44 mg/L with no other abnormal results. Abdominal ultrasound showed a solid echogenic lesion measuring 17 × 18 × 10 cm displacing hepatic and portal veins within her liver. A localized lesion was confirmed on CT imaging: there was no evidence of metastasis. Serum alpha-fetoprotein level was within the normal range.\n\n【12】She underwent laparotomy and extended right hemi-hepatectomy with caudate lobe resection and there was complete macroscopic clearance of visible disease. Histopathology confirmed a primary fibrolamellar HCC, measuring 28 cm diameter, with no histological evidence of fibrosis or steatohepatitis in the background liver and no evidence of infective or metabolic liver disease as shown in Figure 1 . Figure 2 shows the typical fibrocollagenous bands of fibrolamellar HCC. Following surgery, she received adjuvant systemic therapy in the form of chemotherapy with intravenous doxorubicin and sorafenib for a period of 6 months. However, 9 months following the completion of adjuvant therapy, routine surveillance imaging detected a seemingly isolated recurrent lesion in the remnant liver. This was resected with a non-anatomical resection with clear margins and histomorphological appearances identical to the primary lesion, with evidence of focal lymphovascular invasion as shown in Figure 3 . A follow-up CT scan 6 months later demonstrated multiple lung lesions. At this point, after an informed discussion with the patient and her family regarding the relative paucity of evidence for sorafenib in fibrolamellar HCC, sorafenib was re-instituted at a dose of 800 mg daily and this was later reduced to 600 mg daily in view of grade 1 - 2 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia and generalized dry skin. Over the next 3 years, she underwent multiple video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical wedge resections for asymptomatic small pulmonary nodules (one in the right lung and three in the left lung) detected on routine surveillance thoracic and abdominal imaging. Histology confirmed metastatic fibrolamellar HCC in all nodules (with evidence of bile production by tumor cells), one resected nodule had positive resection margins and a hilar lymph node was involved with tumor. Histomorphological appearances resembled those of the primary lesion in the liver . She continued with sorafenib 600 mg during this period with reasonably good tolerance.\n\n|  <mark>Figure 1.

This was kept under surveillance and sorafenib was continued. However, 8 months later (5 years after initial diagnosis of fibrolamellar HCC in the liver) there was unequivocal enlargement of the left hilar node with a new enlarged right hilar node as shown in Figure 5a, b At this point, her sorafenib dose was increased back to 800 mg daily. Once again, a thoracic surgical opinion was sought and due to proximity of the left-sided lymph node to the inferior pulmonary vein and the right-sided node to the pulmonary artery, surgical resection was deemed inappropriate. Therefore, in a patient with an excellent performance status and no respiratory co-morbidity, an opinion regarding radical radiotherapy was sought. She underwent tomotherapy to bilateral mediastinal lymph nodes with a dose of 50 Gy in 20 fractions. Sorafenib was continued during radiotherapy and following completion of radiotherapy, she developed oral mucositis which had never been experienced with sorafenib previously. A follow-up CT scan 7 months after radiotherapy confirmed complete resolution of the bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and no evidence of recurrence elsewhere . Six months after this, despite remaining well and free of cancer-related symptoms, she developed grade 2 palmar-plantar erythrodysasthesia despite supportive measures. Due to the adverse effects on her quality of life, after an informed discussion she discontinued sorafenib and was kept under regular surveillance.

An isolated intestinal angioedema is even less common but can lead to a great morbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 3 \\]</u>. It can have several etiologies, from hereditary to a drug reaction, especially from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Its incidence is rising due to the increased use of these drugs, occurring in up to 1% of patients with angioedema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\- 7 \\]</u>. Its diagnostic is difficult because of the non-specific symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea) often related with other pathologies, such as gastroenteritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】The patient was a 28-year-old woman, diagnosed with arterial hypertension 2 months before and medicated with lisinopril and an oral contraceptive. She was admitted to the emergency room with a generalized and intense (8/10) abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting and a single episode of watery stool. The patient did not report any fever, labial edema, dyspnea or similar.\n\n【4】In the objective examination, she was hypertensive (blood pressure of 200/140 mm Hg) without evidence of cardiac dysfunction or fever and her abdomen was distended and painful to superficial and deep palpation. No other changes were found, namely in the oropharynx and in the cardiopulmonary, anorectal and neurological systems.\n\n【5】The clinical analysis revealed leukocytosis (20,590/µL) with neutrophils predominance and negative C-reactive protein. There were no other significant abnormalities. The patient was also submitted to an abdominal ultrasound which revealed a small volume of ascites scattered throughout the four quadrants. This was confirmed by an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan that also showed a parietal thickening of a 20 cm segment in the middle ileum.\n\n【6】According to the initial findings, the main hypothesis was IBD with subocclusive presentation associated with a hypertensive urgency. Therefore, the patient was admitted to an intermediate care unit and treated with a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. At the same time, she stopped taking the ACEI. Given the condition severity and the clinical suspicion, the patient was medicated with antibiotics and corticoids empirically. This unsuccessful strategy was suspended 48 h later, since there was no support for maintaining it: the microbiological and autoimmune studies came back all negative. Thus, other diagnoses were considered, such as intestinal angioedema caused by ACEIs. This hypothesis was also supported by the clinical evolution of the case: fast clinical recovery, continuous apyrexia, no inflammatory syndrome associated, quick resolution of the imagiological findings and negative results for the microbiological studies, serologies, autoimmune parameters and hereditary angioedema.\n\n【7】The patient was discharged and has been followed as an outpatient, asymptomatic and without a record of new episodes. She has normal blood pressure, does not take ACEI anymore and the study pending secondary causes for hypertension came back negative.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Intestinal angioedema is a rare condition that is very difficult to diagnose. It occurs essentially as a result of ACEIs taking. Out of these, the most common one is lisinopril 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 8 \\]</u>. ACEs can lead to bradykinin accumulation due to its lack of degradation, causing vasodilation and vascular permeability that in turn result in mucosal edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】This event can occur any time during ACEI pharmacotherapy, but most of them occur in the first year of use, ranging from days to several years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 8 \\]</u>. The condition is more common in women and black people and manifests with more frequency in the jejunum, followed by the ileum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 9 \\- 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Symptoms are non-specific and not taken into account sometimes, especially when isolated, with no other mucous membranes involved, leading to underdiagnoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The most referred symptoms are abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea (mostly watery) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\- 10 \\]</u> and the laboratory results are usually normal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Concerning imagiology, the most common finding is the parietal thickening of part of the intestine, sometimes with ascites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. This clinical, laboratory and imagiology presentation is similar in many other conditions, such as infectious diseases, inflammations and even hereditary angioedema. Therefore, clinical suspicion must be at the highest level, where findings are taken into account for coming back negative. In this case, other pathologies were excluded due to the absence of fever and inflammatory syndrome and due to the fast clinical resolution after drug withdrawal with no record of reoccurrence. The inexistence of other imagiology findings such as fistulous paths, abdominal fat densification and adenopathies, which could indicate other pathologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, also contributed to the final diagnosis.\n\n【12】The treatment involves drug withdrawing and supporting measures, with symptom resolution within 48 h in most cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Therefore, the authors describe the case of a young woman recently medicated with lisinopril, who had clinical and imagiology findings compatible with intestinal angioedema caused by that drug, with no other mucosae affected. Intestinal mucous edema is even rarer when relating to angioedema caused by ACEI. This finding was more suggestive of an inflammatory/infectious process. In this setting, the ascites found were a discriminating factor giving its infrequency in IBD. Finally, the symptoms disappeared after drug withdrawal, with no reoccurrence and with no other condition being the probable cause for her symptoms.\n\n【14】The authors want to raise awareness about this rare condition that is caused by ACEIs, very commonly used in the daily practice. The associated symptoms can cause great morbidity, with several admissions to the emergency department and consequently unnecessary exams.

The groups and the specific diseases associated with each group are: anginosus group, abscess formation; mitis group, septicemia in neutropenic patients and endocarditis; salivarius group, endocarditis; mutans group, dental caries; bovis group, bacteremia associated with cancer and meningitis. Anginosus group of streptococci comprises three distinct species: Streptococcus anginosus ( S. anginosus ), Streptococcus intermedius ( S. intermedius ), and Streptococcus constellatus ( S. constellatus ) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. These microorganisms are found in the oral cavity and in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as part of the normal commensal flora. S. intermedius is more frequently found in dental plaque, whereas S. anginosus is more frequently found in the GI tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Infections caused by these bacteria range from minor oral infections to serious, complicated, life-threatening infections. They are commonly associated with abscess formation, bacteremia is rare and mortality rate is low. Predisposing or underlying conditions are reported as previous surgery, trauma, diabetes, immunodeficiency and malignancy, but may also be related to poor oral hygiene or the patient’s overall health condition. S. anginosus was the most frequently isolated species from clinically significant specimens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3-8 \\]</u>. We report here an unusual presentation of S. anginosus with severe sepsis and liver abscess secondary to biliary tract perforation possibly due to cholelithiasis in a diabetic female patient. This case also emphasizes that early diagnosis and administration of appropriate antibiotic with surgical drainage are crucial to save live and to improve patient outcome.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 49-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital, complaining of high fever, chills, sweating, headache, cough, nausea and arthralgia lasting for 1 week. She had previously been given gemifloxacin at another center. She was hospitalized with a presumptive diagnosis of sepsis with possible intra-abdominal origin and to research other possible etiologies of fever (including endocarditis, brucellosis). On her physical examination, body temperature was 40 °C, blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg, pulse rate was 134 beats/min, respiratory rate was 30 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 99% while she was breathing ambient air on room air. Physical examination revealed right upper quadrant mild tenderness with no distension or rebound. The rest of examination was normal.\n\n【4】Initial hematologic and biochemical laboratory data were as follows: Hb, 12.3 g/dL; leucocytes, 20,300/mm <sup>3 </sup> with 85 % neutrophils; thrombocytes, 403,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> ; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 82 IU/L (RR 0 - 32 IU/L); alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 41 IU/L (RR 0 - 35 IU/L); alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 315 IU/L (RR 35 - 114 IU/L); gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), 86 IU/L (0 - 40 IU/L); albumin, 3.2 g/dL (RR 3.5 - 5.5 g/dL); total bilirubin, 1.317 mg/dL (RR 0 - 1.2 mg/dL); direct bilirubin, l.05 mg/dL (RR 0 - 0.3 mg/dL); sodium, 131 mmol/L (135 - 145 mmol/L); chloride, 91 mmol/L (RR 98 - 107 mmol/L); serum creatinine, 0.73 mg/dL (RR 0.5 - 1.2 mg/dL); ferritin, 901 ng/mL (RR 13 - 150 ng/mL); sedimentation rate, 107 mm/h; and C-reactive protein, 398 mg/L (RR 0 - 5 mg/L); D-dimer, 0.4 μg/mL (RR 0 - 0.5 μg/mL). Serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C, syphilis, Brucella, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalo virus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Entamoeba histolytica and hydatid cyst is negative.\n\n【5】Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to exclude infective endocarditis at the same day. The transthoracic echocardiographic findings suggested that it may be due to infective endocarditis, and therefore, transesophageal echocardiography was recommended. The initial antibiotic regimen was intravenous meropenem (3 × 1 g/day), intravenous gentamicin (1 × 160 mg/day) and intravenous teicoplanin (1 × 800 mg/day maintenance dose following of 2 × 800 mg initial dose) for possible intra-abdominal sepsis and endocarditis after blood culture was obtained. Performed transesophageal echocardiogram finding after 1 week was negative for endocarditis.\n\n【6】After 4 days of incubation, blood cultures taken on admission grew S. anginosus . According to the antimicrobial susceptibility results, it was sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefepime, imipenem, chloramphenicol and vancomycin, but resistant to penicillin and oxacillin. The identification of the S. anginosus at the species level was done using the BBL Crystal system. The susceptibility of the isolate was performed by the disk diffusion test. S. anginosus growth on blood agar was shown in Figure 1A , and gram stain of S. anginosus was shown in Figure 1B .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. S. anginosus .

Hypoechoic areas in the liver were identified by the ultrasonography (USG). On the next day, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. The T2-weighted MR image reveals a nodule in the gallbladder lumen that may belong to calculi and a lesion at approximately 14 × 9 cm in size in the right lobe of the liver . Liver abscess with biliary tract perforation was shown in Figure 2B . It was reported that the described findings may be significant for liver abscess secondary to gallbladder perforation. The patient was consulted by general surgery and taken to exploratory laparotomy. Surgical drainage of abscess and a cholecystectomy were performed. S. anginosus was isolated from peritoneum and abscess cultures. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of all isolates that were obtained from blood, peritoneal fluid and abscess sample was same. The initial antibiotic regimen was meropenem, gentamicin and teicoplanin, but after infective endocarditis was excluded, this regimen was continued with meropenem only. She was discharged after 4 weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy with cure. At 3 months, she remained well and repeated abdominal USG showed normal results.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. MRI findings.

These species are catalase-negative gram-positive cocci, as the other members in the genus streptococcus. Colonies are typically < 0.5 mm in diameter after 24 h incubation and can be either beta- or alpha-hemolytic, although majority of them are alpha-hemolytic and are grouped to viridans group of streptococci. They are capable of causing a variety of multiple body site infections. They also tend to form abscesses and cause hematogenously disseminated infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Bacteremia from the anginosus group is rare and usually the result of an identifiable focus of infection, such as intra-abdominal abscess, deep-seated head and neck infection, brain abscess and endocarditis. It is usually associated with underlying hepatic and biliary tract disease, neoplasia and diabetes. In the absence of endocarditis or distant focal suppurative complications, bacteremia has a good prognosis. Liver abscess and associated sepsis can be a serious and potentially life-threatening condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 , 9-12 \\]</u>. In one study about anginosus group of bacteremia cases, it was reported that 16 (55%) had intra-abdominal sepsis (liver abscess, cecal abscess, abdominal abscess, cholangitis/cholecystitis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In another study, members of the anginosus group were accounted 3-15% of streptococcal isolates from patients with endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. S. anginosus is the most frequently isolated species in bacteremic patients, while S. constellatus is infrequently isolated species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4-7 , 10 \\]</u>. In our case, all blood cultures of S. anginosus were isolated. The liver abscess and biliary tract perforation limited by peritoneum were detected on the CT. There were no endocarditis findings shown by the transesophageal echocardiogram. She was diagnosed as S. anginosus sepsis with liver abscess secondary to biliary tract perforation due to cholelithiasis according to clinical, laboratory and radiological findings. At surgery the diagnosis of cholelithiasis with perforation and liver abscess was confirmed. Surgical drainage of abscess and cholecystectomy with exploratory laparotomy was performed by the general surgery. S. anginosus was isolated from culture of both peritoneal fluid and abscess specimens. Our patient’s extensive intra-abdominal disease process was considered that liver abscess is most likely as a complication of cholestasis due to gallstones. The presence of high fever and palpable right upper quadrant tenderness may indicate an acute onset.\n\n【13】Anginosus group organisms are generally susceptible to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to penicillin G are usually less than 0.125 μg/mL with occasional strains with MICs greater than 1.0 µg/mL. Penicillin resistance is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13-15 \\]</u>. According to a recent study, penicillin is proved to be an effective antimicrobial agent, with only five isolates (1.7%) showing penicillin resistance and 13 isolates (4.5%) showing intermediate resistance. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was approximately 2%, and approximately 1% of isolates showed intermediate resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. The recent increase in MICs to penicillin G suggests that initiation of penicillin G combined with gentamicin may be prudent. Alternatively, higher doses of penicillin or vancomycin could be used. Some authors suggest initial combination therapy with penicillin and an aminoglycoside because of the tolerance in some isolates. Subsequent therapy should be guided by the results of culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.\n\n【14】Clinically, infections caused by these bacteria have responded well to beta-lactams. Vancomycin and/or clindamycin have been alternative choice in case of beta-lactam allergies. Minimum 2 weeks of therapy (or more) should be administered in the setting of bacteremia. The longer therapy may be needed in case of liver abscess, according to the clinical response to the therapy. In addition to parenteral antimicrobial therapy, treatment of an abscess involves drainage of purulent material or surgical excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 7 \\]</u>. In our case, S. anginosus strain was resistant to oxacillin. Therefore, meropenem therapy was continued. The patient was successfully treated by surgical drainage and administration of appropriate antibiotherapy.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Anginosus group often causes invasive pyogenic infections. Positive blood cultures, especially when multiple, should be evaluated for further investigation. It is also important to consider that successful treatment of these infections requires surgery and appropriate antibiotics. Antimicrobial therapy should be administered until clinical signs of infection have resolved.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Competing Interests</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:37:26", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:38:52", "cost": 85.714}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:38:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:37:25"}

Repetitive vigorous activity, abnormal quality of bone or morphologic abnormalities involving proximal femur such as coxa vara are known to be related with the development of femoral neck stress fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 3 \\]</u>. Femoroacetabular impingement is a pathologic condition in which subtle structural abnormalities of proximal femur or acetabulum can evoke an abutement between femoral neck and acetabular edge. It is considered as a main pathophysiology to understand osteoarthritis of hip. However, a study about high prevalence of radiologic finding of acetabular retroversion, a form of femoroacetabular impingement in patients with stress fracture in military recruits had reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. We propose a possible relationship between the stress fracture of femoral neck and femoroacetabular impingement in case report of patient who had the stress fracture with hip of excessive acetabular anteversion and coxa profunda.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】The patient was a 59-year-old female housewife visited hospital with a chief complaint of worsening left lateral and groin pain which was aggravated by activity and insidious in nature. She could not walk with weight bearing due to left hip pain. Over the past 3 years, she had developed stiffness and discomfort in the left hip, and over the past 2 months the hip pain had gone worse. Her usual level of activity was not different from other housewives. She had a history of hypertension, L5 spondylolysis and degenerative knee arthritis, but had no history of smoking or drinking. The body mass index indicated that she was obese (body mass index 38.2 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ). Physical examination revealed that the patient’s left hip pain was primarily reproduced with passive hip flexion- adduction- internal rotation and the Patrick test. Slight weakness of the left hip abductor and internal/external rotator muscles was noted. On radiographics, a crack with lateral opening was found in left femoral neck . Also, dense sclerotic line was noted around the fracture site in femoral neck. The neck-shaft angle was 128 in degree and posterior wall sign was positive. The lateral center-edge angle was 39 in degree and cross-over sign was negative. The femoral head was more medial with acetabular fossa being medial to ilioischial line (coxa profunda). Computer tomography revealed findings consistent with a complete stress fracture of subcapital neck in left hip . The irregularity of posterior articular cartilage in head, ossified labral cartilage and joint space narrowing were noted . The angle of acetabular anteversion in left hip was 29 in degree. 3D reconstructed computer tomography showed femoral head was deeply located in acetabulum. Bone cysts were found in bilateral superolateral head. Also the film showed femoral head was over-covered posteriorly due to excessive acetabular anteversion . Her bone mineral density in dual energy absorptiometry showed -2.1 of T-score in right femoral neck. The patient underwent total hip replacement of the left hip  and successfully returned her life.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Genetic factors may play a role in the development of stress fractures in individuals subjected to heavy exercise and mechanical loading 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Also stress fracture of the femoral neck in active adults is known to be related with coxa vara 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Biomechanically, direct muscle pulling effect increases in coxa vara and leads to fatigue of opposing muscle group. Recently, the paper about femoral neck stress fracture which is related with FAI was published 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】FAI is associated with subtle morphologic abnormalities around the hip which result in abnormal contact between the femoral head/neck and the acetabular margin during extreme range of motion, causing tearing of the labrum and avulsion of the underlying cartilage lesion, continued deterioration, and eventual onset of arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Protruded head-neck junction (cam type) and over-coverage of head by acetabulum (pincer type) or both (mixed type) evoke impingement between head and acetabulum. Cam lesion can be seen in prior femoral neck fracture, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease and after femoral osteotomy. Typical conditions of pincer lesion seen to cause of FAI include posttraumatic deformities, coxa profunda, protrusio acetabuli, and acetabular retroversion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Ganz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> first reported the association between the development of femoroacetabular impingement and femoral neck fracture. Malunited femoral neck fracture by improper reduction might produce mechanical symptoms by impingement. They found impingement phenomenon intraoperatively in cases of treatment for hip pain after femoral neck fracture. Also FAI mechanism is proposed as a cause for nonunion of femoral neck fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Impingement was identified at surgery and all cases of nonunion went on to uneventful healing after elimination of the cause for impingement. Decreased clearance between femoral neck and acetabulum can be aggravated by a bulge or a spur at the fracture site. The acetabular rim acts as a fulcrum on which the femoral neck fracture is strained repetitively with motion across the fracture. And higher incidence of acetabular retroversion, a form of pincer type impingement, is found in military recruits with femoral neck stress fractures than the normal people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. But nevertheless the association between acetabular retroversion and femoral neck stress fracture, it is unclear whether the presence of acetabular retroversion is a true risk factor for development of a femoral neck stress fracture.\n\n【12】We report a case of stress fracture of femoral neck in patient who has no known risk factors such as prolonged, excessive physical activity or abnormal bone quality. The exact etiology of stress fracture of femoral neck is still not clear. We propose the relation between femoroacetabular impingement by excessive acetabular anteversion and coxa profunda and femoral neck stress fracture. Biomechanical effect by FAI mechanism in abnormal orientation of acetabulum and deep socket may predispose to development of stress fracture of femoral neck. Carpintero et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> reported coxa vara, a form of cam impingement, is possibly related with stress fracture of femoral neck. There was a normal neck-shaft angle (128 in degree) and no abnormal head-neck offset in our case.\n\n【13】Stress fracture of femoral neck usually needs surgical treatment. Closed pinning method is known to be a gold standard treatment. But when its diagnosis is delayed or in displaced fracture, the complications after internal fixation such as avascular necrosis or nonunion can occur. If osteoarthritis was previously developed by FAI before stress fracture, hip symptoms can persist after fracture healing. When the stress fracture is associated with FAI, the combined cam or pincer lesion can be corrected with internal fixation by debridement of protruded head-neck junction and superior labrum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. We performed total hip arthroplasty because of combined hip osteoarthritis and the avoidance of nonunion by repeated abuttment.\n\n【14】We report a rare case of stress fracture of femoral neck in patient with excessive acetabular anteversion and over-coverage by coxa profunda which can support the hypothesis of role of FAI mechanism on development of stress fracture of femoral neck.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:50:41", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:50:58", "cost": 16.857}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:50:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:50:41"}

It is torsion of the stomach anteriorly or posteriorly around its longitudinal or horizontal axis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The symptoms may be incomplete or periodic obstruction with dysphagia and regurgitation or vomiting. Acute volvulus is manifested as an acute upper gastrointestinal obstruction and rarely, if there is vascular obstruction and necrosis, as an acute abdominal emergency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Gastric volvulus occurs most frequently in the elderly and only in 10-20% in infants and children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In the elderly patient, gastric volvulus is usually associated with a hiatus hernia. It relates to displacement of the stomach through the hiatus into the chest that produces vigorous peristalsis and antiperistalsis predisposing to volvulus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. We report a rare case of an elderly patient with chronic volvulus of the stomach in traumatic hiatus hernia after a severe injury of the chest by a road accident which was diagnosed endoscopically, documented radiologically and managed operatively by a successful gastrostomy. However, a delayed diagnosis may be threatening to the patient’s life and what should be highlighted is the difficulty of the diagnosis and the management in rare cases, such as chronic volvulus of the stomach.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】An 84-year-old man admitted to our hospital with a 2 months history of dyspepsia and intermittent non-bilious vomiting. He had a medical history of diabetes mellitus, severe cardiopathy with pacemaker, chronic respiratory disease and six months ago a road accident with a severe injury of the chest. Physical examination revealed a heavily ill patient with Hippocratic face and malnutrition. The pathological findings from the abdomen and respiratory system were succussion splash of the stomach and decrease of respiratory murmur in the left lung. Laboratory data besides an anemia, hypoproteinemia and electrolyte disorders, the other blood investigations, as well as tumor markers, were within normal limits. Gastroscopy revealed a hiatus hernia and ulcerative lesions of the gastric mucosa close to the gastro-esophageal area, the fundus and the posterior surface of the body. Biopsies from the edges were obtained four times, which showed no evidence of malignancy. Furthermore, it posed the suspicion of the gastric volvulus because gastroscopy failed to enter in the distal stomach, the lumen appeared to narrow to a point through which the endoscope could not be passed. Chest and Abdomen x-ray showed a high left hemidiaphragm with a large air bubble above a fluid level in dilated stomach. Abdominal and Thorax CT scan showed rupture of the left hemidiaphragm and old ribs fractures of the left hemithorax. However, barium meal  confirmed, apart from hiatus hernia, the diagnosis of the gastric volvulus. The final diagnosis of the severely ill patient was traumatic hiatus hernia and gastric volvulus, which led us to reach a decision of surgical treatment. The preoperative preparation was supplemented by a detailed examination of the heart and the respiratory system, arterial blood gases as well as spirometry test. He was of high perioperative risk because of the severe concomitant diseases and his malnutrition. The patient during the diagnostic approach and until the surgical procedure was managed by nasogastric tube without bilious backflow, intravenous fluid administration, adjustment of electrolyte and parenteral nutrition. Laparotomy was carried out through a midline incision. The stomach was found to be almost throughout, about 2/3 of it, into the thorax through a large hiatus of the diaphragm. It was in incomplete anterior torsion around the horizontal axis and the pylorus and duodenum were elongated and stretched. In addition, it was fixed in the thorax posteriorly at the cardiac portion and part of the fundus. Consequently, it was reduced partially after pull and sufficient mobilization of the greater and the lesser curvature. However, the high operative risk of the patient did not permit a major procedure of hiatus hernia repair. Thereby, it was decided that the fixation of the stomach would be simplest and safest procedure to prevent displacement and rotation. The fixation was performed by gastrostomy drainage at the level of the antrum. The stomach wall was sutured by the anterior abdominal wall at the gastrostomy exit using 0 vicryl sutures. The abdomen was then closed without peritoneal drainage. Postoperative course of the patient was with no complications. He was able to drink on the 3rd postoperative day and the gastrostomy tube was clamped. A barium meal examination was done on the 5th postoperative day  and the gastrostomy tube was removed uneventfully on the 12th postoperative day. After that, he discharged on the 14th postoperative day and he remains well since.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

In our patient the cause of the gastric volvulus was apparently secondary. It was a diaphragm rupture after a severe injury of the thorax by a road accident that favoured the displacement of the stomach into the chest. Thereby, a traumatic hiatus hernia had been produced which led to the gastric volvulus. Here, it should be emphasized the difficulty to differentiate the ischemic ulcerative lesions of the gastric mucosa by the torsion from the malignancy, which was excluded by successive biopsies.

She noticed a mass of the right elbow 11 years earlier, and she had a past history of undergoing tumor resection and flap surgery at another hospital 9 years earlier, and the mass was diagnosed as a giant cell tumor. On pathological examination, the margin of the resected tumor was diagnosed as intralesional resection. However, she did not go to the hospital postoperatively. On physical examination, there was a poorly mobile mass measuring 8 × 5 cm on the olecranon side of the right elbow joint. She had diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure, with a shunt on the right forearm. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this tumor around the elbow joint showed low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and low to high intensity on T2-weighted images. After administration of gadolinium contrast, it was enhanced irregularly. A needle biopsy was performed, and histopathologic examination showed a giant cell tumor resembling the pathological findings 9 years earlier, with no malignancy.\n\n【4】The tumor gradually grew larger and formed ulcers. The tumor was present almost over the entire circumference of the upper arm and invaded the humerus, with the shunt blood vessel in the right forearm. Therefore, it seemed that it was difficult to preserve the limb, and upper arm amputation was performed. Pathological examination showed invasive proliferation to the synovial membrane, osteoclast-like giant cells, proliferation of round cells, and hemosiderin accumulation between cells . In addition, lesions were continuous from the periosteum and proliferated invasively in the dermis. The histological diagnosis was PVNS. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. There was no recurrence of PVNS at the most recent follow-up 2 years after surgery.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

It is a common complication in patients with advanced liver disease, 49.4% of patients with cirrhosis have serum sodium concentration less than 135 mmol/L. Hyponatremia in the setting of cirrhosis is associated with severe ascites, high frequency of hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Additionally, hyponatremia is also a powerful predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis.\n\n【2】The etiology of hyponatremia in cirrhotic patients can be attributed to either intravascular volume depletion commonly found in patients who receive high dose of diuretics or hypervolemic hyponatremia due to diminished effective circulatory volume (ECV) resulting from splanchnic vasodilatation. The diminished ECV due to splanchnic vasodilatation will lead to increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which in turn results in decreased ability to excrete the daily water intake. Whereas the treatment of hypovolemic hyponatremia secondary to overdiuresis is to discontinue the diuretics and to restore the intravascular volume depletion with isotonic saline, the mainstay of treatment for hypervolemic hyponatremia secondary to the impaired water excretion is free water restriction. Recently, vasopressin-2-receptor antagonist (V2RA) has been used as an alternative treatment in cirrhotic patients whose hyponatremia fails to correct with free water restriction alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The increase in serum sodium concentration occurs within the first few days of treatment and ranges from 2 to 7 mmol/L on average 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. To date, there has been no report of the failure of V2RAs in correcting hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis. We report a patient with cirrhosis whose hyponatremia failed to improve with tolvaptan and conivaptan but subsequently corrected with treatment with midodrine and octreotide.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 51-year-old female with past medical history significant for alcoholic cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and multiple admissions for hyponatremia was admitted for management of severe hyponatremia. On presentation, the patient had a serum sodium concentration of 118 mmol/L associated with a serum and urine osmolality of 254 and 519 mOsm/kg H <sub>2 </sub> O respectively. The patient’s hyponatremia failed to improve with free water restriction. Therefore, tolvaptan, a selective V2RA, was started with close monitoring of the patient’s serum sodium concentration (Of note, tolvaptan was FDA approved for treatment of hyponatremia secondary to cirrhosis at that time). Despite adequate up-titration from 15 to 60 mg over a 96-h period, her serum sodium level remained relatively unchanged at a level of 120 mmol/L. Due to the potential concern for inadequate gastrointestinal absorption of the drug, a decision was made to change from oral tolvaptan to intravenous conivaptan. Her serum sodium concentration, however, minimally improved to 123 mmol/L even after up-titration of the conivaptan to the maximum dose. On hospital day 13, the patient was started on midodrine and octreotide for treatment of acute kidney injury thought to be due to HRS, which slowly brought the patient’s serum sodium level from 122 to 132 mmol/L over a 5-day course coinciding with the resolution of the HRS. Repeat laboratory values revealed a stable serum sodium level of 135 mmol/L 2 weeks after initiation of the drugs.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Hyponatremia commonly occurs in patients with cirrhosis. In cirrhosis, the pathogenesis is thought to be related to the hemodynamic changes and secondary neurohumoral adaptation that occurs in these patients. Patients with cirrhosis usually have a marked reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and mean arterial pressure due to splanchnic vasodilatation. The splanchnic vasodilatation in cirrhotic patients results in arterial underfilling, and the resultant ECV depletion in these patients stimulates the secretion of ADH. The elevated ADH secretion leads to increased water reabsorption in the collecting tubule, which in turn results in decreased ability to excrete the daily water intake. Therefore, V2RAs can be an effective therapy for cirrhosis-associated hyponatremia by antagonizing the action of ADH at the collecting tubule. By reducing the urinary concentration in the collecting duct, V2RAs result in the urinary excretion of electrolyte-free water excretion.\n\n【7】In our patient, her hyponatremia, however, failed to improve with free water restriction and V2RAs. Her hyponatremia was refractory to tolvaptan and conivaptan despite a reduction in urine osmolality from 519 mOsm/kg H <sub>2 </sub> O to 242 mOsm/kg H <sub>2 </sub> O. Her hyponatremia persisted until she was started on midodrine (selective alpha-1 adrenergic agonist) and octreotide (a somatostatin analog) for treatment of HRS. Treatment with midodrine and octreotide resulted in the resolution of the HRS as well as hyponatremia with an associated increment in her urinary output and relatively constant urinary osmolality.\n\n【8】The lack of response to the V2RAs in our patient was due to disruption in the mechanisms involved with dilute urine formation. The normal physiology of urinary dilution is determined by numerous factors such as normal glomerular filtration rate, adequate delivery of H <sub>2 </sub> O to the diluting segments of the nephron mediated by inhibition of proximal Na <sup>+ </sup> and H <sub>2 </sub> O absorption, intact Na <sup>+ </sup> and Cl <sup>- </sup> reabsorption at both the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubules, and the inhibition of H <sub>2 </sub> O absorption at the collecting duct resulting from the suppression of ADH secretion. In light of the aforementioned factors, the efficacy of the V2RAs in cirrhosis will be limited by the decrease in distal delivery of the filtrate to the collecting tubule which is the site of ADH action . Therefore, the lack of response to the V2RAs in our patient was likely due to the decreased GFR and avid proximal sodium and fluid reabsorption . The low urinary Na <sup>+ </sup> of < 20 mmol/L was consistent with the increased proximal sodium and fluid reabsorption resulting from the decreased ECV. This will in turn lead to diminished distal fluid delivery to the collecting tubule, the site of ADH action. Distal fluid delivery is best assessed by determining the sum of the fraction of filtered chloride excreted (chloride clearance/GFR) plus the fractional free water clearance (free water clearance/GFR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Unfortunately, urinary chloride concentration before and after treatment with midodrine and octreotide was not available to assess distal fluid delivery in this patient. However, the improvement in hyponatremia with midodrine and octreotide in our patient was likely due to increased distal fluid delivery to the collecting tubule as reflected in the increase in urinary output in the setting of relatively constant urinary osmolality. Urinary osmolality initially decreased from 519 mOsm/kg to 242 - 250 mOsm/kg after the administration of tolvaptan and conivaptan. After treatment of HRS with midodrine and octreotide, urinary osmolality remained relatively constant at 245 - 248 mOsm/kg. Although the urinary osmolality remained relatively constant, her urinary output increased from 570 - 1200 mL to 1750 - 1850 mL, thereby resulting in an increment in free water clearance. Free water clearance increased from 0.076 L/day prior to initiation of midodrine and octreotide to 0.31 L/day after administration of midodrine and octreotide. Unfortunately, urinary sodium and potassium concentrations were not available to calculate urinary electrolyte-free water clearance. The increase in free water clearance was likely due to increased fluid delivery to the diluting segments of the nephron and collecting tubule due to improvement in the ECV induced by midodrine and octreotide.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Impaired urinary dilution in cirrhosis. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【10】To date, this is the first case report of a cirrhotic patient with hyponatremia refractory to V2RAs which resolved with treatment with midodrine and octreotide. Further studies are needed to help substantiate the effectiveness of this novel therapeutic approach in cirrhotic patients whose hyponatremia fails to improve with V2RAs. In these patients, assessment of distal fluid delivery will be helpful in elucidating the mechanism of action of midodrine and octreotide in the correction of hyponatremia refractory to V2RAs.\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:44:26", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:45:24", "cost": 57.222}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:45:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:44:25"}

We present a case of a 29-year-old woman found to have a myxoid liposarcoma located in her right lower back.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 29-year-old woman presented to the hospital for an elective excision on a soft, mobile mass located on her right lower back. The patient stated that the mass had been causing her discomfort and had been present for quite some time. The mass was excised and during the procedure was noted to be intramuscular. Upon biopsy results, the gross specimen was partially capsulated measuring 11.0 × 10.0 ×5.5 cm, tan-pink to brown in color with a smooth outer surface. The tumor extended into the margins of the excision. The mass consisted of mainly hypocellular, vaguely lobulated, proliferation of small ovoid to spindle cell admixed with scattered lipoblasts, in a background of abundant myxoid material and arborizing vascularity. At the periphery of the lobules, increased cellularity was noted with moderately increased cytological atypia. Mitotic activity was very rare and areas of round cell composed less than 5% of the total tumor. In many of the tumor cells, stain with p53 showed evidence of p53 overexpression. Stain with Ki-67 showed a proliferation index of 2-8%. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was positive for detection of rearrangements of the DDIT3 ( CHOP ) gene at the 12q13 locus, consistent with the diagnosis of myxoid liposarcoma. Following the diagnosis, the patient had a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, which revealed a resection scar along the right paraspinal musculature with no evidence of lymphadenopathy, lesions or pathology. Due to evidence of the tumor extension into the margins, the patient underwent re-excision at the previous resection site of the mass. The patient tolerated the procedure well and will be followed up for subsequent post-operative visits. The biopsy results of the re-excision revealed no evidence of residual myxoid liposarcoma.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Liposarcomas are one of the most common types of soft tissue sarcomas. According to the World Health Organization, there are four types. These subtypes are myxoid/round cell, pleomorphic, well differentiated and dedifferentiated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>. Of the four subtypes, myxoid liposarcomas account for about 20%. Myxoid liposarcomas typically present as a painless slow growing mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. They are frequently located in the intramuscular fascia, under or on muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】The most common area for myxoid/round cell liposarcomas to develop is in the lower extremities, which make up about 75-80% of cases. More specifically, about two-thirds of cases manifest in the thigh 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>. In about 8% of cases they present in the retroperitoneum and 5% appear in the upper extremities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is atypical for a liposarcoma to present in the back 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, no cases of primary myxoid liposarcomas subtype located in the lower back have been reported. We report a rare case of a myxoid liposarcoma presenting in the right lower back.\n\n【7】Histologically, this subtype exists on a spectrum with variable amounts of round cells. The existence of greater than 5% of round cells within the mass is associated with a poor prognosis and is considered high-grade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 7 \\]</u>. Approximately 95% of cases of myxoid/round cell liposarcoma subtype have a TLS-CHOP fusion gene on cytogenetic analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. This fusion gene is specific for this subtype and is the result of t(12;16)(q13;p11) translocation. It has been suggested to be a dysfunctional transcriptional regulator that interrupts differentiation of adipocytes resulting in proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. In our case, the mass was found to have this specific fusion gene. Seen in less than 5% of cases, EWS-CHOP fusion gene is a rare variant that has also been observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】The standard of care for patient with local disease is wide local surgical resection with the confirmation of negative margins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Low-grade myxoid liposarcomas have a low local recurrence rate. At a 5-year follow-up, approximately 8% of diagnosed patients will have local disease recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In comparison to other types of soft tissue sarcomas, myxoid liposarcoma is more radiosensitive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Adjuvant radiation is typically considered for patients who have considerable number of round cells composing the mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Myxoid/round cell liposarcoma has a tendency to metastasize to extrapulmonary sites, specifically, soft tissue and skeletal sites such as the mediastinum and the retroperitoneum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. With the potential to metastasize to distant sites, prompt diagnosis as well as providing the best possible treatment options is critical 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Conclusions\n\n【11】This case illustrates the challenges associated with the diagnosis and management of these rare tumors. Myxoid liposarcomas should be included as a possible differential diagnosis in cases of soft tissue masses that present in the lower back. An early accurate diagnosis will not only result in appropriate treatment from the get-go, but also save both the patient and clinician valuable time and resources. Although a rare entity, considering myxoid liposarcoma in the diagnosis of soft tissue masses may prevent misdiagnosis and possibly alter the clinical approach.\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SQ participated in the case.

The weakness started suddenly, initially affecting the feet then it progressed to involve both legs. There was no upper limb weakness, neck stiffness, stool or urinary incontinence or sensory deficits. The patient reported cough that started a few days prior to the onset of the weakness. There was no associated fever, shortness of breath, headache, vomiting or diarrhea. There was no history of similar episodes in the past and no history of recent travel or contact with sick persons. The patient does not smoke or consume alcohol.\n\n【6】On physical examination, the patient appeared well in no acute distress. Blood pressure was 104/62 mmHg, heart rate was 92 beats per minute with a regular rhythm and temperature was normal. Examination of the chest, cardiovascular system, and abdomen was normal. He was oriented to time, place and person. Neurological examination revealed reduced power (grade 2/5) of both lower limbs. Reflexes of both lower limbs were absent while plantar reflexes were equivocal. Sensory examination was normal.\n\n【7】Laboratory investigations revealed the following: white blood cell count 10.1×10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, hemoglobin 11.7 g/dL, hematocrit 34.7 %, mean corpuscular volume 80.9 fL, platelet count 301 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL, and glucose 5.6 mmol/L, while sodium, potassium, HCO <sub>3 </sub> , creatinine and calcium were normal. Alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase were elevated at 78 U/L and 70 U/L respectively (Normal less than 40 U/L). Total protein was 70 g/L, albumin was 32 g/L, alkaline phosphatase was 171 U/L and bilirubin was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a white cell count of less than 5/µL, no red blood cells, protein of 0.21 g/L, and glucose of 3.5 mmol/L. Gram stain and culture of the cerebrospinal fluid showed no organisms and no growth while viral serology and PCR testing for tuberculosis were negative. One day following admission, the patient developed fever with a temperature of 38.5°C. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral non-homogeneous opacities involving the right middle and left upper zones . The purified protein derivative (PPD) test was positive at 14 mm after 48 hours. Examination of the sputum showed 25 acid-fast bacilli per 100 fields. Subsequent culture grew mycobacterium tuberculosis. The clinical impression was Guillain-Barre syndrome associated with pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient was started on intravenous Immunoglobulin G and anti-tuberculosis treatment along with physiotherapy. He improved and regained full power and mobility after 30 days.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Antero-posterior view chest X-ray showing non-homogeneous opacities involving the right middle and left upper zones. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Guillain-Barre syndrome, first described in 1916, is characterized by acute areflexic muscle paralysis with albuminocytologic dissociation (high levels of protein in the cerebrospinal fluid with normal cell counts). Since poliomyelitis has nearly been eliminated, Guillain-Barre syndrome is currently the most frequent cause of acute flaccid paralysis and constitutes a neurological emergency.\n\n【11】Two-thirds of cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome are preceded by symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection or diarrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The most frequently identified infectious agent associated with the subsequent development of Guillain-Barre syndrome is Campylobacter jejuni followed by cytomegalovirus. The incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome is estimated to be 0.25 to 0.65 per 1000 cases of Campylobacter jejuni infection and 0.6 to 2.2 per 1000 cases of primary cytomegalovirus infection. Other infectious agents with a well-defined association with Guillain-Barre syndrome are Epstein-Barr virus, Varicella-Zoster virus, mycoplasma pneumonia, and hemophilus influenza 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】There is evidence from both human and animal studies that some cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome are caused by an infection-induced aberrant immune response that damages peripheral nerves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Four key factors that control this response have been identified: antiganglioside antibodies, molecular mimicry and cross-reactivity, complement activation and host factors. In about half of patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome, serum antibodies to various gangliosides have been found in peripheral nerves such as LM1, GM1, GM1b, GM2 and GD1a 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. These gangliosides have a specific tissue distribution in peripheral nerves and are organized in specialized functional microdomains called “lipid rafts”, and play a part in the maintenance of the cell membrane structure. It is proposed that immune responses directed towards the infecting organisms are involved in the pathogenesis of Guillain-Barre syndrome by cross-reaction with neural tissues. The infecting organism induces humoral and cellular immune responses that, because of the sharing of homologous epitopes (molecular mimicry), cross-react with ganglioside surface components of peripheral nerves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The phenomenon of molecular mimicry has been shown between the gangliosides of peripheral nerves of patients with Guillain–Barre syndrome and the lipooligosaccharide part of the outer membrane of C. jejuni 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】We describe a patient with Guillain-Barre syndrome who was found to have pulmonary tuberculosis. We could find only 2 reports in the literature describing 3 patients with such an association 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】One report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> described two patients: The first was an 18-year-old man who was admitted with acute onset of weakness involving upper and lower limbs for 10 days along with feeling unwell, weight loss and chronic productive cough. After treatment with anti-tuberculosis medications and steroids, the patient subsequently improved and had complete neurological recovery after 10 weeks. The second patient was a 56-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital with a 3-week history of weakness of all four limbs, chronic productive cough, loss of appetite and fever. The patient was started on anti-tuberculosis therapy, but she was discharged against medical advice on the third day and died at home. No further details were provided in the report. The diagnosis of tuberculosis in both patients was made on the basis of radiological imaging, as they were too weak to produce a satisfactory specimen of sputum.\n\n【15】The second report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> described a 35-year-old man with a history of leprosy and tuberculous pleural effusion who was not adherent with therapy. He presented with sudden inability to walk and weakness of the upper limbs that was preceded by symptoms of a respiratory tract infection. Guillain-Barre syndrome was diagnosed. The sputum smear for Acid-fast bacilli was negative, but the chest X-ray revealed findings suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis.\n\n【16】In a review of 1,100 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, about two-thirds of the cases were associated with medical conditions. The review reports tuberculosis as an associated illness in 8 cases. However, these cases were grouped under “tuberculosis of the lungs and brain”; the review does not provide further details and did not differentiate between pulmonary tuberculosis and other forms of tuberculosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】To our knowledge, the patient we report is the first case of Guillain-Barre syndrome with microbiological confirmation of pulmonary tuberculosis. This association has not been confirmed and it remains a question whether tuberculosis is a contributory factor in the development of Guillain-Barre syndrome. We wish to draw the attention of clinicians to the consider tuberculosis as a possible associated condition when evaluating patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors certify no conflict of interest in the case report presented within.

In addition, patients can also present with neutropenia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Neutropenia, AIHA and ITP can occur at the same time or present sequentially 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. ES is more prevalent in the pediatric population as compared to adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】ES can be categorized as primary or secondary which is dependent on presence or absence of associated connective tissue diseases/autoimmune diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Primary type is considered to be idiopathic whereas secondary ES is associated with other diseases or syndromes such as systemic lupus erythematosus, common variable immunodeficiency and non-Hodgkin lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. When associated with other diseases, the management (and outcomes) may be different as opposed to the management of primary ES, which makes correct diagnosis of integral importance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】ES is associated warm AIHA, in which immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies react with red blood cell (RBC) surface antigens at body temperature, as opposed to cold AIHA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】The presenting signs and symptoms of ES can be variable. Although primarily a chronic condition, it is characterized by relapsing remitting flares which can be challenging to manage. It is rare for patients to develop thrombotic events. Although venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) have been reported in some cases, there are no clearly established incidence rates of arterial thrombosis in patient with ES. According to one retrospective study evaluating 68 patients of ES, six patients developed cardiovascular events over a period of 4.8 years among which four had acute coronary syndrome (ACS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The study also reflected that risk of AIHA-related complication such as thrombosis may supersede the risk of thrombocytopenia-related complications such as bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction presenting with ES is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Treatment involves steroids, although patients who do not respond to steroids, may require more aggressive interventions such as administration of rituximab or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). In some cases, with significant thrombocytopenia, splenectomy may also be considered although the benefits of splenectomy are not well established. We present an interesting case of ES with unstable angina (UA) requiring rituximab and intravenous (IV) steroids.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】Investigations\n\n【7】A 64-year-old male with past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease with two prior stent placements in right coronary artery and patent ductus arteriosus, presented to the emergency room (ER) due to chest pain and shortness of breath for 2 weeks. He also endorsed fatigue and gross hematuria. Patient did not have any petechiae, bleeding elsewhere or rash. The review of systems was otherwise unremarkable.\n\n【8】Diagnosis\n\n【9】Physical examination demonstrated splenomegaly and palmar pallor. Otherwise, examination was unremarkable. Electrocardiography (EKG) was done which demonstrated ST depression in leads I, aVL, V5 - V6, T wave inversion in lead III and aVL; these findings were new compared to previous EKG. Laboratory results were as follows: hemoglobin 9.6 (reference value: 13.8 - 18 g/dL); platelet count 58 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL (reference value: 150 - 450 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL); segmented neutrophils 80% (25-62%); troponin < 0.03 ng/mL (reference value: < 0.03 ng/mL); lactic acid 2.5 mmol/L (reference value: 0.5 - 2 mmol/L); total bilirubin 5.4 mg/dL (reference value: 0.3 - 1 mg/dL); direct bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL (reference value: 0 - 0.2 mg/dL); reticulocyte count 3.8% (reference value: 0.7-1.7%); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 478 U/L (reference value: 140 - 271 U/L); haptoglobin < 30 mg/dL (reference value: 44 - 215 mg/dL). His iron, vitamin B 12, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and folic acid were within normal range. Ferritin level was not checked. His prior hemoglobin approximately 11 months to admission was 15.4 g/dL. Prior EKG did not show any gross ST segment or T-wave changes but did show q waves in lead II, III, V4, V5 and V6. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was done which was unremarkable except for splenomegaly (16 cm). Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal ejection fraction and moderate aortic stenosis. Blood smear was urgently done, and it indicated spherocytes without evidence of schistocytes. Patient was admitted with concern for possible AIHA and UA.\n\n【10】Cardiology consultant evaluated the patient and observed patient’s presentation was consistent with UA with symptoms also being contributed by anemia. Hematology also evaluated the patient and determined that patient’s presentation was likely secondary to ES due to presence of hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. They also observed other possibilities included paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea despite AIHA being more likely due to smear findings. Direct antiglobulin test was obtained, and it came back positive for IgG confirming the diagnosis of AIHA. Due to concurrent likely immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, the diagnosis of ES was established. Patient was also considered to have concurrent UA which can be categorized as a thrombotic event despite ES’s association with thrombocytopenia.\n\n【11】Treatment\n\n【12】Patient was started on prednisone 80 mg daily. Patient continued to have anemia and after two doses, prednisone was switched to dexamethasone 40 mg once daily for 4 days. Patient underwent cardiac stress tests once he clinically improved which indicated mild reversible inferior apical ischemia. Cardiac catheterization was pursued, and it revealed 95% stenosis of proximal left circumflex artery requiring single drug eluding stent placement. Dual antiplatelet therapy was also initiated due to high risk of stent thrombosis despite ongoing intermittent transfusions.\n\n【13】Patient continued to have anemia (dropped from 9.6 to 7.6 g/dL) despite five intermittent blood transfusions, although his platelet counts improved (58 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL to 88 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL). Patient remained hemodynamically stable. Later his hemoglobin dropped to 7.1 g/dL and by this time he had received a total of eight packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions since admission. He was considered to be a candidate for rituximab, and he was started on 375 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> every week for total four doses. Patient’s hepatitis B core antibody later was noted to be positive with a negative hepatitis surface antigen and positive hepatitis B surface antibody. There was a concern for risk of reactivation of hepatitis B with rituximab for which he was started on entecavir prophylactically. His hemoglobin dropped to 6.3 g/dL 2 days after receiving the rituximab, which prompted the involvement of surgical consultants for possible splenectomy. However, subsequently after two more units of hemoglobin his hemoglobin stabilized, and splenectomy was deferred.\n\n【14】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【15】Patient’s hemoglobin stabilized after first dose of rituximab. IV steroids were transitioned to oral prednisone 90 mg once daily. He was continued on dual antiplatelet therapy which he tolerated well, and thrombocytopenia continued to improve. Patient’s chest pain resolved post cardiac catheterization. Once patient clinically improved, he was discharged with plans for slow tapering of steroids of prednisone 90 mg and recommendations for outpatient cardiology and hematology follow-up. Plan was also to continue rituximab weekly for a total of four doses.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】“Primary Evans syndrome (ES) is defined by the concurrent or sequential occurrence of immune thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia in the absence of an underlying etiology” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Diagnosis of primary ES is established once other etiologies such as primary immunodeficiency, systemic lupus erythematosus and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are ruled out 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. If patient is anemic, a smear should be done promptly which may show spherocytes, which may help in diagnosis as it is indicative of autoimmune hemolysis. The absence of schistocytes can be considered a clue to rule out TTP as was the case in our patient. Coombs’s test can also be done which can further assist in establishing diagnosis. Other tests indicating hemolytic anemia include LDH, haptoglobin, reticulocyte count and bilirubin levels. Often, ES can have relapsing and remitting course requiring recurrent interventions. Due to the rarity of syndrome itself, no randomized studies focusing on treatment are available till date and therapy is mainly tailored towards addressing AIHA and ITP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. “Corticosteroids represent the cornerstone therapy, used at a daily dose of 1 mg/kg of prednisone” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Patients who do not respond to steroids may require rituximab, IVIG or even splenectomy.\n\n【18】ACS can rarely occur with ES and is associated with high morbidity and mortality, necessitating early reperfusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. As this is a thrombotic process, it can be difficult to diagnose in the setting of ES which commonly presents with thrombocytopenia. The pathophysiology of the thrombotic events in ES is not clearly understood. One hypothesis revolves around association of AIHA with thrombotic events since ES manifests with AIHA as well. AIHA has been associated with thrombotic events and according to literature 15-33% adults with warm AIHA may have VTEs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, considering ES patient also have thrombocytopenia, the mechanism of thrombosis in such patients is not clearly understood. There are a limited number of cases reports or case series emphasizing on the occurrence of thrombotic events in ES.\n\n【19】In our patient, normal troponin levels further complicated the situation making it harder to determine if underlying cardiac ischemia was present. However, there was high suspicion due to the character of his chest pain and risk factors. A cardiac stress test was pursued, and it was positive for ischemia. Multivessel disease was later confirmed through cardiac catheterization leading to stent placement which also presented a new challenge in the form of necessity of dual antiplatelets and risk of bleeding due to anemia as well as thrombocytopenia. Although platelets contribute to occurrence of ACS, thrombocytopenia does not result in reduction of this problem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Hence, in our patient dual antiplatelet therapy was continued.\n\n【20】As the patient had risk factors for coronary artery disease these risk factors can be the primary reasons for UA. Considering recent onset of chest pain and concurrent presence of ES, it was considered that UA may have occurred due to thrombotic process secondary to ES, although it is difficult to establish this with certainty.\n\n【21】Patient did not initially respond to oral steroids which complicated the hospital course further. Prednisone was transitioned to IV dexamethasone, although there is limited evidence of any significant benefit to patients who do not respond to steroids. Eventually he was started on rituximab infusion which resulted in stabilization of his hemoglobin levels. He only required two more units of PRBC transfusions after rituximab infusion and thereafter his hemoglobin was noted to uptrend. Prior to initiation of rituximab, patient had required eight units of PRBC transfusions. This highlights the importance of transitioning from steroids of immunotherapy in non-responsive cases. Rituximab which has been approved for lymphomas has also been used to treat ITP and AIHA such as ES 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】An interesting factor of this case was positive results for core hepatitis B antibody. There have been reported case reports of ES secondary to hepatitis B. In addition, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a new boxed warning of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation after 109 cases of fatal reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were receiving rituximab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In our patient considering his hepatitis B surface antibody was positive he was considered not to have active hepatitis B infection. However, it was deduced that there may be residual HBV in the liver with potential for reactivation with rituximab. Hence, he was prophylactically given entecavir which is an inhibitor of replication of HBV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Learning points\n\n【24】ES is a rare disorder which can present with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Although it is usually associated with thrombocytopenia it can sometimes lead to thrombotic processes. ACS can rarely present in the setting of ES which can be challenging to manage considering the treatment may require stent placement and dual antiplatelet therapy in the setting of anemia and thrombocytopenia. The treatment of ES involves steroids which can be followed by rituximab, IVIG or splenectomy for non-responsive cases. If a thrombotic event such as ACS occurs due to ES, patients may require reperfusion and dual antiplatelet therapy. Early intervention and management can prevent mortality and morbidity.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No funding was obtained in preparation of this manuscript.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors have contributed to the manuscript preparation.

Its incidence is approximately 1 in 10,000 - 20,000 individuals, and it is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, although at least 25% of cases result from a new mutation in the FBN1 gene . The clinical diagnosis is based on the revised Ghent criteria and can be confirmed by genetic testing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The primary organ systems involved include the heart, aorta, eye, musculoskeletal, skin, lung, and central nervous system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Involvement of the heart and aorta are recognized as the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with MFS. Dilation of the ascending aorta occurs in 77% of affected individuals, with progression to dissection in 14% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】The primary cellular defect of MFS is a mutation of the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1) on chromosome 15 (15q21.1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Fibrillin-1 is a matrix glycoprotein essential for the formation of microfibrils that regulate the formation and repair of connective tissue throughout the body. These microfibrils are also integral to the normal control and function of growth factors including tissue growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which are responsible for the development and repair of connective tissue. Fibrillin-1 regulates TGF-β which activates metalloproteinases (MMPs). The combination of structural microfibril matrix abnormalities and dysregulation of matrix homeostasis mediated by excess TGF-β and overexpression of MMPs is responsible for the phenotypic features of MFS in various organ systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】The imbalance between MMPs and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) damages the elastin structure, leading to loss of vascular smooth muscle cells, with the associated clinical manifestations involving the aorta and heart. Given the multisystem involvement of MFS, anesthetic care is frequently required during surgical or orthopedic procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. We present a 15-year-old adolescent who required anesthetic care during spinal fusion. The perioperative implications of MFS are presented, previous reports of anesthetic care reviewed, and options for perioperative care discussed.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Institutional Review Board approval is not required at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, Ohio) for the presentation of single case reports. The patient was a 15-year-old, 54 kg adolescent who presented for posterior spinal fusion for the treatment of thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis. Her past medical history was significant for MFS, psychiatric disorder with a history of aggressive behavior, and attention deficit disorder. Her past surgical history included mechanical aortic valve replacement 3 years prior to the current surgery. Aortic valve sparing aortic root replacement and mitral valve repair were performed 6 years prior to surgery. Her medication regimen included warfarin 5 mg once a day, aspirin 81 mg once a day and losartan 25 mg once a day.\n\n【6】Warfarin and aspirin were discontinued 4 days prior to surgery and full anticoagulation provided by a continuous heparin infusion. Echocardiogram 5 months prior to the procedure demonstrated mitral valve prolapse with mild regurgitation and normal systolic function. The heparin infusion rate was based on laboratory parameters (partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and anti-factor Xa assay). The patient was held nil per os for 8 h. The heparin infusion was discontinued 4 h prior to the surgery; however, the PTT remained elevated at 60 s, so the surgical procedure was delayed for 1 hour and a repeat PTT was obtained (44 s).\n\n【7】The patient was premedicated with intravenous midazolam (2 mg) through a pre-existing peripheral intravenous cannula, and transported to the operating room, where routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were placed. Following preoxygenation with 100% oxygen, anesthesia was induced with propofol (130 mg), lidocaine (60 mg), and sufentanil (20 µg). Bag-valve-mask ventilation was provided without difficulty. Rocuronium (50 mg) was administered to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Direct laryngoscopy was performed with a Miller 2 blade and revealed a Cormack-Lehane Grade 1 view. A 7.0 mm cuffed endotracheal tube was placed on the first attempt. Two 16 gauge intravenous cannulas were placed. A 20 gauge arterial cannula was placed in the left radial artery. Neurophysiological monitoring, including motor evoked potentials (MEP) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) was performed.\n\n【8】Following our usual practice to allow for neurophysiological monitoring during spinal surgery, anesthesia was maintained with desflurane titrated to maintain the bispectral index (BIS) at 50 - 60 and a sufentanil infusion of 0.1 - 0.3 µg/kg/h to maintain the mean arterial pressure at 55 - 65 mm Hg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. An esmolol infusion (25 - 30 µg/kg/min) was administered to maintain the heart rate at the baseline rate of 60 - 80 beats/min and a lidocaine infusion (30 µg/kg/min) was administered to prevent arrhythmias and to provide analgesia. The patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position. The surgical procedure included an anterior arthrodesis of the thoracic and lumbar spine (T11-L4) through an anterior thoracoabdominal incision. The surgical duration was 400 min. Total blood loss was estimated at 750 mL and urine output was 325 mL. Total fluids included 1,774 mL of isotonic crystalloid, 500 mL of 5% albumin, and one unit of packed red blood cells.\n\n【9】During wound closure, the sufentanil infusion was discontinued. Acetaminophen (1,000 mg) and hydromorphone (0.5 mg) were administered to provide postoperative analgesia. After completion of the surgical procedure and prior to tracheal extubation, bilateral ultrasound-guided, erector spinae blocks were performed with 0.25% ropivacaine (20 mL) with epinephrine (1:200,000) and preservative-free dexamethasone (4 mg). Following completion of the blocks, the patient was turned supine and her trachea was extubated in the operating room. She was transported to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CTICU). Postoperative pain control in the CTICU was provided with hydromorphone delivered via a patient controlled analgesia device. Warfarin was restarted on postoperative day (POD) 1. Enoxaparin was administered from POD 1 to 4. The remainder of her postoperative course was uncomplicated and she was discharged on POD 6.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】MFS is a well described, autosomal dominant connective tissue disease caused by mutation of the FBN1 gene. The diagnosed is based on the revised Ghent nosology established in 2010 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva (z value ≥ 2), aortic root dissection, ectopia lentis, and the FBN1 mutation are the most important factors for diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Effective perioperative care begins with a thorough preoperative evaluation, with identification of anatomical and end-organ effects of MFS, as well as adverse effects or implications related to therapeutic interventions, such as the long-term anticoagulation required in our patient. Of primary concern to anesthesia providers is the potential for difficult endotracheal intubation related to a high arched palate and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\- 12 \\]</u>. A significant percentage of patients with MFS have a high arched palate (59%). TMJ involvement is also common, with symptoms of TMJ dysfunction noted in 52% of patients with MFS, of whom 35% had previously received medical treatment, and 24% had symptoms of subluxation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 11 \\]</u>. Given these concerns, the appropriate equipment for dealing with a difficult airway, including an indirect laryngoscopy device, should be readily available prior to anesthetic induction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. If there are concerns, general anesthesia can be induced by the incremental inhalation of sevoflurane in 100% oxygen with the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation until effective bag-valve-mask ventilation is demonstrated. Alternatively, as in our patient, intravenous induction can be achieved with propofol, and effective bag-valve-mask ventilation can be followed by the administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent.\n\n【12】Airway involvement with craniofacial abnormalities and laxity of upper airway musculature results in a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with MFS, even in the absence of obesity. Craniofacial and upper airway skeletal muscle involvement results in increased nasal airway resistance and upper airway collapse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. Given the residual effects of opioids and neuromuscular blocking agents on respiratory function, postoperative monitoring may be indicated, especially when ongoing pain management requires the use of opioids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】In addition to airway abnormalities, respiratory and pulmonary involvement may predispose to barotrauma due to blebs or bullae. The frequency of spontaneous pneumothorax has been reported to be as high as 4-15% in patients with MFS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 18 \\]</u>. Apical blebs or bullae significantly increase the risk of spontaneous pneumothorax. When there are concerns noted on a preoperative chest radiograph, computed tomography may help in risk stratification. Additionally, chest wall and vertebral bony abnormalities (scoliosis or pectus excavatum) may impact respiratory function. Progressive scoliosis is a well-known cause of pulmonary dysfunction. Scoliosis with a curve greater than 65, 100, and 120 degrees may result in restrictive lung disease noted only on pulmonary function testing, symptomatic lung disease with a clinical impact, and alveolar hypoventilation, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Patients with MFS and scoliosis or pectus excavatum may have marked reductions in total lung capacity, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume over 1 s (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ). Pulmonary function values calculated by body height underestimate true values in patients with MFS because of long-bone overgrowth. Expected values calculated by normalized or sitting height are suggested to give a better evaluation of true pulmonary function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Given these concerns, intraoperative strategies to minimize barotrauma may be indicated, including the use of lower tidal volumes, careful monitoring or peak inflating pressure, prolongation of the inspiratory time, and pressure-controlled ventilation with monitoring of exhaled tidal volume. If alterations in compliance or resistance are noted, the potential for a pneumothorax as the etiology must be considered.\n\n【15】Postoperatively, severe kyphoscoliosis related to neuromuscular disease, as well as OSA and primary respiratory involvement, may predispose to respiratory insufficiency or failure. Patients who have abnormal results on their pulmonary function test, particularly a forced vital capacity less than 30%, or those who have hypercapnia preoperatively have been shown to have a higher need for postoperative ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Preoperative optimization of pulmonary function is suggested, including the aggressive treatment of respiratory infections and instructions regarding the use of postoperative incentive spirometry. Non-invasive techniques of respiratory support, such as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), may facilitate postoperative tracheal extubation and avoid postoperative respiratory insufficiency or failure in patients with pre-existing pulmonary dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 24 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】As noted in our patient, the cardiovascular system is frequently affected in patients with MFS, including aortic and pulmonary artery dilation, valvular regurgitation, left ventricular dysfunction, and arrhythmias. MVP is the most common cause of severe mitral valve regurgitation, as upregulation of TGF-β results in myxomatous changes of the atrioventricular valves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. This results in elongation and thickening of atrioventricular valve leaflets. By 30 years of age, the Weibull cumulative distribution has been reported to be 42.6% for MVP, 56.5% for MVR of any degree, 6.7% for severe MVR, and 0.9% for MV endocarditis in patients with MFS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. In children with early onset of severe MFS, mitral valve dysfunction, which can lead to pulmonary hypertension and congestive heart failure, is the leading cause of death in infancy. Tricuspid valve regurgitation and prolapse can also occur, although surgery is rarely required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. Aortic valve regurgitation can occur as well, but it generally occurs in the second and third decade of life, related to progressive aortic root dilation.\n\n【17】Aortic root dilation is the most common cardiovascular manifestation of MFS, occurring in 60% of affected individuals. Aortic root rupture and dissection remain the most life-threatening events in patients with MFS. The aorta dilates most between 6 to 14 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>. Management may include both medical and surgical management options. Medical therapy includes a combination of β-adrenergic antagonists and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). Beta-adrenergic blockade reduces heart rate, blood pressure, and aortic root dilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. The target heart rate is less than 60 - 70 beats per minutes at rest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. Intraoperatively, esmolol may be used to provide rapid and precise heart rate control. ARBs regulate excessive TGF-β signaling, which may play an etiologic role in aortic root dilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Ascending aorta root replacement is the only way to prevent fatal events including dissection and rupture. Elective surgery is recommended when the maximum aortic root diameter is greater than 5.0 - 5.5 cm in adult patients. If the patients have a family history of aortic rupture, or increase in aortic diameter exceeding 1 cm/year, earlier surgical intervention is recommended. Various surgical procedures have been offered, including various valve sparing procedures which preserve the native aortic valve and eliminate the need for long-term anticoagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\- 34 \\]</u>. When mechanical valve replacement is performed, long-term anticoagulation with coumadin is required.\n\n【19】Guidelines for perioperative anticoagulation therapy have been published by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>. As in our patient, coumadin or other oral anticoagulation agents are stopped 3 - 4 days prior to surgery, and full anticoagulation started with heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight) once the international normalized ratio (INR) falls below the therapeutic threshold. Intravenous unfractionated heparin is stopped 4 - 6 h prior to surgery and subcutaneous low molecular heparin is stopped 12 h prior to surgery, to allow return of coagulation function to normal. Anticoagulation is restarted as soon as the postoperative bleeding risk allows, typically 12 to 24 h after surgery.\n\n【20】In addition to valvular dysfunction and aortic root dilation, ventricular arrhythmias may occur in up to 21% of patients with MFS, with one report suggesting that this was the cause of death in 4% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 36 \\]</u>. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was also noted in 40% of patients. Microfibril abnormalities in the matrix of the myocardium result in arrhythmogenesis and may affect conduction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 37 \\]</u>. Given these concerns, a preoperative 12-lead ECG and echocardiogram are suggested. A more thorough workup such as a Holter monitor may be indicated in patients with symptoms.\n\n【21】Ocular involvement, including ectopia lentis, is common in MFS and may predispose to perioperative visual loss (POVL) during spine surgery. Additional ocular involvement may include thinning of the cornea, early onset of cataracts, glaucoma, strabismus, and retinal detachment. Although POVL is rare, its impact on the quality of life is significant, and spinal surgery represents a high risk population with an incidence of POVL ranging from 0.017% to 0.1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. Ischemic injury to the optic nerve due to venous congestion is the most common cause of POVL following spinal surgery. Symptoms present immediately after the surgery and are typically bilateral. Risk factors include anemia, hypotension, blood loss, prolonged surgical times, large fluid requirements, male gender and obesity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 39 , 40 \\]</u>. Prevention should remain the primary focus, with routine position checks to ensure that there is no direct pressure on the eyes or orbits. Others have suggested the use of colloid instead of crystalloid as well as avoidance of hypotension, anemia, and hypovolemia. A staged procedure should be considered if a long surgery is anticipated.\n\n【22】Finally, intraoperative monitoring of spinal cord function with somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) further impacts anesthetic management during PSF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 \\]</u>. Both inhaled and intravenous anesthetic agents may depress SSEP and MEP signal attainment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 42 \\]</u>. Our general practice includes the use of a low dose of an inhalational anesthetic agent combined with the infusion of a potent opioid (sufentanil or remifentanil) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. When inhalational anesthetic agents are used, it is generally recommended to maintain end-tidal concentrations levels at or below 0.5 MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) to allow for adequate MEP monitoring. These agents provide an effective intraoperative anesthetic while allowing for neurophysiological monitoring and providing a rapid emergence at the conclusion of the case.\n\n【23】In summary, we present the perioperative management of an adolescent with MFS for spinal fusion. As the primary defect affects fibrillin-1, a matrix glycoprotein essential for the formation and repair of connective tissue, multisystem involvement is present. Progressive skeletal deformities may require orthopedic procedures such as spinal fusion. Most importantly, the cardiovascular system may be involved with valvular regurgitation, aortic root dilation, and arrhythmias. Additional comorbid concerns include airway involvement (difficult intubation, sleep disordered breathing), respiratory involvement (risk of barotrauma), and ocular involvement. The preoperative evaluation is essential to identify anatomical and end-organ effects of MFS, as well as implications of therapeutic interventions, such as long-term anticoagulation.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors do not have conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:34:29", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:34:35", "cost": 6.379}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:34:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:34:28"}

Laboratory examination yielded the following findings: WBC 10,000/µL (myelocytes 1.0%, metamyelocytes 4.0%, band forms 38.0%, neutrophils 43.0%), platelets 117,000/µL, FDP 90.0 µg/mL, D-dimer 70.0 µg/mL, BUN 38.8 mg/dL, creatinine 2.7 mg/dL, K 3.0 mEq/L, AST 236 U/L, ALT 110 U/L, LDH 512 U/L, γGTP 146 U/L, blood glucose 195 mg/dL, CRP 62.56 mg/dL. Results of CSF Gram staining were suggestive of pneumococci, and cultures grew PRSP. Results of other laboratory tests were normal. Results of urinalysis included 3+ occult blood, 3+ protein, RBC 20-29/HPF (high power field), and white cell casts 20-29/F. Electroencephalogram revealed β activity and some spikes. Findings of brain MRI suggested ventriculitis.\n\n【20】Meropenem 2 g 3 times/day and Dexamethasone 8 mg 4 times /day for 3 days were initiated. Oliguria and DIC were observed (platelets were 57,000/µL on the second hospital day). Fluid, low-dose dopamine, heparin, and gabexate mesylate were injected. From the ninth hospital day, he exhibited rash. He was diagnosed with erythema multiforme, which was suspected to be drug-induced. Meropenem was discontinued on the 10th hospital day and vancomycin 0.5g 4 times/day, ceftriaxone 2 g twice/day, and micafungin 100 mg/day were administered. CSF findings were normalized and antibiotics were discontinued on the 31st hospital day and liver dysfunction was improved. However, he exhibited fever and low back pain. Ceftriaxone 2 g once/day was injected on the 34th hospital day. Spinal MRI in patient 2 revealed low intensity areas on T1-weighted images and high intensity areas on T2-weighted images of the L4 and L5 vertebral bodies and L4/5 intervertebral disc space . Technetium-99m bone scans in both patient 2 showed accumulations in L4 and L5.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. MRI of lumbar vertebrae and abdominal CT scan in patient 2.

CT scan on admission in patient 2 revealed no gallstones , while after liver dysfunction it revealed choledocholithiasis and gallstones .\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】The characteristics of these patients include the following: patient 1 was a 65-year-old executive who worked hard without holidays and slept very little. He showed PRSP meningitis, DIC, infective endocarditis, vertebral osteomyelitis and choledocholithiasis with gallstones. Patient 2 was a 57-year-old singer who worked night and slept from 5:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M. daily. He was a heavy drinker, and traveled and worked without sleep before the onset of meningitis. He showed PRSP meningitis, DIC, acute renal failure, liver dysfunction, vertebral osteomyelitis, and choledocholithiasis with gallstones. Similarities in background included hard work at night and little sleep before onset. Fatigue and stress predisposed Pneumococcal infection.\n\n【25】We think of vertebral osteomyelitis as a complication of PRSP meningitis. Consequently, PRSP meningitis can complicate vertebral osteomyelitis according to the findings of the present case report. Previous authors reported patients of vertebral osteomyelitis complicating pneumococcal meningitis  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 5 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Hematogenous seeding from the CSF space to lumbar vertebrae may cause vertebral osteomyelitis. We think of vertebral osteomyelitis as a possible complication of bacterial meningitis, especially that due to PRSP.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Characteristics of Patients With Meningitis and Vertebral Osteomyelitis |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【27】The question arises whether the choledocholithiasis in these two patients was a complication of vertebral osteomyelitis or PRSP meningitis. There is no evidence for this, and there has been no similar case report. The gallstones were very small, and were not present at disease onset. Therefore, these gall stones were formed after disease onset. There may be an association between choledocholithiasis and PRSP meningitis with vertebral osteomyelitis. Increase in local blood calcium concentration by vertebral osteomyelitis may result in formation of gallstones and choledocholithiasis. Weight loss and gallbladder hypomotility due to parenteral nutrition predisposed cholesterol stones. We think of choledocholithiasis as a possible complication of PRSP meningitis or vertebral osteomyelitis.\n\n【28】We have described two patients of PRSP meningitis with vertebral osteomyelitis and choledocholithiasis. Vertebral osteomyelitis and choledocholithiasis should be noted as possible complications of PRSP meningitis.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Disclosure</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no financial interests tied to this original research, neither is there any other side support.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 09:58:24", "endTime": "2024/09/19 09:59:45", "cost": 81.06}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 17:59:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 17:58:22"}

He was admitted with acute-onset epigastric pain and vomiting. The biochemical results were: WBC count, 11,800/µL; hemoglobin level, 15.3 g/dL; AST, 34 IU/L; ALT, 30 IU/L; total bilirubin level, 0.58 mg/dL; lactate dehydrogenase, 1,156 IU/L (reference range, 250 - 580 IU/L); serum lipase, 1,851 U/L (reference range, 13 - 60 U/L); serum amylase, 740 U/L (reference range, 28 - 100 U/L). The abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan indicated a 2 cm diameter irregular solid lesion in the head of pancreas, suspicion of duedonal invasion and multiple hypoechoic liver lesions, suggesting an advanced pancreatic adnocarcinoma with liver metastases. No retroperitoneal and para-aortic lymph nodes were detected . CA 19-9 was normal. Upper GI system endoscopy showed 5 - 6 mm in diameter, polypoid and centrally ulcerated five lesions in the duedonum and biopsies of them were taken. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy of the hepatic lesions was taken too. The biopsies of both liver and duedonal lesions revealed Burkitt lymphoma (BL). Diffuse infiltration by large atypical lymhoid cells with increased mitotic activity was immunreactive for leukocyte common antigen, Bcl-6, CD10, and CD20 and negative for CD3, CD5 and Bcl-1.

The estimated frequency of primary NHL of the pancreas is about 2.2%. Secondary pancreatic involvement by NHL is equally uncommon; approximately 0.2-2.2% of patients with NHL have pancreatic involvement at presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Pancreatic involvement in lymphoma can be due to peripancreatic lymph node mass causing direct invasion of the parenchyma, intrinsic pancreatic mass lesion with or without discrete peripancreatic lymphadenopathy or secondary extranodal deposit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Cases have been described in both pediatric and adult population, presenting with obstructive jaundice, pancreatitis or symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction. In older individuals with elevated CA 19-9 levels, BL can be mistaken for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and they therefore undergo major surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic masses. The well-circumscribed tumoral form is distinguished from pancreatic adenocarcinoma by the absence of pancreatic duct involvement and the presence of surrounding lymphadenopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Ultrasound- or CT-guided fine-needle biopsy of the pancreatic mass helps to make differential diagnosis.

Although the origin of Merkel cell has been debated, MCC is considered a neuroendocrine tumor (NET) due to its characteristic histopathologic appearance expressing CD56, neurofilament protein (NFP) and chromogranin A 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】It was first described by Toker in 1972 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It is an uncommon skin neoplasm of the elderly population. The majority of patients with MCC present with localized disease at diagnosis and few patients have regional lymph node (LN) involvement and distant metastases. Although it has been previously reported in various anatomical sites, LN metastatic MCC in the absence of a primary site is extremely rare and for this reason there is no standard approach to its management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Curative surgery is commonly recommended to manage localized MCC. Nevertheless, specific postoperative palliative treatments for MCC have emerged, including radiotherapy (RT) or chemotherapy, due to the high local failure rate and the aggressive nature of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】We present a case of a 63-year-old patient who underwent a diagnostic biopsy of an inguinal lump at his local hospital which was proven to be an infiltrated LN by an MCC. Following his imaging staging with computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scan, which showed only abdominal LN disease, she was referred to our department for adjuvant RT after surgery and chemotherapy.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 63-year-old female was admitted to her local hospital with edema of the left lower extremity and motor dysfunction. On clinical examination, a large palpable inguinal mass was identified. It was oval, lobulated, firm, fixed to underlying tissue with normal overlying skin. She reported a history of a palpable mass measuring 2 cm of 2 years’ duration in the left inguinal region with progressive growth. The patient’s medical history was not significant and no suspicious skin lesions were identified. Triplex US of the left extremity revealed normal depiction of the deep veins of the lower extremity without thrombosis but in the abdominal region, swollen rounded LNs were observed. Diagnostic workup imaging including abdominal-pelvic contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a large lobulated mass measuring 7 × 7 cm in the left inguinal area adjacent to the femoral vessels and an enlarged left external iliac LN of size 3.7 × 3 cm. The mass was compressing the left common femoral vein and remained inseparable from the vein as well as from the adductor muscles ventrally. Further diagnostic evaluation including CT of the chest and abdomen demonstrated only a cyst in the right kidney. The results of laboratory examinations, including complete blood count, renal, bone hepatic and coagulation profiles, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) and CA-12-5, revealed no abnormalities. With no primary site of cancer identified, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the mass was performed. According to the histological report, it was a malignancy with extensive necrosis, but it did not result in a definitive diagnosis. The differential diagnosis included malignant neoplasm of small cells and lymphoma. Thus, the patient underwent an excisional biopsy of the left inguinal lymph node. The biopsy specimen showed a low-grade neoplasm with morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics, which were consistent with the diagnosis of MCC. Histopathologically, the neoplastic cells were monomorphic, basophilic, small, round with ovoid vesicular nuclei and scanty cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for LMWKer, Ker20, Nf, synaptophysin and chromogranin. The tumor cells were negative for TTF1, Ker7, HMWKer, p63, Ker5/6, S-100, c-Kit and LCA. Because of the size and involvement of the femoral vessels, chemotherapy was recommended as the most appropriate curative option by the multidisciplinary team. Systemic chemotherapy was administered as six cycles cisplatin/etoposide- based combination schedule with remarkable clinical response. After chemotherapy, the CT imaging study revealed a reduction in size of the inguinal LN measuring 3.6 × 2.6 cm. The patient refused further treatment. Nonetheless, she was admitted again to the hospital 5 months later due to disease progression. The CT demonstrated the presence of the known lymphadenopathy in the left inguinal area with increased dimensions. She managed with partial left inguinal LN surgical excision due to invasion of the safenofemoral junction. The removal part was 14 × 9 × 3 cm and the histological examination showed almost complete invasion of the known malignant cells according to the patient’s history of MCC. Post-surgical PET scan showed low tracer uptake in the left external iliac node (SUVmax: 3.1) and in the left inguinal area (SUVmax: 3.5), with possible reactive etiology. Pathological tracer uptake of 18F-FDG (SUVmax: 3.4) was observed in the left adrenal gland, a finding that could be related to adenoma. There was no evidence of metabolically active lesions in the skin or internal organs. Subsequently, she attended to our Radiotherapy Department after 3 weeks so as to be delivered to her adjuvant radiation therapy. She received a total dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions with a daily dose of 2 Gy in the inguinal region and a total dose of 46 Gy in the external iliac lymph nodes .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Radiotherapy treatment plan. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】It is difficult to diagnose MCC in an LN due to its similarity to other poorly differentiated small basophilic cell tumors, including metastatic melanoma, lymphoma, small cell carcinoma, and neuroendocrine carcinoma metastatic from other organs. Immunohistochemistry is necessary for the definitive diagnosis. On immunohistochemical staining, it is necessary to express the pattern of CK20 positivity along with positivity for any of the neuroendocrine markers such as, chromogranin A, synaptophysin or neuron specific enolase (NSE) and negative TTF-1 staining 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】The origin of MCC has been debated and both neural crest cells as well as epithelial cells have been implicated. Due to the rarity of this malignancy, it has not yet been delineated in the case of metastatic to LNs unknown primary Mercel cell carcinoma (UPMCC), if the tumor arises de novo from neural cells located within the involved LNs or if the primary lesion undergoes spontaneous regression. It has been shown in MCC of a known skin primary there is clear association of the carcinogenesis process with infection from polyomavirus which is on the contrary is not seen in cases of UPMCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】A chest, abdomen and pelvis CT scan usually confirms LN involvement and reveals the extent of disease. Recently the role of PET/CT has been upgraded in depicting the sites of LN disease in MCC due to its high reported specificity and sensitivity, 98% and 90% respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Currently, there is no standard approach to the management of MCC in the absence of a primary site. Mohs micrographic surgery is currently considered as the primary and complementary measure for controlling this serious disease. Since the disease is highly aggressive and the failure rate following surgery alone is high, RT is usually administered as temporary support for numerous patients with MCC. MCC cell lines have been demonstrated to be radiosensitive in vitro . Results have indicated that adjuvant RT, following initial surgery and resection for recurrent MCC and palliation is beneficial. A previous study reported that a radiation dose of 45 Gy had significant impact on local control and prolonged survival in nine patients, whereas a subset of seven patients who received < 45 Gy had a poorer outcome. MCC is considered to be resistant to chemotherapy; however, various agents have been used to treat MCC with variable results. The most commonly used chemotherapy regimen is etoposide/cisplatin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Although multimodal treatment with surgery, RT and chemotherapy results in excellent local control, local recurrence and distant metastases are ultimately developed, possibly owing to the characteristics of MCC or inadequate treatment. Therefore, the role of adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy and RT in MCC remains to be determined in future trials.\n\n【14】In conclusion, MCC presenting with LN involvement without an obvious primary site is uncommon and the diagnosis can be challenging. Meticulous workup for the primary focus as well as thorough pathological and immunohistochemical analysis must be carried out. Advances in understanding the origin and natural history of this rare entity would be helpful in establishing management guidelines in the future.

Opportunistic infections and other immunodeficiency-associated conditions are minimized, and patients can live longer. However, HAART can determine some quite debilitating side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u> such as the HIV-1-associated adipose redistribution syndrome (HARS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Its primary characteristic is an increase of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), often accompanied by a lipoatrophy of the subcutaneous tissue in the face, arms, and legs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In addition, adipose tissue may accumulate in pubis, neck or trunk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u> and in dorso-cervical area (buffalo hump) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.

A recent study estimated in 6% its prevalence among HAART-treated patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Buffalo hump may result from alterations of the adipocytes at those sites. In fact, these cells express the brown fat uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) gene, thus suggesting disturbances in the brown-versus-white adipocyte differentiation pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Another hypothesis is the involvement of adipocyte mitochondrial disturbances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u> with a site-specific compensatory response to metabolic dysregulation, or an enhanced local toxicity elicited by HIV-1 itself and/or by HAART. Although medical treatments including recombinant growth hormone and anabolic steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u> have been used with improvements, surgical approach remains the mainstay of correction of buffalo hump 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】HIV-1 infected individuals are at increased risk of developing non-AIDS cancers, particularly those associated with infections and smoking.

The relationship between the overlapping pathologies is analyzed.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】On March 1990, a 68 year-old heterosexual man presenting with severe thrombocytopenia and recurrent herpes zoster was diagnosed as having a HIV-1 infection stage B3, according to the Centers for Disease Control classification system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. A generalized lymphoadenopathy with CD4+ T cell count of 180 cells/µL was present and a zidovudine-based antiretroviral therapy was started. Hepatotropic virus serology (HAV, HBV and HCV) was negative. Familiarity for hypertension and dyslipidemia, and tobacco smoking were also present. Up to 2000, he changed several antiretroviral treatments, from mono-dual therapies with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) to protease inhibitor (PI)-based triple combination treatments (including indinavir). A partial immune recovery was observed and plasma HIV-RNA levels sometimes reached undetectable values, with occasional high triglyceride and cholesterol levels. A fat redistribution was also evident, with VAT increase and lipoatrophy on arms and legs, and an initial buffalo hump. On January 2001, treatment was replaced with lopinavir/ritonavir plus abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine-fixed dose (inconsistent compliance and virological failure), with worsening in fat redistribution and lipid levels, needing lipid-lowering therapy. In November 2007, patient showed a severe immunodeficiency (CD4+ 13%, 120 cells/µL) with 56.000 copies/mL of HIV-RNA so, based on the results of a genotypic resistance test, darunavir/ritonavir + raltegravir + tenofovir and lamivudine/zidovudine fixed-dose were started. Three months later, plasma HIV-RNA reached undetectable levels (< 50 copies/mL) and CD4+ raised to 19% (202 cells/µL). Subsequently, hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation was diagnosed and an anti-arrhythmic, anticoagulant and anti-platelet therapy added to HAART, but patient developed an ischemic stroke in the right anterior cerebral artery territory. In November 2008, after an acute bronco-pneumonia, he was treated for a left carotid stenosis (85%) and developed a reactive depression with behavioral changes. On April 2009, HAART was simplified with darunavir/ritonavir plus raltegravir and emtricitabine/tenofovir fixed-dose. Viro-immunological assessment showed HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL, CD4+ 18% (295 cells/µL), and normal metabolic parameters. On December 2009, triglycerides and cholesterol were uncontrolled despite the lipid-lowering treatment, whereas buffalo hump determined a functional limitation in head and neck movements. Moreover, patient referred recent onset of persistent cough and dysphonia with dysphagia. A fiberscope examination showed an exophytic neoformation with irregular limits (diameter 2 cm) in the laryngeal epiglottis face. A CT angiography confirmed the neoformation (2.2 × 1.8 cm) in the supraglottic region involving the laryngeal side of epiglottis (with infiltration of the pre-epiglottic and paraglottic fat) and extension to the right epiglottal ear pocket; no thyroid cartilage erosions or nodes involvement; severe lipodystrophy of the subcutaneous adipose tissue in the submandibular, retronucal and dorsal region (antero-posterior diameter 7.4 cm, transverse 16 cm, longitudinal 8.8 cm.). The tumor staging was T3N0Mx. Histological examination showed an infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma. According to the 2008 American Cancer Society guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>, patient underwent a radiation therapy (RT) and platinum-based chemotherapy (CHT) protocol, without HAART discontinuation. The treatment was well tolerated, with only a grade 2 dysphagia and mucositis. A CT scan showed the laryngeal cancer disappearance without significant changes in the buffalo hump mass (antero-posterior diameter 6.0 cm, transverse 15 cm, longitudinal 8.8 cm), despite patient’s 5 kilograms weight loss . Immune activation and metabolic profiles were assessed by plasma concentrations of IL-6 (Enzo Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), leptin (Adipogen International, SOUTH KOREA), adiponectin (Enzo Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and resistin (Adipogen International, SOUTH KOREA), using commercially available kits, being these cytokines a marker of altered lipid and glucose metabolism in HIV-1 patients receiving HAART.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Patient’s metabolic profile was evaluated by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), using the standardized formula (fasting glucose (mmol/L) × fasting insulin (mU/L)/22.5), and by the body mass index (BMI) calculation. HOMA-IR index was 0.24, whereas BMI resulted 30.06 (slightly high). Patient then entered in a follow-up program with bimonthly clinical and fiberscope examination in the first year, quarterly in the second year, then every six months. He is currently followed on regular basis, and no signs of relapse are present; HIV RNA levels are always < 50 copies/mL and CD4+ T cell counts are increased from 89/µL (12%, nadir post-CHT) to 273/µL (18%).\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Causes of metabolic alterations and adipose tissue modifications in HIV-1 patients during HAART are different and controversial, in fact antiretroviral drugs, hormonal changes and cytokine level alterations are involved. Moreover it has been hypothesized that adipocyte functions may play an important role in the development of HARS-associated metabolic abnormalities. Adipocytes are metabolically and hormonally active, secreting proteins such as plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, TNF-α, IL-6, and leptin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\- 26 \\]</u>. Some antiretroviral drugs inhibit differentiation and induce insulin resistance and apoptosis in adipose cells, both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, PIs and NRTIs increase secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, which are involved in altered adipocyte functions, and decrease production of adiponectin, a positive modulator of insulin sensitivity. Adipocytes also produce a protein (resistin) that plays an important function as a link between obesity and insulin resistance. Adiponectin is a structural homologue of the TNF-α family of trimeric cytokines with anti-inflammatory properties that antagonize those of TNF-α 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. These disorders probably result in an increased release of free fatty acids by insulin-resistant adipose tissue. In fact, similar alterations are observed in fat and serum from HIV-1-infected lipodystrophic patients under HAART 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】A cytokine production alteration plays a pivotal role in the development of insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and abnormal fibrinolysis, those are frequently described in metabolic syndrome. Hyper-insulinemia, type-2 diabetes, hypertension, hyper-lipidemia and coronary heart disease (CHD) also characterize this syndrome, often occurring in HIV-1 patients. Moreover, adiponectin negatively correlated with BMI, whereas its reduced levels have been associated with insulin resistance, high cholesterol and hyper-triglyceridemia and these alterations are involved in increased immune activation, responsible of the progressive immune depletion and, possibly, of the increased risk of malignancies. In fact, our patient showed impaired cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism, reduced adiponectin levels and high pro-inflammatory cytokine production, as described in HIV-1 lipodystrophyc patients. Moreover, HOMA index and BMI value were slightly high, as described in patients with mild obesity. These findings strongly suggest the need to monitor patient for early detection of type-2 diabetes. RT/CHT protocol showed no impact on metabolic abnormalities, as well as on cytokine levels, that remained unchanged during follow up.\n\n【14】The risk of non-AIDS cancers among HIV-1 infected patients is much higher than in uninfected population, even after adjusting for age, gender, and race. Potential causes of this trend could be related to differences in lifestyle and rates of traditional cancer risk factors among HIV-1 patients, as well as to other viral infections (or HIV-1 itself), immune deficiency and immune activation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】In HIV-1 infected patients RT, and especially CHT, may cause life-threatening complications such as acute toxicity reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. Subjects with a good performance status can be safety treated with standard radical RT if the CD4+ T cell count is > 200 cells/µL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. Occasional reports of laryngeal cancer presenting a response to RT in HIV-1 patients with severe immune-suppression are described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. Following surgery, AIDS patients may have worse wound healing and a greater tendency to contract infections. In this case, a combined RT/CHT approach was chosen taking in account the neoplasm staging and the presence of severe immune suppression at the diagnosis, not allowing patient to tolerate a surgical treatment. Furthermore, concurrent RT plus cisplatin is the standard organ-preservation protocol in patients with locally advanced laryngeal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. Neck and buffalo hump adipose tissues did not hamper an effective RT response of the laryngeal cancer. Furthermore, the fatty mass volume was not affected by RT, as showed by the CT-scans and described for normal adipose tissue. Even if in previous reports buffalo hump was assimilated to a tissue with a high proliferation activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>, our observations indicate that in this context adipocytes have a metabolic profile similar to those present in other sites.\n\n【16】The peculiarity of the case described lies in the relatively rare occurrence in a HIV-1 infected subject of a laryngeal cancer with long disease-free survival after RT/CHT, the concurrent buffalo hump with metabolic syndrome, and the lack of opportunistic complications despite iatrogenic worsening of immunodeficiency. In the past decade we observed only 4 cases of laryngeal cancer, including the present one, in a cohort of 800 subjects with HIV-1 disease. All were presenting an advanced TNM staging and died within 6 - 12 months from the diagnosis. The not aggressive trend observed in this subject, despite several concomitant pathologies, may be probably related to TNM staging (T3N0Mx) and early diagnosis. Furthermore, presence of a high performance score and lack of severe immunodeficiency before RT/CHT, with a low grade toxicity observed, and the protective role exerted by HAART could all have contributed to the favourable outcome.\n\n【17】Since it has been hypothesized that in HIV-1 infected patients lipodystrophy would be a marker of early metabolic syndrome, a correct management of HIV-1 infected patients need to individualize antiretroviral therapy, choosing drugs with lower metabolic impact, as recommended in current guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>. Furthermore, considering the HAART-related life expectancy increase and the presence of lifestyle-related risk factors, it is important in HIV-1 infected patients to implement an expanded and accurate screening for an early detection and treatment of cancers.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:23:25", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:23:47", "cost": 22.122}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:23:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:23:24"}

Nevertheless, as the use of PEGs in modern practice is gaining popularity due to various indications, more unusual complications have been increasingly reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

The patient was referred to oncology and was started on immunotherapy and palliative chemotherapy.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Investigations\n\n【5】A 62-year-old male patient presented with a past medical history of stage IVA (T2N2M0) SCC of the hypopharynx (right pyriform sinus) that was initially diagnosed in August 2021 status post-primary radiotherapy (a total dose of 60 Gy) and chemotherapy (four cycles of carboplatin-based regimen) in October 2021 with interval downgrading of the hypopharyngeal tumor to stage II (T2N0M0). The treatment course was complicated by a cervicofacial actinomycosis infection that led to an acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from an acute upper airway obstruction that necessitated a tracheostomy placement and PEG placement (using Gauderer Ponsky technique) in March 2022. The patient has a history of a 50-pack-year smoking and alcohol use disorder. The patient presented to the emergency department in May 2022 with black-colored stools for 3 weeks. The patient denied nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, or abdominal pain and stated that he has been tolerating enteral feeding through the PEG without concerns.\n\n【6】An initial evaluation in the emergency department revealed a middle-aged male who was hemodynamically unstable with a blood pressure of 88/44 mm Hg and a pulse rate of 132 beats/min. The patient was pale but not jaundiced. The abdominal examination was remarkable for a dry and clean PEG site and moderate epigastric tenderness without guarding or rigidity. The digital rectal examination revealed a black tarry stool consistent with melena. The rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable.\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n\n【8】Initial laboratory results demonstrated an acute blood loss anemia with an extremely low hemoglobin of 3.3 g/dL (patient’s baseline 9.5 - 10.0 g/dL, reference range 13.0 - 17.0 g/dL), platelets of 576 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /mm <sup>3 </sup> (reference range 150 - 450 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /mm <sup>3 </sup> ), and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.0 (reference range 0.9 - 1.1). The comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) was only remarkable for an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 75 mg/dL (reference range 8.5 - 25 mg/dL).\n\n【9】Treatment\n\n【10】The patient received aggressive fluid resuscitation and intravenous pantoprazole therapy and he was transfused with four units of packed red blood cells. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close hemodynamic monitoring. An urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed a large, ulcerated, non-circumferential mass in the greater curvature of the stomach with stigmata of recent bleeding, and multiple biopsies were obtained . Histopathology with immunohistochemistry confirmed a diagnosis of metastatic SCC that concurred with the patient’s primary hypopharyngeal SCC .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The patient’s hemodynamic status stabilized, and hemoglobin remained stable without further episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding. He was safely discharged home with an oncology follow-up.

Poor nutrition has been linked with adverse outcomes in the HNSCC patients’ population, hence alternative nutritional support means have understandably been employed to improve life expectancy and overall outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Moreover, the global benefits of enteral nutritional support have become well-established as an adjunctive component in the interdisciplinary management of primary HNSCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Enteral feeding by open gastrostomy was first introduced in 1875, but this method has up to 50% risk of major complications associated with the procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. PEG tube feeding was introduced by Gauderer and Ponsky in 1980 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> and has been a useful method of providing an alternative mean of adjunctive nutrition, especially for patients with primary HNSCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】PEG site metastasis from primary HNSCCs is a rare but serious clinical entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>. According to a recent systematic review conducted by Siu et al in 2019 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, a total of 121 cases of PEG site metastasis from various primary upper aerodigestive cancers were documented 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Most cases were of SCC pathology (95%). There were 86 cases available to be analyzed for clinical staging using the AJCC seventh edition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Most cases had SCC as primary cancer (95%). More than two-thirds had stage IV (67.4%) with advanced nodal metastasis (N2/N3) (52%) at the time of PEG metastasis diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, in keeping with our reported patient’s characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】The average time from PEG placement to the diagnosis of metastasis was 7.78 ± 4.96 months, the average tumor size on detection was 4.65 (standard deviation (SD) 2.02) cm, and the average length of survival after detection was 7.26 (SD 6.23) months. About one-third of patients (33.1%) had evidence of other distant metastases at the time of PEG site metastatic diagnosis, in a similar pattern to this reported patient who was also found to have a metastatic liver disease identified at the time of PEG metastasis diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The reviewed literature postulated several hypotheses for the metastasis at the PEG site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 8 \\]</u>. The direct seeding hypothesis postulates procedural inoculation of tumor cells, during the instrument passage through the primary aerodigestive neoplasm, that eventually implant at the PEG site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, cases of metastasis in patients in which a PEG was placed without instrument passage through the oral cavity or pharynx may favor alternate methods of tumor implantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Hematogenic or lymphatic dissemination to the PEG site, which may be more susceptible because of prior surgical trauma and local vascularization conditions, and lastly shedding of tumor cells into the digestive tube that selectively spread into the traumatized tissues of the PEG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\- 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Interestingly, PEG site metastasis may take a relatively long time to develop (an average of 12 months) after the PEG placement; this observation may support the hematogenic dissemination theory, in contrast to the rapid development onset (around 7.9 months) that suggests the direct implantation model of PEG site metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】They are diverse clinical presentations for PEG site metastasis from primary HNSCCs including unexplained abdominal pain, PEG site bleeding, ulceration around the PEG site, stomal drainage, and less commonly massive gastrointestinal bleeding as demonstrated in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 8 \\]</u>. Additionally, the condition may be asymptomatic and getting incidentally detected during the diagnostic workup for other complaints 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】It is important to note that in several cases the diagnosis was delayed as the tumor was missed or underrecognized and treated as an infection or benign granulation tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】PEG site metastasis is generally associated with poor prognosis with a survival rate of 12.9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, although it may be better than other sites of distant metastatic disease in HNSCC in the term of prognosis (1-6.5%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】In contrast to the most commonly used “pull technique” of Gauderer and Ponsky, alternative techniques (push, direct, or radiologically inserted) were not shown to have a significantly reduced incidence of PEG site metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The available literature revealed a lack of any statistical data to support a relationship between the “pull” method and PEG metastasis suggesting that this complication cannot be avoided simply by use of alternate PEG placement methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. It was theorized that regardless of the method used, the surgical placement of PEG tubes creates an environment potentially favorable for tumor implantation as the tumor cells have an increased likelihood of implanting in the incision site due to increased circulation to the inflamed site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Therefore, physicians need to be vigilant of the symptoms of PEG site metastasis to accurately diagnose and manage the care of this rare occurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】The authors described an unusual case of a primary hypopharyngeal SCC that metastasized to the gastric body mucosa through a PEG site implantation. The metastatic SCC presented as massive gastrointestinal bleeding with a large, ulcerated mass in the gastric body on the EGD masquerading as a primary gastric adenocarcinoma.

A new cluster was identified in the East of France at the end of February 2020 after a religious meeting of about 2,000 people. In the following weeks, our hospital had to face a massive influx of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We present a series of six cases of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in whom bone marrow aspirate revealed hemophagocytosis.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】We hereby report a series of six cases of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) in whom bone marrow aspirate revealed hemophagocytosis. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed by a positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. The presence of at least one cytopenia justified bone marrow aspirates.\n\n【4】Clinical and laboratory characteristics of these six patients are summarized in Table 1 . On the day of bone marrow aspirate, four patients had hyperthermia. Clinical examination revealed neither lymphoid tumor syndrome (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy), nor neurological and cardiological symptoms. Every patient presented either anemia or thrombocytopenia and five patients had lymphopenia. All of them had moderate-to-severe inflammatory syndrome.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1.

Two patients had renal replacement therapy. Three patients required transfusion. Concerning outcome, four patients died during hospitalization, and two patients are still hospitalized.\n\n【9】This retrospective study was approved by local ethics committee.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an immune-mediated life-threatening disease, during which a proinflammatory cytokine production and a tissue infiltration by activated lymphocytes and macrophages occur. This syndrome is characterized by fever, organomegaly (lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly) and cytopenia related to platelets, red blood cells and leukocytes phagocytosis. HLH can progress to a sepsis-like syndrome and a terminal multiple organ failure. The diagnosis is based on clinical, laboratory parameters and histological criteria.\n\n【12】HLH is divided into familial (primary) HLH (pHLH), which occurs in children, adolescents and young adults, characterized by inherited defects of cytolytic pathway proteins, and acquired (secondary) HLH (sHLH), particularly in adults and commonly triggered by infection, malignancy and autoimmunity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Viral infections are one of the most frequent trigger factors for HLH. Herpes viruses are the most common triggering agents and among them, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most frequently incriminated virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Other viruses triggering HLH are: hepatitis A, B, C, parvovirus B19, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adenovirus, enterovirus, rubella, measles, respiratory syncytial virus, coxsackie, para-influenza type III, dengue, influenza H1N1 and avian influenza (H5N1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>. A case of HLH has also been reported with SARS-CoV-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, this patient concomitantly presented a significant replication of EBV.\n\n【14】Hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow in itself is neither a sensitive nor a specific criterion of HLH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. When performing a systematic bone marrow aspirate in thrombocytopenic patients during septic shock in the ICU, prevalence of hemophagocytosis can reach up to 60% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Diagnosis of sHLH may be guided by the H-score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In our series, only one patient has a high H-score in favor of sHLH.\n\n【15】COVID-19 patients’ hemophagocytosis does not share typical clinical and biological features of sHLH, probably pleading for a different mechanism of macrophage activation.\n\n【16】HLH is usually referred to a disorder of histiocytic system characterized by macrophage activation and proliferation. The central abnormality appears to be a cytotoxicity deficiency of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). In the presence of a microorganism, normal but ineffective activation of CTL and NK T lymphocyte system appears, resulting in the persistence of both pathogen and macrophagic antigen-presenting cells. The sustained macrophage activation and homing to the sites of T-cell activation result in tissue infiltration and the production of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines: tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin 1 (IL-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). This activation plays a major role in tissue damage and the resulting clinical symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Macrophage activation in HLH is mediated by indirect activation. Concerning SARS-CoV-2 infection, new pathophysiological data hypotheses could point us towards a different activation mechanism which could be, at least in part, direct.\n\n【18】We know that SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to penetrate cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Park reported the results of a preprint by Feng et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. These authors performed pathological analysis of lymph node and splenic tissues. They noted the expression of ACE2 receptors on certain subtypes of macrophages but also the presence of nucleoprotein antigen of SARS-CoV-2 in these cells and showed upregulation of IL-6. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 by binding to ACE2 receptors could modulate expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Macrophages express α7 nAChRs subunits and it has been shown that disruption of α7 nAChRs expression could lead to a release of cytokine, particularly TNF-α 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】During SARS-CoV-2 infection, macrophage activation/modulation appears to play an important role in pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Indeed, this infection induces morphological and inflammation-related phenotypic changes in peripheral blood monocytes. A distinct change in the morphology and function of monocytes/macrophages could be predictive of disease severity.

It is clinically classified into 4 types: (I) classic, mainly occurring in elderly men of Mediterranean or East European origin; (II) African-endemic; (III) iatrogenic, developing in solid organ transplantation recipients; and (IV) acquired-immune-deficiency-syndrome (AIDS)–associated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In addition to the strong association with human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), immunosuppression, such as that resulting from immunosuppressant use in allograft recipients, or arising from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, is a well described risk factor for the development of KS. In a retrospective, population-based study that investigated classic KS as a second primary malignancy in an HIV-negative population, development of KS was significantly greater in patients with lymphohematopoietic malignancies such as lymphoma and leukemia with odds ratios (OR) of 7.5 and 5.3, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Among other solid tumor patients, only breast cancer patients were found to have an increased risk of development of KS (OR = 2.2). Cancer patients with a first primary in the lung, colon, stomach, larynx, liver, pancreas, or kidney showed secondary KS less frequently.\n\n【2】Here, we report the case of a Taiwanese patient who developed HIV-negative classic KS after receiving 5 months of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer. After cessation of chemotherapy, the cutaneous lesions regressed dramatically within 2 weeks of starting thalidomide treatment.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】This 65 year-old man was diagnosed with sigmoid colon cancer, characterized as well-to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, during regular health checkups in July 2011. No history of homosexuality, multiple sexual partners, or drug abuse was identified. An HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus) screening test was negative. He had no past medical history except for a thalassemia trait. After surgery for colon cancer, the tumor was pathologically staged as pT2N1M0, stage IIIA, and adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin was started 3 weeks after the operation. The chemotherapy regimen followed the modified FOLFOX6 protocol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and dexamethasone 10 mg was included prior to each cycle of chemotherapy as a part of the prophylactic antiemetic. The 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy was tolerated very well with only mild chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. During the third month of treatment, grade 1 anemia, increased circulating monocytes (up to 9%), myelocytes (1%) and normoblasts (1 per 100 counted WBCs) were noted briefly for 2 months. A bone marrow exam showed only slightly hypercellular bone marrow with a cellularity of 35%, and there was no abnormal cell infiltration in the marrow. After 4.5 months of chemotherapy, two violaceous indurated plaques up to 2 × 2 cm were noted on the medial dorsal surface of his left foot . Two weeks later, a skin biopsy was taken and pathology revealed these to be Kaposi’s sarcoma. The tumor cells from the sarcoma were immunochemically positive for human herpes virus 8 . Repeated endoscopy to evaluate for visceral mucosal involvement was negative. Other systemic workups showed no evidence of metastasis. Since the lesions were restricted to his left lower leg initially, he was referred for local radiation while the adjuvant chemotherapy was maintained. While waiting for radiotherapy (5.5 months after adjuvant chemotherapy started), his left lower leg became increasingly edematous and a new skin lesion, similar to that previously observed, was found on his right lower leg. Immediately after the 6-month course of adjuvant chemotherapy was complete, thalidomide 100 mg per day was given orally. The main lesions became flattened two weeks after thalidomide treatment and completely disappeared after 2 months of treatment . Thalidomide was used for a total of 3 months and the patient is still in complete remission after 6 months of observation.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The disease progressed aggressively during the 5th and 6th months of adjuvant chemotherapy and regressed rapidly after thalidomide treatment and cessation of chemotherapy.\n\n【9】Before the era of AIDS, it was well known that the incidence of KS development increased following hematopoietic malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. However, the development of KS after solid tumors, other than lymphoma, does not occur as frequently. As discussed earlier, only patients with breast cancer showed a modestly increased risk of developing a secondary malignancy of Kaposi’s sarcoma in a single population-based retrospective study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. For colorectal cancer patients, the risk in the studied population was not significantly increased in comparison with control cases (OR = 0.5, 0.2 - 1.0).\n\n【10】One possible explanation for the heterogeneous association of secondary KS and different solid tumors may lie in the radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment of the primary neoplasm. Given that the potency of immunosuppression is a highly relevant factor for the development of KS in patients receiving renal transplant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, patients receiving more intense or longer chemotherapy protocols may similarly be at a significantly higher risk for secondary KS. Although it is well established that KS is commonly associated with an immunocompromised condition, it is less well described in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n【11】Another independent risk factor for the development of KS is a pre-existing infection with HHV-8, also known as Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV). HHV-8 genes have been found in every type of KS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In patients with a renal transplant, seropositive recipients had a 28 - 75 fold higher rate of KS occurrence than did seronegative recipients, suggesting that reactivation of HHV-8 may play a role in KS development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Global HHV-8 infection rates vary widely, but they are very high in endemic areas, including sub-Saharan Africa (where the seropositive rate is 50-70%) and the Mediterranean region (20-30%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Although the prevalence of HHV-8 in Asians was not reported as being as high as that of endemic areas, it is not uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In Taiwanese blood donors, the seroprevalence was between 7.8% and 19.6 % depending on the detection method used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. In some ethnic groups in China, an increased prevalence with respect to the general population has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The life cycle of HHV-8 has two distinct phases: inactive latency and active, lytic replication. During latency, the virus evades the host immune response and only a few gene products are expressed through cellular DNA polymerase. After stimulation, the virus enters the lytic cycle by a reactivation process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In tumor cells, HHV-8 predominantly persists in a latent form. However, lytic replication is believed to play a critical role in tumorigenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. When cells are infected by HHV-8, one of the viral gene results in the production of viral interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is thought to be an important growth factor for HHV-8-driven neoplasms. The exact mechanism by which HHV-8 promotes tumor formation is an area of active investigation. Clinically, it is common to have viral reactivation when patients have acquired conditions that suppress cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to viral infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In the case described here, it is likely that chemotherapy and the steroid used for antiemetic premedication resulted in immunosuppression, leading to reactivation of HHV-8 and consequently the development of KS. Although detection of HHV-8 infection in the neoplastic cells is unambiguous in this case, serology could not be used due to technical limitations. If serology was available, it might have been a better way to assess if the patient had been previously infected.\n\n【12】Reactivation of HHV-8 in patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy is less well studied clinically than other viruses such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\- 18 \\]</u>. In these studies, risk factors for viral reactivation included cytotoxic chemotherapy, the use of corticosteroids or rituximab, duration of neutropenia, and the viral load 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\- 16 \\]</u>. The type of cancer was also found to influence viral reactivation. Among solid tumors, HBV carriers with lymphoma had the highest risk for HBV reactivation while patients with lung, gastrointestinal or breast cancer were at half or one-third the risk of reactivation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Whether this is also true for HHV-8 reactivation, remains to be investigated. Interestingly, similar disease group patients such as those with lymphoma and breast cancer have also been reported to have a greater risk of developing secondary KS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Viral reactivation most frequent followed cessation of chemotherapy, but it could also occur during chemotherapy, between 4 and 36 weeks from treatment initiation, with a median duration of 16 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. This observation suggests a common period for reactivation of the DNA virus after the start of chemotherapy and provides a rationale for the introduction of anti-viral agents during treatment.\n\n【13】At present, treatment choices for symptomatic HIV-negative KS include excision, radiotherapy, and anthracycline-containing chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Chemotherapy is usually reserved for KS patients with widespread, bulky, or rapidly progressive disease. In the case reported here, radiotherapy was chosen in the beginning due to multi-centric skin lesions on the patient’s left foot and ankle. While the patient was waiting for radiotherapy, the edematous symptoms progressed and a new cutaneous lesion was noted on right lower leg, which indicated the necessity of systemic treatment. Thalidomide, as an anti-angiogenesis agent and immune modulator, has been reported to be of therapeutic benefit in patients with HIV-negative classic KS in small retrospective studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 \\]</u>. The rapid remission of skin lesions, within 2 months, in response to thalidomide treatment suggests that the restoration of immunity after cessation of chemotherapy could also play an important role.\n\n【14】Conclusions\n\n【15】In conclusion, our case illustrates that immunosuppressive status during adjuvant chemotherapy can predispose colon cancer patients to HHV-8 associated secondary malignancy KS. Cessation of chemotherapy together with administration of the immunomodulator thalidomide could help control the disease when radiotherapy is unavailable for technical reasons. HHV-8 seropositivity is not uncommon in certain Asian ethnic groups and the population receiving chemotherapy is increasing in line with cancer incidence. As a result, the reactivation of HHV-8 and its related diseases may become more frequent. Further studies are needed to determine the best strategies for monitoring HHV-8 activity and for determining the treatment choice between cytotoxic chemotherapy and experimental drugs.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This work was partly supported by Taipei Medical University /Wan Fang Hospital grants 100TMU-WFH-09.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors declare no conflict of interest or financial relationship with a biotechnology manufacturer, a pharmaceutical company, or other commercial entity that has an interest in the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:36:59", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:37:22", "cost": 22.959}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:37:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:36:58"}

Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, hereditary papillary renal carcinoma, familial renal oncocytoma associated with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, and hereditary renal carcinoma are often associated with renal cell carcinoma.

More recently it has been suggested that cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may play a significant role by demonstrating specific findings in favor of myxoma. Regarding the literature, this is the first case which describes the concomitant left renal cell carcinoma and incidentally discovered left atrial myxoma.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 51 years old woman (body weight 61 kg, height 169 cm, ASA I), without significant previous medical history, was consulted by an urologist because of left flank moderate pain. She underwent an ultrasound examination, during which a left kidney tumor was verified. She also underwent angio-computed tomography (CT)  scan and MRI examination in order to make tumor stratification and verify possible conflicts with the great vessels as well. These examinations incidentally discovered a formation in left atrium. The patient was consulted by a cardiologist and a cardio surgeon, and then underwent echocardiography  and coronarography examination. The diagnosis of left atrial myxoma was made (no vascularization by coronary arteries). Clinical assessment, chest x-ray and laboratory findings were normal. The patient was premedicated with oral Diazepam 10 mg the night before the surgery, and morphine sulfate 10 mg intramuscularly 30 minutes before the induction of anesthesia. In operating room, after peripheral venous cannula was inserted, right radial artery and right internal jugular vein were cannulated with a 20 G arterial cannula and 7.5 F central venous catheter. A fast track anesthesia was made (fentanyl 5 mg/kg, propofol 2 mg/kg, cisatracurium 0.15 mg/kg). Monitoring included invasive arterial monitoring, central venous pressure, ECG, temperature, urine output, and end-Tidal carbon dioxide. The anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, propofol infusion, fentanyl and cisatracurium as needed. An open heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass was performed. Perioperative period was uneventful, dealing with renal protection with good mean arterial pressure (MAP), volume maintenance, furosemide and fenoldopam. An open radical left nephrectomy was performed 3 weeks later. The surgery and postoperative period were uneventful and the patient was discharged in 4th postoperative day.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Echocardiography examination confirmed left atrial myxoma. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】The first issue was to diagnose the formation situated at the left atrium. It should be identified if it was a tromb, myxoma or a metastase caused by the renal tumor.\n\n【10】In patients with diagnosis of myxoma, a surgical intervention is strongly recommended. In patients with cardiac thrombus a period of anticoagulation therapy may be warranted, whereas in case of metastasis probably the surgery would not be the best choice.\n\n【11】Renal cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 3% of adult malignancies and 90-95% of neoplasms arising from the kidney. Several hereditary syndromes are associated with renal cell carcinoma such as: von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, hereditary papillary renal carcinoma, familial renal oncocytoma associated with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, and hereditary renal carcinoma. Approximately 30% of patients with renal carcinoma present with metastatic disease including: lung (75%), soft tissues (36%), bone (20%), liver (18%), cutaneous sites (8%), and central nervous system (8%). In approximately 5-10% of patients, the tumor extends in the renal vein, inferior vena cava and right atrium as a thrombus. The classic signs as hematuria, flank pain, and palpable mass are presented in 10% of the patients. Mostly this tumor is incidentally diagnosed by a routine abdominal ultrasound examination. Once the diagnosis is made, several examinations are perhaps required like computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MRI), and/or renal angiography (RA). Our patient underwent all the examinations mentioned above for renal cell carcinoma diagnosing, which incidentally discovered left atrial myxoma in MRI. Then our patients made echocardiography and coronary angiography (CA) despite it’s low sensitivity and specificity. Echocardiography is usually the first imaging modality which leads to the diagnosis of a cardiac mass. It provides information about its size, localization and mobility. However, echocardiographic findings are not specific and discrimination between primary cardiac tumors, such as myxoma, and other cardiac masses remains challenging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The most common differential diagnosis of cardiac myxoma is atrial thrombi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 6 \\]</u>. Clinical symptoms may be similar particularly with respect to intracardiac obstruction and peripheral embolization. CA may be a useful tool in further differentiating between cardiac tumor and thrombi. Cardiac tumors such as myxomas are considered highly vascularized. Furedi et al reported signs of neovascularization in five out of nine (56%) cardiac myxoma patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These findings of neovascularization were in favor of tumoral nature of cardiac mass allowing differentiation from atrial thrombi. Therefore, the value of CA in differentiating cardiac masses between tumors such as myxoma and thrombi remains limited. Despite the lack of sensitivity and specificity, some authors have, however, suggested that CA should be performed systematically in patients with cardiac myxoma to detect a large supplying vessel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Our patient had no neovascularization by coronary arteries. We believe that CA is of limited interest in determining the etiology of an intracardiac mass. MRI provides specific information about tissue characteristics that facilitate the differentiation between myxoma and thrombi. These findings are characteristic of myxomas and differentiate them from other tumors which show different signal intensity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In addition, myxomas typically show a heterogeneous appearance in MRI, due to areas of necrosis, hemorrhage or calcification. These findings were consistent in our patient. Cardiac CT is increasingly used for noninvasive CA and may be an alternative modality for the assessment of cardiac masses.\n\n【12】The second issue was setting of the priorities, so if we had to first left radical nephrectomy or myxoma, or both in the same time.\n\n【13】We thought that both intervents could not be done in the same time because of the risk for renal failure and bleeding by anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass. Surgery should, therefore, be performed promptly after the diagnosis is made to avoid potential complications such as peripheral embolization or cardiac valvular obstruction. So it was decided to begine with myxoma intervent, to proceed in a second phase with left kidney removal. So our patient first underwent to cardiac surgery to remove the myxoma. We didn’t find any author who supported the idea that cardiopulmonary bypass would be contraindicated in malignancy because of tumor spreading risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\- 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The third issue was renal protection and prevention of the possible renal failure.\n\n【15】The preservation of renal function was very important to our patient, because of later surgery which consisted in radical left kidney removal. Cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass are well known as events related to perioperative renal failure. All organs are potential sites of dysfunction during cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass. Renal complication may be evident almost immediately 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Nevertheless the incidence of renal failure ranges between 2-35% depending more on preoperative renal function, type of surgery, diabetes, age older than 70 years, and hemodynamic status. The incidence increases dramatically if there is preoperative renal dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\- 16 \\]</u>. Several mechanisms explain the possible perioperative renal dysfunction. These include hypotension, nonpulsatile flow which promotes vasoconstriction and decreases renal blood flow, glomerular filtration, and urine output. Intravascular hemolysis can cause acute tubular necrosis too. So the cardiopulmonary bypass period was short, we took care about blood pressure, volume status, good diuresis using furosemide, and of course avoiding renal hypoperfusion and vasoconstriction using fenoldopam.\n\n【16】As a conclusion we conclude that the role of diagnostic evaluation and the determination of surgical priorities are the main factors in achieving the successful outcome in the treatment of above mentioned concomitant pathologies.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflicts of interests.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:04:54", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:05:26", "cost": 32.228}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:05:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:04:53"}

Antibodies for Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Varicella zoster virus, Herpes simplex virus, Enteroviruses, Coxsackie B1-B6, Coxiella burnetti, Legionella pneumophila, Borrelia burgdorferi, Brucella and Chlamydia antibodies were negative. However, IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies for M. pneumoniae were detected at a concentration of 951 U/mL, 67 U/mL and 49 U/mL respectively. Detection of M. pneumoniae DNA in CSF and blood serum samples using a nested polymerase chain reaction method was negative whereas it was positive in the sputum. Mycoplasma \\-related acute transverse myelitis was provisionally diagnosed and the patient was moved to an intermediate intensive care unit for better monitoring and supportive care. Azithromycin 500 mg × 2 given intravenously and doxycycline 100 mg × 2 was started. The patient’s neurological status improved progressively and was discharged after a total hospital stay of 18 days. Three years after the initial episode the patient remains asymptomatic.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Acute transverse myelitis is characterized by focal inflammation of the spinal cord with resultant neural involvement. It is a rare disorder with an estimated incidence of 1 - 8 cases per million of population per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> and may be caused by a variety of mechanisms. M. pneumoniae infection as a cause of acute transverse myelitis is a rare clinical entity, known from a limited number of discrepant cases until now, mainly reported in pediatric patients, since children are most likely affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Typically, the onset of M. pneumoniae \\-associated myelitis occurs during or after the course of the respiratory infection, usually within three weeks after the onset of respiratory illness. Largely consistent with this progress, the onset of acute transverse myelitis in our patient occurred on the seventeenth day after initiation of the respiratory illness symptoms, while he was recovering from pneumonia. However, there are reports of M. pneumoniae \\-associated acute transverse myelitis with no evidence of respiratory disease indicating the difficulty to suspect the infective cause of this neurological condition in such cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】The diagnosis of acute transverse myelitis in our patient was based on the clinical picture, CSF findings and spinal neuroimaging results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The laboratory diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection was made by determination of specific antibodies in serum samples combined with detection of M. pneumoniae in a sputum specimen by nested PCR, as recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Therefore, the patient fulfils criteria for a “probable” case of M. pneumoniae \\-related acute transverse myelitis according to the classification proposed by Tsiodras et al in a recent literature review 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Notably, only 2 out of the 35 reported cases with M. pneumoniae \\-associated acute transverse myelitis applied to this category whereas the remaining cases were classified as either “possible” or “suspected” or “indeterminate” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Detection of M. pneumoniae by PCR or culture in CSF failed in the present case which is in accordance with other reports. Isolation of M. pneumoniae by culture in a CSF sample has never been reported in M. pneumoniae \\-associated myelitis in contrast to encephalitis cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Also, in only 2 cases PCR testing for M. pneumoniae in CSF was positive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 12 \\]</u>. Early antimicrobial treatment, low sensitivity of the culture and poor specific serological response of the patients may be responsible for this.\n\n【15】The evidence of a causal association of transverse myelitis and M. pneumoniae respiratory infection is based mainly on the reported cases and on retrospective studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 13 \\]</u>. The pathogenetic mechanisms are not completely understood. Although direct invasion and the related host immune response are thought to be responsible for the pulmonary disease, the pathophysiological basis for the CNS manifestations is not elucidated. The theory of a direct invasion is not fully supported since isolation of M. pneumoniae by culture in a CSF sample has never been reported in M. pneumoniae \\-associated myelitis; however, it cannot be ruled out since positive PCR testing for M. pneumoniae has been detected in CSF specimens on some occasions as mentioned above 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 12 \\]</u>. It had been postulated that an immune-mediated process or an autoimmune reaction possibly play part in pathogenesis. Neuropathological observation of demyelination and perineural inflammation in cases with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, give support to the latter suggestion. Importantly, among 49 children with M. pneumoniae infection, in two patients with acute cerebellar dysfunction, antibodies to mitotic spindle apparatus have been found indicating their role in the pathogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Macrolide or tetracycline classes are considered effective for treating M. pneumoniae infections. However, data on their concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are limited. Clarithromycin levels have been shown above the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for M. pneumoniae in CSF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>; doxycycline also seems to reach therapeutic concentrations in CSF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Notably, our patient was already under macrolide antimicrobial therapy at the onset of neurological symptoms. The administration of intravenous azithromycin and the addition of doxycycline might have contributed to his treatment since it allows sufficient concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid. However, the role of antibiotics remains questionable. Due to the possible immunological etiology of M. pneumoniae associated acute transverse myelitis, antibiotic treatment probably has no role. Therefore, in addition to antimicrobial therapy, immunomodulating therapies such as corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin have been used with good results. However, there is insufficient evidence to show conclusively that they are effective. Some patients also had recovered without receiving such a treatment. Similarly, our patient had a successful recovery although he received only antimicrobial treatment.\n\n【17】Outcome was generally favorable in the reported cases of M. pneumoniae- associated acute transverse myelitis with the exception of two cases appearing in childhood and adolescence respectively and leading to persistent paraplegia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】In summary, the current case demonstrates the sudden development of the rare entity of acute transverse myelitis in a patient with lower respiratory tract infection and extents the list of similar cases documented by both positive M. pneumoniae serology and by PCR from sputum. Given the high prevalence of M. pneumoniae respiratory infections, physicians evaluating patients with acute transverse myelitis neurologic symptoms, should have a high index of suspicion for M. pneumoniae- associated nervous system disease in order to optimize the management of such conditions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:51:21", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:51:31", "cost": 9.807}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:51:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:51:12"}

It is amongst the most pathogenic species of Clostridium species, alongside with Clostridium botulinum , Clostridium tetani and Clostridium difficile .\n\n【2】C. perfringens can be found in samples of water, soil, and it is present in gastro-intestinal tract of healthy animals as well as in humans. It has also the ability to cause disease in humans and animals, with a rapid growth of bacterial inoculum with spore and toxins formation. There are five biotypes of C. perfringens , based on the type of toxin that is produced, type A, B, C, D and E 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The main toxin is the α-toxin, an enzyme that splits lecithin into phosphocholine and diglyceride, causing damage to red blood cell membrane, accounting for development of spherocytosis and subsequent intravascular haemolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The clinical presentation of C. perfringens infection includes a variety of manifestations, such as gas gangrene, emphysematous cholecystitis, crepitant cellulitis, fasciitis and myositis. It is frequently associated with septic shock and intravascular haemolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\- 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】The diagnosis of intravascular haemolysis by C. perfringens should be suspected in the presence of acute anaemia with a raised mean cell haemoglobin concentration and a reduced mean cell volume, spherocytosis, negative indirect and direct Coombs test, haemoglobinemia and haemoglobinuria. It is also associated with Gram-positive rods on Gram stain of a peripheral blood smear and positive blood or tissue culture. A plain radiograph of the abdomen may reveal the presence of abscess or gas in tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】We report a case of a man that die with a C. perfringens sepsis with massive intravascular haemolysis, 22 hrs after the onset of symptoms.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 66-year-old male was admitted in the Emergency Room of our hospital with a 12 hrs history of fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and dark red urine. He had a past medical history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia and nephrolithiasis. He reportedly did not have travelled abroad namely to malaria endemic areas.\n\n【7】At admission, his core temperature was 38 °C, pulse rate was 106/minute, blood pressure was 157/67 mmHg. Physical examination was normal with the exception of moderate pain on palpation of the epigastric and right flank zone but without signs of peritoneal irritation.\n\n【8】In the initial hemogram , haemoglobin concentration and platelet count were within the normal range with an elevation of white blood cell count. Biochemical screening showed elevation of total bilirrubin, direct bilirrubin, lactate dehydrogenase, serum aspartate transaminase, serum alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyltransferase. Urine analysis showed the presence of hemoglobinuria without haematuria.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Laboratory Data |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【10】A peripheral blood smear revealed spherocytosis and absence of schizocytes. The direct and indirect Coombs tests were negative. Plasmodium was not detected in microscopic examination of blood. Electrocardiogram and chest X-rays were normal. Abdominal ultrasound was performed and showed no relevant findings.\n\n【11】A few hours later the patient remained febrile (38 °C), tachycardic and became dyspneic. Arterial blood gases revealed severe metabolic (lactic) acidosis with pH 7.33; HCO <sub>3 </sub> 12.2 mmol/L; PaCO <sub>2 </sub> 16.4 mmHg; PaO <sub>2 </sub> 51 mmHg; SaO <sub>2 </sub> 90.8%, lactate 10.4 mmol/L. Antibiotic therapy was started with piperacilin/tazobactam 4.5 g ev qid.\n\n【12】He was promptly admitted to our ICU with the diagnosis of massive intravascular haemolysis. His condition deteriorated very rapidly, with the development of multiple organ failure.\n\n【13】He was intubated and invasive mechanical ventilation was started. Large doses of vasopressor agents were given and renal replacement therapy was immediately started, without any significant clinical improvement. The second chest x-ray showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and severe hypoxemia (PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> ratio - 43.9 mmHg), compatible with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Laboratory data in the subsequent hours following ICU admission revealed very low levels of haemoglobin concentration and platelet count, low haptoglobin and a marked increase in creatinine and transaminases .\n\n【14】Coagulation tests were compatible with disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n【15】Despite intensive therapy and supportive care, the patient died 22 hrs after the onset of symptoms and 10 hrs after hospital admission. The performance of an exchange transfusion was considered but the rapid and severe courses of the disease preclude its implementation.\n\n【16】The definitive diagnosis of C. perfringens sepsis was made after its identification in blood cultures for anaerobes, performed before death. The blood cultures for aerobes were sterile. Autopsy was not performed because of the advanced decomposition of the body, that took place in less then 24 hrs after death, which also pointed to the presence of gas-producing bacteria .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Among the infectious causes one should consider malaria, but also clostridial bacteraemia and other rare conditions, such as bartonellosis and babesiosis as possible aetiologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, with the exception of clostridium bacteraemia, these infectious diseases are usually straightforward to diagnose and can normally be easily excluded because of their particular epidemiology. Non-infectious causes of intravascular haemolysis include haemolytic transfusion reactions, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or haemolysis caused by snake venoms.\n\n【23】In our patient, the possibility of HUS was raised, since this can be associated with acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia and haemolysis. However, our patient blood smear showed spherocytes, not schizocytes typically present in this syndrome. Moreover there was no other evidence of microangiopatic haemolytic anaemia that is also characteristically present in HUS.\n\n【24】The diagnosis of C. perfringens sepsis is difficult without its identification in blood cultures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. If clostridium bacteraemia is suspected, antibiotics should be started immediately, including high-dose penicillin (up to 30 million units per day) or tetracycline (if β-lactam allergy is suspected). In the presence of gas gangrene, clindamycin is also recommended. Chloramphenicol, doxycycline, imipenem and metronidazole are also alternative agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. If there is a perceived infection focus, large and rapid surgical debridement is part of the initial approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Finally two additional therapeutic options must be considered: exchange transfusion and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Exchange transfusion could be beneficial at an early stage of intravascular haemolysis by removing toxin-damaged red cells, free haemoglobin and fibrin split products 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 9 \\]</u>. The beneficial effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been reported in several case series since an oxygen-rich environment promotes the death of C. perfringens and blocks the production of toxins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Van Bunderen et al. reviewed 40 cases of C. perfringens septicaemia with massive intravascular haemolysis published in the literature since 1990 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. They found that 37.5% of patients had no underlying condition related to this infectious disease. The most common associated diseases were haematological disorders (22.5%), pancreatic or gastric cancer (12.5%). Diabetes was present in 30% of the patients, being the only risk factor in 15%. The focus of infection was mostly hepatobiliary (45.0%), being intestinal in 17.5%. A gynaecological origin, after an invasive procedure, was found in 10% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The mortality rate was very high, ranging between 70 - 100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 7 \\]</u>. In the large majority of cases the definite diagnosis was confirmed only after death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, as it was our case.\n\n【27】The present case is particular and rare since it was complicated with massive intravascular haemolysis, with an extremely rapid clinical course, without identification of an obvious infectious focus, in a patient with only one predisposing factor (diabetes).\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】Despite all the medical treatments and organ support, our patient presented a very severe septic shock and had a fatal outcome.\n\n【30】The severity of C. perfringens infections, associated with a high mortality rate, reinforce the importance of rapid clinical diagnosis and, above all, immediate antibiotic therapy and focus control, when appropriate.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding for this research.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:45:11", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:46:18", "cost": 67.592}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:46:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:45:10"}

On rectal examination, it was identified an ulcerated rectal mass, on the anterior wall of the rectum. A colonoscopy was performed, which showed an ulcerated, hard and friable tumor located on the anterior surface of the distal rectum . The biopsy revealed a high-grade GIST. The patient was subjected to a computed tomography (CT) scan that showed a tumorous formation in the rectum, with no densification of the fat of the ischiorectal space or pelvic lymphadenopathy . The pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan results showed a 5.1 × 3.1 cm mass in the rectovaginal space with origin in the anterior wall of the rectum, 2.9 cm from the anal verge with presumably non-epithelial origin and no apparent local invasion .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The proliferative index (assessed with Ki67) was around 60-70%.\n\n【11】On multidisciplinary consultation, the patient was proposed to adjunctive therapy with imatinib.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】GIST represents 80% of mesenchymal tumors. They are relatively rare, constituting 1-3% of all malignant gastrointestinal tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The organs most often affected are the stomach (60%), jejunum and ileum (30%). The other locations are duodenum (5%), colon and rectum (5%) and esophagus and appendix (< 1%). Rarely, they can be found in extra-luminous locations such as mesentery, omentum and retroperitoneum (< 5%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Rectal GISTs are more predominant in males and are more frequent between the fifth and seventh decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】This type of tumor originates in interstitial cells of Cajal, located in the myenteric plexus of the gastrointestinal wall, which act as gastrointestinal motility regulators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Approximately 10-30% are clinically malignant; however, all of them have some potential degree of malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】GISTs are associated with two mutations: the mutation of the c-kit proto-oncogene (responsible for the expression of the CD117 protein, a receptor for the tyrosine kinase growth factor) and the mutation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFRA ) gene. These mutations are present in 80-85% of patients (75-80% c-kit and 10-15% PDGFRA ). The GISTs that do not have these mutations are classified as “wild type”, this one with better prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Most patients are asymptomatic. In rectum, although rare, obstruction or hemorrhage may be present.\n\n【17】The diagnosis follows the principles of diagnosis of any rectal mass, using imaging exams (endoscopy, CT scan and pelvic MRI scan) and biopsy.\n\n【18】Usually, the GIST is endoscopically characterized as a bulging of the wall, with normal mucosa or eventual mucosal ulceration, with solid consistency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The diagnosis includes CT scan with intravenous contrast, in order to identify distant metastatic disease. Locally they present as a well-circumscribed region of contrast, with heterogeneous enhancement, particularly if it is a large GIST with necro-hemorrhagic areas or degenerative components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Pelvic MRI scan allows locoregional staging. The lesions are usually described as well-defined solid masses, and some of them may have central necrosis, presenting with a diffuse hyposignal at T1 and hypersignal at T2. Post-contrast gain is homogeneous in the solid region, forming a ring around central necrosis.\n\n【21】Signs of malignancy include ulceration, irregular margins and increased dimensions on follow-up exams 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Biopsy is particularly important in the characterization of the tumor, namely in the differential diagnosis with rectal adenocarcinoma (in the case of ulcerated GIST), whose management are different. The final diagnosis is established according to the specific histological and immunohistochemical characteristics (CD117, CD34, actin, desmin, S-100 and Ki67). Sometimes, the biopsy is not conclusive since it is a neoplasm originated in the deeper layers of the rectum, which, if not biopsied, there is no representative sample.\n\n【23】The standard treatment of non-metastatic GIST involves complete resection of the tumor, with free margins, without rupture of the capsule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. In the case of rectal GIST, the purpose of surgery, in addition to local tumor resection, is when possible, the sphincters preservation. The spread does not usually involve regional ganglion metastases, so regional lymphadenectomy is unnecessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】There are several surgical techniques described, from conventional transanal resection (Parks), trans-sacral approach (Kraske), transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS), laparoscopic and laparotomic surgery (anterior resection of the rectum, abdominal-perineal amputation) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\- 17 \\]</u>. The method of choice is decided according to the characteristics of the tumor (size, extent, location) and according to the surgeon’s preferences.\n\n【25】The resection of tumors of the anterior wall of the rectum is technically more difficult. The transvaginal approach is a possible method for local tumor excision when located in the rectovaginal region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>. It is an alternative to a low or ultralow anterior resection surgery, which has a higher risk of complications. Transvaginal resection is a valid approach due to the large volume of the vagina, which is enough to support the resection.\n\n【26】In our case, enucleation without fragmentation of the piece was not possible. However, the entire lesion was macroscopically resected, and that constitutes one of the most important factors for the prognosis.\n\n【27】In large tumors and in those that have a high risk of metastases, preoperative treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib is recommended to decrease tumor volume, improve intact resection with negative margins, sphincter preservation and increase disease-free survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 13 \\]</u>. Several studies have shown that neoadjuvant treatment with imatinib improved R0 resection rates and decreased the risk of postoperative morbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. However, in the case of our patient, the tumor was symptomatic, requiring a primary surgical approach.\n\n【28】The worst prognostic factors for GIST are tumor size, mitotic activity (> 5 mitoses/50 high-power fields (a total area of 5 mm <sup>2 </sup> ), non-gastric location, male gender and pseudo-capsule rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Adjuvant therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor is strongly recommended in high-risk patients to reduce the risk of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】The biology of our patient’s tumor, with a high risk of biological behavior (18 mitosis/5 mm <sup>2 </sup> and a proliferative index around 60-70% (Ki-67)), demanded adjuvant therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Recurrence can develop 10 - 15 years after primary treatment, so clinical follow-up must be done over the long term 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Conclusions\n\n【33】Rectal GISTs are uncommon and the treatment involves local excision of the lesion, without regional lymphadenectomy. Transvaginal resection is an acceptable procedure in tumors located in the rectovaginal region, with protrusion in the posterior wall of the vagina.

However, complications of the procedure minor or major are referred and present in a rate varying from 0.4% to 22.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Buried bumper syndrome (BBS), the migration of the internal fixation device (bumper) out of the stomach, to the gastric wall and even to the abdominal wall, is a major and usually late complication of PEG leading in most of cases to severe intra-abdominal or abdominal wall infection. Its incidence ranges between 0.3% and 2.4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, but, according to others, it can occur in 0.9% to over 8% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> of adult patients with PEG.

The patient suffered from final stage of Alzheimer’s disease and a PEG was placed 6 months before the admission.\n\n【6】The terminal stage of dementia made the patient unable to communicate, and her relatives did not report any change of behavior or other symptoms on her behalf. On clinical examination, crepitus was found in the major part of anterior abdominal wall which was reddish . Complete laboratory values showed 9,000,000/μL white blood cells with 84% neutrophils, hemoglobin 8 g/dL, hematocrite 25.2%, urea 80 mg/dL, creatinine 1.58 mg/dL, K <sup>+ </sup> 4 mmol/L, Na <sup>+ </sup> 126 mmol/L and Ca <sup>2+ </sup> 7.90 mmol/dL.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Intra-operatively, the abdominal wall was opened and explored extensively; PEG was retracted as the internal bumper rested subcutaneously and the necrotic regions were removed . Tissues from the wound, as well as the PEG tip, were selected for cultures and sensitivity test and the patient was immediately administered wide-range antibiotics. Although she was, hemodynamically, full supported, the patient died the next day, due to septic shock. The culture revealed the presence of E. coli , sensitive at amoxicillin, clavulanic and imipenem.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3. Extensive exploration of the abdominal wall, PEG extraction, debridement and collection of tissues for culture. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】PEG was realized for the first time by Gauderer et al in 1980 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, for long-term enteral feeding without the need of an open surgery. Since then, PEG has been widely used for feeding patients with poor oral intake, such as in cases of neurologic or mechanical dysphagia and in the critically ill. It provides a more natural nutrition than parenteral feeding and is thought to be a safe procedure, even for the elder patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The overall complication rate after PEG placement ranges between 2% and 23.8% of cases, according to Biswas et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These complications can be minor, as wound infection, or major, as necrotizing fasciitis or peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. They can also be classified in mechanical (tube obstruction, malposition, secondary displacement or removal, leakage, skin erosion, intestinal obstruction or perforation, bleeding), infectious (infection of the insertion site, aspiration, peritonitis) and metabolic complications (electrolyte and glucose disturbances) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】BBS was first reported as a complication in 1988 by Levant et al and it is considered as a late and major complication, presenting with leakage, peristomal pain and infection and difficulty of feeding through the tube 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. It consists of migration of the internal bumper in the gastric wall (incomplete type) or anywhere outside the gastric lumen (complete type). It, usually, occurs after a 4-month period from PEG placement, as in our case, but cases of acute BBS presentation have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Many risk factors have been proposed, but, actually, obesity and increased tension of the tube are certain reasons that lead to this condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】BBS may present with bleeding, perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, peritonitis, abscess and phlegmon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, but also, rarely, as necrotizing fasciitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, rectus abdominis necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, or with co-existence of encephalopathy and high anion gap metabolic acidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>; these complications could be potentially lethal. Microbes isolated from the tube or the wound are rarely described in the literature, but they can include Klebsiella pneumonia and Candida vulgaris 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】When BBS does occur, the removal of the tube is necessary for the prevention of secondary complications. Although endoscopic or surgical retrieval, open or laparoscopic, can be performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>, new methods have also been described, such as NOTES 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. However, efforts to re-introduction of the bumper in the stomach, through endoscopy, have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Furthermore, necrotic fasciitis, which consists of a usually lethal condition, has been reported to be treated with early and aggressive surgical debridement, antibiotic administration and supportive therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】In patients suffering from dementia or brain injury, who are not able to communicate and report their symptoms to their family members or caregivers, the initial clinical condition could be misleading 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u> and, therefore, they may not be examined and treated in time. Our patient could not reveal any signs of pain or discomfort in the inflammatory area, so her condition misinterpreted to local skin irritation, before the presence of high fever, which increased the family’s concerns. However, as in our case, a suspected and earlier diagnosis could have prevented any further intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration of feeding via the PEG, as well as earlier treatment of necrotic fasciitis.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】BBS is a rare complication of the PEG placement. Safe positioning of the external bolster is important for the prevention of this complication. However, in cases of internal bumper migration, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for the prevention of further complications; if not treated on time, the results could be severe and even lethal. Cooperation between doctors, nurses, family, or care-givers can lead to prevention and a better confrontation of the condition.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding this paper.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:04:32", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:05:09", "cost": 36.77}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:05:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:04:31"}

However, adult invagination is relatively rare and constitutes 5% of all intussusception cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Intussusception presents as classic clinical triad: palpable mass, abdominal pain and bloody mucoid stools. Although most of childhood intussusceptions are idiopathic, 90% of adult cases are secondary to benign or malign lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Adult intussusception presents with nonspecific abdominal symptoms. It is important to diagnose and to differentiate from other inflammatory or mechanical obstructive disorders earlier.\n\n【2】Entamoeba histolytica ( E. hisyolytica ) infection becomes manifest as asymptomatic colonization, diarrhea, acute dysentery, fulminant colitis with perforation, toxic megacolon and ameboma formation in intestine. Intestinal amebiasis confused with many other benign or malignant diseases. We report here a patient with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea which amebiasis masqueraded colonic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma presenting with ileocolonic invagination.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 22-year-old male presented with 6-week history of right lower side abdominal pain which had worsened over time and intermittent diarrhea. Patient had empirically been treated with PO ciprofloxacin. Recently, loss of appetite and recurrent vomiting were also added to his complaints and diarrhea had become bloody and mucoid. He denied any history of fever, noticeable weight loss or night sweats. His medical history had not any distinctive feature. On examination, the abdomen was soft, tender to palpation over the right lower quadrant with no rebound or guarding. There was no obvious mass lesion. Laboratory data revealed normal hemoglobin (14 g/dL), white cell count (9,810,000/µL) and platelet count (351,000,000/µL). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 10 mm/h and C-reactive protein was 0.54 mg/dL. Urea, electrolytes, amylase and liver function tests were also normal, but lactate dehydrogenase was slightly raised (274 U/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(125 - 220)</u>). Fecal leukocyte and erythrocyte was detected in stool examination. Stool antigen for E. histolytica was also positive. Intravenous fluids and metronidazole were started immediately and bloody diarrhea disappeared after treatment. However, colicky abdominal pain persisted and abdominal computed tomography with oral and intravenous contrast was performed. A 13-cm lesion with invaginated intestinal loops at the pelvic midline was detected . There were also multiple lymphadenopathies adjacent to the mass lesion. Colonoscopic examination was consistent with an obstructive, ulcerated and necrotic mass lesion at the neighborhood of cecum . Biopsies obtained during the colonoscopy were consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . The patient underwent right hemicolectomy with primary anastamosis, and then, was treated with systemic chemotherapy.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Adult intussusception cause 1-5% of all adult intestinal obstructions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Most of adult intussusception cases (approximately 90%) are secondary to other benign or malignant disorders with a lead point lesion. The etiologic factor might be a benign lesion like, fibroid polyp, lipoma, Meckel’s diverticulum, Crohn’s disease and Yersinia enterocolitis or a malignant tumor such as a primary carcinoma, metastatic carcinoma such as melanoma, GISTs, lymphoma, or carcinoid tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 , 6 \\]</u>. In contrast to pediatric intussusception cases most of which are primary and benign, most of adult patients have structural lesions, especially malignancy in colonic cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Patients present with nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, change in bowel habits, constipation or abdominal distension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Although majority of adult cases have a chronic intermittent course, some patients present with acute or subacute symptoms. Classical clinical triad can be detected in about 10-20% of adult cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 \\]</u>. On the other hand, although CT can detect a lead point easily on CT examination, determination of intussusception cause is not always possible with CT imaging, except lipoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Vague presentation of intussusception in adulthood causes delaying of the diagnosis.\n\n【10】Primary colonic lymphomas account for only 0.2-0.6% of colon cancers and 10-20% of all gastrointestinal lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Colonic lymphomas are found more frequently in males in their sixth and seventh decade of life. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma are the most common histological subtypes. The most frequently involved colonic site at diagnosis is cecum followed by the sigmoid and the rectum. Clinical presentation of colonic lymphoma is quite vague and variable. Intussusception is very rarely seen in intestinal lymphoma. The most common type of lymphoma causing intussusception is diffuse B-cell lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】In our patient, diffuse B-cell lymphoma causing ileocolonic intussusception is the case. The patient attended to our clinic with nonspecific abdominal pain and intermittent bloody diarrhea. There was no fever, night sweat or weight loss and laboratory finding was not remarkable except LDH. Moreover, amebiasis complicated the case and led to delay in diagnosis. The lymphoma was not obviously demonstrated on CT imaging. The patient was diagnosed accurately with colonoscopic examination and pathological findings after the treatment of E. histolytica infection with metronidazole.\n\n【12】Ileocolonic or colocolonic intussusception is extremely rare presentation of intestinal amebiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Some infections cause intestinal intussusception. It is suggested that infection-related mesenteric lymph node involvement or mass formation may constitute lead point for intussusception development. On the other hand, intestinal amebiasis may present with bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain or intestinal mass lesion (ameboma). In the presence of stool E. histolytica antigen positivity, bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain symptoms are suggestive for invasive amebic colitis. Persistence of abdominal pain after resolving of bloody diarrhea gave an impression about other presumptive diagnosis.\n\n【13】Consequently, intussusception has a course with indistinct symptoms. It is mandatory to define the cause, especially in adult patients. Intestinal amebiasis may cause similar symptoms with intussusception. However, clinical course of intestinal amebiasis resembles intussusception symptoms and this tropical infection may masquerade colonic lymphoma.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:42:25", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:42:44", "cost": 18.945}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:42:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:42:16"}

This is rare and much of the literature pertains to case reports and small case series. Its wide range of predisposing factors and mild chronic obstructive features make the diagnosis a high index of suspicion. It was first described in 1842 by Rokitansky and the first case series of 75 patients was published by Wilkie in 1927.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 46-year-old female presented to emergency department with 2 days history of abdominal pain and vomiting. Initially she developed sharp, stabbing generalized abdominal pain followed by abdominal distension. She did not open her bowel for 4 days with nil flatus for 2 days. She had previously been treated for gastritis for H. pylori 15 years ago. She never had any abdominal operation. She also noticed a 50 kg weight loss in last 1 year, some of which was intentional. Since dieting, her bowel motion reduced from three times per day to once per week. On physical examination, she was hemodynamically stable. Her abdomen was soft but generalized tender with no bowel sound. CT scan of abdomen showed dilatation of stomach, first and second part of duodenum. There was compression of D3 (third part of duodenum) between the aorta and SMA . Distal to this, the bowel loops were completely collapsed. A subsequent barium meal and follow-through demonstrated a linear compression at the third part of the duodenum causing dilation of the proximal duodenum. This was also compatible with compression by the SMA . Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was organized that showed gastroparesis and scattered stomach ulcer in antrum. D1 and D2 were visualized without any obvious lesion. It was unable to reach D3, possibly secondary to dilated and stretched stomach. SMA syndrome was diagnosed. She was treated conservatively for 6 days without any improvement. She was taken to theater and Strong procedure was performed and discharged on second postoperative day. Postoperatively, she was put on a high-calorie diet, and subsequently gained 10 kg in body weight with no recurrence on 6 and 12 months follow-up.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Prevalence is about 0.013-0.3% with female predominance and occurs mostly between 10 and 39 years.\n\n【9】Normally, the SMA forms an approximately 45° angle (range, 38-65°) as it comes off the aorta. This angulation produces an aortomesenteric distance that spans 10 - 28 mm without impingement on the duodenal lumen as the third portion traverses laterally toward the ligament of Treitz. Decreasing the aortomesenteric angle to less than 25° will decrease the aortomesenteric distance to less than 10 mm. When this condition occurs, the third portion of the duodenum is compressed and SMA syndrome symptoms ensue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Predisposing factors\n\n【11】Predisposing factors include: 1) reapid weight loss; 2) reduction of the mesenteric fat around the SMA (causes: AIDS, malabsorption, cancer, cerebral palsy, and other conditions associated with cachexia; catabolic conditions, e.g. burns; eating disorders, e.g. anorexia nervosa and drug abuse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>); 3) following surgery (spine surgery: scoliosis correction, due to a relative lengthening of the spine postoperatively (prevalence 0.5-2.4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>; ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) - stretch the SMA over duodenum as the ileal pouch reaches pelvis; surgery associated with rapid weight loss - bariatric surgery, esophagectomy, abdominal trauma; others: compression from an AAA or SMA aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>); and 4) anatomical variants (high ligament of Treitz; low origin of the SMA).\n\n【12】Diagnosis\n\n【13】Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Unlikely our patient, most cases present in a chronic, insidious manner with the development of intermittent abdominal pain associated with vomiting, early satiety, and anorexia, esophageal reflux or anorexia. Sometimes they present with weight loss. Patients rarely present with signs and symptoms of acute duodenal obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Investigations\n\n【15】Radiological evidence of D3 compression by SMA includes: 1) aorto-mesenteric angle < 22° (normal 38-65°) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>; 2) aorto-mesenteric distance < 8 mm (normal 10 - 28 mm); and 3) proximal duodenal dilation with cut-off at D3 indicates SMA syndrome .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 4. (a) Anatomy and origin of SMA. (b) Normal aorto-mesenteric angle and distance. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【17】Contrast X-ray studies involve barium studies (that show duodenal dilation, retention of barium within the duodenum, and the characteristic vertical linear extrinsic compression at the third part of the duodenum), CT of abdomen (with oral contrast) and CT angiogram 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Endoscopy is used to confirm external compression at the third part of the duodenum and can rule out intrinsic pathology of the duodenum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Treatment\n\n【19】Conservative management combined with a high-calorie diet is usually advocated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 6 \\]</u>. Nutritional support with nasojejunal feeds when possible or TPN in selected patients is helpful. Positioning the patient in a knee-to-chest position or prone after eating helps to improve symptoms.\n\n【20】Surgical intervention is indicated only when medical therapy fails. Strong procedure involves division of the ligament of Treitz 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, and allows caudal duodenal mobilization outside the aortomesenteric angle. Although appealing because bowel integrity is not compromised by an anastomosis, the drawback of the Strong procedure is a 25% failure rate resulting from tethering of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Bypass of the third part of the duodenum by the creation of a duodenojejunostomy together with division of the ligament of Treitz has been the operation of choice. Recently, laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy has been attempted in a number of centers with satisfactory results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】SMA syndrome is a rare cause of chronic duodenal obstruction. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. It requires surgical intervention if conservative management fails. Currently, advances in minimal-access bariatric surgery have demonstrated the safety and low morbidity of laparoscopically created enteric anastomoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

His symptoms had worsened since his last visit with his WHO International Prostate Symptom Score rising from 17 to 23 in six months. A flow study was performed and this demonstrated a peak urinary flow of 11.2ml/sec on a voided volume of 142 ml and the ultrasound measured post void residual volume was 100 ml. While preparing for the study the patient consumed approximately three litres of water over four hours.\n\n【5】Several hours after the study his family noticed that the patient had difficulty finding words and was progressively more confused. He was brought to a local emergency department and found to be acutely confused with a GCS of 14. The physical examination was unremarkable aside from an ejection-systolic murmur with prosthetic heart sounds. His serum sodium level on admission was 114 mmol/L (normal range: 135 - 145 mmol/L). There were no acute infarcts or haemorrhage on a non-contrast CT brain scan. The patient was admitted to ICU for management of severe hyponatremia and commenced on an 800ml daily fluid restriction. Mirtazapine and ramipril were withheld during the admission. After several days of slow correction, his alertness and confusion improved. Seven days later he was discharged with a sodium level of 127 mmol/L and a diagnosis of hyponatraemia secondary to excessive fluid hydration exacerbated by tricyclic antidepressant therapy.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】The case presented demonstrates the importance of appropriate counselling when preparing patients for urine flow studies. Patients with predisposing medications or conditions should be warned of the risks of excessive fluid consumption before they begin to prepare for a study. Medications that are commonly known to cause hyponatraemia include diuretics (e.g. thiazides, indapamide, loop diuretics), anti-depressants (SSRIs, TCAs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors), anti-psychotics (e.g. haloperidol), anti-convulsants (e.g. sodium valproate, carbemazepine) and anti-neoplastic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】In rare instances, some commonly prescribed medications including ACE-inhibitors, amlodipine, proton-pump inhibitors, amiodarone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin have also been known to cause SIADH-related hyponatraemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Patients with a history of congestive heart failure, malignancy, hepatic cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome are at risk of developing hypervolaemic hyponatraemia with a large fluid load 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Our patient was on a regular tricyclic antidepressant (mirtazapine) and ACE inhibitor (ramipril) that were both identified as significant contributors to his hyponatraemia. These medications were withheld during his admission until further review by his family practitioner. There was a trend towards mild hyponatraemia on review of his previous biochemistry with a level of 132 mmol/L one month prior to his admission. This demonstrates the complexities of performing urine flow studies in a population with predisposing risk factors. Risk stratification within best practice guidelines will be necessary to identify patients undergoing such studies that would benefit most from tailored fluid intake volumes.\n\n【10】Hyponatraemia from overconsumption of fluid is an underreported adverse outcome of preparation for urinary flow studies with a risk of high morbidity and mortality. There is currently limited guidance on the quantity of water intake recommended for bladder preparation in both urine flow studies and abdominal or pelvic ultrasonography. Previous studies have recommended the need for standardised practice guidelines especially for patients at risk of serum inappropriate ADH syndrome related hyponatraemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. The case we have presented provides further evidence of the need for an improvement in current best practice. We recommend that a consensus guideline should be developed for patients undergoing urine flow studies on pre-study fluid consumption to minimise the incidence of future cases as demonstrated in this report.\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:49:38", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:50:01", "cost": 23.655}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:50:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:49:37"}

Lymphadenopathy usually is bilateral, painless and massive, and may also affect other lymphatic chains. It is observed in any age, but there is a predilection for young adult males (1.4:1) and commonly, the disease occurs in whites and blacks, and rarely in Asians 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】The extranodal involvement is observed in rare cases, and it is observed as typical sites of involvement, the skin and subcutaneous tissue, the upper airway, salivary glands, the eyeball, bones, central nervous system and breast, the latter being an uncommon site of presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In most patients, the lesions regress spontaneously, however, these patients may develop recurrent, persistent disease, however stable or progressive disease leading to death in a few cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Systemic changes and involvement of multiple organs apparently indicate a poor prognosis.\n\n【3】The differential diagnosis of lesions of Rosai-Dorfman disease of the breast is very complex and important in view that one should rule out a variety of malignant lesions. According to the literature, the radiologically Rosai-Dorfman disease manifests itself as lesions poorly defined borders without calcifications, difficult to distinguish from a carcinoma, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> which is actually a challenge since the doctor suspected until the therapeutic decision.\n\n【4】The authors of this study present a case of Rosai-Dorfman breast with a literature review on the topic, addressing different aspects of diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】Woman, mulatto, 37 years old, married, domestic Brazilian sought medical treatment with a history of nodulation in the left breast, slightly painful and itchy, no redness, no report of preview drainage and with the same skin coloring. She was detected 2 years ago during self-breast examination, leading her to seek medical attention.\n\n【7】On physical examination, patients with good general condition, absence of peripheral lymphadenopathy. There was a palpable nodule in the left breast, in the union of the lower quadrants, measuring about 3 cm in greatest diameter, hardened, alteration without skin color, not adhered to the deep plane and painless. There were exams pulmonary, cardiac, abdominal and gynecological pathology, without semiological signs. Laboratory tests such as complete blood count and electrolytes without changes.\n\n【8】Mammography was performed, which revealed no satisfactoriness for evaluation (BI-RADS 0). The research was complemented with breast ultrasound, which showed solid nodule and heterogeneous, with images circumscribed and irregular, complete with halo and thick 3.5 × 1.5 × 2.0 cm (BI-RADS/US IVc).\n\n【9】Core biopsy performed with a probable diagnosis of chronic mastitis abscess, and then a biopsy. The result of pathologic analysis of the lesion showed no growth with neoplastic chronic inflammatory process and outline of noncaseating granuloma, and complementary diagnosis by immunohistochemical assessment of the same specimen showed intense chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed of plasma cells, histiocytes and lymphocytes , observing further proliferation of histiocytic cells with characteristics of eosinophilic cytoplasm and large vesicular nuclei with nucleoli sometimes evident, the presence of inflammatory cells preserved inside the cytoplasm of these histiocytic cells, with clear halo around them, a phenomenon emperipolesis named . The immunohistochemical study revealed diffuse expression for protein S-100 in histiocytic cells, and CD20 +, CD3 +, CD163 +, CD138 + and negative for CD1a, which are morphological findings consistent with Rosai-Dorfman breast (extranodal).\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The patient recovered without developing disease in the last 1 year of outpatient treatment.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】The Rosai-Dorfman is a clinical and pathological entity infrequent, have unknown etiology and is characterized by reactive changes of the immune system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Its classical presentation is painless bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy in a young patient asymptomatic and usually evolves into a benign clinical course with low risk of systemic involvement.\n\n【18】In 1969, several years after its original description, it was felt that this was a disease process limited to lymph nodes. Currently has documented numerous cases in extranodal sites, which most often affect individuals with an age range a little higher, above 40 years. In another publication, we described seven cases with involvement of the mammary gland, showing the ages between 15 and 84 years, with an average of 42 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. During the last 16 years, in the literature, there have been 19 cases of Rosai-Dorfman disease related to mammary gland, and of these, 18 women with a median age of 45 years and 1 case in a man of 23 years old, with palpable mass in the right breast 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Reported Cases of Rosai-Dorfman Disease in the Breast |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【20】Patients with involvement of the breast are rare and usually present with a palpable mass and ill-defined sensitivity exacerbated or an abnormal mammogram, typically of malignancy. The differential diagnosis based on sonographic and mammographic findings includes both benign and malignant solid masses. According to literature, ultrasound usually shows a hypoechoic mass vascularized, and usually mammography shows a mass with ill-defined borders, without calcifications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The differential diagnosis based on histopathologic features include invasive breast carcinoma, Malakoplakia, diabetic mastopathy, fat necrosis, granulomatous mastitis, infectious granulomas, Erdheim-Chester, fibrous histiocytoma, malignant melanoma and Langerhans cell histiocytosis.\n\n【22】Definitive diagnosis is known thru the pathology, which can be established through fine needle aspiration (FNA), the core biopsy or surgical excision, histopathological characteristics that demonstrate similar regardless of the place of occurrence. The brand Rosai-Dorfman histiocytosis is a large, polygonal with round nuclei, vesicular chromatin, nuclear membrane thin, one to several eosinophilic nucleoli and abundant pale cytoplasm. Many of the histiocytes show emperipolesis, which signals useful feature, but not disease-specific and can be found in other pathologies. However, emperipolesis is often more difficult to be viewed in that extra nodal lesions in the lymph nodes.\n\n【23】Lymph nodes show capsular fibrosis and dilated nodal sinuses filled with foamy histiocytes, hence the disease is also known as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The immunohistochemical profile and is characterized by classic ultramicroscopic S-100 +, CD1a, without Birbeck granules. This type of spectrum immunohistochemical suggests that sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy is a proliferation of interdigitating dendritic cells in lymph nodes of antigen processing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】Currently there is a worldwide consensus of when to initiate treatment, or if conservative treatment is indicated, expectant or surgical. However, we know that Rosai-Dorfman disease usually evolves with spontaneous resolution in most cases. However, if you have documented, which may be persistent and aggressive evidence multisystemic, which can even be deadly in rare cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. What can be observed in the literature, is that patients with bilateral breast show an indolent clinical course similar to that seen in other extranodal site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Some unfavorable prognostic factors are: the extensive lymph node spread, extranodal involvement, immune disorders such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, the presence of rheumatoid factor or antinuclear antibodies and the association of anemia with neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】There are no standardized guidelines on follow-up of patients with disease confined to the breast, however, must be graded individually in order to delete the systematization of disease or local recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. However, we can conclude, as proposed by Landim et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, that tumors located exclusively in single anatomical site skin with surgical resection feasible, surgery should be considered: 1) tumors that persist or recur; 2) when the histopathologic findings are inconclusive; 3) the presence of symptoms; 4) if is the patient’s wish. Complete resection with clear margins should be the goal of surgery is a great option for regional control.\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author’s Contributions</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Thais Helena de Souza Silotti, substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data, drafting the article and critical revision of the article, final approval of the version to be published.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Maria Riselda Vinhote da Silva, substantial contributions to acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data, drafting the article and critical revision of the article, final approval of the version to be published.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Nilton Cesar O.

She also complained of persistent post-coital bleeding for 1-year duration. There was no fever, night sweats, cough or other constitutional symptoms. She had no positive contact history with any patients who had tuberculosis. She also had no significant past medical history and is a non-smoker.\n\n【7】On examination, there was a 3-cm exophytic, friable lesion with contact bleeding noted on the cervix.

Pelvic organs are infected from a primary focus, most commonly a pulmonary source, by hematogenous spread. The cervix is infected by lymphatic spread or by direct extension. Cervical tuberculosis is rarely a primary infection.\n\n【21】In our patient, the chest X-ray which showed bronchiectatic changes is likely to be consistent with a previous pulmonary tuberculosis infection. While the focus in the lung usually heals in most cases, the lesion may remain dormant in the genital tract for many years, and can be reactivated later.\n\n【22】Cervical tuberculosis can present as papillary or vegetative lesions, ulcers and miliary growths, therefore mimicking malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The diagnosis is usually made by histology of a cervical biopsy specimen. The gold standard for diagnosis is by culture growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis . However, one-third of cases can be culture negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Acid fast bacilli are not found to be useful in making the diagnosis, but the presence of typical granuloma is sufficient for diagnosis if other causes of granulomatous cervicitis are excluded, or a primary focus identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】The treatment regime is similar to that of pulmonary tuberculosis. A cervical lesion should respond to 6 months of standard treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> and is a good marker to assess response to treatment.\n\n【24】Subfertility, the initial presentation in our patient, is common even after treatment, owing to involvement of the fallopian tube and endometrium, as well as subsequent healing by fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. This patient had a hysterosalpingography done as part of the subfertility work-up 6 months after completion of treatment. Both fallopian tubes showed only partial opacification without free intraperitoneal spillage despite repeated attempts, suggestive of obstruction.\n\n【25】Tuberculosis is uncommon in a developed country such as Singapore. The age-standardized incidence rate of tuberculosis in Singapore was 38.7 per 100,000 population in 2016.

Whilst some patients may be asymptomatic, those with moderate to severe stenosis often present with exertional dyspnoea, chest pain, syncope and heart failure. Less commonly described complications of aortic stenosis include disorders of conduction. This case report describes a patient with previously undiagnosed aortic stenosis presenting with isolated presyncopal episodes.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 62-year-old gentleman with no cardiac history was admitted with a 3 weeks history of recurrent presyncope. These episodes occurred on moderate exertion, lasted only a few seconds and resolved with rest. He denied symptoms of chest pain or breathlessness but did report an awareness of intermittent palpitations, which he described as a ‘heavy thud in the chest,’ mainly in bed at night.\n\n【4】Examination was generally unremarkable, with the exception of mild systolic hypertension 165/80 mmHg and a soft, grade 3/6, systolic murmur over the precordium radiating to the neck. Initial investigations including full blood count, electrolytes and thyroid function were normal. His resting ECG  showed sinus rhythm with a normal axis. There was right bundle branch block morphology and the PR and QTc intervals were normal.

History and examination were unchanged. His baseline ECG was almost identical, except a prolonged PR interval of 210 ms was noted. Routine monitoring again revealed no abnormality. The patient suggested that he could try to replicate his symptoms through exercise. Under supervision, he walked briskly along the corridor without any symptoms. After two minutes rest, he had an episode of presyncope and an ECG confirmed second degree atrioventricular block (Mobitz type II), and a prolonged ventricular pause of approximately 6 seconds .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. ECG recording 2 minutes after a brisk walk. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【8】An urgent echocardiogram was arranged. The aortic valve was found to be moderately thickened and calcified with restricted opening. Continuous wave Doppler velocities suggested a peak gradient of 70 mmHg in keeping with moderate to severe aortic stenosis. In addition, mild aortic regurgitation was noted. There was mild left ventricular hypertrophy but preserved systolic function. No other structural abnormalities were identified. Coronary angiography demonstrated only minor coronary artery disease.\n\n【9】A dual chamber pacemaker was implanted 2 days after admission. Atrial pacing at the time of pacemaker implantation confirmed 1:1 atrioventricular conduction up to 130 beats per minute. The patient was discharged the following day with plans for early review and reassessment of his aortic valve. He has had no further episodes of presyncope since discharge. His nocturnal palpitations have resolved and he can exercise freely without breathlessness or angina.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Syncopal or presyncopal symptoms in patients with aortic stenosis are well recognised and thought to be caused by heightened left-ventricular baroreceptor activation. The development of these symptoms is an important marker of increased mortality and often prompts referral for aortic valve replacement. However, calcific aortic valve disease is also associated with impaired atrioventricular node conduction, particularly in cases with marked annular calcification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】This case serves as a reminder to consider investigating patients with aortic valve stenosis for conduction disease if they present with isolated syncope or presyncope. This also raises the dilemma of when it is sensible to exercise patients with significant aortic stenosis. Generally, guidelines discourage formal exercise testing in symptomatic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>, but, as we have demonstrated, this approach risks missing a significant and treatable alternative diagnosis.\n\n【13】Conclusions\n\n【14】To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature to report presyncopal symptoms on exercise related to transient AV node block, in the presence of moderate to severe aortic stenosis.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no conflicts of interest to be declared.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:55:16", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:56:28", "cost": 72.439}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:56:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:55:15"}

Definitive diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made upon detection of noncaseating granuloma via biopsy.\n\n【2】Posterior segment inflammation has an extensive differential diagnosis including infectious causes, immunologic conditions and malignancies such as lymphomas. Intraocular lymphoma is a malignant form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that presents as chronic vitritis with subretinal infiltrates refractory to corticosteroid therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Herein, we present an unusual case of sarcoid associated posterior uveitis presenting with retinitis and subretinal yellowish infiltrative lesions.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 73-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our institution by her community retina specialist for evaluation of abnormal retinal lesions. There was no significant past ocular history. She had a medical history of non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes and hypertension. She reported weight loss, profuse sweating, and loss of appetite over the last 3 weeks. Family history was remarkable of lymphoma in the sister.\n\n【5】On examination, visual acuity was 20/25 in the right eye and 20/30-2 in the left eye. Slit lamp examination revealed trace vitreous inflammation in the right and 3+ in the left. Anterior segment was non-revealing in both eyes with no sign of inflammatory corneal deposits (keratic precipitates) or anterior chamber reaction. Initial fundal examination revealed mild inferior retinal hemorrhage with no definite infiltrates in the right eye. In the left eye there were subretinal yellowish infiltrative lesions and hemorrhage up to the inferior arcade with some healed retinal lesions in the periphery seen through the vitritis .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

There was significant leakage from the disc and inferior vessels in the left eye . Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the left eye showed foveal outer retinal band elevation and disruption with a hyperintense subretinal infiltrate . Indocyanin green angiography showed dilated inferior choroidal vessels in the left eye. Serum testing was negative for Treponema pallidum and Toxoplasma antibodies. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and serum calcium levels were normal. T-SPOT tuberculosis test was negative. Chest X-ray and subsequent chest CT with contrast revealed hilar lymphadenopathy .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. (a, b) Coronal and axial chest CT with contrast demonstrating bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy . (c) Low magnification (× 200) H&E stain of hilar biopsy showing extensive granulomatous inflammation with no caseation. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【9】Because of the wide range of differential diagnosis in this case, we performed a pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy. Polymerase chain analysis (PCR) of the vitreous was negative for Herpes viruses and Toxoplasma gondii ; bacterial and fungal cultures were also negative. Histological examination of the vitreous sample showed intermediate-sized lymphoid cells with mature morphology. Flow cytometric analysis revealed CD4 T lymphoid population with a subset missing CD7 surface antigen and an elevated CD4/CD8 ratio. This raised the concern for intraocular lymphoma and prompted referral to the oncology service. Small mobile lymph nodes were palpable in the anterior cervical triangle, but lumbar puncture and CSF analysis were normal. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) biopsy of hilar lymph nodes was undertaken and results were consistent with noncaseating granulomatous inflammation rather than a neoplastic process . Both the lung aspirate and lymph node biopsy staining were negative for acid fast bacilli. These findings supported a diagnosis of sarcoidosis rather than lymphoma.\n\n【10】The patient was started on oral prednisone initially at 60 mg, tapering down over 6 weeks to 5 mg every other day. A sustained-release dexamethasone intravitreal implant (Ozurdex) was also injected into the left eye. She responded well to the corticosteroid regimen with resolution of macular edema and chorioretinal inflammation in the left eye after treatment but required repeated treatment with intravitreal dexamethasone implants for both eyes throughout the follow-up period of 15 months .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

The clinical presentation of our patient was an unusual combination of retinitis with subretinal infiltrates. This atypical presentation emulated the presentation of ocular lymphoma.\n\n【14】The differential diagnosis in this patient at presentation included infectious causes such as viral retinitis (herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) or West Nile virus (WNV)), tuberculosis, syphilis, Lyme disease, fungal endophthalmitis, Toxoplasma chorioretinits; and inflammatory causes such as sarcoidosis and Behcet’s disease in addition to intraocular lymphoma. The absence of associated systemic features such as skin and mucous membrane ulcers made the diagnosis of Behcet’s disease unlikely. Blood tests and vitreous PCR tests were negative for causes of infectious retinitis. Fundus examination revealed yellowish subretinal infiltrates in her left eye, which are suggestive of intraocular lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. The presentation of these lesions contrasts with the posterior segment lesions of sarcoidosis which present as multifocal choroiditis, vasculitis or granulomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Vitreous biopsy was consistent with intraocular lymphoma but was not conclusive. There were no multinucleated giant cells upon cytologic examination of the vitreous fluid indicative of sarcoid inflammation. Elevation of CD4/CD8 ratio can be found in chronic inflammatory conditions as well as lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. A final diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made based on the noncaseating granulomas found in the hilar lymph nodes.\n\n【15】There are two points in this case that deserve attention. First, laboratory tests and initial biopsy results were inconclusive of sarcoidosis. Serum ACE and calcium were both normal. In sarcoidosis patients with uveitis, sensitivity of raised serum ACE was 73% and specificity 83% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Serum lysozyme was not tested in this case. When both ACE and serum lysozyme are raised, the predictive value of diagnosis of sarcoidosis is 83% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Vitreous biopsy was also inconclusive of the diagnosis but concerning for lymphoma. Second, the clinical presentation was atypical for sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. There was an absence of anterior uveitis, keratic precipitates, choroidal or optic disc granulomas. Subretinal infiltrates and retinitis are unusual manifestations of sarcoid granulomatous inflammation. The clinical picture was concerning for lymphoma, including the hilar adenopathy. Ultimately, EBUS biopsy of the lymph nodes provided a definitive diagnosis of sarcoidosis.\n\n【16】In summary, retinitis and subretinal infiltrates can be an atypical, misleading clinical finding of sarcoidosis, masquerading as intraocular lymphoma.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Support</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No grant or financial support received.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FA: fluorescein angiography; OCT: optical coherence tomography; ACE: angiotensin-converting enzyme; PCR: polymerase chain analysis; EBUS: endobronchial ultrasound; HSV: herpes simplex virus; CMV: cytomegalovirus; EBV: Epstein-Barr virus; VZV: varicella-zoster virus; WNV: West Nile virus</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:58:04", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:58:26", "cost": 22.148}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:58:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:58:03"}

The high clinical efficacy of this drug in patients with sepsis has been confirmed in the phase III trials in Japan, including bacteremia caused by beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative rods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

Thus, TAZ/PIPC has shown a lot of clinical efficacy in the era of serious infections due to antimicrobial resistant pathogens.\n\n【3】We report on a case of E. coli bacteremia associated with renal abscess, in whom bacteremia was refractory to TAZ/PIPC treatment even though the time above MIC persistently exceeded 70%. The pathophysiology of the refractory bacteremia is discussed in light of PK-PD analyses with review of the pertinent literatures.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】An 84-year-old woman was referred to Saga University Hospital for work-up of fever, and the right lower guardant pain associated with diarrhea. Her past medical history included hypertension and reflux esophagitis.\n\n【6】On admission, the body temperature was 38 °C, pulse rate 112/min, respiratory rate 24/min, and blood pressure 99/66 mmHg. The oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was breathing 2 L/min oxygen. The abdomen was soft with tenderness in the right lower quadrant area. The laboratory results on admission showed peripheral WBC count 15,800/L with significant increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, the serum level of C-reactive protein 19.6 mg/dL, and the blood gas analysis revealed metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. These clinical features suggested severe sepsis with septic shock. The urinalysis was positive for leukocytes and nitrate, but the Gram stain was negative for bacteria. The plain abdominal X-ray found distension of the ascending colon, which was revealed by contrast-enhanced CT scan to have been caused by ischemic colitis.\n\n【7】There was also a low density lesion with peripheral enhancement in the left kidney that was suggestive of abscess in the corticomedullary portion .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Clinical course. Right lower abdominal pain improved and pyuria turned negative after administering TAZ/PIPC, but fever and bacteremia still continued. After TAZ/PIPC was replaced with PZFX and TOB, fever subsided and blood culture was sterilized. Abdominal CT (bottom) shows gradual reduction in size and subsequent disappearance of the left renal abscess after antimicrobial switch to PZFX. TAZ/PIPC: Tazobactam/piperacillin 4.5 g × 3 div; TOB: Tobramycin 150 mg × 1 div; PZFX: Pazufloxacin 500 mg × 1-2 div; CPFX: Ciprofloxacin 400 mg/day p.o. MICs were determined by microdilution method. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【9】After drawing two sets of blood culture, empiric treatment of intravenous TAZ/PIPC 4.5 g q8H, adjusted to creatinine clearance (67 mL/min), was started. The blood culture subsequently grew E. coli with the MIC of ampicillin (ABPC) > 32 g/mL, sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) 32 g/mL, PIPC > 64 g/mL, and TAZ/PIPC ≤ 2 g/mL. The right lower quadrant pain and pyuria showed improvements in response to TAZ/PIPC. The fever was still present; however, and the repeat blood culture drawn on the 4th, 5th, and 6th hospital-day all retrieved E. coli despite continuing antimicrobial treatment. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC against all the strains of E. coli ranged from 2 to 16 g/mL , which was considered sensitive.\n\n【10】The possible cause of the breakthrough bacteremia observed at this point was deemed either persistence of renal abscess from which E. coli spread into blood stream, or altered distribution of TAZ/PIPC, such as declining of serum concentration due to septic shock-induced increase in capillary permeability.\n\n【11】PK parameters were individually derived by measuring the patient’s serum concentrations of TAZ and PIPC separately, with the use of HPLC and the Sawchuk-Zaske equation as described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Subsequently the patient specific profile of the concentration time curve was simulated, and T > MIC was calculated by using one-compartmental single-dose infusion model. The serum peak/trough levels were 269/11 g/mL for PIPC and 41/5 g/mL for TAZ. The percent of time during which the serum concentration of TAZ/PIPC exceeds the MICs of the E. coli strains ranged from 70% at the MIC of 16 g/mL to 100% at the MIC of 2 g/mL . The volume of distribution (VD), the total clearance of the drug (CL <sub>T </sub> ), and the elimination half-life (T <sub>1/2 </sub> ) was 13.82 L (reference range: 9.56 ± 6.59 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, 11.9 ± 1.70 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, 11.6 ± 2.1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>), 98.89 mL/min (reference range: 173.5 ± 75.33 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, 181.67 ± 20.00 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, 183 ± 41 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>), and 1.61 h (reference range: 0.844 ± 0.083 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>), respectively .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. Pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics analysis. The serum peak/trough levels were 269/11 µg/mL for PIPC and 41/5 µg/mL for TAZ.

Pharmacokinetics of Piperacillin/Tazobactam |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【14】Although the drug distribution of TAZ/PIPC, as represented by CL <sub>T </sub> and T <sub>1/2 </sub> , was thus altered to some extent, the high percentage of T > MIC made it unlikely that the breakthrough bacteremia was due to insufficient dosing of TAZ/PIPC .\n\n【15】The follow-up CT scan revealed improvements of inflammatory findings of the ascending colon, but the size of the renal abscess remained the same as the pretreatment level . Having confirmed clinical ineffectiveness despite the optimal in vivo pharmacokinetics of TAZ/PIPC, the antibiotic regimen was switched to pazufloxacin (PZFX) 500 mg q12h and tobramycin (TOB) 180 mg q24h aiming at both adequate tissue penetration and eradication of bacteria from the blood stream. The fever gradually subsided following antibiotic therapy of PZFX + TOB, and the blood culture turned negative in parallel with disappearance of the renal abscess . The patient’s clinical course was uneventful thereafter, and was discharged to home.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】The clinical cues in this case were positive blood culture of E. coli , the right lower quadrant pain attributable to ischemic colitis of the ascending colon, and abscess formation in corticomedullary region of the left kidney without bacteriuria. These clinical features indicate in concert that the patient had developed translocation bacteremia of E. coli from ischemic colitis, which also hematogenously developed renal cortical abscess.\n\n【18】Despite high-dose intravenous administration of TAZ/PIPC, E. coli bacteremia in our case was refractory to this antimicrobial therapy even though the PK-PD analyses confirmed the T > MIC of TAZ/PIPC being kept mostly at 100% during the treatment. Penicillin antibiotics are known to exert bacteriostatic effects with T > MIC greater than 30%, which is further enhanced to bactericidal when achieving greater than 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In Gram-negative infections, however, these values are expected to exceed 40% and 70% because of the absence of post-antibiotic effects against Gram-negative bacilli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The same PK-PD profile can be applied to the TAZ/PIPC administered in the present case, because TAZ, a potent inhibitor of most group 2 beta-lactamase is known not to affect the pharmacokinetics of PIPC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Since the infusion method (continuous infusion over 24 h vs. intermittent infusion) reportedly had no influence on PK parameters of TAZ/PIPC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, our antimicrobial strategies of switching to other agents, not changing the dosing regimen, could be justified.\n\n【19】It is well known that beta-lactam agent is generally incapable of eradicating bacteria from circumscribed collection of purulent exudate such as abscess as seen in our case. This results from less effective tissue penetration of beta-lactams than other classes of antibiotics with higher VD, or lipophilic agents such as macrolide or fluoroquinolone . Therefore, given that intermittent bacteremia, which is discontinuous seeding of the same pathogen, is caused by infections such as abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, failure of TAZ/PIPC in sterilizing renal abscess may well explain refractory nature of E. coli bacteremia. But, why did it also fail in eradicating bacteria in the blood flow? The clinical picture with the use of TAZ/PIPC could have been persistent renal abscess with sterilization of blood culture, which was not observed in this patient.\n\n【20】In an acidic environment such as abscess, the MIC50/90 of TAZ/PIPC against 59 clinical isolates of Bacteroides fragilis was reportedly increased from 4/8 g/mL (pH 7.1) to 4/16 g/mL (pH 6.3), then to 16/32 g/mL (pH 5.8) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. These findings may indicate that acidic pH confers bacteria a temporally enhanced antimicrobial resistance beyond the value of antimicrobial susceptibility as measured by MIC. Additionally, duration of the contact time of antibiotics at sufficient concentration and bacteria, which should be long enough to exert antimicrobial activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, might have been short enough with q8h dosing of TAZ/PIPC for bacteria to evade bactericidal effect of TAZ/PIPC.\n\n【21】In conclusion, we presented a case demonstrating PK-PD success resulting in clinical failure of bacteremia. Infectious disease practitioner should be reminded that PK-PD theory should be carefully applied to different patients with different underlying conditions.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:20:15", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:20:31", "cost": 15.752}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:20:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:20:14"}

We describe a case of extreme hypernatremia secondary to dehydration in a 70-year-old male who presented with altered mental status, jaw clenching, and a serum sodium concentration of 191 mmol/L. Case reports with extreme hypernatremia reported in the literature were mostly secondary to increased sodium intake or hypertonic solutions, despite the most common cause of hypernatremia being excess water loss. Severe and extreme hypernatremia is associated with high mortality and morbidity, and mortality increases with higher initial serum sodium on admission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. There are few reported cases of extreme hypernatremia with serum sodium of more than 190 mmol/L on admission especially secondary to dehydration. We are presenting a case of extreme hypernatremia secondary to dehydration, who developed ventriculomegaly/hydrocephalus, regardless of guideline-based therapy that did not have a successful outcome, posing a therapeutic challenge to treat patients with sodium levels of more than 190 mmol/L.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Investigations\n\n【4】A 70-year-old male resident of a nursing home, with a past medical history of Parkinson’s dementia, deep vein thrombosis on chronic anticoagulation, right ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) for ventriculomegaly due to aqueduct stenosis, presented to the hospital with altered mental status. At baseline, the patient was bedbound and wheelchair-dependent but was alert, oriented, and able to hold a normal conversation, prior to this episode. One week prior to the hospital admission he had received a course of azithromycin for cough. Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 36.4 °C, tachycardic with a heart rate of 101 beats/min, hypotensive with a blood pressure of 78/51 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 15/min, and oxygen saturation of 97% at room air. On physical examination, he appeared cachectic with a scaphoid abdomen and mottled lower extremities. He was unresponsive to noxious stimuli and had coarse crackles throughout all the lung fields. He was intubated upon arrival at the hospital for airway protection, because of a low Glasgow comma scale (GCS) score of 3.\n\n【5】Diagnosis\n\n【6】The initial laboratory workup showed serum sodium 191 mmol/L (136 - 145 mmol/L), chloride > 150 mmol/L (98 - 107 mmol/L), potassium 5.1 mmol/L (3.5 - 5.1 mmol/L), bicarbonate 18 mmol/L (22 - 30 mmol/L), anion gap 23 mmol/L (< 18 mmol/L), glucose 162 mg/dL (70 - 99 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 119 mg/dL (8 - 26 mg/dL), creatinine (Cr) 3.17 mg/dL (0.7 - 1.3 mg/dL). Blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.36 (7.35 - 7.45), PCO <sub>2 </sub> 27.6 (35 - 45 mm Hg). Other lab work included creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) 598 U/L (30 - 200 U/L), magnesium 3.5 mg/dL (1.6 - 2.3 mg/dL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 1.057 mIU/L (0.3 - 5 mIU/L), albumin 3.5 g/dL (3.5 - 5 g/dL), calcium 9.5 mg/dL (8.7 - 10.5 mg/dL), total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL (0.2 - 1.2 mg/dL) and normal liver function tests. White blood cell count was elevated to 18,700/mm <sup>3 </sup> (4 - 12.00 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /mm <sup>3 </sup> ), hemoglobin 18.4 g/dL (13 - 16.5 g/dL), platelet 269,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> (140 - 400 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /mm <sup>3 </sup> ), lactic acid 3.1 mmol/L (0.7 - 2 mmol/L), troponin 39 ng/L (≤ 35 mg/L), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) 33 pg/mL (< 100 pg/mL). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), influenza A/B, and respiratory syncytial virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and urine analysis were negative. Chest X-ray showed infiltrate versus atelectasis on the left lower lobe. Computed tomography (CT) of the head showed marked ventriculomegaly with a VPS tip positioned in the left lateral ventricle. There was an initial concern about shunt malfunction, so an X-ray shuntogram was performed which did not show any disconnections. Externalization of the left VPS and placement of a right VPS was performed but follow-up imaging showed no significant change in the ventricular size. In the absence of shunt malfunction, ventriculomegaly was thought to be secondary to fluid shift in brain parenchymal cells due to acute hypernatremia.\n\n【7】Treatment\n\n【8】Given the extreme hypernatremia, encephalopathy, hypotension, and a clinical exam consistent with severe dehydration, he had received initial fluid resuscitation with 3 L of normal saline followed by dextrose 5% water at 75 mL/h.

He was also treated with vancomycin and piperacillin and tazobactam at 4.5 g every 8 h for pneumonia. Other infectious disease workups including blood cultures remained negative.\n\n【11】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【12】Despite electrolyte correction and cerebrospinal fluid diversion, the patient had minimal neurological improvement. His sodium was gradually corrected over a period of 6 - 7 days to 144 mmol/L. He developed ventilator-associated pneumonia and could not be weaned off the ventilator.

Our patient’s immobility status, age, and comorbidities likely made him vulnerable to extreme hypernatremia given his inability to seek water when needed.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 2. Summary of Case Reports on Severe and Extreme Hypernatremia |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【17】Hypernatremia is defined as acute when elevated serum sodium levels are present for 48 h or less. Initial symptoms with acute hypernatremia include lethargy, weakness, and irritability, and can progress to seizures and coma. Chronic hypernatremia is defined when elevated serum sodium levels were present for more than 48 h and are less likely to have severe symptoms given the cerebral adaptation. Severe symptoms with neurological manifestations occur when there is an acute elevation in serum sodium concentration above 160 mmol/L, and values above 180 mmol/L are associated with high mortality, especially in elderly individuals. In patients with extreme hypernatremia with neurological deficits, an initial CT head is recommended to detect possible intracranial hemorrhage due to vascular rupture from the shrinkage of brain cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Other rare neurological deficits have been reported, including transient ventriculomegaly, which was also seen in our patient. The brain is very vulnerable to fluid shifts associated with a hyperosmolar state from hypernatremia, and one case report showed a correlation between different sodium levels and the variation in ventricular size. Case reports have also described transient ventriculomegaly in patients with shunted hydrocephalus from hypernatremia which resolved after correction of osmolar imbalance. Shunted patients have altered brain elasticity as in other patients with tumors, hemorrhages predisposing them to a higher risk of ventriculomegaly with hypernatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Age and levels of serum sodium are independent risk factors for mortality in hypernatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. Geriatric population, nursing home residents are mainly dependent on help to maintain water intake. Their urge to drink is usually impaired and they cannot seek water for themselves making them vulnerable to dehydration and resultant severe hypernatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. Studies showed that there is decreased thirst response in elderly patients compared to younger subjects after water deprivation for about 24 h 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. Along with the impaired thirst mechanism, the renal concentrating ability to increase sodium excretion in response to sodium load is impaired with aging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>. Another physiological change that occurs with aging is the decrease in total body water predisposing the elderly population to dehydration and subsequent hypernatremia with minimal loss of fluid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】A delay in diagnosis and treatment of hypernatremia can lead to increased mortality. Despite being a very common electrolyte abnormality, management of hypernatremia is challenging, as it needs an understanding of body fluid compartments and concepts of normal body water balance. Rapid and overcorrection can lead to fatal outcomes due to cerebral edema. As per current evidence in treating hypernatremia, a reduction rate of no more than 0.5 mmol/L per hour or > 12 mmol/L in 24 h is recommended. However, some studies identified that rapid correction of hypernatremia with more than 0.5 mmol/L per hour or > 12 mmol/L in 24 h was not associated with high mortality or cerebral edema and recommended correcting sodium in order to decrease the length of stay in this vulnerable patient population. The rapid correction which is increasing the rate of free water administration has been found to be beneficial, especially in patients developing hypernatremia secondary to dehydration. The goal of treatment for hypernatremia is the restoration of plasma tonicity, and rapid correction improves the prognosis by preventing the effects of cellular dehydration, especially when hypernatremia developed acutely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. Our patient’s sodium was corrected gradually as per the current evidence-based guidelines and still did not have the desired outcome, and there was no evidence of cerebral edema but ventriculomegaly which is a rare neurological complication.\n\n【20】Conclusions\n\n【21】This case illustrates the high risk of mortality and morbidity associated with extreme hypernatremia and the need for reinforcing the importance of hydration in the elderly population. Also, it highlights the need for more research and evidence on the efficacy and safety of rapid correction of serum sodium in hypernatremia to decrease mortality in these vulnerable patient populations.\n\n【22】Learning point\n\n【23】Extreme hypernatremia is associated with a high risk of mortality and morbidity; early recognition and appropriate treatment are vital to have desired outcomes. Severe dehydration, although a rare cause, can cause extreme hypernatremia making elderly patients vulnerable to severe electrolyte abnormalities.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We appreciate Dr. Subramanyam Chittivelu MD for proofreading the revision of this case report.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study did not receive any funding.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was waived as this is a retrospective study.

Antimicrobial therapy is initiated based on this finding pending isolation of organism. In some cases, bacteria may exist in peritoneal fluid in absence of neutrophilic leukocytosis (polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) < 250/mm <sup>3 </sup> ), a condition termed as monomicrobial non-neutrocytic bacteriascites (MNB). This is a poorly recognized clinical entity. Salmonella has been reported as an uncommon cause of SBP and is a rare microorganism to cause MNB. We report a rare case of Salmonella MNB and present a brief review of literature.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 70-year-old man was brought to the hospital by his son with irritable mood and confusion for 2 days. The patient had recently recovered from a non-bloody diarrheal illness 3 days prior to presentation for which he did not receive any medical care. His past medical history was significant for non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, and Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis secondary to autoimmune hepatitis diagnosed 7 years ago for which he did not receive any treatment. Physical examination revealed blood pressure of 142/88, heart rate of 135 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute and dry oral mucosa. Patient was sleepy but arousable with marked confusion, incoherent speech and inappropriate responses to questions. Chest auscultation showed regular heart beat with tachycardia, normal heart and breath sounds. Abdominal examination was notable for distension, non-tense ascites with diffuse tenderness on palpation. Bowel sounds were auscultated in all four quadrants. Initial laboratory tests were significant for hemoglobin 10.2 g/L, white blood cell count 6,800/mm <sup>3 </sup> (72% neutrophils), platelets 130,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> , sodium 133 mg/dL, creatinine 1.38 mg/dL, ammonia 142 mMol/L, lactic acid 5.3 mMol/L, ALT 39 units/L, AST 67 units/L, ALP 82 units/L, total bilirubin 1.9 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, total protein 6.0 g/dL, and albumin 2.1 g/dL. Urinalysis showed 3+ leukocyte esterase, 20 - 50 white blood cells per high power field, and positive urine nitrite. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed which revealed a nucleated cell count of 33/mm <sup>3 </sup> (13% neutrophils) and proteins < 2 g/dL. The initial clinical impression was severe sepsis; patient was started on empiric vancomycin and cefepime. Salmonella enteritidis was isolated in the ascitic culture on day 4. Therapy with cefepime was thought to cover this organism. Patient was treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy but had a poor response. His clinical condition worsened and he subsequently developed septic shock secondary to pneumonia caused by ESBL producing E. coli . He required vasopressors, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy. Antibiotics coverage was adjusted according to susceptibilities. On day 5, he was transferred to another facility for continued care per family’s request where he died 6 days later. Repeat paracentesis was indicated but could not be performed as the patient was transferred.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Infection secondary to non-typhoidal Salmonella is uncommon in the United States and usually presents as a self-limited gastrointestinal disease. SBP secondary to Salmonella is uncommon. It has been reported previously in patients with immunosuppression and may present without signs or symptoms of SBP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-4 \\]</u>. We present a rare case of MNB with isolation of Salmonella enteritidis from the ascitic fluid. To our knowledge, this is only the second case report for MNB secondary to Salmonella enteritidis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】The diagnosis of MNB is made when ascitic fluid culture is positive but PMN count is < 250/mm <sup>3 </sup> . MNB is a poorly recognized clinical entity. Small studies show prevalence of asymptomatic MNB between 0.7% and 3% in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6-8 \\]</u>, while prevalence among patients with decompensated hepatic cirrhosis is reported to be as high as 16.25% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Mechanism of infection has been widely cited as translocation of bacteria across intestinal cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. The prevalence of bacterial translocation increases according to the Child-Pugh classification, up to 30.8% in Child C patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The opsonic activity in ascitic fluid depends on the protein content. Low-protein ascitic fluids in cirrhotic patients are deficient in opsonic activity and are particularly predisposed to ascitic fluid infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Total protein in the ascitic fluid in our patient was reported as < 2 g/dL. The fact that he had a diarrheal illness preceding presentation might have led to translocation of Salmonella into the peritoneum. In general, gram negative bacteria are the primary causative microorganisms for MNB, similar to SBP  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Causative Microorganisms of Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis and Monomicrobial Non-Neutrocytic Bacteriascites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u> |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【8】The clinical course of MNB is variable. Runyon et al report that 38% of patients with MNB eventually progress to SBP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u> and hence, a second diagnostic paracentesis is recommended after 72 h. In other patients, it represents spontaneous colonization of ascites which resolves without antibiotic treatment. Treatment with antibiotics is recommended if patients continue to have positive ascitic fluid cultures on subsequent paracentesis or if they develop local or systemic signs of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Mortality rate for MNB is also reported to be similar to SBP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】MNB is a poorly recognized clinical entity with variable course. Clinicians must timely recognize MNB as mortality is similar to SBP. To avoid missing MNB, ascitic fluid cultures must be sent and vigilantly followed up even with nucleated cell count of < 250/mm <sup>3 </sup> in the ascitic fluid. MNB may progress to SBP and hence, a repeat paracentesis should be done after 72 h. Salmonella is an uncommon cause of SBP and rarely causes MNB but should be considered in immunocompromised hosts.\n\n【11】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【12】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:50:37", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:50:42", "cost": 5.038}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:54", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:50:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:50:27"}

Given the limited treatment options and poor prognosis of IPF, patients and their families are drawn to experimental treatments to help prolong life and improve symptoms. One such treatment that has received much recent publicity is stem cell therapy. However, there are limited data on its safety and efficacy in IPF. Patients have been receiving stem cell therapy by various techniques both in the context of carefully supervised clinical trials as well as more loosely monitored settings.\n\n【2】We present a case of a patient with IPF who developed acute respiratory failure after undergoing intravenous (IV) and nebulized stem cell replacement therapy. High-resolution CT scan showed extensive ground glass attenuation in a “crazy paving” pattern in a perihilar distribution superimposed on his chronic pulmonary fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Stem cell replacement was felt to be the most likely trigger of his exacerbation. He responded rapidly to corticosteroid therapy.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 72-year-old male diagnosed with IPF 4.5 years prior to presentation and maintained on home oxygen presented with progressively worsening shortness of breath and cough over 1 week. He denied fever, chills, sputum production and chest pain. He had no prior IPF exacerbations. The patient reported that he had received IV and nebulized stem cell therapy through an experimental program 4 weeks prior to and again 2 weeks prior to the current admission. The procedures were completed as part of a patient-funded experimental program where stem cells were harvested from adipose tissue, cultured, and reintroduced to the patient intravenously and via nebulizer.\n\n【5】Of note, upon admission to the hospital, a copy of the study consent form was requested in order to better understand the procedures the patient underwent as part of the program. Unfortunately, the consent form was very limited and did not explain the reason the patient received the stem cell treatment, the methods employed for harvesting and re-introducing the stem cells, and the known or potential side effects from the treatment. Conversation with the doctor who administered the therapy confirmed that the patient received adipose-derived autologous stem cells via IV and nebulization. He reported that there were no potential side effects to the procedure, which was consistent with what the patient had been told.\n\n【6】Other medical problems included diabetes, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux and anemia. On EMS arrival, he was tachypneic and tachycardic with an oxygen saturation of 68% on 2 L nasal cannula; 100% non-rebreather facemask improved saturation to 85%. He was normotensive. He was afebrile but developed a transient fever shortly after admission.\n\n【7】On exam, he appeared malnourished and fatigued. Lungs had bilateral lower lobe rales, without wheeze or evidence of consolidation. Labs were significant for elevated WBC (17.6), glucose 通用删除7(英):<u>(299)</u>, BUN 通用删除7(英):<u>(32)</u>, creatinine (1.2), anion gap 通用删除7(英):<u>(21)</u>, and lactic acid (6.5). Mild anemia was also noted. Rapid influenza, urine legionella antigen, and urine streptococcal pneumonia antigen were negative. Chest radiograph revealed diffuse infiltrates in both lungs, much increased from last study 12 months earlier . The patient was started on methylprednisolone 40 mg q8h, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levaquin. High-resolution CT scan showed extensive ground glass attenuation in a “crazy paving” pattern in a perihilar distribution superimposed on extensive interstitial lung disease . The apices were spared.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

He was maintained on BIPAP and demonstrated significant improvement in oxygenation within 12 h. By day 2, the patient reported feeling less dyspneic and his chest X-ray demonstrated improvement in the bilateral infiltrates . By day 3, these were markedly improved. He remained on BIPAP for 3 days. Cultures were unrevealing and antibiotics were narrowed; he completed a course of levaquin. IV corticosteroids were continued for 5 days at which time oral prednisone was started. By day 5, oxygen saturation had improved to 96% on 2 L via nasal cannula at rest.\n\n【11】The patient was discharged on 40 mg prednisone and supplemental oxygen at 2 L NC. Prednisone was tapered down over several weeks with close follow-up. Chest X-ray 10 days after discharge revealed complete resolution of the alveolar infiltrates .\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Complete reviews regarding the potential of stem cells for treating pulmonary disease can be found elsewhere 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\- 6 \\]</u>. Briefly, when appropriately selected, screened, and implanted, stem cells may have the ability to repair and regenerate damaged tissues in the body. One theory of IPF pathogenesis is that epithelial injury, abnormal re-epithelialization, deposition of fibroblasts and microfibroblasts, and scarring of the lung parenchyma contribute to the disease. Hypothetically, stem cell treatment could contribute to cell repair and regeneration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 \\]</u>. Thus far, human studies in patients with lung disease are few in number with small sample sizes.\n\n【14】In published and ongoing studies in patients with IPF, several techniques of harvesting stem cells have been utilized. Sources have included bone marrow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\- 10 \\]</u>, adipose tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, lung (from both live and deceased donors) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, and placentas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Once cultivated, several ways of reintroducing stem cells have been described, including by IV infusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 , 14 \\]</u>, nebulization and bronchoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. In our patient, adipose tissue was used for stem cell harvesting and reintroduction was performed intravenously and via nebulizer.\n\n【15】Given the limited therapies for IPF, patients are drawn to experimental medications and off-label treatments, such as stem cell therapy. There has been a paucity of studies published in this area and few trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov. In the small number of IPF patients whom have been reported on, there have been no serious adverse events identified. One patient in the Serrano-Mollar study developed a transitory alveolar infiltrate and hypoxemia after cell instillation that responded rapidly to steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Chambers and colleagues reported only mild adverse events, including a transient decrease in arterial oxygen saturation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Recent results of the AETHER study revealed two deaths during the study period, one from IPF exacerbation and one from disease progression, over a 15-month period after IV stem cell therapy. Neither death was reported as being related to the study intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. However, due to the small samples, the diversity of disease states, and different methods employed, there is much information lacking regarding the short-term and long-term safety of the procedures.\n\n【16】Based on clinical presentation and CT scan findings, our patient met criteria for an acute exacerbation of IPF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Temporal relationship suggested stem cell treatment as the likely trigger. In the recent AETHER study, treatment emergent adverse events were those occurring within 4 weeks of stem cell treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>; our case met that definition. The clinical course made infection unlikely. Frequently, patients with acute exacerbation of IPF have diffuse alveolar damage superimposed on UIP. Given our patient’s rapid improvement and possible link to stem cell inhalation or infusion, one could speculate that pathologically he had an organizing pneumonia, a hypersensitivity reaction or an eosinophilic pneumonia (though peripheral eosinophils were normal).\n\n【17】The above case raises concerns over the safety of stem cell therapy in IPF. These concerns have been elucidated in recent editorials on the topic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\- 17 \\]</u>. Patients seeking stem cell therapy should only do so in the context of a reputable clinical research program. Clinicians must be diligent in explaining the unproven nature of stem cell therapy and the potential unknown side effects of this newly emerging option. Patients with life-threatening and orphan diseases are particularly susceptible to participating in unproven therapy as they grasp for any hope of relief from their disease. This makes them vulnerable to undergoing unproven therapies outside the context of a well-designed clinical trial.\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>KLC, JR and PD wrote the initial draft of the article.

The triggering etiology in most cases is unknown, but it has been reported to be associated with certain infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Helicobacter pylori . Histoplasmosis is the most common of all North American fungal infections. The lymphogenous reaction to Histoplasma can cause mediastinal lymph node enlargement, bronchiectasis, constrictive pericarditis, and rarely, idiopathic thrombocytopenia.

During this most recent admission, she was found to have a platelet count of 6,000/μL and therefore diagnosed as having another ITP relapse.\n\n【4】The patient was admitted and started on intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids. Her platelet count gradually improved and the patient was evaluated for a splenectomy as definitive treatment of her ITP. Two weeks after discharge, the patient underwent a splenectomy.\n\n【5】The patient tolerated the procedure well, without any intra-operative complications.

Thus this is the first report of factor V inhibitor emerging after PEIT in a patient with HCC.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】The case was an 80-year-old man with HCV-positive HCC that was firstly found 3 years ago. Both of two liver tumors in the S6 and S7 regions, 40 mm each in diameter, were surgically removed at another hospital. The patient firstly received blood transfusion during that surgery. Then the thrombotic arterial embolization (TAE) therapy was carried out against a rupture of the tumor in the S1 region in January 2009. In September 2010, PEIT was undertaken for the tumor in the S8 region with 3.5 ml of 90% ethanol and 0.2% lidocaine chloride. Figure 1 shows the abdominal CT of the case after PEIT. Then, the plasma prothrombin time (PT) was abruptly extended from 1.23 to 5.06 in the international normalized ratio (INR) one month (26 days) after PEIT , while the patient did not show any symptoms related to bleeding tendency. As Table 1 shows, hypoalbuminemia, azotemia, mild liver injury, anemia, mild thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of AFP, along with coagulation disturbance were observed. These parameters except for the coagulation disturbance had stayed in the similar levels before and after PEIT. Drug prescription patterns had not been changed over the period of PEIT. The patient had received blood transfusion during the admission period for the resection surgery of the tumors in the S6 and S7 region 3 years ago, but then any other biological products, such as albumin or a fibrin sealant had never been administered. As Figure 2 shows, the PT could not have been normalized by repeated administration of vitamin K (VK) and infusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). In the following examinations, the activity of the factor V was less than the detecting limit, and the activity of factor V inhibitor was identified using the Bethesda method as 30 Bethesda unit (BU)/ml . As Figure 3 shows, the cross-mixing test with normal plasma showed the pattern of existence of coagulation inhibitors, rather than deficiencies of coagulation factors. The patient was high-aged with renal failure, and did not show any symptoms suggesting bleeding tendency, liver failure or progressive anemia, except for transient mild hematochezia, not accompanied by a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) levels. Therefore, we carefully observed the patient without any additional therapy other than the administration of a long-acting erythropoietin analogue, darbepoetin . The PT of the patient gradually shortened, and PT-INR turned out less than 2.0, along with diminished activity of factor V inhibitor under the detection limit, five months (157 days) after PEIT .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The other liver function had been preserved, whereas the supplementation of vitamin K and FFP failed in recovery of the coagulation function. The case showed a decline in activities of multiple coagulation factors . The mixing test with the normal plasma suggested the existence of coagulation inhibitors, rather than a deficiency of coagulation factors, since the incubation with the normal plasma delayed the recovery of coagulation time . Then the activity of factor V inhibitor was identified. The decreased activities of other coagulation factors were consistent with the previous report that suggested the possibility of interference of inhibitors to the activity assays of other coagulation factors when the titers of inhibitor stayed at higher-levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. These assays measure PT or APTT of samples with the plasma that is deficient in a target coagulation factor, thus a decrease in the activity of the factor V caused by inhibitors may still affect those results. Meanwhile, the factor XIII activity using a direct photometric determination of the factor XIII 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> stayed in the normal range . In the case reported here, although both of APTT and PT had been prolonged, the PT abnormality had been rather predominant over the entire clinical course. Therefore, factor VIII inhibitor and other coagulation abnormalities, not examined in detail in this case, were not supposed to be co-existed.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 3. Activities of the Coagulation Factors |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【12】As summarized in Figure 4 , factor V inhibitor may arise from immunological sensitization to bovine serum albumin, fibrin sealants, transfused plasma, or drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Otherwise, impaired immunological responses may cause inhibitors in autoimmunological disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 10 \\]</u>. But there were some cases, such as malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, in which apparent antigens could not be identified. Newly emerged antigenicities that have cross-immunogenicity with the factor V might have produced antibodies to the factor V in these cases. There is no report concerning factor V inhibitors arising from PEIT. Damaged protein exposed to ethanol consequently might have obtained a cross-antigenicity with the factor V in the case reported here, because ethanol could certainly destroy protein structures and change their antigenicities as in envelope proteins of hepatitis B virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Besides the factor V, inhibitors against the factor VIII have also been reported. The factor V and VIII have similar structures and molecular weight around 330 kilo dalton (kDa). Moreover, both proteins are spliced and inactivated by protein C bound to protein S. Hence both proteins might have some similarities in their structures that can develop cross-antigenicities with the factor V.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 4. Possible pathogenic mechanism of factor V inhibitors. In addition to the possibilities reported previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\- 5 , 12 \\]</u>, ethanol in this report was described as an intrinsic causative agent. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【14】The actual incidence of factor V inhibitors is anticipated to be higher than that of reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. It will be the same or higher in patients with liver diseases, because the coagulopathy in advanced liver disease may mask a change in coagulation function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In this case, factor V inhibitor had not been examined before PEIT, thus HCV infection or HCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> might be predisposed to developing inhibitors, although abrupt elevation of PT in the clinical course suggested a close relationship between factor V inhibitor and PEIT, rather than either HCV infection or HCC. The complete eradication of the activity of factor V inhibitor five months after PEIT, along with normalization of coagulation time also suggested a closer relationship between the emergence of inhibitor and PEIT.\n\n【15】Except for supplementation with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K, no other treatments for eradicating factor V inhibitor were undertaken, because the patient had never shown any symptoms suggesting bleeding tendency and progressive anemia . According to the previous reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>, severity in bleeding tendency and concurrent clinical problems varied in each case, and neither levels of PT nor titers of inhibitors were directly related to the severity and the prognosis of patients with factor V inhibitors. Moreover, some patients spontaneously recovered, and their prognoses were not different from the patients receiving therapies including steroids. These observations make it difficult to establish the treatment regimen for factor V inhibitor. Consequently, we carefully observed the patient without any additional therapies, and the patient was fully recovered. We need to accumulate cases and their information to establish a useful regimen for the management of factor V inhibitors.\n\n【16】In conclusion, this is the first case report of factor V inhibitor arising from PEIT for HCC, and the patient was spontaneously recovered without any treatments except for the supplementation of vitamin K and the transfusion of FFP only in the early phase of the clinical course. Although mild coagulation disturbances are frequent complications of LC and HCC, a sudden-onset coagulopathy as reported here may be derived from factor V inhibitors, especially after PEIT. Because a spontaneous recovery is anticipated in some cases as reported here, careful observations without aggressive therapies will be a choice in case of poor general condition, or with multiple concurrent problems, unless serious symptoms arise from bleeding tendency.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We sincerely appreciate the laboratory technician, Fusao Kasahara for his excellent assistance in the analysis of coagulopathy in this reported case.

There are no reports of gastric metastasis from PPSC in the English literature. Here, we report a case of gastric metastasis from PPSC mimicking a primary gastric submucosal tumor (SMT). Gynecologists should recognize and identify this unusual pattern of metastasis to achieve complete tumor resection. Furthermore, preoperative gastric biopsy should be considered to judge the indication for surgical resection.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 62-year-old woman presented at her neighborhood hospital with complaints of abdominal distension. Transvaginal ultrasonography showed that both the ovaries were of normal size with no observed abnormalities. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed large amounts of ascites and omental caking . The patient underwent upper gastrointestinal fiberscopy (GF) to investigate the possibility of primary gastric cancer, the most frequent cause of peritoneal dissemination in Japan. A 4-cm submucosal mass without ulceration was detected on the posterior wall of the lesser curvature of the gastric antrum. The lesion was elastic, hard, and covered with an intact mucosa, implying a gastric SMT similar to a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) . The subsequent examinations, including a total colonoscopy, revealed no other primary tumors. Cellblock specimens of ascites showed adenocarcinoma cells that were immunohistochemically positive for BerEP4, PAX-8, WT-1, and p53 . These findings were consistent with high-grade serous Müllerian adenocarcinoma. Thus, a clinical diagnosis of PPSC, FIGO stage IIIc, was rendered. PPSC appeared life-threatening at the time of diagnosis, so we prioritized systemic chemotherapy for PPSC rather than a gastric biopsy of the SMT. The patient received three cycles of a dose-dense paclitaxel and carboplatin regimen (carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on day 1 and paclitaxel 80 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on days 1, 8, and 15). Two months later, a CT scan revealed a reduction in both ascites and the omental tumor, and interval debulking surgery for the tumor was performed. Intra-operative findings demonstrated bloody ascites, a thickened greater omentum, and disseminated tumors less than 10 mm in the abdominal cavity. The uterus and bilateral adnexae were not affected by the tumor . The gastric submucosal mass became smaller (3 cm in diameter) after chemotherapy. Following this, the patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, partial omentectomy, partial gastrectomy, and resection for the dissemination. The final pathology of the omental lesion and dissemination was high-grade serous adenocarcinoma . Although there was a small amount of adenocarcinoma cells on the right fallopian tube, definite serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma was not identified. Furthermore, the residual adenocarcinoma was mainly located on the omentum. The gastric lesion showed adenocarcinoma closely resembling peritoneal high-grade serous adenocarcinoma. It was covered with intact gastric mucosa and located in the proper muscular layer of the subserosa . These findings strongly support the final diagnosis of PPSC metastasizing to the stomach. The patient was discharged without complications and completed an additional three cycles of chemotherapy. She has been doing well for 6 months without recurrence.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. (A) A contrast-enhanced CT scan, showing large amounts of ascites and omental caking.

Gastric metastasis of PPSC is unusual. Based on the similar clinical and histopathological characteristics, PPSC has recently been classified as a pelvic high-grade serous adenocarcinoma. This group also comprises ovarian and tubal serous adenocarcinoma. There are no reports of gastric metastasis from PPSC in the English literature. Previously reported cases of gastric metastasis from pelvic high-grade serous adenocarcinoma are summarized in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-14 \\]</u>. Of these 15 cases, only one Japanese case was reported as PPSC, excluding the case discussed here 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. However, we cannot dismiss the possibility of more PPSC cases because the ovarian size at the initial diagnosis was not described in the most cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-9 , 11-13 \\]</u> and another report revealed the size of the ovary was 3 cm on PET/CT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Of the 15 cases, three cases were symptomatic and detected at the initial diagnosis; the other cases were diagnosed as postoperative recurrence at the stomach. The present case demonstrated that gastric metastasis of PPSC could be asymptomatic, similar to most primary gastric SMTs at the time of first diagnosis.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Summary of Reported Cases of PPSC Metastasizing to the Stomach |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【11】The mechanism behind gastric metastasis of PPSC remains unclear, although microscopic dissemination seems to be a possible explanation for the present case. This case did not show lymph node metastasis, hematogenous metastasis, or direct invasion to the stomach. However, one of these microscopic disseminations might grow and develop due to an abundant supply of blood from the stomach.\n\n【12】In the diagnostic process of PPSC, gynecologists occasionally need GF to rule out other possible primary malignancies including gastric cancer. When gastroenterologists detect an SMT, primary gastric mesenchymal tumors including GIST, leiomyoma, and schwannoma are listed at the top of the differential diagnosis. However, we should consider the possibility of gastric metastasis, which enables us to conduct an adequate debulking surgery. At the same time, unnecessary gastrectomy for benign SMT should be avoided. Thus, if the situation allows, preoperative gastric biopsy is recommended to judge the indication for surgical treatment. Fortunately, a tissue sampling method for gastric SMT has improved recently. Jhala et al reported that the diagnostic accuracy for specimens obtained is 96% with an endoscopic ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. For the present case, we prioritized chemotherapy for a life-threatening malignancy and the subsequent apparent reduction in size of the gastric SMT indicated the possibility of metastatic adenocarcinoma. Thus, partial gastrectomy was performed for confirming pathological diagnosis, which resulted in optimal surgery. In addition, Takigawa et al reported they could perform preoperative EUS-FNAB and avoid gastrectomy for scar with no residual tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】In conclusion, we reported the case of gastric metastasis from PPSC. We recommend that when a gastric SMT is detected on GF during the diagnostic process of PPSC, gynecologists should be aware of the possibility of gastric metastasis from PPSC as well as a primary gastric mesenchymal tumor. If the situation allows, preoperative gastric biopsy should be considered to determine an appropriate therapeutic strategy.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We are grateful to Dr. Wada for performing the operation with us.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors declare no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:55:41", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:55:48", "cost": 6.704}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:55:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:55:32"}

SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the organs with a high quantity of virus targeted receptor protein: angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which includes the lungs, heart, kidney, and small intestine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Clinical manifestations include mild symptoms like diarrhea, shortness of breath and cough to severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, widespread thrombosis, renal failure, and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Current treatment modalities for moderate and severe for COVID-19 include antiviral agents, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and supportive management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】Recently mAbs have emerged as a beneficial tool for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 based on their specificity, ability to prevent disease progression and reduction of disease period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. It follows the hypothesis that passive immunotherapy might be useful for the management of COVID-19 since patients who develop antibodies soon after disease occurrence have better prognosis than those with delayed antibody response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The mAbs are derived from the B cells. These antibodies neutralize the virus by binding to the spike proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 and block the entry of the virus into the host cells thereby reducing the viral load 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) of mAbs for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 disease within 10 days of symptom onset including bamlanivimab-etesevimab, casirivimab-imdevimab, bebtelovimab and sotrovimab; however, the use of bamlanivimab-etesevimab and casirivimab-imdevimab against Omicron variant was later revised in January 2022 due to lack of efficacy against the variant. The combination of casirivimab and imdevimab (REGN-COV2) binds to the epitopes of the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 and blocks the virus binding to the human receptors causing decrease in the viral load 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Bamlanivimab-etesevimab also has a similar mechanism of action and can be used in patients with mild to moderate symptoms and high risk of progression to severe disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Clinical trials for the efficacy, rate of hospitalization and mortality benefits of mAbs for COVID-19 are currently underway for patients with early disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. However, limited benefit has been observed in patients with severe disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【40】A study conducted by Bariola et al showed that 15 out of 232 propensity matched patients were hospitalized after treatment with bamlanivimab and only four of these patients died 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. This study emphasized that bamlanivimab therapy reduced the hospitalization and mortality in patients more than 65 years of age with COVID-19. Another study conducted by Gupta et al showed that only three out of 291 patients with COVID-19 treated with sotrovimab had disease progression leading to hospitalization and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. The emergence of viral variants, however, is an issue of concern since it may undermine the clinical effectiveness of current mAbs therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Omicron (B1.1.529) is a new variant with missense substitutions in the spike protein receptor domain that might not be neutralized by casirivimab and imdevimab as per unpublished in vitro studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. If this hypothesis proves true, then it will significantly compromise the efficacy of mAbs against the Omicron variant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 treatment guidelines also recommend against the use of bamlanivimab-etesevimab and casirivimab-imdevimab for Omicron variant and as such have revoked the EUA of these mAbs due to lack of efficacy against the Omicron variant as of January 2022 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【41】We compiled the data of 125 patients with mild and moderate symptoms of COVID-19 who received mAbs over the course of 2 months from October 2021 to December 2021. Twelve patients out of 125 received sotrovimab whereas 55 received casirivimab/imdevimab and 58 received bamlanivimab/etesevimab. Most of the patients were Hispanic. Diabetes and hypertension were the most common comorbidities. Majority of the patients were male. We report three cases of hospitalization out of these 125 patients post mAbs treatment. One patient received bamlanivimab 700 mg and etesevimab 1,400 mg transfusion whereas the remaining two received casirivimab-imdevimab 1,200 mg mAb treatment. Out of the three, one patient who received casirivimab-imdevimab, passed away due to progression of disease. It is to be noted that the patient had multiple comorbidities which might be a cofounder to the efficacy of mAbs. All patients were above 54 years of age. Two patients were hospitalized within a week of mAb administration whereas one patient was hospitalized after 2 weeks for worsening clinical symptoms. Only one patient was upgraded to the ICU due to progression of the disease. All the patients were given prophylactic anticoagulation whereas, only two patients received remdesivir and dexamethasone. One patient had no significant PMH except obesity whereas the other two had multiple comorbidities. All of the patients showed progression of disease on imaging; however, the only patient with unfavorable outcome had significant co-morbidities which might have played a role in the severity of his symptoms. A study conducted by Lovett et al demonstrated that out of 270 patients treated with bamlanivimab only five patients (1.9%) required hospitalization and the risk of hospitalization was 82% lower in mAb treated patients as compared to untreated patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. These cases coincide with the beginning of the spread of the Omicron variant and even though the viral genome was not sequenced due to the paucity of funds in the community hospital, the timing of the cases suggest infection with the Omicron variant and the therapeutic failure of the mAbs might be due to the reduced activity of mAbs against the newer variant. It is to be noted that mAbs are susceptible to mutations and not useful for permanent intervention.\n\n【42】Future prospective studies are required to explore medical conditions and viral variants that may benefit from mAbs for the treatment of COVID-19. Outpatient strategies to decrease the rate of hospitalization and death are imperative to reduce the disease burden caused by SARS-CoV-2 and as such also supports the investment of funds for the development of infusion infrastructure.\n\n【43】Learning points\n\n【44】The use of neutralizing antibodies has a potential utility as a treatment option for COVID-19 and clinical trials are underway to determine the optimum strategic use. The emergence of viral variants is a limiting factor for the treatment with mAbs and should be kept in consideration while using the mAbs.\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consents were obtained from the patients for publication of the case report.</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RA, AP, MW, and KT contributed to diagnosis and management of the patient, discussion, writing and drafting of the case, final approval of the case reports.

The clinical features associated with 13q deletion include moderate to severe mental and growth retardation, craniofacial dysmorphisms, hand and foot anomalies, brain, heart and kidney defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. A translocation or deletion involving the region 13q33.1-34 results in low concentrations of coagulation factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Clinically this may or may not be associated with bleeding. Sub-clinical factor VII deficiency associated with a 46, XY, t(13;Y)(q11;q34) translocation and probable deletion of a terminal segment of 13q manifesting as elevated prothrombin time (PTT) has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】We report an unusual presentation of 13q deletion. In our child factor VII assays showed a level of less than 3 IU/dL in utero resulting in intracranial hemorrhage. However factor VII levels increased spontaneously without treatment and although she continued to have an abnormal clotting profile with a raised PTT, there have been no symptoms of bruising or bleeding in the postnatal period.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A baby girl was born at 39 weeks to non-consanguineous parents by emergency section for fetal distress in a good condition with a birth weight of 2.3 kg. The baby was noted to have a paucity of movement of the left side of the body and was diagnosed to have left sided hemiplegia subsequently. Antenatally, an ultrasound scan done at 22 weeks showed right ventriculomegaly with caudothalamic groove atrophy, which was thought to represent earlier hemorrhage. Antibody titers for toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes infections were negative. The fetal blood sampling showed a normal platelet count. Maternal platelet counts were normal and there was no history of maternal intake of aspirin, antiplatelet medications, anticoagulants or any other drug ingestion. Functional factor VII assay performed antenatally, demonstrated a factor VII level of less than 3 IU/dL (normal range > 50 IU/dL). Cytogenetic analysis of the amniotic fluid revealed a terminal deletion of chromosome 13 with a breakpoint at 13q33.3 (46XX del 通用删除7(英):<u>(13)</u> (q33.3) ish del 通用删除7(英):<u>(13)</u> (q33.3) (wcp13+, D13S327-)). The genotype was confirmed in the postnatal period. A probe for the subtelomeric region of chromosome 13 (D13S327) demonstrated a small distal long arm deletion in the anomalous chromosome. A cytogenetic analysis performed on both the parents did not reveal any abnormalities.\n\n【5】Functional factor assays performed in the postnatal period showed an increase in the factor VII level to 8 IU/dL from an antenatal assay level of less than 3 IU/dL. At 3 months of age her factor VII levels spontaneously rose to 35 IU/dL. There was no history of bruising epistaxis or bleeding during childhood. The factor X assay was subsequently within the normal range.\n\n【6】The dysmorphic features comprised of prominent forehead, triangular face, almond shaped eyes with upslanting palpable fissures, mild ptosis, high nasal root, hypoplastic alae nasi with prominent columella, thin upper lip, downturned corners of the mouth, and a small pointed chin . She also developed swelling of both lower limbs, which progressively increased with time. A series of abdominal ultrasounds showed no evidence for obstruction of the inferior vena cava. A clinical diagnosis of lymphedema praecox was made.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Nissen’s fundoplication was performed at 8 years of age. The surgical procedure was not associated with abnormal bleeding. She was subsequently noted to gain excessive weight. At 10 years of age, the patient’s body mass index (BMI) was 29.5 (+3.07 standard deviation score) with microcephaly (below 0.4th centile).\n\n【9】Endocrine investigations to identify the cause of obesity including a 24-h glucose and cortisol profile, urinary steroid profile, adrenal androgens, thyroid function tests, and baseline pituitary function tests were within normal limits. An oral glucose tolerance test showed evidence of insulin insensitivity  with the peak plasma insulin level of 170 mU/L at 30 min and peak plasma glucose of 124 mg/dL. She was commenced on metformin at a dose of 500 mg twice daily and follow-up of 12 months did not reveal any significant benefit.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1.

While distal deletions are closely associated with severe phenotypes, proximal deletions tend to cause fewer major anomalies, with the exception of retinoblastoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】In our patient, the deletion occurred before the coding region for factor VII, with the break point occurring at 13q33.3 . This possibly led to antenatally detected very low levels of factor VII leading to intracranial hemorrhage. This is the first case report of 13q deletion associated with factor VII deficiency leading to antenatal stroke. Interestingly the factor VII levels improved spontaneously in the postnatal period. The reason for this fluctuation in the factor VII levels remains unclear. In addition to factor VII deficiency, the deletion of COL4A1 (OMIM 120130) and COL4A2 (OMIM 120090) genes, which have been mapped to chromosome 13q33.3-34  could have contributed to the hemorrhagic stroke in the antenatal period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 2. Genes Mapping to Chromosome 13q33.3-34 (Ensembl/Biomart) |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【15】The human insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) (OMIM 600797) is localized on chromosome 13q34 . This gene encodes the IRS2, a cytoplasmic signaling molecule that mediates effects of insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, and other cytokines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Homozygous deletion of IRS2 in mice is known to generate insulin resistance which is particularly pronounced in liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Mice lacking IRS2 develop diabetes due to peripheral insulin resistance, failed hypothalamic regulation of appetite and β-cell insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Our patient had a heterozygous deletion of IRS2 gene  which we postulate to be the cause of insulin resistance. Our patient has mobility issues that reduce the calorie expenditure in addition to the behavioral difficulties that make calorie restriction very difficult. These factors in association with the genetic predisposition for insulin resistance due to IRS2 deletion possibly act together in contributing to the obesity.\n\n【16】Primary lymphedema (lymphedema praecox), a disorder causing persistent swelling in an extremity, is rare in childhood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The influences of estrogen and inflammation are thought to be important etiologic factors in primary lymphedema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. This is the first case report of lymphedema praecox in association with 13q deletion. She did not have any other cause like trauma, illness, pelvic mass or surgery that could have contributed to the lymphedema. No genetic etiology for lymphedema praecox has been identified so far; hence the exact genetic link between 13q deletion and lymphedema is not clear.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】While 13q deletion syndromes are well recognized, this is the first reported case report of antenatal, hemorrhagic stroke secondary to factor VII deficiency. In the index case, the deletion has occurred just before the coding region for factor VII leading to intracranial hemorrhage antenatally. A combination of genetic (deletion of IRS2) and environmental factors (diet and exercise) possibly contributes to the obesity and insulin resistance. This is the also first case report of lymphedema praecox in association with 13q deletion.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Competing Interests</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:37:41", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:41:14", "cost": 212.907}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:41:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:37:32"}

However, intramuscular cysts at the proximal calf are rare, and the etiologies of these cysts are diverse. Some case reports have shown that atypical Baker’s cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>, cysts arising from the proximal tibiofibular joint (PTFJ) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\- 8 \\]</u> and nerve sheath ganglions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\- 12 \\]</u>, can lead to intramuscular cysts at the proximal calf. The clinical presentation of these cysts is usually a painless mass along the calf. When the cyst exerts pressure on the nerves or blood vessels, pain, numbness, and muscle weakness might occur, or there might be tenderness and discomfort during movement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 8 , 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can clearly reveal the size and position of the cysts, and identify their anatomical relationship to the joint and surrounding structures. Prior to surgery, it is important to identify whether the cyst is connected to the joint, or is associated with intraarticular disease, and to perform thorough excision, to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. Although the presentation of cystic masses arising from different origins might be similar, their treatments are different, thus underscoring the importance of accurate diagnosis.\n\n【2】To our knowledge, there are no previous publications about intramuscular cysts at the proximal calf, arising from different origins. To arrive at an accurate diagnosis, and decide an appropriate treatment of these cysts, we describe here two cases of rare intramuscular cysts. The first case is a ganglion cyst arising from the proximal gastrocnemius medialis muscle and the second case is about a synovial cyst arising from pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), which has never been reported in the literature. In addition, we have recapitulated intramuscular cysts at the proximal calf with different etiologies based on their origin, by a systematic review of literature, to aid in accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The respective patients provided their consent for the publication of these cases.\n\n【3】Case Reports\n\n【4】Case 1\n\n【5】A 61-year-old woman presented with a painless mass at the posterior aspect of her right knee, which had grown progressively over the last 4 months. There were no symptoms of pain or numbness in her right leg. There was no history of recent local injury or surgical treatment. On examination, there was a non-tender mass of the size of a quail egg, over the gastrocnemius medialis muscle. Slight pain was elicited on deep palpation. The overlying skin was normal. The ranges of movements of the right knee were flexion 100° and extension 5°. Remainder of the examination was normal.\n\n【6】Anteroposterior radiographs revealed degenerative changes in the knee joint. An ultrasound (US) examination was performed for evaluation of the mass and its relation to the adjacent structures. US demonstrated a hypoechoic cystic lesion with well-defined borders and thick walls, containing scattered hyperechoic spots, located at the gastrocnemius medialis muscle. The maximum diameter was 4 cm. MRI was performed to confirm the US findings. MRI revealed a cystic mass in the gastrocnemius medialis muscle and the mass was not attached to the knee joint . The surrounding soft tissue was normal. The primary diagnosis in this case was a popliteal cyst.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Preoperative magnetic resonance image of the right knee.

First, an arthroscopic examination was performed. The anterior-lateral and anterior-medial arthroscopic portals were used to perform the procedure and no evidence of intra-articular pathology or capsular opening was found. Subsequently, a surgical exposure of the popliteal fossa was performed. Intraoperatively, the cystic mass of about 4 × 3 × 3 cm was located in the gastrocnemius medialis muscle . The cyst was filled with mucoid-like material. The histological diagnosis was compatible with a ganglion cyst and a diagnosis of intramuscular ganglion cyst was made, based on these histologic findings. Postoperatively, the patient recovered completely in a few weeks. There was no recurrence or complications during 8 months of follow-up.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

There was no previous history of significant injury to the right knee and no congenital abnormalities. On examination, there was tenderness around the knee joint with a visible swelling. However, the mass was not felt on palpation. The overlying skin was normal. The ranges of the right knee movements were flexion 90° and extension 0°. Rest of the examination was normal.\n\n【12】Anteroposterior radiographs revealed slight bony erosions of the lateral condyle of femur. MRI showed an extra-articular cyst measuring approximately 4 × 1 × 1 cm, at the site of gastrocnemius lateralis muscle. The lesion had a well-circumscribed margin, with low signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images . In addition, there was significant fluid in the suprapatellar bursa, and thickened synovium with low signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. One of the sagittal T1-weighted images showed that the cyst wall was attached to the knee joint capsule . The surrounding soft tissue was normal. A preoperative diagnosis of diffuse PVNS was considered, and the intramuscular cyst was believed to be arising from PVNS.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3.

Since there were no symptoms, no surgery or needle puncture of the intramuscular cyst was performed. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of diffuse PVNS. The patient was fully asymptomatic with no evidence of recurrence at the most recent 6-month follow-up after surgery.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】We have described two rare intramuscular cysts, thus highlighting the need for consideration of intramuscular ganglion cyst or intramuscular cyst arising from PVNS, in the differential diagnosis of cysts at proximal calf. Based on the site of origin, intramuscular cysts can be divided into the following five types: intramuscular cysts arising from the muscular tissue, knee joint, PTFJ, neurilemma and PVNS. The characteristics of these cysts but cysts arising from PVNS resemble the characteristics of a ganglion; hence, these cysts can be considered as intramuscular ganglion cysts.\n\n【18】The ganglion cyst is a benign cystic mass, with a dense fibrous connective tissue capsule, containing clear, high-viscosity mucinous fluid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, and usually originate from the joint capsule or tendon sheath. The pathogenesis of ganglia is controversial. Rohrich et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u> mentioned that there were three predominant theories about the origin of a ganglion: 1) they arise as an outpouching or weakening of the joint capsule, 2) they arise from a mesothelial embryonic rest, and 3) they arise due to mucin formation by fibroblasts of the joint space or bursa. In an extensive review of the literature, we found that ganglion cysts occur most frequently in juxta-articular locations such as hand and wrist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. However, intramuscular ganglion cysts are uncommon, with only a few reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 14 , 16 , 19 \\- 25 \\]</u>, of which, intramuscular ganglion cysts located in the proximal calf are even rarer with fewer case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 14 , 19 , 24 , 25 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】For accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, we present below, a precise description of these cysts at the proximal calf.\n\n【20】Intramuscular cysts arising from the muscular tissue\n\n【21】We defined the intramuscular ganglion cyst, which was not attached to the adjacent joint, as an intramuscular cyst arising from the muscular tissue. This type of cyst is currently rare. Rohrich et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u> first reported a patient with a ganglion within the biceps muscle, which had no association with adjacent joints. They postulated that the ganglion might have originated from embryonic rest of ectopic synovial tissue. Subsequently, James et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u> presented a series of 10 cases of ganglion cysts arising from the medial or lateral gastrocnemius muscle. No link could be identified between the cyst and knee joint or any other intra-articular structure on MRI. However, none of them was dissected intramuscularly. Beggs et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u> presented the imaging findings in three patients who had intramuscular ganglia, which were not attached to a joint, and one case had the ganglion in the medial gastrocnemius muscle. Park et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u> reported a case of ruptured intramuscular ganglion cyst in the gastrocnemius medialis muscle. Nicholson et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u> also described a case of intramuscular ganglion cyst in the medial gastrocnemius muscle. The cysts in these two cases were not attached to the knee joint on MRI, and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of ganglion cysts. The first case in our article is also an intramuscular ganglion cyst at the proximal calf. MRI showed no communication between the cyst and the adjacent joint. Arthroscopic examination was performed and we did not find any evidence of intra-articular pathology or capsular opening. The histological diagnosis was ganglion cyst. Based on previous case reports, we deduced that these intramuscular ganglion cysts arise from the muscular tissue. For this type of cysts, satisfactory clinical results can be achieved by direct open excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 24 , 25 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Intramuscular cysts arising from the knee joint\n\n【23】When the intramuscular cysts communicate with the joint cavity through a tortuous pedicle, they are considered to be arising from the joint. These types of cysts arise as an outpouching or weakening of the joint capsule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. In addition, Fang et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> thought that current knowledge about the anatomy and pathophysiology of popliteal cysts does not convincingly explain the mechanism by which intramuscular cysts arise. They presumed that cysts extend along the intermuscular planes that offer least resistance. Chiu et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u> reported the case of a child with an intramuscular cyst in the thenar eminence, with its origin in the scaphocapitate joint. Montet et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u> also reported a case of intramuscular ganglion arising from the acromioclavicular joint. Intramuscular cysts arising from the knee joint capsule can be considered as atypical Baker’s cysts. Baker’s cyst is a fluid-filled mass, which is a distention of the gastrocnemio-semimembranosus bursa, located on the medial aspect of popliteal fossa. Several previous studies have shown the communication between the gastrocnemio-semimembranosus bursa and the joint cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\- 29 \\]</u>. This plays an important role as a diagnostic marker for the differentiation between extra-articular soft tissue ganglion cyst and Baker’s cyst.\n\n【24】Intramuscular Baker’s cysts have rarely been reported in the international literature. Kim et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u> reported a case of Baker’s cyst with intramuscular extension into the vastus medialis muscle. Kim et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> reported a ganglion cyst in gastrocnemius muscle, which had a channel communicating with the knee joint. Fang et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> described the intramuscular dissection of Baker’s cysts in three cases. An extension of a Baker’s cyst was shown to involve the vastus medialis in one case and two cases involved the medial head of gastrocnemius. In each of these reports, a channel was seen to be communicating with the knee joint on MRI, allowing identification of the source of these cysts. Clearly, it is important to differentiate atypical Baker’s cysts from ganglion cysts arising close to the medial head of gastrocnemius that this study describes. Historically, direct open excision has resulted in unacceptably high recurrence rates, as the intra-articular pathology that causes and sustains the cyst is not curable and the communication with the joint is not tightly closed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\- 33 \\]</u>. Currently, arthroscopic procedures are most commonly used to treat the intra-articular pathology and to address the cysts directly by opening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u> or closing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u> the orifice of communication. However, we propose that open surgery combined with arthroscopic procedures is also necessary when the cysts are large.\n\n【25】Intramuscular cysts arising from the PTFJ\n\n【26】Similarly, when intramuscular cysts communicate with the PTFJ cavity, they are considered as arising from the PTFJ. In one case reported by Brooks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>, the ganglion invaded the tibialis anterior muscle. Subsequently, Muckart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> described eight patients with ganglia arising from the superior tibiofibular joint, five of which were within the peroneus longus muscle and were connected to the superior tibiofibular joint, through the tendinous origin of the muscle. The clinical presentation of this type of cysts is variable, from asymptomatic to gradually increasing swelling and pain. In addition, it is known that over 50% of cysts of the PTFJ are associated with peroneal nerve palsy, due to compression of the common peroneal nerve in the peroneal canal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\- 8 , 35 \\- 37 \\]</u>. This is characterized by anterolateral leg and dorsal foot pain, followed by progressive weakness of the peroneal nerve innervated anterior compartment musculature, along with a steppage gait. Complete peroneal nerve palsy presenting with a foot drop has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 , 38 \\]</u>. We believe that MRI is the best imaging method for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of a cyst arising from the PTFJ. It provides the best images of the communicating channel leading from the cyst into the PTFJ, and proximity of the cyst to the peroneal nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 15 \\]</u>. Aspiration and corticosteroid injection in the cyst has limited success and surgical excision with removal of the pedicle connecting the cyst to the joint is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 14 , 39 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Intramuscular cysts arising from the neurilemma\n\n【28】When ganglions in intra-neural locations occur within the sheaths of peripheral nerves, they are called nerve sheath ganglions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 12 \\]</u>. Nerve sheath ganglions are most commonly found in peroneal or tibial nerve in the lower limb 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 40 \\]</u> or ulnar nerve in the upper extremity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 11 \\]</u>. This type of intramuscular ganglion is called an intramuscular cyst arising from the neurilemma. The etiology of these nerve sheath ganglions is controversial. Patel et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 \\]</u> reported a case of fascicular posterior tibial nerve involvement by a ganglion cyst in the calf, which they presumed was a perineural pseudoganglion cyst, and agreed with the hypothesis that repetitive nerve compression was the etiology. However, some cases in the literature do not involve clear differentiation between intramuscular cysts arising from the PTFJ and intramuscular cysts arising from the neurilemma, and they were believed to be the same entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\- 15 \\]</u>. These cysts usually present as tender masses with pain or numbness in the distribution of the affected nerve, due to nerve compression and nerve involvement. Similarly, MRI can be used to document the cystic nature and extent of the mass. In addition, electromyographic examination can also reveal the involved nerve as well as the extent of nerve damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 40 , 42 \\]</u>. A complete surgical removal of the cyst is the most reliable treatment. However, safe removal of the ganglion cannot be achieved without compromising the nerve’s integrity. Therefore, incising the cyst wall, drainage of the gelatinous contents and injection of steroids to prevent recurrence, while leaving the cyst wall left open, appeared to be effective in treating these cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Intramuscular cysts arising from the PVNS\n\n【30】PVNS, which was first described by Jaffe et al in 1941 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 43 \\]</u>, is rare, with an annual incidence of 1.8 cases per million 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 \\]</u>. It is a benign but aggressive pathology of the synovium, often localized to the knee joint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 45 , 46 \\]</u>. It is characterized by synovial proliferation and hemosiderin deposition inside the joints, tendon sheaths, and bursae. Granowitz et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 47 \\]</u> further sub classified them into diffuse and localized types, and the diffuse type is reportedly more common than the localized type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 \\]</u>. Similarly, its etiology is also controversial. The clinical presentation includes periarticular pain and swelling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 45 \\]</u>. MRI is the best imaging method for diagnosis, but definitive diagnosis can only be confirmed by pathological biopsy. The management of PVNS includes open surgical excision and arthroscopic synovectomy, which have been reported to have a high rate of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 48 , 49 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Extra-articular spread of PVNS in the knee joint has scarcely been reported. Tatari et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 50 \\]</u>, Gokhale et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 51 \\]</u> and Tosti et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 52 \\]</u> each described a case of PVNS in the popliteal fossa presenting as a popliteal cyst, and concluded that the disease had originated in the knee and spread to the popliteal space. However, after a thorough systematic literature review, we found that this is the first case report about intramuscular cysts at proximal calf arising from the PVNS. In this case, the patient’s primary clinical manifestation is pain in the knee joint and swelling due to PNVS of the joint, without any symptoms of an intramuscular cyst. MRI provides a clear image of the cyst’s location and communication between the cyst and knee joint. Compared to intramuscular cysts arising from a different etiology, this type of cyst has a thickened wall with low signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. Due to the absence of clinical manifestations, we did not perform any clinical intervention for the cyst. However, in case of compression of the adjacent nerve and vessel or limitation of the range of knee joint movements, we suggest that both arthroscopic synovectomy and cyst excision are necessary.\n\n【32】In conclusion, depending on the origin of intramuscular cysts, they were divided into the following five types: intramuscular cysts arising from the muscular tissue, knee joint, PTFJ, neurilemma and PVNS. The therapy varies based on the origin; hence, it is important to identify the origin of the cyst.\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors are grateful to the staff of the Department of Orthopedics, Beijing Shunyi District Hospital for their valuable assistance with in collection of the patients’ medical records.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None of the authors has any potential conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:35:04", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:35:30", "cost": 26.264}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:35:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:34:55"}

It is known to be due to the exposure of the root surface as a result of apical migration of the gingival margin from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It may appear to be clinically as localized or generalized. This can occur with or without loss of attached tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Several such factors have been implicated in GR etiology: anatomical, physiological, pathological and traumatic, and they may occur together coincidentally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. The common traumatic lesions in the oral cavity may be chemical, thermal or physical in nature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5-7 \\]</u>. However, the physical trauma is more severe, predominant and can implicate the deeper periodontal tissues.\n\n【3】One type of these physical injurious traumas is the self-injurious behavior (SIB). This behavior refers to repetitive acts that cause physical damage to the individual without any intent to die but for purposes unacceptable socially 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. It may occur as a solitary confined action or as a recurrent phenomenon, whether intentional or not. However, such behavior is relatively widespread manifestation of mental disorders, emotionally unbalanced personality, developmental disabilities, and some other syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. It is usually due to psychic nature, mutilation, mental conflicts and emotions such as hate, jealousy, frustration, feelings of inferiority, etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】Sometimes the traumatic gingival injuries are called gingivitis artifacts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These gingival injuries occur as a result of scratching, rubbing or picking the gingiva using the fingernail, or using abrasive objects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 13 \\]</u> where patients are aware of their damaging behavior but cannot stop it. Such cases seem to be much more common in children than in teenagers and adults and frequently in female patients with emotional disturbances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. The management of such cases is a challenge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> in the dental clinic as the main cause is not dental in origin.\n\n【5】This report describes a case with SIB that caused an unusual self-inflicted gingival lesion. She was suffering from depression; her behavior caused bilateral recessions in both right and left mandibular canines. The periodontal treatment involved removal of the causative agent (the harmful behavioral habit), the potential ramifications of this habit are discussed, and the steps necessary to ensure and preserve the dental health were taken, including oral hygiene instructions and the scaling and root planning then the periodontal surgical procedures using the acellular connective tissue allograft (Alloderm <sup>® </sup> ) were performed for root coverage.\n\n【6】Aim\n\n【7】Our purpose was to highlight the adverse effect of the destructive ability of the psychological SIB to the gingiva and illustrate how these habits may affect the success of the treatment.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 15-year-old girl was referred to the Department of Periodontology Clinics, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University, Egypt for evaluation and treatment of bilateral GR related to mandibular canines.\n\n【10】The medical and dental histories were taken and revealed that she was systemically and dentally healthy. She reported that the first time she noticed this recession was 8 months ago and it progressively worsened. The patient suffered from continuous burning pain in lower labial gingiva related to the lower canines. She also complained of pain and sensitivity in this area during drinking and also while coming in contact with food. She also reported that there were white membranes that were easily removed from the lower labial gingiva by her fingernails, resulting in red painful and bleeding areas.\n\n【11】Her parents stated that they had visited four physicians and the patient had taken systemic antibiotics without any improvement. Upon questioning, the patient concealed of doing any habits. Then latterly, as a result of a frank and friendly conversation with the patient, she admitted of scratching her gingiva by her fingernails for long periods since her parents started having the traumatic problems of their divorce procedures. The patient further stated that she became emotionally depressed and irritable. She believed that no one gave any attention to her and she felt neglected. This explained the clinical consequences of her harmful behavior.\n\n【12】Periodontal evaluation\n\n【13】On clinical examination, none of these clinical features existed: high frenal attachment, traumatic overbite and bruxism secondary to premature tooth contact. The gingiva in both regions had an ulcerated appearance of edematous, reddish margins extending to alveolar mucosa. There were white, yellowish membranes that were slightly removed by gauze leaving very painful erythematous bleeding areas. Minimal plaque deposits were noticed .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. (a, b) Recession class II Miller’s classification with ulcerations extending to alveolar mucosa related to the mandibular canines. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【15】The periodontal evaluation revealed Miller’s class II 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u> GRs on the facial surface of both mandibular canines, extending 9 mm apical to the CEJ in the left mandibular canine and 8 mm apical to the CEJ in right mandibular canine, a narrow zone of attached gingiva (1 mm) and no loss in height of the mesial and distal interdental papillae. There was no GR associated with adjacent teeth .\n\n【16】On radiographic examination using periapical radiographs, no evidence of proximal bone loss in the mesial and distal aspects of the affected teeth was found.\n\n【17】The causative habit\n\n【18】The patient explained that her habit was of using her index fingernails of both hands, pushing the mandibular canines gingiva in a downward direction at the same time. She added that she liked to scratch the mucosa beneath the canines until bleeding.\n\n【19】Treatment consideration\n\n【20】After the diagnosis of self-inflicted gingival lesions and the patient’s harmful behavior, the patient and her family were taught and became aware of the squeals of her self-inflicted injury. She comprehended the effect of her scratching habit and how much damage it would cause to the gingiva and she was also convinced to discontinue this habit. She was asked to trim her fingernails, replace her old toothbrush and avoid the use of abrasive pastes to evade any harmful effect on the gingival tissue. She was then referred to a psychiatrist for evaluation, discovering, treatment and elimination of this behavior. The behavioral treatment included awareness training to sensitize the patient to the occurrence of this behavior, teaching the patient how to face and deal with her apprehensive attitude, giving alternatives rather than nail scratching and follow-up social support.\n\n【21】The first steps in the periodontal treatment of the GR were taken. Scaling, root planing and polishing were done. Oral hygiene instructions were given, including the flossing and the brushing procedures, using an extra soft toothbrush with a technique starting apically on the gingiva and gently sweeping coronally with the toothbrush. Chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% rinse was prescribed twice daily for 2 weeks to decrease the mucosal inflammation and infection. The patient started to improve and her pain decreased considerably .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. (a, b) Ulcerations and inflammation were resolved after periodontal treatment. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【23】After 4 months of progressive psychological treatment and periodical dental re- evaluation visits, it was affirmed that the patient was in a stable psychological state and willing to have root coverage surgery. We started the periodontal surgical treatment for the purpose of restoring the esthetic appearance of the GR and increasing the attached gingiva zone. We decided to use the acellular connective tissue allograft (Alloderm <sup>® </sup> ) for root coverage to avoid palatal graft donor surgical site.\n\n【24】Before incision, a very careful root planning was done to the root surface by Gracey’s curettes to remove plaque, calculus, and soft tooth structure. Any gross irregularities and prominent root eminences were smoothed by fine diamond bur and the sites were rinsed with a sterile saline solution. The exposed roots were conditioned by burnishing it with tetracycline (100 mg/mL for 4 min). Two split mucoperiosteal flaps were done by scalpel blade no. 15C (Hu-Friedy). Horizontal incisions were made at the level of CEJ corresponding to the base of adjacent papilla, and then vertical incisions were placed from line angles of neighboring teeth extending apically beyond the mucogingival junction in trapezoidal design . The acellular dermal matrix allograft (Alloderm) was dehydrated with a sterile saline for 10 min according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. The alloderm was trimmed and adjusted to fit the recipient areas at the CEJ.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3. (a, b) The split mucoperiosteal flaps were done from the base of interdental papillae of both sides. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【26】First, interrupted sutures were performed to secure the allograft in its position at the base of the mesial and distal papillae using resorbable 5-0 chromic gut sutures in an interrupted configuration. The intact papillae helped the Alloderm to be stable in the surgical sites  and the flaps covered the entire graft and were sutured tension free. Periodontal dressing was applied to surgical sites to protect the wound and increase stability of the surgical site during the healing process.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 4. (a, b) The application and suturing of Alloderm to the base of papillae of the left and right mandibular canines. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【28】Amoxicillin, 500 mg, three times a day for 7 days was prescribed and analgesics were prescribed as needed. A gentle ice pack was applied immediately after surgery on a 20-min intermittent basis for the first 24 h on both sides. She was advised to eat a soft diet for the next 2 weeks. After 7 days, the periodontal dressings were removed. The patient was recommended to use cotton applicators saturated with chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% on the surgical sites and avoid scratching or trauma to the surgical sites. Excellent results were predicted as the patient was so co-operative and had the willingness to get the periodontal surgery done.\n\n【29】Clinical observation and results\n\n【30】After 7 days postoperatively, the patient was asked to come every week for re-evaluation and irrigation of the surgical sites. The healing was progressively good and the gingival appearance started to become harmonious with the other teeth showing the maturation of Alloderm graft . Then, the surgical site was covered again with periodontal pack to avoid any risk of infection.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 5. (a, b) Normal postoperative healing, whitish color was related to epithelial sloughing and homogenisty indicated good expections. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【32】At the 1-week later review, she came back to our clinic with unexpected results; there were no gingiva coverings on the facial part of canine’s roots. The final clinical picture was the same as of the first one before the periodontal surgery.\n\n【33】Upon asking about the cause for her baleful attitude towards the root coverage treatment and its healing, she gave a wondering expression as if she did not know what had happened to the surgical site. She then admitted that she had removed the periodontal pack and started the SIB again. She did not feel any guilt. The patient was again shown the damage she had caused to the gingiva and requested her to stop her injurious behavior and referred her to the psychiatrist for advanced retreatment. We advised the patient to complete the follow-up visits for her re-evaluation. Unfortunately, she did not continue the follow-up visits and refused her psychiatric re-treatment. Consequently, the failure of the whole periodontal treatment could be predicted.\n\n【34】Regarding the psychological explanation, the main cause of the patient’s harmful habit was due to her volatile emotions towards her parent’s conflicts and her weak personality to face such problems, and self-harm became a response to her profound emotional pain that could not be resolved in a more functional way. It was concluded that the relapse and continuity of this habit were due to her excessive attention seeking and the addiction of causing trauma.\n\n【35】Discussion\n\n【36】The SIB is usually of a psychic nature, originating from mental or emotional disturbance. The most common ones are stress, anxiety and depression. However, this behavior has been recorded intensely in the past several decades. Although neither a hard nor a soft oral tissue is excluded from the harmful effects of these psychological influences, the gingiva is the most affected tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】The treatment of SIB is very problematic as its management includes both the dental and the psychological approaches. This type of behavior is more persistent with the conventional treatment as it is usually associated with an emotional disturbance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. It is seriously influenced by the patient’s ability to discontinue his behavior and to make a conscious obedience of his treatment.\n\n【38】Also, there are no standard techniques to prevent or treat self-inflicted injuries. The treatment is planned according to the case’s circumstances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. The lesions may persist longer and may relapse after curing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Therefore, several challenges need to be overcome; otherwise, the treatment could be complicated by their negative attitude and the lack of their compliance.\n\n【39】In this reported case, the teenage girl had a compulsive habitual fingernail scratching, which caused GRs in both mandibular canines. This case has highlighted and broadened the causative spectrum of GR. However, if the periodontal findings were presented with local factors (e.g. plaque, calculus, developmental teeth defect), the case could have been misdiagnosed.\n\n【40】After 7 days of good healing outcomes, her incessant injurious habitude despite her knowing of its harmful effect on the gingiva has affected the case in stabilization and interrupted the gingival healing, resulting in the failure of the whole periodontal treatment.\n\n【41】Conclusion\n\n【42】Before treatment of any oral mucosal lesion, it is advisable to recognize the main cause of the lesion without excluding any suspected reason to avoid persistence or recurrence of the lesion.\n\n【43】Taking a proper patient history, proper periodontal evaluation, enrollment, all factors of the GR, awareness regarding the incidence of these habitual factors even in the presence of other obvious etiology is mandatory, otherwise misdiagnosis and mistreatment will be the consequence. Psychotherapeutic counseling and early detection of the cause is the first step for management of periodontal patients with SIB. The severity of gingival artifacts is related to degree and periods of stress and anxiety. The prognosis and treatment success are completely dependent on their compliance, willing attitudes and conscious change of their behavior.\n\n【44】The psychological treatment success totally affects the prognosis and achievements of periodontal treatment in such cases. Therefore, the SIB is considered as one of the risk factors in periodontal clinic.\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent and verbal approval were obtained from the patient’s parents.

However, these invasive treatments are expensive and generally not available or possible to the greater majority of those who suffer from CD, e.g. in developing countries.\n\n【3】The efficacy and tolerability of oral pharmacotherapy for CD is poorly documented.

However, neither controlled data of oral pharmacotherapy of CD, nor reports of sustained full remission were published 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Thus, it was unclear if any effective and safe oral pharmacotherapy for CD exists, and if it is possible to cure all symptoms of CD with an oral pharmacotherapy.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Herein, I report of the recovery of a 48-year-old woman who has now been symptom-free nearly 4 years during treatment with topiramate, after previously suffering from rotational lateral CD during 29 years. The patient’s symptoms begun at the age of 12 with head tremor. Her lateral, left-sided rotational dystonia began when she was 15, and increased in both social and stressful situations, and during physical activity. Her grandmother had suffered from a similar dystonia. In her twenties, the patient also suffered from social phobia, anxiety, borderline and depressive symptoms and alcohol dependence, while her dystonia was misdiagnosed as a panic disorder, and treated with amitriptylene/chlordiazepoxid and benzodiazepines. She used citalopram (up to 45 mg) and moclobemide (150 mg) temporarily but suffered from restlessness, agitation and hypomanic symptoms during them. At the age of 34, a diagnosis of CD in the Clinic of Neurology of the Central Hospital was a relief to the patient. However, her symptoms did not respond significantly to any pharmacotherapy, including botulinum toxin injections which she received regularly during 1 year. The patient achieved some relief only from benzodiazepines and alcohol.\n\n【6】At the age of 42 her lifetime health care documents were reviewed in a forensic psychiatric examination, and the patient was diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder, alcohol dependence and benzodiazepine dependence. MRI study revealed no structural brain abnormalities. The left-handed patient suffered from postural and rotating left-sided CD and a slight cervical tremor; cervical muscular hypertrophy and pain, and dysphagia due to the distortion of the esophagus. She also had daily headache, and both paranoid and depressive delusions. In the forensic psychiatric hospital administration of olanzapine resulted in metabolic syndrome. Ziprasidone could not be used because of akathisia, increased tremor and an urge to twist her body. These symptoms increased in the evenings, as well as the symptoms of CD. Clozapine (150 mg/day), administered since September of 2010, relieved paranoid symptoms. Topiramate (up to 150 mg/day) was administrated as an adjuvant since August of 2011, to replace lamotrigin. Unexpectedly, the rotating and postural symptoms subsequently disappeared within less than 2 months during the increase of the dose up to 150 mg/day, and gradually also the muscular hypertrophy, cervical pain, daily headache, tremor and dysphagia recovered. During some weeks the patient still felt while swallowing as if there now was a curve in her esophagus.\n\n【7】The patient has now been symptom-free from the dystonia after nearly 4 years of topiramate 150 mg, clozapine 175 mg, fluoxetine 15 mg and bisoprolol 2.5 mg per day. In stressful situations, she still has very slight tremor in hands, but no abnormal movements or positions. Gradually, also her delusions and social fears have subsided. The patient is very happy of her recovery. She wishes that an article of it would encourage research and help others who suffer from this painful and distressing disorder.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】This case demonstrated that some patients recover from CD and remain asymptomatic for years during treatment with topiramate. It was possible to follow the previous development of the symptoms of CD from the detailed health care data collected for the profound mental state examination in a university clinic. The author has examined the patient and discussed with her regularly since her admission to a forensic psychiatric hospital, and documented her symptoms during 6 years. No postural or rotating symptoms have relapsed this far.\n\n【10】The role of clozapine in this recovery was unclear. A small non-controlled pilot study (n = 10) reported that clozapine decreased clonic symptoms of CD but had no effect on torticollis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In the present case clozapine (150 mg/day) was administered without any effect on CD during 11 months before the administration of topiramate. In theory, it may have had some adjunctive effect on the clonic component. The small dose of fluoxetine (15 mg/day) administered 2 months before topiramate may have increased the concentration of clozapine and topiramate in the serum. However, fluoxetine was not likely to be involved in the improvement of CD after the administration of topiramate. The patient had previously used other SSRIs without any relief of the CD. It had increased restlessness, and 45 mg citalopram/day had induced manic symptoms.\n\n【11】The pathophysiology of involuntary movements in dystonia and chorea, essential tremor, myoclonus and restless legs syndrome has been associated with a reduction of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurons in the basal ganglia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The reduced output results in thalamo-cortical system disinhibition, which releases the cortical motor areas generating the normally suppressed movements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Changes in the patterning or synchronization of basal ganglia output, as well as dopaminergic system dysfunction in the basal ganglia, may be involved in some hyperkinetic disorders, and also in schizophrenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Topiramate, a sulfamate-substituted monosaccharide, modulates both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission, as well as voltage-gated ion channels or intracellular signaling pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The efficacy and tolerability of topiramate has been reported with several randomized controlled studies for many neurological and psychiatric disorders, e.g. for some epileptic disorders, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and migraine, essential tremor, vascular generalized chorea, and as an adjunct to clozapine in treatment resistant schizophrenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7-9 \\]</u>. It has been used since 1990s for some forms of epilepsy and for migraine. There are reports of improvement of cluster headache, schizo-affective disorders, bipolar disorder, bulimia and neuropathic pain syndromes during treatment of topiramate. Clinical evidence suggests the usefulness of topiramate also in some hyperkinetic disorders, i.e. essential tremor, chorea, restless legs syndrome and myoclonus. It has also reduced symptoms in single cases of spinal myoclonus and Tourette’s syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The only case report of improvement of dystonia demonstrated a marked improvement of the symptoms of a primary cervico-trunco-brachial segmental dystonia of a 46-year-old man whose CD had already responded to botulinum injections during 11 years. During 2 months treatment with topiramate (up to 200 mg/day) his trunk and upper limb dystonic component, trunk flexion and action-induced wrist extension improved considerably. The dystonic symptoms deteriorated after discontinuation of topiramate because of angle closure glaucoma, weight loss and word-finding difficulty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】This case demonstrates that some patients recover from CD during treatment with topiramate, and remain asymptomatic for years. This is in accordance with the pharmacodynamic mechanisms of topiramate, the pathophysiological mechanisms of involuntary movements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, and with the clinical evidence of topiramate in some other hyperkinetic movement disorders with similar pathophysiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. It would be important to conduct randomized controlled studies of topiramate in CD, and to define the subgroups who may benefit from it.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study was supported by Niuvanniemi Hospital, Finland.

In the emergency department he was febrile, tachycardic, and hypertensive, with a Glasgow coma score of 7. He developed seizures requiring benzodiazepines and intubation.\n\n【4】He was given benzodiazepines and dexmedetomidine for agitation and suspected serotonin syndrome. An epinephrine drip was briefly required for hypotension. Lactate level initially peaked at 2.6 mEq/L 16 h post-ingestion. He also became hemodynamically stable and creatinine decreased from 1.45 to 1.04 mg/dL.\n\n【5】The patient then developed a new lactic acidosis about 30 h after admission, which rose to 8.5 mEq/L . Initial mixed venous saturation (S <sub>v </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> ) was normal (46-72%) but later unexpectedly rose to 93%; this coincided with peak lactate. At this time he had an arterial total O <sub>2 </sub> concentration (TO <sub>2 </sub> c) of 19 mL O <sub>2 </sub> /dL blood (vol%), and an elevated venous TO <sub>2 </sub> c of 17.8 vol%; the arterial-venous oxygen content difference (AVDO <sub>2 </sub> ) was therefore 1.2 vol%, much lower than expected , indicating impaired oxygen utilization. The patient developed multiple organ dysfunction, including hypotension, oliguria and increases in creatinine and hepatic transaminases. This change was presumed to be caused by a defect in aerobic metabolism, despite adequate substrate delivery. To manage this metabolic uncoupling, thiamine 100 mg daily, levocarnitine 100 mg/kg/day divided every 8 h, and coenzyme Q-10 (CoQ-10) 120 mg every 8 h were given for 14 days. Additional treatments included N-acetylcysteine (NAC), per acetaminophen toxicity protocol, and one session of plasmapheresis with 2 L 5% albumin and 2 L fresh frozen plasma as replacement.\n\n|  Figure 1.

Other markers of organ injury and dysfunction also improved.\n\n【9】The patient’s serum levels of 25-I were 25.1 pg/mL before plasmapheresis and 30.6 pg/mL after. The concentration of 25-I in the pheresis fluid was 20.1 pg/mL. 25-I was also detected in the urine at admission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.

However, the late development lactic acidosis and multi-organ dysfunction has not been reported. This second phase of illness was successfully managed with a novel combination treatment strategy to target metabolic uncoupling and promote drug clearance with plasmapheresis.\n\n【12】Lactic acidosis is most often caused by inadequate substrate delivery, type A lactic acidosis, with cardinal features of poor perfusion and low S <sub>v </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> . Our patient had a high S <sub>v </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> and no signs of hypoperfusion, suggesting adequate substrate delivery with decreased oxygen uptake by tissues; the low AVDO <sub>2 </sub> is congruent with this. The patient had signs of end-organ dysfunction, rising creatinine and transaminases, oliguria and hypotension. This is most consistent with type B lactic acidosis, caused by a defect in the aerobic metabolism pathway leading to anaerobic metabolism, decreased ATP production and lactic acidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.

Co-Q10 is part of the oxidative phosphorylation chain in the mitochondria. These vitamins support aerobic metabolism in the mitochondria.\n\n【14】Free-radical mediated injury may occur as a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.

Patients’ Characteristics |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】MTSCC of the kidney is a rare and a recently described tumor. Until now, less than 60 cases have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It occurs in adults, predominantly in women and is typically detected as an asymptomatic renal mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Two of our patients had an asymptomatic tumor. On ultrasonography and computed tomography, the tumor is well-circumscribed and contained in the renal capsule. Grossly, MTSCC is usually a well-circumscribed tumor which presents as a single firm, homogenous, gray to brown mass at cut surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. All our cases had a well-circumscribed growth on computed tomography scan and on macroscopic examination. The histological diagnosis of MTSCC is based on the criteria established by the WHO classification system. The tumor is composed of cuboidal cells arranged in microtubules and long cords making abrupt transition to spindle morphology. These structures are arrayed in a mucinous or a myxoid stroma that reacts strongly with alcian blue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Nuclear atypia and mitoses are rare in both cuboïdal and spindle cells. Because of the presence of compact tubular architecture, focal papillations and mucin production, the MTSCC has some morphological similarities with papillary renal cell carcinoma particularly type 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This tumor can also be confused with the papillary renal cell carcinoma with sarcomatoid change, but in the MTSCC, spindle cells are arranged in parallel bundles with eosinophilic cytoplasm and low grade nuclei 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Immunohistochemistry is not helpful in discriminating between papillary renal cell carcinoma and MTSCC and the morphological interpretation is still important in the distinction between these tumors. MTSCC of the kidney must also be distinguished from metanephric adenoma which shows cells having less cytoplasm and appears as a cellular blue tumor on microscopy; but the latter is usually negative for EMA and cytokeratin 7. The renal MTSCC has a relatively indolent behavior and the prognosis is favorable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In our cases, none of the patients developed recurrence or metastases with 31 months' mean follow-up. In summary, MTSCC of the kidney is a rare and distinctive subtype of renal cell carcinoma that must be differentiated from papillary renal cell carcinoma, especially with sarcomatoid change, which has a much poorer prognosis. Recognition of this histological variant is important because it can be mistaken for other neoplasm potentially resulting in suboptimal therapy.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflict of interests.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 09:59:43", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:00:49", "cost": 65.604}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:00:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 17:59:42"}

The majority of FD cases are found between 10 and 30 years old, have the same prevalence rate in males and females and show variable radiographic features in relation with the level of maturation, which determines of the imaging characteristics. FD can be monostotic or, more rarely, polyostotic. This case is of particular interest due to the late presentation as an incidental finding, considering that this entity is more commonly seen in the first two decades of life.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 66-year-old female, with medical history of pituitary macroadenoma treated with surgery in 2017, in periodical control, gave no history of hearing loss, pain or tinnitus. Post-surgical high-resolution CT scan demonstrated a focal expansion of the left petrous temporal bone with complete sclerosis of the mastoid air cells. The middle ear cavity, ossicles and external canal were uninvolved. In comparison, the right temporal bone appears well pneumatized with no apparent abnormalities. Diagnosis of monostotic fibrous dysplasia was made based on the above findings .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

FD represents 2.5% the bone lesion and 7% of benign bone tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It was first described by McCune and Bruch and Albright et al in two different articles in 1937 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. FD has various clinical presentation groups such as the monostotic (70%), polyostotic (30%) and the McCune-Albright syndrome (3%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. More frequently, the FD was observed in patients between 10 and 30 years old, and the distribution rate between male and female is 2:1. A race predilection has been observed, with Caucasians comprising 80% of all cases, African-Americans 2% and Asians 1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The McCune-Albright syndrome is more common in females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】FD and McCune-Albright syndrome arise from activating missense mutations of the GNAS gene, which encodes the α-subunit of the Gs stimulatory protein (Gsα). Mutations which occur post-zygotically resulting in a mosaic pattern of disease were shown to dramatically upregulate RANKL expression, consistent with the increased levels of osteoclastogenesis (RANKL promotes osteoclast differentiation and ultimately leads to increased bone resorption) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Polyostotic FD affects many bones usually on the ipsilateral side of the body, is relatively rare, and in some cases, is called the Jaffe type. When the polyostotic form of FD, cutaneous pigmentation and no regulated hyperfunction of one or many endocrine glands are observed, we find the presence of McCune-Albright syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\- 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Craniofacial involvement is found in only 10% of cases of the monostotic variety with the following order of involved bones: frontal, sphenoid, ethmoid, maxillary, mandible, zygomatic, occipital and temporal. Temporal bone involvement is very rare, with less than 60 cases being reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. It usually involves the external auditory canal, although it may also involve the middle ear, jugular foramen and more rarely, extend into the otic capsule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】The patient’s symptoms aligned with the location of the lesion, led by atypical facial pain, headache, nerve compression and sinus symptoms. In the case of FD in the temporal bone, the most reported clinical findings are conductive hearing loss and obstruction of the external auditory canal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Barrionuevo et al classified fibrous dysplasia of the temporal bone into the following three stages according to the progression of the disease: stage 1, latent phase; stage 2, symptomatic phase; and stage 3, complication phase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】High-resolution CT is the examination of choice if fibrous dysplasia is highly suspected. Homogenous ground-glass density, loss of the trabecular pattern and asymmetrical thickening of the cortical wall are the typical manifestations. CT attenuation coefficient values vary between 34 and 513 Hounsfield units in the different series, in relation with the amount of fibrous and osseous tissue and the rate of bone deposition, leading to three major imaging patterns: pagetoid (56%), sclerotic (23%) and cystic (21%) types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\- 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】The differential diagnosis of bony lesions of the temporal bone includes Paget’s disease, which presents with diffuse involvement of the temporal bone and calvarium. Ossifying fibromas, which have a well-demarcated border on CT imaging, can also mimic the cystic pattern of fibrous displasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. The rate of variation to malignant tumor is higher in monostotic craniofacial disease (0.05%). Osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma and chondrosarcoma are the most prevalent malignant tumors reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Conservative treatment is recommended initially depending on the extent of the disease, the patient disability experienced as a result of the hearing loss and surgeon expertise. Middle ear exploration and/or tympanomastoidectomy may be needed to manage extension of the disease into the middle ear and mastoid cavity or to manage complications such as colesteatoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】Monostotic FD of the temporal bone is rare, has no symptoms or may present with different neurological signs. The diagnosis depends mainly on the imaging exams (X-ray, CT or CBCT), but clinicians must be aware of the potential diagnosis even if no symptoms are observed. The treatment, in most cases, is conservative; surgery is only indicated in cases of the patients who develop complications, oto-neurological symptoms or improve cosmetic demands.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:34:37", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:34:57", "cost": 19.925}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:34:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:34:37"}

This syndrome may constitute a diagnosis dilemma since it has a diverse spectrum of clinical manifestations, its etiology is not fully understood and it can mimic a variety of conditions including aseptic meningitis, meningoencephalitis, migraine with aura and stroke.\n\n【2】The syndrome is a triad of transient focal neurological deficits, headache and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Knowledge about this disorder is important because its self-limited nature and favorable outcome make other therapeutic interventions, besides symptomatic treatment, largely unnecessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 31-year-old Caucasian man, an employee in a transport company, was asymptomatic until 2 weeks prior to admission when he started complaints of moderate continuous, holocranial, pulsating headache associated with mild nausea, without other symptoms. On the second week of headache, he recalled sudden onset of dysarthria and paresthesias in the right upper limb and face and was admitted at the emergency department (ED). Besides the smoking habits (0.5 packs per day), past medical history was irrelevant, and he denied hypertension, diabetes mellitus, trauma, alcohol and illicit drug use.\n\n【5】On the initial evaluation at ED, his vital signs were normal and he was conscious, with dysarthria and right arm paresis (manual muscle test score 4/5) without any other deficits or signs of meningeal irritation. He underwent a brain CT scan that excluded any ischemic or hemorrhagic lesions. While at the ED his clinical condition rapidly deteriorated: obnubilation, aphasia, right hypoesthesia (NIHSS 10), so it was decided to perform thrombolysis with alteplase. Despite treatment, the patient did not recover deficits and within 1 h an episode of tonic movements and myoclonus was documented. CT angiogram was performed and no significant changes were present. He was started on antiepileptics, ceftriaxone, ampicilin and acyclovir. Lumbar puncture (LP) had been delayed for 24 h, since he had recently performed thrombolysis.\n\n【6】Workup revealed normal blood count. Serum electrolytes and renal and liver function tests were also within normal range, inflammatory markers were low (PCR 24.3 mg/L), urine toxicology screen was negative, and X-ray and urine analysis were unremarkable. In less than 12 h since the onset of the symptoms, he had a complete reversal of all deficits, and eventually became asymptomatic in 3 days. Electroencephalogram (ECK) was normal and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, a decreased and delayed perfusion to the entire left hemisphere . LP revealed 484 cells with mononuclear predominance (98%), normal glucose (0.74 mg/L) and slightly elevated protein concentration (0.52 g/L). The opening pressure was not measured. CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HSV1 and 2, EBV, CMV, Varicella-Zoster, Enterovirus, Mycoplasma pneumonia , Chlamydophila pneumonia , West Nile, Borrelia and Toscana was negative. CSF bacterial, mycobacterial and micologic cultures were negative.

Autoimmune study and serologic tests for HIV, hepatitis, syphilis, CMV, EBV, herpes simplex 1&2, Borrelia, toxoplasmosis, Chlamydia pneumonia and varicella were also negative. Repeated ECK was normal and the patient was discharged on day 10 with levetiracetam 1,000 mg twice a day. At this time, HaNDL had already been considered and the patient was counseled and oriented to follow-up by neurology.\n\n【9】Two days after discharge, he developed a similar clinical picture, with dizziness, paresthesia in the right upper arm, dysarthria and headache. He was brought to the ED and recovered completely 30 min after admission. Neurological exam was normal. He repeated LP that was similar to the previous one, the opening pressure was normal and MRI did not reveal any of the previous changes. Levetiracetam was slowly tapered and the patient remained symptom-free at 12 weeks of follow-up. Given the presentation (clinical picture, imaging and CSF studies), the subsequent similar and self-limited episode and having excluded other causes, a final diagnosis of HaNDL was made.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】With this clinical case, the authors pretend to draw attention to this entity that is frequently underdiagnosed and can lead to high cost imaging studies and non-innocuous interventions such as broad-spectrum antibiotics and thrombolysis.\n\n【12】As for the patient presented, it is most frequently seen in young adults (15 - 40 years) and is characterized by recurrent episodes (1 to more than 15) of headache and neurological deficits that last from a few hours to 3 days and are separated by symptom-free intervals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Unlike migraine, it has male predominance, a lack of personal or familiar history of migraine and a prodrome of viral infection in about one-third of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Etiology of HaNDL is not yet fully understood. Most studies suggest infectious, vascular and autoimmune mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Currently, the main hypothesis is that this process is secondary to an activation of the immune system due to an infectious/inflammatory process, which activates the trigeminovascular system, leading to the development of focal neurological symptoms by a mechanism similar to the neuronal spreading depression seen in migraines with aura 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The most common transient neurological findings are hemisensory disturbances affecting mainly the face and distal upper limb (78%), followed by motor aphasia and motor disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 8 \\]</u>. In more than 80%, the deficits are confined to the dominant hemisphere 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Trunk and leg involvement, visual symptoms, acute confusional state and epileptic seizures are rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】An LP is essential for diagnosis, since CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis (range 10 - 760 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> ) is a constant feature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Elevated CSF opening pressure can be present in up to half of the patients and CSF protein is usually elevated with normal glucose 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 9 \\]</u>. Bacterial, viral, fungal and serological studies of the CSF must be negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Our patient was submitted to three LPs that showed progressive improvement as expected due to the clinical resolution.\n\n【16】Our patients’ MRI revealed a decreased and delayed perfusion to the entire left hemisphere that resolved in a few days. Though normal neuroimaging is usually present, non-specific abnormalities are occasionally seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 10 \\]</u>. As previously described in HaNDL, CT or MRI perfusion techniques may show temporary global hemispheric hypoperfusion that correlated with neurologic deficits in acutely symptomatic patients .\n\n【17】Given the self-limited nature of the disease and favorable outcome (with all patients recovering by 3 months), therapeutic interventions other than symptomatic treatment of the headache are largely unnecessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】HaNDL is one of the most frequent stroke mimics and probably not as rare as commonly thought. After exclusion of other significant pathologies that require specific therapeutic measures, in a patient with headache accompanied by recurrent neurological disorder episodes, CSF pleocytosis and normal imaging tests, HaNDL syndrome should always be considered. It has a good prognosis since this monophasic, self-limiting condition runs its course usually within a few months from onset, without any neurological sequelae.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:54:53", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:55:14", "cost": 20.371}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:55:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:54:52"}

The patient has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes for 4 decades, systemic hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and stage 3 chronic renal insufficiencies. He had no history of smoking, alcohol, drug use, or any neurologic problems. Electrocardiography findings showed nonspecific ST and T wave abnormalities and an echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fracture of 25% with segmental wall motion abnormalities. His significant laboratory values showed a creatinine of 2.45 mg/dL, a b-type natriuretic peptide of 1,480 pg/mL, and elevated cardiac biomarkers with a creatinine kinase-MB of 28.2 ng/mL and troponin I of 11.08 ng/mL.\n\n【4】Coronary angiography showed severe three-vessel coronary artery disease. Due to his multiple comorbidities and decompensated heart failure, he was felt to be too frail for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He underwent successful, uncomplicated three-vessel drug eluting stenting with a good result. He was treated with aspirin, prasugrel, furosemide, and atorvastatin. He did well overnight with no further chest pain, and improved dyspnea. His blood pressure and heart rate remained stable.\n\n【5】On hospital day three after good diuresis, he was started on carvedilol 6.25 mg twice a day for hypertension and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Within 6 hours of carvedilol administration, the patient developed acute symptoms of delirium including agitation, disorientation, aggression, and generalized confusion.\n\n【6】A non-contrast brain computed tomographic scan showed no hemorrhage or acute stroke. Laboratory studies showed no evidence of a metabolic abnormality, and his renal function continued to improve, with his serum creatinine decreasing to 1.37 mg/dL. The patient’s carvedilol was stopped after the second dose, as no other source could be identified. Twelve hours later, the patient’s delirium completely resolved and he was alert and oriented.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Delirium associated with β-blocker use can result in symptoms such as confusion, disorientation, agitation, aggression, and visual and auditory hallucinations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 6 \\]</u>.

Here we describe a patient with thrombi in an otherwise normal carotid artery and left ventricle, which is a previously unreported site for thrombosis in patients with IDA. Our case exemplifies a new site for thrombosis in IDA and indicates that patients with IDA may present with simultaneous thrombosis at separate sites.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 45-year-old woman presented with left hemiparesis. Three years before admission she was diagnosed with IDA, which was attributed to menorrhagia; however, she did not take medication and was otherwise healthy. She experienced headache and left hemiparesis upon awakening and was admitted to the hospital. Her blood pressure was 122/80 mm Hg, pulse rate regular at 90/min and anemic conjunctiva. She was alert but slightly agitated. Neurological examination revealed left hemiparesis and left hemispatial neglect, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed right frontoparietal infarction. MR angiography revealed occlusion of the distal branches of the right middle cerebral artery, and MR venography revealed normal dural sinuses. The electrocardiogram was normal. Hemoglobin was 6.0 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume 65.3 fL, platelets 573,000/µL, serum iron 19 µg/dL, total iron-binding capacity 497 µg/dL, transferrin saturation 3.8% and ferritin 1.6 ng/mL. Protein S, protein C, antithrombin III and antiphospholipid antibody values were normal, indicating the absence of thrombophilia.\n\n【4】The next day, transthoracic echocardiography revealed a mobile thrombus in the left ventricle apparently attached to the chordae tendineae of the mitral valve . Chamber size, wall motion and cardiac valves were normal. Carotid ultrasound revealed a mobile thrombus attached to the wall of the right internal carotid artery . There was no detectable atherosclerotic lesion with a maximal intima-media thickness of 1.0 mm. She was treated with aspirin, clopidogrel and argatroban (a direct thrombin inhibitor) as well as iron supplementation. Her symptoms resolved after 2 weeks, and no thromboembolism occurred after admission.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

On day 11, transesophageal echocardiography did not detect a cardiac thrombus; no septal defect or patent foramen ovale was present, and the thoracic aorta was normal. On day 14, transthoracic echocardiography revealed no left ventricular thrombus.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】IDA is implicated as a cause of stroke or systemic thromboembolism, and epidemiological studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u> revealed that IDA is more prevalent in patients with stroke compared with controls. Moreover, when IDA is associated with stroke or a systemic embolism, large thrombi are sometimes present in an apparently intact carotid artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 9 \\]</u> as in our present case or less commonly in the aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. These patients are young women 20 - 50 years of age with severe IDA (Hb 5.5 - 10 g/dL), which is often caused by menorrhagia. More important, they have no known cardiovascular disease. These common features, taken together with the characteristics of our present patient, suggest that IDA plays a causative role in certain young patients with stroke rather than as a risk factor.\n\n【10】The present case reveals that the left ventricle represents a new site for thrombosis in patients with IDA. In the absence of detectable cardiac disease, left ventricular thrombosis is rare and described only anecdotally. Many of these patients have prothrombotic disorders such as protein C deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, protein S deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, essential thrombocythemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u> and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>; however, there are no reports of patients with left ventricular thrombus associated with IDA. Because our patient had no other detectable prothrombotic disorders, we concluded that IDA was the sole cause of left ventricular thrombosis. Moreover, since left ventricular thrombosis is rare in the absence of cardiac disease, such a thrombus may be overlooked, particularly when it is small or less mobile. Conversely, when the thrombus is large and mobile, it may be indistinguishable from cardiac myxoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\- 17 \\]</u>, and this diagnostic uncertainty may lead to surgery. In our present patient, the thrombus was distinguished from myxoma by its relatively small size and its resolution after treatment. Therefore, it is important to recognize IDA as a cause of left ventricular thrombosis to avoid unnecessary surgery as well as to identify the embolic source.\n\n【11】The characteristics of our present patient, taken together with those of others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 11 \\]</u>, suggest that in patients with IDA, a thrombus may be formed proximally from the left ventricle to the carotid arteries. In view of Virchow’s triad for thrombosis, it is surprising that a massive thrombus was formed in apparently intact large arteries such as the aorta or carotid where the blood flows without stagnation. A fortiori, thrombosis in the normal left ventricle appears surprising. How a thrombus is formed at such sites is unclear, although reactive thrombocytosis may be involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 18 \\- 20 \\]</u>. Further, Akins et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> speculate that thrombosis may be caused by endothelial injury, which in turn is caused by turbulent blood flow. They state further that the Reynolds number may exceed the threshold for turbulence because IDA decreases viscosity and increases blood velocity. The Reynolds number, which equals rVd/n, where r is the radius, V is the velocity, d is the density and n is the viscosity, explains why IDA induces turbulence by decreasing viscosity and increasing velocity. Moreover, this may explain why thrombi are often formed in large arteries because the Reynolds number is proportional to the radius of the artery.\n\n【12】We detected thrombi in our patient’s proximal internal carotid artery and left ventricle. When a cardiac embolus lodges in carotid arteries, it usually leads to the occlusion of the distal intracranial internal carotid arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. On the contrary, the thrombus in our patient was loosely attached to the proximal internal carotid wall without occlusion, which suggests in situ thrombosis rather than embolism. Therefore, we believe that the thrombi were formed independently in the carotid artery and left ventricle. There is a report of thrombosis at separate sites in only one patient with IDA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u> who presented with simultaneous arterial and venous cerebral infarctions, although other prothrombotic coagulation disorders were present. The present patient indicates that a thrombus can be formed simultaneously at separate sites and serves to emphasize the importance of careful investigation to detect the embolic source.\n\n【13】In the present and previous cases, treatment included anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy and iron supplementation. Our patient’s thrombi were undetectable 8 - 11 days after treatment was initiated. Similar early resolution, as early as 7 days, was observed in other patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 11 \\]</u>. Although no randomized trials were conducted, these treatments are reasonable and appear effective.\n\n【14】In some patients with stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 , 23 \\]</u> or with systemic embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u> associated with IDA, no embolic source was found, although they share features similar to ours, specifically young women with menorrhagia, very low hemoglobin level and without cardiovascular disease. In these cases, undetected thrombi may have formed in the left ventricle, aorta, or carotid arteries. Early resolution or unexpected sites such as the left ventricle or aorta may explain why thrombi were not detectable.\n\n【15】In addition to arterial thromboembolic disease, IDA is associated with cerebral venous thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 , 25 \\]</u>. Therefore, IDA may contribute to thrombosis by different mechanisms and may be involved in various forms of thrombotic disease. Therefore, IDA should be recognized as an important cause of stroke.\n\n【16】In conclusion, IDA must be recognized as a cause of stroke or systemic embolism, particularly in young patients without detectable cardiovascular disease. In such patients, thrombi can form simultaneously at separate sites, including the normal left ventricle. Therefore, IDA patients should be examined carefully for thrombosis.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All the authors have no conflict of interest related to this study.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:52:00", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:52:09", "cost": 8.856}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:52:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:51:50"}

In both cases, the pain is localized in the surgical field or traumatic area, projected to the innervation territory or referred to a dermatome.\n\n【3】The best known model of postsurgical chronic pain is that related to the amputation of limbs (or part of them) and postsurgical low back chronic pain, also called “failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS)”, located in the surgical site or projected to the limbs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

On the other hand, chronic posttraumatic pain can also arise after nerve damage due to pressure, crush injuries, cuts, lacerations, stretching, bleeding into the tissue surrounding the nerve, irritation produced by foreign material in contact with a nerve, infections, ischemia , by inclusion of nerves in the ligation of an artery, fracture of the bone canal, nerve fibers pressed by nearby structures and in fractures when the fragments are misaligned 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.

This would explain why chronic pain caused by surgery, trauma, and other clinical conditions improves with local blocks.\n\n【5】This study reports two patients with chronic unilateral headaches: the first one with a posttraumatic scar in the parietal region and the other with a postsurgical scar in the mastoid region. In both patients, the headache was ipsilateral to the scar, and it was resolved after an anesthetic block.\n\n【6】Case Reports\n\n【7】Case 1\n\n【8】Investigations\n\n【9】A 34-year-old male was referred by the primary health service for treatment at the Headache Clinic, due to left hemicrania headache for 2 years, with no improvement in the pain with treatments performed. The headache started with low intensity and increased over months. Currently, it was a pressure pain, unilateral, and continuous. In addition of this continuous headache, he described paroxysmal episodes of pain, three to four times a day, stabbing, prickling or throbbing, lasting 1 hour, with sense of restlessness and agitation during the pain, associated with mild nausea, without photophobia or phonophobia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal.\n\n【10】Diagnosis\n\n【11】Posttraumatic headache mimicking hemicrania continua, but there was no response to indomethacin test.\n\n【12】Treatment\n\n【13】The indomethacin was maintained for 2 months at doses between 100 to 200 mg per day, with no response. After that, several therapeutic approaches, pharmacological (e.g. topiramate, amitriptyline) and non-pharmacological, were performed without any clinical improvement, during 2 years of follow-up. On a given day, the patient appeared with shaved hair (he had thick and long hair before) and there was a huge scar from a previous head trauma, which had occurred about 8 months before the onset of the headache. The scar had not been reported in previous consultations. Examining the scar, it was observed small nodules measuring 1 - 2 mm, which submitted to digital pressure, triggered the same lancinating, stabbing pain, which was followed, after minutes, by an increased pain . An anesthetic block was performed, injecting approximately 0.1 - 0.2 mL of dexamethasone 10% and 0.4 mL of lidocaine 2% without vasoconstrictor, in each diagnosed nodule.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Scar from a previous head trauma (case 1). |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【15】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【16】The pain improved, with no relapse, until the return, a month later. The pain triggers had disappeared and finally the patient left the Headache Clinic.\n\n【17】Case 2\n\n【18】Investigations\n\n【19】A 37-year-old male was referred by the primary health service for treatment at the Headache Clinic, with a chronic severe headache, right-sided, with autonomic signs. The patient reported that the headache started 2 years before. It was completely resolved in 1 - 2 months, disappeared for more than a year and then it relapsed. The headache was right-sided, severe, excruciating and usually woke him up in the middle of the night. It was completely improved in 1 - 2 h, but it could be repeated one to three times in the same day, also occurring during wakefulness with the same characteristics and at the same time. He reported that during the attack he was very agitated, with red eye, tearing and, sometimes, a runny nose. The pain has been persisting daily throughout this time. Clinical examination showed a right eye miosis and an important surgical scar from a right-sided mastoidectomy in the past. Some small nodules measuring 1 - 2 mm, and very painful to digital pressure, were present on the edges of the surgical scar. Brain MRI was performed, which was normal.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. Scar from a right-sided mastoidectomy (case 2). |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【21】Diagnosis\n\n【22】The diagnosis was postcraniotomy headache with features of chronic cluster headache.\n\n【23】Treatment\n\n【24】Thus, treatment for cluster headache was instituted, including verapamil 320 mg/day (increased to 480 mg/day) and oral corticoid. There was no improvement with this treatment, nor with the combination of topiramate (150 mg/day) and melatonin (10 mg at night). It was then decided to block the small nodules in the surgical scar with an injection of approximately 0.1 - 0.2 mL of dexamethasone 10% and 0.4 mL of lidocaine 2% without vasoconstrictor in each trigger point.\n\n【25】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【26】It improved until the next follow-up (1 month), allowing the withdrawal of the medications gradually until the interruption. Three months later he returned without headache.\n\n【27】Discussion\n\n【28】Herein two case reports were described with clinical conditions that suggested diagnostic criteria for primary headache (trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TAC)), one of them suggesting hemicrania continua (but without indomethacin response) and the other suggesting chronic cluster headache. Nevertheless, pharmacological treatment for these conditions failed. Instead, there was complete remission of the headache with anesthetic blockade of scar nodules (demonstrated by clinical examination in both patients), one with a posttraumatic scar and the other with a postsurgical scar.\n\n【29】We believe that both patients described in this study presented neuromas in skull scars. Neuromas can be diagnosed in scars by digital pressure (nodules of 1 - 2 mm at the edges of the scars) that trigger intense stinging pain and/or the presence of referred pain (burning, stabbing or continuous) in the areas corresponding to the peripheral distributions of the nerves. On examination, changes in local sensitivity (hypoesthesia, hyperalgesia or anesthesia) can also be verified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Neuromas usually present as a firm, oval, slowly growing nodule no larger than 2 cm. A prominent area visible in the scar may be a characteristic of a neuroma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】In this study, patients did not report pain in the scar itself. They reported headaches with autonomic signs, one with hemicrania continua phenotype and the other with cluster headache phenotype. This situation could be understood considering the possibility of central sensitization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Nociceptive afferents originated in the scar, which can be clinical or subclinical (in these two cases subclinical), reaching the brain, in specific sites, would demodulate the mechanisms related to the pathophysiology of trigeminal autonomic headaches, triggering symptoms phenotypically like the primary headaches; but in this case, they were secondary headaches. Once the nociceptive afferents in the scar neuromas were blocked, the headaches disappeared.\n\n【31】According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, headache related to traumatic scar (first patient) would be classified as “5.2 persistent headache attributed to traumatic head injury”, but it did not meet all diagnostic criteria. It can be better classified as “Appendix (A5.2) persistent headache attributed to traumatic head injury”. The difference between the two proposals, one found in the body of the classification and the other in the appendix, is the time for the onset of chronic persistent headache. Appendix (A5.2) admits that this time may be longer than 3 months. Interestingly, the initial diagnosis was possibly hemicrania continua, but finally there was no response to indomethacin test.\n\n【32】Furthermore, according to ICHD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, the headache related to the surgical scar (second patient) would be classified as “5.6 persistent headache attributed to craniotomy”, without fulfilling all diagnostic criteria. Otherwise, this headache phenotype met criteria for chronic cluster headache (“3.1.2 chronic cluster headache”). Literature review was performed, and it did not report posttraumatic or postcraniotomy headache with the phenotype of TAC.\n\n【33】Regarding treatment, since pharmacological treatment did not improve the symptoms, the option to treat our patients was the anesthetic block of the scar neuromas, observed by physical examination. All diagnosed neuromas were blocked. The response to anesthetic block was described before and it can explain the decision for this conduct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\- 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Previous literature described pharmacological treatment for neuromas, including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, opioids, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, local anesthetics, and calcitonin, which act by inhibiting pain signaling pathways and central and peripheral sensitization. For patients who develop pain that is refractory to pharmacological treatment, alternative intervention is described, such as cryotherapy and spinal cord stimulation, but they are ineffective and may cause undesirable consequences.\n\n【35】Finally, for patients with intractable painful neuromas, surgery may be the best choice. In general, capping the nerve end or covering it with muscle or bone flaps is strongly recommended for all patients with painful neuromas, as this approach not only reduces mechanical stimulation, but also isolates the skin and scar tissue from the neuroma, thus avoiding pain. Another effective treatment includes ligation and restoration of nerve continuity. These cases could be treated surgically from the beginning and the period of patient suffering can be shortened.\n\n【36】On the other hand, postcraniotomy headache can also be treated with sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion or surgical site injection with local anesthetics, corticosteroids, or botulinum toxin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】The treatment proposed in this study was the anesthetic injection of all neuromas identified in the scars, due to our team experience with this treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Although numerous treatments have been proposed for painful neuromas, including prevention techniques, non-surgical treatment, and surgical treatment, none of them are universally accepted and they usually provide incomplete pain relief, inducing side effects. This reflects the frustrating clinical prognosis and high failure rates of all these treatment methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】A previous study was published by our team, describing postsurgical unilateral headaches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Four patients were described (one had a benign brain tumor, two had intracranial aneurysm surgery and one had temporal lobectomy for epilepsy). All of them presented hemicrania after a variable time interval (from 1 month to 9 years). Migraine-like and trigeminal-autonomic symptoms (without criteria for TAC) related to scar neuromas were described.\n\n【39】The limitation of this study was the short follow-up time of the patients. As our university hospital is considered by the population to be the last hope for unresolved problems elsewhere, if patients did not return for a long time, after neuroma treatment for follow-up visits, our conclusion is that the treatment was successful. However, a long-term follow-up would be suitable for these patients.\n\n【40】Conclusions\n\n【41】Chronic posttraumatic and postcraniotomy headache treatment can be a challenge in clinical practice. One hypothesis is that the pain can be caused and maintained by scar neuromas. Otherwise, an active search for traumatic or nontraumatic scars is recommended in all patients with refractory unilateral headaches, and anesthetic blocks for scar neuromas can be effective in treating this pain.\n\n【42】Learning points\n\n【43】The most important conclusions related to this study can be summarized here: 1) Persistent unilateral headaches, with specific or unspecific characteristics, may be secondary to trauma or surgery; 2) An active search for traumatic or nontraumatic scars (from herpes zoster, for example) is recommended in all patients with refractory unilateral headaches; 3) The time interval between the trauma and the onset of chronic pain may be longer than accepted in ICHD; 4) Anesthetic blocks for scar neuromas can be effective in treating posttraumatic and postsurgical headaches.\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent was obtained.</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Karen S.

Presence of psychotic symptoms is also a risk factor for the development of PD dementia and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Recently, new criteria for PD associated psychosis were proposed by an NIH-sponsored workshop. According to these criteria, the diagnosis of PDAP requires at least one of the following features: hallucinations, delusions, sense of presence and visual illusions, occurring with a clear sensorium and a chronic course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In a study patients 43% of 116 PD patients had either hallucinations or delusions, while 60% fulfilled the NINDS-NIMH criteria for PD associated psychosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】These psychotic symptoms are likely to be induced by high doses of antiparkinsonian drugs, but they also can occur intrinsically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Presence of psychotic symptoms significantly alters prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】The psychotic symptoms are often resistant to antipsychotics, and PD patients easily become intolerant to them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Thus, psychosis is an essential determinant of PD prognosis, and its management is one of the most critical issues in the management of PD. There are a few studies about electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) use in PD psychosis and some other non-motor symptoms. Herein, we present a case of PD who had benefitted from ECT against psychotic and motor symptoms.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 42-year-old male patient, who was diagnosed as PD according to United Kingdom Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> since 2008, attended to our clinic with a history of agitation, paranoid delusions and severe insomnia. He was on a treatment of Ropinirole 12 mg/day. Neuropsychological evaluation revealed no cognitive impairment, but just mild memory impairment comprising of secondary attention deficits without primary memory deficits. He had persecutive and paranoid delusions with no insight, and had depressive periods which were not long enough to be diagnosed as depression. His delusions were jealous type, believing that his spouse is cheating in the absence of evidence to support his belief. He also had visual hallucinations as vivid sensation of the presence of a man somewhere in the house. He also reported that he heard his wife had sexual intercourse with that man while the patient was sleeping beside them. Neurological examination did not demonstrate any resting tremor but moderate rigidity of both upper extremities. His axial rigidity was prominent. He also had bradykinesia and micrographia.\n\n【6】After the clinical evaluation, he was diagnosed as PD associated psychosis he was started on quetiapine 25 mg/day with a plan to increase the dose gradually up to 100 mg/day. For the control of mild depressive symptoms, escitalopram 10 mg/day was also added to his treatment. He was scored 4 on the Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HYS), 82 on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) and 47 on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).\n\n【7】Ten days later, his psychotic symptoms worsened and eventually lead to hospital admission. His aggression got worsened and his homicide thoughts became more evident. He got a gun for punishing his wife. Upon his admission to the inpatient unit, his medication was gradually switched to clozapine 100 mg/day as the quetiapine dose tapered off. Escitalopram 10 mg/day and ropinirole 12 mg/day were continued and ECT planned. He received a total of five sessions of ECT, performed on an every other day basis with Thymartron System IV (Somatics, IL, USA). Bitemporal bilateral electrode placement was selected. Anesthesia induction was attained with methohexital 100 - 150 mg IV and succinylcholine 100 - 120 mg IV. Seizure threshold was determined using a dose titration schedule. His motor and psychotic signs showed significant improvement two weeks after. His escitalopram plasma level was found to be 38 ng/mL (15 - 80 ng/mL), clozapine and norclozapine plasma levels were 124.9/144.0 ng/mL (350 - 600 ng/mL). Even though the plasma levels of clozapine were below the therapeutic levels, it was not needed to change the dosage due to his near perfect clinical improvement. His scores on HYS, PANSS and BPRS were 2, 38 and 18 respectively.\n\n【8】Last follow-up appointment with the patient was 6 months after the last ECT and, his scores almost remained the same. Patient is still in our follow-up with planned clinical visits every 4 months.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Researchers are increasingly attending to and characterizing the non-motor symptoms of the disease such as depression, apathy, dementia, insomnia and psychosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Thus, PD is no longer conceptualized as a sole motor disorder.\n\n【11】Previous studies have repeatedly shown that several clinical factors were associated with visual hallucinations and PD associated psychosis, most consistently found being dementia, a longer duration of PD, and/or an older age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In our case, age was extremely young, PD duration was 5 years and there was not any dementia. In this case dopaminergic treatment was suspected as the cause of the psychosis, but reduction on ropinirole dose or switching to another medication was not possible due to worsening of motor symptoms. He responded well to ECT for psychotic symptoms and motor symptoms.\n\n【12】Initial management of psychosis in PD requires exclusion of other organic causes of psychosis such as psychoactive substances, intoxication, medication side effects and endocrine disorders. Delirium should also be excluded if symptoms start acutely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In treatment of PD associated psychosis, anticholinergic medication and dopamine agonists should be reduced. But this dose reduction may worsen the motor symptoms. Risperidone and typical antipsychotics should be avoided due to their increased propensity to cause extrapyramidal side-effects and worsening of motor function. Generally atypical antipsychotics often used initially due to their low risk of extrapyramidal side effects. Quetiapine is usually relatively well tolerated, but it did not work in our case. Olanzapine is an effective choice but it can cause more adverse effects on motor function than quetiapine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Aripiprazole and ziprasidone were also suggested as effective and relatively safe treatment options in PD associated psychosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Clozapine should be used cautiously in view of the risk of agranulocytosis and there is a mandatory requirement for blood monitoring 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】In the literature, there are some studies demonstrating the role of ECT in controlling motor symptoms of PD. The first study describing the use of ECT in the motor symptoms of PD was published in 1947, and since then, it has been suggested in some case reports of patients with PD and comorbid psychiatric illnesses treated with ECT, showing secondary improvement of the motor symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 17 \\]</u>. In a study of Usui et al, the authors mentioned about a course of ECT producing notable improvements not only in PD associated psychosis but also in the severity of PD. The findings of change in regional cerebral blood flow after electroconvulsive therapy suggested implications for dysfunction in the middle frontal region for patients with PD psychosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. In another case on a patient with PD and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). After the ECT, his OCD symptoms and mood improved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. There are few studies on implementation of ECT on patients with deep brain stimulator (DBS), which offer additional evidence about the safety and efficacy of ECT in patients with DBS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Although there is a case report with schizoaffective disorder and anticholinergic refractory neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism manifested a marked increase of parkinsonian symptoms and dystonia after ECT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>, the majority of the published articles suggested that ECT can be used to treat PD associated psychosis, depression, OCD and even though motor symptoms.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Psychosis in PD is common and associated with a range of negative outcomes. Psychosis is a risk factor for the development of PD dementia and mortality. ECT should be considered for PD patients with problems not responsive to medications. However, ECT can increase the risk of delirium, particularly in patients with cognitive impairment.\n\n【17】Declaration\n\n【18】The authors declare no competing interest.

Over the last 3 weeks, the patient would get agitated and would pull the PEG tube out which led to multiple bedside and/or endoscopic PEG replacements. Thereafter, the 28 Fr PEG tube was changed to a Mickey. It is shorter in length, and thus less prone to dislodgement. Specifically, a 24 Fr Mickey was selected as it is the largest diameter Mickey available.\n\n【4】After 28 days of Mickey placement without any issues, the patient presented again to our emergency room with misplaced Mickey tube. On physical examination, the extension tubing was observed coming out of the gastro-cutaneous fistula tract. The diagnosis of internal tube migration into the stomach was considered as the Mickey tube along with the external bumper was not visualized. The abdominal X-ray performed revealed that the contrast filled Mickey balloon was noticed in the stomach . At bedside, an attempt was made to pull the Mickey through the formed fistula tract, but the effort was unsuccessful. Thus, a decision was made to undergo a concomitant esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which revealed that the Mickey tube had migrated entirely into the stomach with the inflated Mickey balloon obstructing the pylorus . The balloon was then successfully deflated with an endoscopic injection needle . The extension tubing on the external surface of the body was then cut, and the Mickey tube was removed completely with the use of an endosnare without any complications through the oral cavity. Subsequently, a new 28 Fr PEG tube was placed and secured in appropriate fashion.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The absence of external bolster (such as in Foley Catheter) and placement of gastrostomy tube in pylorus are risk factors leading to gastric outlet obstruction. An abdominal X-ray or endoscopy usually confirms the diagnosis. It is extremely important to recognize the possibility of tube migration in appropriate clinical settings as delay in recognition may lead to necrosis or ulceration of the tissue. Careful retraction of the tube through the fistula tract, or endoscopic extraction, would solve the problem in majority of the cases.\n\n【11】In summary, if a patient with ballooned feeding tube develops obstructive intestinal symptoms, internal migration should be considered.

This appearance is also mimicked by a cartilage graft, an osteoma of the ossicular chain, and a foreign body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. These conditions should be evaluated because of neighboring organs which are important for hearing, balancing, and facial expression. Therefore, radiologic evaluation is inevitable. In this case the TBCT findings showed that the lesiona were not the part of skin or tympanic membrane itself but scutum.\n\n【8】The eggshell appearance of the scutum probably was due to hyperpneumatization. The normal process of the pneumatization of the temporal bone starts in the last weeks before birth with reduction of the embryonic mesenchyme in the antrum and progresses through infancy, childhood and puberty, when the last part of the petrous apex is pneumatized. Large pneumatization of the temporal squama, extending behind the sigmoid sinus, is considered to be a normal variant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Extensive hyperpneumatization of the temporal and occipital bone usually has been reported in association with pneumatocele, which represents a spontaneous collection of gas, sually air, beneath the pericranium or within the skull. According to the study of Madeline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, the occipitomastoidal synchondrosis remains partially opened into the teenage years or early adulthood, while the other synchondroses of the occipital bone close earlier. The lambdoid suture connecting the occipital and parietal bones and sagital suture were connecting the parietal bones close in the 30s. He thought that these findings explain the development of hyperpneumatization extending into the occipital bone and from it through the lambdoid and sagital suture into the parietal bone. The whole process takes at least 3 decades to reach a maximum stage, leaving only thin tabula interna and external.\n\n【10】There has been a description of variable scutum anatomy such as the scutum “pseudotumor” appearance caused by incomplete pneumatization was seen frequently, and should not be mistaken for mastoiditis or an osteoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.

However, a rare entity called eosinophilic variant of CML (eoCML) can present with eosinophilia without excess neutrophils or basophils.

EoCML typically presents with the involvement of the heart, lungs, and central nervous system. Here, we report a rare and unusual case of eoCML presenting as a liver mass with abnormal liver function tests, which has not been reported in the literature so far.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 26-year-old male with a past medical history of depression and marijuana use presented to the emergency room (ER) with abdominal pain and dyspepsia for 6 weeks. He had no history of liver disease, alcohol abuse, recent travel, itching, changes in bowel habits, weight loss, fever, or chills. Vital signs in the ER were within normal limits. Physical exam was significant for icteric sclera. There was no mass or tenderness on abdominal exam. Complete blood count was significant for leukocytosis of 25.4 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (reference range (RR): 3.6 - 11 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) with an absolute eosinophil count of 18.7 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (RR: 0 - 0.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). His absolute neutrophil count was within normal limits at 3 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (RR: 2 - 7.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), hemoglobin and platelet count were within normal limits as well. Liver function tests were elevated with aspartate transaminase (AST) of 944 U/L (RR: < 37), alanine transaminase (ALT) of 613 U/L (RR: 11 - 61), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 956 U/L (RR: < 126), total bilirubin of 199 µmol/L (RR: 0 - 18), conjugated bilirubin of 122 µmol/L (RR: 0 - 10), and LDH of 1,437 U/L (RR: < 234). Other blood tests, including prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), lipase, renal function panel were within normal limits.\n\n【4】Extensive testing was performed to identify the etiology of liver injury, which revealed negative viral hepatitis panel, normal ceruloplasmin, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels. The IgE level was elevated at 1,706 kU/L (RR: < 100 kU/L). Imaging with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a hypodense mass in the liver involving the porta hepatis and left lobe measuring at 11.5 × 5.8 × 7.5 cm. The spleen was unremarkable and had normal size measuring at 10 × 4.9 cm.\n\n【5】Peripheral blood smear examination revealed marked leukocytosis (due to eosinophilia) without overt dysplasia. There was no increase in blasts or basophils. A concurrent bone marrow examination revealed an increased myeloid/erythroid ratio with marked eosinophilia. There was no morphologic or immunohistochemical evidence of dysplasia, an increase in blasts, nor the presence of B- and T-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms. Special stains for amyloid deposition and infectious organisms (mycobacteria and fungus) were negative. The hematoxylin and eosin stain of the bone marrow biopsy was shown in Figure 1 .

Next-generation sequencing performed on the bone marrow aspirate identified the presence of a p210 BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript. However, mutations for PCM1-JAK2 , PDGFRA/PDGFRB as well as FGFR1 were negative.\n\n【10】Due to a longer turnaround time for cytogenetic studies, the patient was initially placed on steroids for eosinophilia and organ damage, which resulted in severe steroid psychosis. However, once molecular and cytogenetics results were available, the patient was diagnosed with eoCML and started on tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib at 400 mg daily. The patient achieved hematologic remission within 6 weeks of TKI initiation (except an intermittent and very mild increase in eosinophil count). Within 10 weeks of TKI initiation, his liver enzymes (AST, ALT, and ALP), as well as bilirubin, normalized and he achieved 1.92 log reduction on his quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for BCR-ABL (1.2% BCR-ABL/ABL1 ) and IS-score of 0.73 which is within the expected response milestone per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines 通用删除1(英):<u>(NCCN guidelines version 1.2019, CML)</u>.\n\n【11】Repeat ultrasound imaging performed at 14 weeks following initiation of TKI showed mild hepatomegaly at 18.1 cm with reduced penetration (possibly mild fatty liver infiltration) but no discrete hepatic mass.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue, chronic myelogenous leukemia, BCR-ABL1 \\-positive leukemia is defined as myeloproliferative neoplasm presenting with marked granulocytosis in different stages of maturation with a predominance of myelocytes. Usual clinical findings at presentation include fatigue, malaise, weight loss, and splenomegaly.

Cases such as atypical presentation of isolated thrombocytosis without leucocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\- 4 \\]</u> with the sole presence of p190 BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript, absolute monocytosis, and features intermediate between CML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) have also been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\- 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】In the peripheral blood, absolute eosinophilia is defined as > 500 eosinophils/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Eosinophilia has been divided into mild (500 - 1,500/mm <sup>3 </sup> ), moderate (1,500 - 5,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> ), and severe (> 5,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> ) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The term hypereosinophilia was initially introduced in the 2011 Working Conference on Eosinophil Disorders and Syndromes. It was defined as marked and persistent eosinophilia (> 1,500/mm <sup>3 </sup> ) and/or the percentage of eosinophils in bone marrow section exceeding 20% of all nucleated cells and/or the pathologist believes that tissue infiltration by eosinophils is extensive and/or if marked deposition of eosinophil granule proteins is found (in the absence or presence of significant tissue infiltration by eosinophil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Peripheral eosinophilia occurs due to various etiologies, including parasite infestation, hypersensitivity reactions, autoimmune disorders as well as malignancies including hematological malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】HES has been divided into three categories: primary, secondary, and idiopathic. In primary/neoplastic HES, eosinophilic expansion occurs due to underlying clonal stem cell, myeloid, or eosinophilic neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and genetic rearrangements are given a special place in the latest 2016 WHO revised classification of hematological tumors. These genetic rearrangements include genes such as PDGFR-A , PDGFR-B , FGFR-1 , and PCM1-JAK2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (CEL, NOS) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm which results in clonal hyperproliferation of eosinophils and eosinophilic precursors in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and peripheral tissues and is a diagnosis of exclusion. CEL, NOS, is characterized by an absolute eosinophil count of > 1,500/mm <sup>3 </sup> , < 20% blasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow and/or presence of a clonal abnormality, and the absence of other clonal abnormalities that results in eosinophilia- BCR-ABL1 fusion, rearrangement of PDGFRA , PDGFRB or FGFR1 or PCM1-JAK-2 , ETV6-JAK2 , or BCR-JAK2 fusion , and other acute and chronic myeloid neoplasms that could present with eosinophilia, like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with inv通用删除7(英):<u>(16)</u>通用删除11(英):<u>(p13.1q22)</u>; t(1;16)通用删除11(英):<u>(p13.1;q22)</u>, t(8;21)(q22;q22.1), polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, CMML and BCR-ABL1 \\-negative atypical CML 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Secondary HES is a reactive, polyclonal proliferation of eosinophils in response to eosinophilic cytokines seen in parasitic infections, certain solid tumors, hematologic neoplasms like T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, systemic mastocytosis, and lymphoblastic leukemia. Systemic mastocytosis may be associated with the clonal proliferation of eosinophils 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】A rare entity called a lymphocytic variant of HES (L-HES) presents as persistent eosinophilia due to cytokine release by aberrant T cells. It is defined as a clonal proliferation of abnormal memory T cells. Symptoms mimic Sezary syndrome with predominant dermatological manifestations. Less commonly, superficial lymphadenopathy, rheumatological, cardiovascular, and pulmonary involvement are documented. The most common aberrant immunophenotype associated is cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) <sup>- </sup> , CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells. These cells are proven to release interleukin-5 (IL-5), which eventually causes HES. However, identification of IL-5 levels in the blood is not a routine practice in making this diagnosis. Though there are no definitive diagnostic criteria for L-HES, findings like abnormal immunophenotypes on T cells like CD3 <sup>- </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> , CD3 <sup>+ </sup> CD4 <sup>- </sup> CD8 <sup>- </sup> , CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD7 <sup>- </sup> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, T-cell clonality on PCR studies, rarely occurring cytogenetic abnormalities like 16q breakage, partial 6q, 10q deletion and trisomy 7 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>, increased serum IgE levels, polyclonal hypogammaglobinemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels by PCR are considered in the diagnosis.\n\n【19】Idiopathic HES includes conditions where there is tissue damage as a result of eosinophilia with no known etiology and diagnosed after excluding primary and secondary causes of HES as well as the L-HES. Whereas the term idiopathic hypereosinophilia is used when all the above criteria are met without evidence of tissue damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Tissue damage by eosinophilia, in general, is thought to be caused via degranulation. Few cases reported include endomyocardial fibrosis and multiple thromboses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 17 \\]</u>. In a case report from India, a patient presented with recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis and eosinophilia secondary to BCR-ABL fusion gene.

Rare presentations like digital ischemia have been reported as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】In HES, a thorough workup including blood and bone marrow microscopic examination, flow cytometric analysis, cytogenetics, and molecular studies, should be performed to assess clonality after ruling out secondary causes.\n\n【22】The literature has documented very few cases with isolated eosinophilia without neutrophilia or basophilia with associated BCR-ABL1 rearrangement termed as eoCML. EoCML is reported to be a rare presentation of CML, which differs from other forms of HES and CEL, NOS by the presence of BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangement and splenomegaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\- 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】In classic cases of CML, various scoring systems are used for the prediction of prognosis. The most important factor is a response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in all three areas: hematological, cytogenetic, and molecular. Overall, the response for TKI in chronic phase CML is excellent. As the studies have shown, dasatinib and nilotinib have a better and faster response than imatinib. A retrospective cohort analysis performed by Jain et al on patients with chronic phase CML taking imatinib 400 mg, imatinib 800 mg, dasatinib and nilotinib showed overall 5-year outcomes of failure-free survival (FFS) 70%, transformation-free survival (TFS) 92%, and overall survival (OS) 93% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】There is limited literature published so far and no definitive data about the prevalence of eoCML.

The anesthetic agents identified as possible neurotoxins include either γ-amino-butyric-acid (GABA) agonists including the volatile anesthetic agents, benzodiazepines, barbiturates and propofol or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists such as nitrous oxide or ketamine. Although spinal and regional anesthesia are acceptable alternatives and have seen increased use in an attempt to eliminate the concerns of such problems, many surgical procedures may not be amenable to regional anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】We report a 3-year-old boy presenting for excision of an enlarging left ear cyst. During the preoperative visit with the surgeon, the patient’s mother expressed concerns regarding the potential neurocognitive effects of general anesthesia. General anesthesia was provided using a combination of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil. Previous reports of the use of this unique combination of agents are reviewed and its potential role in this scenario was discussed.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】Institutional Review Board approval is not required for presentation of single case reports at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (Columbus, OH). The patient was a 3-year-old, 14 kg boy who presented for excision of a left ear cyst that had been enlarging over the past 11 months. His past medical history included varicella, parainfluenza respiratory infection, hand-foot-mouth disease, and a single episode of a febrile seizure at 17 months of age. There was no past surgical history. The patient had no ongoing co-morbid conditions and he was not taking any regularly scheduled medications. Preoperative physical examination revealed a young child in no acute distress. Preoperative laboratory evaluation was normal. The patient was admitted on the day of his surgery. During the preoperative surgical visit, the mother had expressed concerns regarding the potential neurocognitive effects of general anesthesia. These concerns were based on information from various internet sites and the media. Based on these concerns, it was decided to proceed with a general anesthesia using dexmedetomidine and remifentanil. Two options were presented for obtaining intravenous (IV) access including either a brief exposure to sevoflurane and nitrous oxide or a topical anesthetic cream with awake IV cannulation. The mother chose brief exposure to sevoflurane; however, premedication with oral midazolam was declined. The patient was held nil per os for solids for 6 h and for clear liquids for 4 h prior to surgery. The patient was transported to the operating room and routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were placed. Preoperative hemodynamic data included blood pressure (BP) 90/58 mm Hg and heart rate (HR) 97 beats/min. Seventy percent nitrous oxide in oxygen was administered via face mask for 60 s followed by the administration of 8% sevoflurane. Peripheral IV cannulation was achieved within 2 min and the nitrous oxide and sevoflurane were discontinued. Dexmedetomidine (1 µg/kg) and fentanyl (1.5 µg/kg) were administered intravenously over 1 - 2 min as a bolus dose and a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was placed. Dexmedetomidine and remifentanil infusions were started at 1 μg/kg/h and 0.2 μg/kg/min, respectively. To ensure an adequate depth of anesthesia, a bispectral index (BIS) monitor was placed. Due to technical problems, only intermittent readings were able to be obtained, ranging from 40 to 60. Sensory nerve supply to the ear was blocked by local subcutaneous infiltration with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine (1:200,000). Spontaneous ventilation was maintained throughout the case with an inspired oxygen concentration of 40-50%. Intraoperatively, the HR varied from 90 to 130 beats/min. The BP was well maintained during the intraoperative course (BP: 70 - 100/40 - 50 mm Hg). No abrupt changes in oxygen saturation or end-tidal carbon dioxide were noted. The remainder of the intraoperative course was unremarkable. The surgical procedure lasted approximately 70 min. At the conclusion of the procedure, the dexmedetomidine and remifentanil infusions were discontinued. The wake-up time from the completion of the surgical procedure to removal of the LMA was 1 - 2 min. The patient was transported to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). The remainder of his postoperative course was uncomplicated and he was discharged home on the same day.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Dexmedetomidine is an α <sub>2 </sub> \\-adrenergic agonist which initially received approval by the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999 for the sedation of adults during mechanical ventilation. In 2009, it subsequently received FDA approval for monitored anesthesia care (MAC). Although only FDA approved for use in adults, dexmedetomidine has been shown to be efficacious in several different clinical scenarios in infants and children including sedation during mechanical ventilation, procedural sedation, supplementation of postoperative analgesia, prevention of emergence delirium, and treatment of withdrawal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. However, to date, there are limited reports of its use as the primary part of a general anesthetic regimen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12-14 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】Beneficial and protective effects on the central nervous system during hypoxia or ischemia have been demonstrated with dexmedetomidine in animal studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15-19 \\]</u>. Unlike agents that act as GABA agonists or NMDA antagonists, animal data have demonstrated limited impact on apoptosis and neurocognitive outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 21 \\]</u>. In addition to its lack of pro-apoptotic effect, dexmedetomidine has been shown to decrease the pro-apoptotic effect of the volatile anesthetic agent, isoflurane, in laboratory animals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 21 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】Remifentanil is a synthetic opioid derivative that was introduced into clinical practice in the United States in 1996 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. It has a strong affinity for μ opioid receptors with less affinity for other opioid receptors (κ and σ). Its potency and respiratory depressant effect is generally considered to be twice that of fentanyl. However, its half-life is significantly shorter due to modification of its chemical structure with the incorporation of a methyl-ester ring into the molecule thereby allowing its hydrolysis by non-specific plasma and tissue esterases. These characteristics result in a unique pharmacokinetic profile with a rapid onset, easy titration by continuous infusion, and a short context-sensitive half-life with rapid elimination across all age ranges, including neonates. These characteristics make it a valuable agent for the provision of intense intraoperative analgesia with a rapid recovery regardless of the dose or duration of the infusion. Furthermore, the opioids have been shown in laboratory animals to have limited pro-apoptotic effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2-5 \\]</u>. In particular, remifentanil has been shown to have neuroprotective effects during ischemia in laboratory animals and potentially the ability to blunt the pro-apoptotic effects of other agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23-25 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】In our patient, the mother had requested the use of “neuro-safe” medications given her concerns following her reading of articles from the internet and publications from the lay press. As such, we chose a combination of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil, two medications which have been shown in laboratory animals to be free of pro-apoptotic effects. When choosing this anesthetic, several concerns were encountered including whether premedication with midazolam should be used given concerns regarding benzodiazepines and their agonism at GABA receptors. Although our common practice includes the use of oral midazolam for anxiolysis to prevent separation anxiety, alternatives include parental presence or the use of other distraction techniques to avoid the need for such medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 , 26 \\]</u>. Alternatively, although onset times may be longer than oral midazolam, both oral and intranasal dexmedetomidine have been used for premedication prior to anesthetic induction.\n\n【10】Another aspect of concern was the technique for IV cannulation as this is usually performed following the induction of general anesthesia with sevoflurane in pediatric patients. After discussion with the mother, it was decided to proceed without premedication, but to briefly administer nitrous oxide with sevoflurane to allow for placement of an intravenous cannula. Alternatively, use of a topical anesthetic cream may provide an alternative for awake venous cannulation without the need for sevoflurane or nitrous oxide. The presence of an IV cannula would also allow the preoperative administration of IV dexmedetomidine which may be used to facilitate parental separation and transport to the operating room.\n\n【11】Following placement of the IV cannula, the sevoflurane was discontinued and a bolus dose of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine was administered followed by placement of an LMA. Maintenance anesthesia was provided by continuous infusions of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil, which were started at 1.0 μg/kg/h and 0.2 μg/kg/min, respectively and titrated according to clinical need. Given its intense analgesic effects, the remifentanil infusion was titrated to control the hemodynamic response to surgical stimulation and allow for spontaneous ventilation, while the dexmedetomidine infusion was used to provide amnesia and adjusted according to the BIS. Previous reports regarding the use of a combination of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil for general anesthesia are summarized in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 , 27 \\]</u>.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Previous Reports of Dexmedetomidine-Remifentanil for General Anesthesia |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【13】While anecdotal experience suggests efficacy of a combination of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil for intraoperative anesthetic care, potential concerns include lack of significant data demonstrating the amnestic effects of dexmedetomidine, adverse hemodynamic effects, and the potential for prolonged awakening given the longer duration of action of dexmedetomidine compared to other agents. Ensuring adequate amnesia is one of the goals of intraoperative anesthetic care. Although it is accepted as an effective agent for providing sedation and anxiolysis, there are limited data to clearly demonstrate the amnestic effects of dexmedetomidine. In a randomized, cross-over trial, nine adults received either propofol or dexmedetomidine using computer-controlled infusions targeting an effect-site concentration of 1, 2, and 4 µg/mL for propofol or a plasma concentration of 0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 ng/mL for dexmedetomidine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>. Using these graded infusions, the authors then compared the BIS number with the depth of sedation as assessed using the observer’s assessment of alertness and sedation (OAA/S) score. The cutoff values of BIS for an OAA/S score ≤ 2 (a depth of sedation that would ensure amnesia and prevent recall) were obtained by analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves. The median BIS values at OAA/S scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 during propofol sedation were 95.5, 78, 67, 57, and 34, respectively. Median BIS values at OAA/S scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 during dexmedetomidine sedation were 95, 62, 45.5, 39.5, and 24.5, respectively. BIS values were significantly less with dexmedetomidine than propofol at OAA/S responsiveness scores of 2, 3, and 4. With propofol, the calculated cutoff BIS values for an OAA/S score ≤ 2 were 67 (sensitivity of 86%, specificity of 97%, and area under the curve of 0.98). With dexmedetomidine, the values were lower: 46 (sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 91%, and area under the curve of 0.96). Other studies have demonstrated effective amnesia as evidenced by impaired long-term picture recall with dexmedetomidine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 , 30 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Regardless of the anesthetic agents used, adverse effects on respiratory and hemodynamic function may occur. Like all opioids, remifentanil will depress respiratory function in a dose-related manner resulting in respiratory depression and eventually apnea. Higher dosing regimens may require assisted or controlled ventilation. However, when compared to other anesthetic agents such as propofol, there is less impairment of respiratory function with dexmedetomidine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 31 \\]</u>. Adverse hemodynamic effects, albeit rare in the pediatric-aged patient, include bradycardia and hypotension. Hemodynamic effects are more common following bolus dosing, in patients with comorbid cardiac disease, and generally resolve with a decrease of the infusion rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】In summary, we present the use of a combination of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil to provide anesthesia during a minor surgical procedure requiring general anesthesia. The impetus behind such care was prompted by maternal concerns over the potential long-term deleterious effects of general anesthesia on neurocognitive outcomes. Although there remains limited anecdotal experience with such a combination, given the animal data demonstrating a lack of a pro-apoptotic effect, this potentially “neurocognitive safe” anesthetic may warrant further investigation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 13:38:36", "endTime": "2024/09/19 13:40:13", "cost": 97.35}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 21:40:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 21:38:35"}

She denied of an unfavorable lifestyle such as alcohol drinking and cigarette smoking. Her body weight was 56 kg, height was 149 cm, and BMI was 25.22 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . She had completed the GERD questionnaire, including with the severity of symptoms graded on a 3-point Likert scale.

She was further evaluated with the 24 h esophageal pH-metry (Sleuth; Sandhill Scientific, Inc.

The daily acid reflux episodes were 140 times, and the Demeester score was as high as 34.3 (a Demeester score > 14.72 indicates GERD). The detailed results were displayed in Figure 2 . Proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) was prescribed for GERD symptoms, but she lost follow-up then.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

The severity of her reflux symptoms was improved, and the GERD questionnaire results were shown in Figure 1 . She received the 24 h esophageal pH-metry again. The daily acid reflux episodes were 58 times, and the Demeester score was 7.5. The complete results were shown in Figure 2 , too. No additional PPIs were needed based on the minimal reflux symptoms.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】GERD is one of many diseases clearly linked to obesity. The strong positive association between obesity and GERD symptoms has been convincingly demonstrated in several population-based studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2-4 \\]</u>. One previous report found obese participants were 2.5 times as likely as those with normal BMI to have reflux symptoms or esophageal erosions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In a recent meta-analysis, a significant association between gastroesophageal reflux (odds ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.70 - 2.09) and increasing BMI was found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Furthermore, obese patients with GERD tend to own a poor healthy quality of life than others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】One retrospective study, using esophageal 24 h pH monitoring to evaluate the patients with GERD symptoms, found that 13% of the variation of esophageal acid exposure was due to BMI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Another study performed with wireless capsule pH monitoring during 48 h disclosed that an increased esophageal acid exposure was five times higher in obese patients with GERD symptoms than in normal weight patients with GERD symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The pathogenesis of obesity in GERD might be associated with increased intra-abdominal pressure, impaired gastric emptying, decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure and increased frequency of transient sphincter relaxation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Weight gain aggregates the reflux symptoms, and weight loss is beneficial for GERD symptoms. A past population-based study showed that an increase in BMI of more than 3.5 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> in women with normal BMI at baseline increased the risk of GERD symptoms (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.63 - 4.82) as compared to women without weight change. On the contrary, a weight loss amounting to a decrease of BMI of 3.5 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> over a period of 14 years decreased the risk of frequent GERD symptoms by nearly 40% (odds ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.42 - 0.97) as compared to women without weight loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In another population-based study in Spain, the subjects with a weight gain over 5 kg coexists with an increased new GERD symptoms (odds ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.6 - 6.0) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. A hospital-based study found a weight loss of 5-10% in women and > 10% in men, led to a significant reduction in overall GERD symptoms scores 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. However, until now, there was no report discussing the differences of esophageal physiologic examination after body weight loss in the individuals with GERD.\n\n【12】To our patient, the BMI was reduced from 25.5 to 19.81 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> in a 3-year period. Not only reflux symptoms, but also esophageal physiologic acidic reflux numbers, got a marked improvement, and PPIs could be discontinued. Our result provides a firm evidence of the beneficial effect of body weight reduction to obesity patients with GERD, and the optimal is to treat the obesity first, as weight loss improves quality of life, and also decreases all the comorbidities associated with obesity such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, etc.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Body weight loss leads to reduction of both reflux symptoms severity and esophageal physiologic acid reflux in the obese patients with GERD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:16:17", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:16:36", "cost": 19.428}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:16:36", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:16:17"}

His generalized pain did not change during the daytime, and it did not improve or got worse with exercise. This pain was intermittent and he was asymptomatic between episodes. He previously went to two different medical centers, and both centers diagnosed the patient as myalgia and prescibed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and vitamin C. Patient states that his sypmtoms got worse and worse after he took those medications. His past medical history was unremarkable. His family history reveals that his brother’s son was recently diagnosed with G6PD deficiency.\n\n【5】His physical examination was as follows: body temperature: 36.7 °C, blood pressure:130/60 mm Hg with 86 beats/min. Skin examination revealed erythematous and squamataous plaque formations on his elbows, torso and scalp. Peripheral blood smear did show polychromasia but blister cells were not seen.

Because he had G6PD deficiency, he was only prescribed topical treatment. The patient was relieved of all generalized body pain.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】G6PD deficiency is the most common enzyme defect that causes hemolytic anemia. It is transmitted by an X-recessive fashion. Males can be either normal or hemizygous, and females can be normal, heterozygous or homozygous. World Health Organization classifies G6PD deficiency into five variant classes. Class 1 variant has severe enzyme deficiency (< 10%) and chronic hemolytic anemia, class 2 variant has severe enzyme deficiency and intermittant hemolysis, class 3 variant has moderate enzyme deficiency (10-60%) and intermittant hemolysis caused by drugs and/or infections, class 4 variant is normal and class 5 variant has increased enzyme activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 9 \\]</u>. Our patient had class 1 variant enzyme with severe deficiency.\n\n【14】Drug choice for treatment of comorbities in patients with G6PD is of importance. Primaquine, sulfamethoxazole, dapsone, nitrofurantoin, nalidixic acid, and co-trimoxazole are some of the drugs that have definite association with hemolysis. Use of chloroquine, sulfasalazine, mesalazine, acetylsalicylic acid, ciprofloxacin, ascorbic acid and vitamin K analogues, quinine, paracetamol, aminosalicylic acid, probenecid, dimercaprol, nifedipine, sodium nitroprusside, metoclopromide, methylene blue, phenylenediamine (hair dye), napthalene (moth balls) and henna (dye) have possible association with hemolytic episodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 10 \\]</u>. There are no specific papers on drugs used in psoriasis that may have caused hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. Our patient had used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and excessive doses of vitamin C which may have triggered hemolysis.\n\n【15】Patients with G6PD deficiency may present themselves with generalized body pain as well as back pain. Patients may also report increased symptoms after using specific drugs such as ascorbic acid or non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs. Choosing drugs for comorbidites in patients with G6PD deficiency is important and patients need to be followed during their treatment for hemolysis. There are no reported cases of psoriasis along with G6PD deficiency to the author’s knowledge and this patient is believed to have these two conditions coincidentally.\n\n【16】However, deficiency of G6PD was found to be related to other autoimmune diseases. A reseach on Sudanese vitiligo patients revealed an excess deficiency of G6PD compared to the controls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Type 1 diabetic patients with G6PD deficiency also suffer from accelerated microvascular complications such as retinopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. A study on Sardinian population revealed conflicting results, stating that G6PD deficiency showed a trend for protection against proliferative retinopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Another coincidental case of G6PD deficiency with celiac disease was also reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】G6PD enzyme is regulated with the same gene in leukocytes and platelets. When defective, there is also decreased enzyme levels for those cells as well, but they rarely cause clinical manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. Heavy enzyme defects (less than 5%) may cause decreased respiratory burst activity of granulocytes which may present itself as chronic granulatmatous infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. A decrease in G6PD also occurs when the enzyme is deficient in the skin and favizm can be diagnosed from a skin biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】It was also previously suggested that in regions with high frequency of G6PD deficiency psoriasis was uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. It was proven that in patient’s skin involved with psoriasis strong G6PD activity occurred focally in superficial cells of malphighian layer, stratum granulosum and the overlying parakeratotic layer. Uninvolved skin of psoriatic patients and healthy control patients had confined G6PD activity only to pilosebaceous unit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Another paper on in vitro activity of anti-G6PD agents in psoriatic therapeutics stated that most active inhibitor was methotrexate followed by cGMP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Erythrocyte kinetics also change with psoriasis: membrane fluidity decreases and cytoskeleton is impaired. This caused reduced propensity to hemolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Although it is believed that this patient has these two diseases coincidentally, psoriasis and G6PD deficiency might overlap with more serious or more mild clinical tables. However, it cannot be concluded from this case.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We have no conflict of interest to declare.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Sources of Support</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>G6PD: glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase; NADP: nicotineamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NADPH: reduced nicotineamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:26:12", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:26:28", "cost": 16.326}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:26:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:26:02"}

He was diagnosed with early-stage CLL with a 13q deletion in 2006. He was treated for progressive CLL in 2010 with six cycles of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR). He achieved a complete remission but had progressive CLL in 2013 and was re-treated with a further six cycles of FCR. In 2014 he again had progressive CLL and was treated on a clinical trial of bendamustine-rituximab (BR) +/- idelalisib/placebo (drew placebo). He received six cycles of BR and achieved a partial remission. In 2016, he was commenced on treatment with zanubrutinib, a highly selective BTK inhibitor, in a clinical trial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. He responded well with normalization of lymphocyte count, improvement in hematological parameters and resolution of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.\n\n【7】He first noticed mild peri-orbital edema in July 2018 and was reviewed by an ophthalmologist and treated with topical and oral antibiotics without benefit. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit excluded any masses or obstruction. Subsequently, he stopped zanubrutinib in September 2018 for 4 weeks to undergo a Whipple’s procedure for an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm but the peri-orbital edema remained unchanged. In November 2019 the peri-orbital edema increased and focal crusted plaques and erosions developed. He was reviewed by a dermatologist and treated with topical steroids and tacrolimus ointment without benefit. Antinuclear antibody (ANA), creatine kinase (CK) and patch testing for suspected allergic contact dermatitis were negative.\n\n【8】In January 2020 biopsies were obtained from the left suprabrow, right infraorbital, left pre-auricular and left post-auricular regions. The biopsies showed areas of parakeratosis and surface inflammatory scale crust, follicular plugging with demodex mites and focal suppurative infundibular folliculitis and a dense superficial and deep perivascular and periadnexal infiltrate. In addition to small and medium sized lymphocytes, histiocytes and eosinophils, the dermal infiltrate included a population of larger lymphoid cells with nuclear hyperchromasia and pleomorphism. Immunohistochemistry showed these large cells to be positive for CD2, CD3, CD30 and CD56 . These cells were uniformly positive for EBV early RNA by in situ hybridization, with smaller numbers of cells showing latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) staining, but no staining for Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2), consistent with EBV latency pattern II . T-cell receptor ( TCR ) gene rearrangement studies on the tissue revealed monoclonal TCR beta and TCR gamma gene rearrangements.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Bone marrow biopsy revealed low level involvement with CLL and no morphological or immunophenotypic features for an aberrant T-cell population. EBV was detected in the plasma at a low level of 1.39 × 10 <sup>2 </sup> IU/mL. TCR gene rearrangement studies of peripheral blood revealed polyconal products.\n\n【11】Initial treatment consisted of cessation of zanubrutinib, treatment of demodex mites with ivermectin and strict avoidance of sun exposure. There was no significant improvement and he was commenced on hydroxychloroquine 400 mg nocte . After 2 weeks of therapy there was further progression of the facial edema and ulceration and hydroxychloroquine was changed to prednisolone 1 mg/kg. This resulted in rapid improvement with virtual complete resolution of facial edema. Upon steroid weaning, there has been a mild recurrence of facial edema in a focal distribution and the patient remained on prednisolone 10 mg per day.\n\n【12】Concurrent with the diagnosis of HV-LPD, there was progressive deterioration in liver function which had been mildly abnormal since the Whipple’s procedure. Concern the patient may be developing a T-cell LPD in the liver led to a liver biopsy which revealed most portal tracts were infiltrated with CLL. There was no evidence of large cell transformation or HV-LPD. The patient has since been commenced on venetoclax.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Richter’s transformation to a high-grade B-cell lymphoma occurs in around 5% of patients with CLL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>; however, an NK or T-cell neoplasm arising in pre-existing CLL is unusual 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\- 14 \\]</u>. Reports of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) in CLL have been limited to case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. However, a large Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) study has shown that male patients with CLL were found to have an increased risk of developing cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) compared to the general population, with an incidence of 104.2 per 1,000,000 person-years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. The association between CLL and T-cell LPDs is not clearly defined although it has been hypothesized that reduced immune surveillance, defective T cell function from chronic stimulation of cytotoxic T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\- 15 \\]</u> or malignant transformation originating from a common stem cell progenitor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u> could play a role. No direct relationship with previous CLL treatments or EBV infection has been established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】BTK-inhibitors are now standard of care for many patients with CLL and demonstrate improved outcomes compared with chemo-immunotherapy. Zanubrutinib is a potent and selective BTK-inhibitor which has shown to be safe and effective in CLL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Long-term follow-up of ibrutinib, the first in class BTK-inhibitor, in previously treated CLL patients has not found significant safety signals regarding infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. While concerns over invasive fungal infection have been raised and vigilance is required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>, the incidence is relatively low 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 19 \\]</u>. Of note, disseminated viral infections such as EBV do not appear to be an issue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\- 20 \\]</u>. Our patient had previously received treatment with FCR and BR and it can be postulated that the associated immunosuppression may be a risk factor for the EBV viremia and HV-LPD.\n\n【16】The best treatment approach for HV-LPD is not known and indolent cases are usually treated conservatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 7 \\]</u>. Immunomodulating therapies including prednisolone, cyclosporine, interferon alpha, chloroquine and thalidomide have been shown to induce remission and improvement in symptoms but an allogeneic stem cell transplant remains the only curative option in advanced cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Due to the potential risk of HV-LPD transforming to a systemic lymphoma it is important to continue to follow up these patients on a regular basis.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】To our knowledge, this is the first case of HV-LPD occurring in an adult patient with CLL. The relationship between the HV-LPD and CLL is uncertain, though it can be postulated that immunosuppression from prior therapy was a risk factor. Patients with CLL presenting with cutaneous lesions, particularly those with unusual clinical features, should undergo a thorough assessment including biopsy with adequate samples for morphological, immunophenotypic and molecular studies.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patient’s informed consent for publication of this report was obtained.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AC and GC were involved in the treatment of the patient and co-wrote the manuscript.

He had no systemic symptoms, including fever, night sweats and weight loss. He had a 6-year history of hypothyroidism-associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) and maintained L-thyroxine replacement. On physical examination, a large mass was evident in the anterior neck . On palpation, it was an elastic hard, immobile, and nontender mass and the exact border was ill-defined. No superficial lymph node was palpable. The respiratory sound slightly decreased with prolonged expiration bilaterally. On the laboratory, a leucocyte count of 6.1 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> /µL, hemoglobin 15.2 g/dL, platelet count 26.4 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> /µL, lactate dehydrogenase 289 IU/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(110 - 220)</u>, soluble IL-2 receptor 2040 U/mL 通用删除7(英):<u>(145 - 519)</u>.

CT scan with enhancement revealed a large cervical mass arising from thyroid which completely encircled the narrowed trachea . He was immediately referred to the department of endocrine surgery and under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, an incisional biopsy was performed for combined pathology and immunohistochemistry, that led to the diagnosis of DLBCL, with a positive immunostaining for CD10, CD20, bcl-6, but negative for MUM-1.

Other less common histologic subtypes include follicular lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 11 \\]</u>, Hodgkin lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 11 \\]</u>, small lymphocytic lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, T-cell lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. There is a 4 to 1 female predominance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> and the median age at diagnosis is around 60 year-old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】The possible pathogenetic mechanism of developing PTL\n\n【13】The normal thyroid gland originally has no native lymphoid tissue. Thus, PTL is considered to arise from intrathyroid lymphoid tissue acquired during the course of chronic inflammation or an autoimmune process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Pre-existing HT is known for a significant predisposing factor for PTL with an estimated relative risk of 67 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Up to one-half of PTL patients have a clinical history HT, and an even more patients had pathologically diagnosed with HT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. PTL usually develops after a long period of HT evolution as long as 20 - 30 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. It has been postulated that in HT, lymphomatous change susceptible to neoplastic transformation may be due to chronic antigenic stimulation and proliferation of lymphoid tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Recent report supports this theory by showing sequence similarity in immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement between the clonal bands of HT and that of subsequently developed PTL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. In addition, aberrant somatic hypermutation, previously attributed to the development of multiple proto-oncogenesis in other types of DLBCL, may constitute a pathogenetic mechanism of developing PTL by representing an early step in the process of B-cell clonal transformation in patients with HT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Diagnostic procedure of PTL\n\n【15】PTL presents with rapidly growing mass, which can be lethal due to progressive symptoms of tracheal, laryngeal or esophageal compression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Thus, early diagnosis is essential to save the patients. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a valuable diagnostic tool for evaluation of thyroid mass and can be the first test to diagnose PTL as it is less invasive. But, FNA accurately diagnosed PTL in only 60% of patients due to histopathological similarities between PLT and HT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Thus, confirmatory procedures such as incisional biopsy are highly recommended to obtain sufficient material.\n\n【16】The therapeutic options of PTL\n\n【17】Appropriate treatment for PTL depends on histologic subtype or extent of disease. The therapeutic approach for patients with PTL has been revised over the last a few decades. Conservative treatment mainly with combination chemotherapy has replaced thyroidectomy as mainstay of therapy because effective chemotherapeutic regimens have been introduced. Nowadays, surgery is usually utilized to obtain sufficient tissue for diagnosis, not for radical therapy. For DLBCL of the thyroid, basically, treatment should be the same as DLBCL of any other site or extent. In limited DLBCL, three cycles of CHOP plus IFRT had been considered as standard treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Recently, R-CHOP chemotherapy is the gold standard for this type of lymphoma. The addition of rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against the membrane antigen CD-20 found on pre-B and matured B lymphocytes, led to significant improvement in event-free and overall survival (OS) when compared with CHOP alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Even in patients with severe airway compromise, the tumor can be expected to shrink, which provides symptomatic relief, briefly after initiation of combination chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. In limited DLBCL, there are no large randomized trials of R-CHOP plus radiation therapy, while, in phase II study of limited DLBCL, three cycles of R-CHOP plus IFRT led to better outcome of progression-free survival (PFS) and OS at 2 and 4 years when compared with three cycles of CHOP plus IFRT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Our comments of the present case\n\n【19】The prognosis of patients with DLBCL has been estimated using the International Prognostic Index (IPI) (age > 60, stage III/IV disease, elevated LDH level, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥ 2, more than one extranodal site of disease) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. As the present case had an IPI score of 2, he was assigned into ‘low-intermediate’ group, indicating his 4-year OS of 81% with R-CHOP therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. According to revised IPI (R-IPI) which is on the basis of the same parameters but grouped differently as conventional IPI, the present case was assigned into ‘good’ group, indicating his 4-year OS of 79% with R-CHOP therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Recently, immunohistochemical expression of CD10, bcl-6, or MUM1 could classify DLBCL into prognostically significant subgroup with germinal center B-cell(GCB) and non-GCB, and 5-year OS with an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen are 92% in GCB, and 44% in non-GCB, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. In this patient, CD10 and bcl-6, both are GCB markers, were positive results predictive of better OS.\n\n【21】Through our experience obtained from the present case, it should be emphasized that PTL is entirely different from follicular epithelial-derived thyroid malignancy in disease management, and if PTL is clinically suspected, an incisional biopsy of the thyroid grand is highly recommended because combined pathology and immunohistochemistry can aid in confirmation of histopathology or histologic subtypes, making therapeutic planning, and predicting prognosis of the patients.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】In patients with rapidly growing thyroid causing progressive compression symptoms, PTL with B-cell origin should be highly suspected. HT is a significant predisposing factor for PTL. An incisional biopsy of the thyroid grand is highly recommended for combined pathology and immunohistochemistry, which can aid in confirmation of histopathology or histologic subtypes, making therapeutic planning, and predicting prognosis of the patients. In DLBCL of the thyroid, basically, treatment is the same manner as DLBCL of any other site or extent. R-CHOP chemotherapy is a therapeutic mainstay and can dramatically shrink the tumor and briefly resolve the compression symptoms.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 09:52:31", "endTime": "2024/09/19 09:54:20", "cost": 109.174}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 17:54:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 17:52:26"}

In 2019, the number of newly diagnosed myeloma cases is 32,110 in the USA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Differential diagnosis is important due to the frequency of the disease and different forms of presentation. Among the extramedullary involvements of MM, pleural effusion is rare. Although there is no clear consensus on the treatment of myelomatous involvement, the main treatment is MM treatment.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 67-year-old male patient presented with back pain in November 2016. The patient was diagnosed as IgG-kappa MM. Conventional cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies (t(14;20), t(6;14), t(4;14), t(14;16), t(11;14), 11q13, 17p13) were done. Conventional cytogenetic analysis showed 46,XY and del(11q13) abnormality was detected. At the time of diagnosis, diffuse bone lesions were noted. The patient underwent two cycles of bortezomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone, cisplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (VTD-PACE) regimen. In April 2017, autologous stem cell transplantation was performed with partial response (PR). Then, loss of biochemical response was observed and lenalidomide treatment was started. In September 2017, very good partial response (VGPR) provided with lenalidomid and second autologous stem cell transplantation was performed. The patient had progression in December 2018 and no response was obtained with two cycles of carfilzomib. Daratumumab treatment was planned.\n\n【4】While daratumumab treatment was planning, in March 2019, he presented with severe low back pain and blurred consciousness. Shortness of breath developed while being treated. Pleural effusion was detected. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) showed bilateral pleural effusion and atelectasis in the lower lobes and widespread bony lesions. Pleural fluid sampling was performed.\n\n【5】Cytospin centrifuge preparation of pleural fluid and cell block sections showed infiltration of malign plasma cells .

Overall survival of patients who develop EMD is significantly shorter than that of patients without EMD. In general, EMD especially plasmocytomas which are not continuous with a bone structure may indicate tumor independence from marrow microenvironment and a gain of invasion and aggressiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. So, EMD indicates poor prognosis in MM even in the era of novel agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Baseline imaging techniques, such as PET scans and magnetic resonance imaging can document whether EMD is present prior to therapy or at progression. As EMD, pleural effusions are rarely associated with MM and most often the result of a concurrent disease process or coexisting illness (e.g. cardiac failure related with amyloidosis or not, chronic renal failure, hypoalbuminemia, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia or a second malignancy) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Pleural effusion occurs in approximately 6% of MM cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Effusion directly due to myeloma is less than 1%.

Possible causes include invasion from adjacent bone structure, dissemination from plasmocytoma in the chest wall and direct plasma cell infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.

Increased urinary lead excretion after calcium-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Ca-EDTA) administration indicates high body lead stores 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Chelating agents such as Ca-EDTA, D-penicillamine, dimercaprol (BAL) or succimer (meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA) can be used to treat lead intoxication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Here, we present a male patient who developed lead intoxication after working as a painter for 2 months. His main complaints were loss of appetite, constipation and nausea. The main cause of his lead intoxication was probably inhalation of lead particles while stripping anti-rust compounds including Pb <sub>3 </sub> O <sub>4 </sub> from a bridge. His symptoms rapidly improved after chelation therapy with D-penicillamine. This report focuses on the important symptoms for diagnosis of lead intoxication and reviews previously reported cases, including discussion of the difficulty of early diagnosis.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 36-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of increasing fatigue, constipation and nausea. He had been a clerical worker until 3 months before admission, but the bankruptcy of his company had forced him to change jobs. He had therefore started work as a painter 2 months before admission. His main duties were paint stripping and re-painting of a bridge. He wore a helmet, goggles, dust respirator, protective clothing and leather gloves. He started to develop intermittent abdominal pain after 3 weeks and was prescribed scopolamine butylbromide tablets at another hospital, but his pain did not resolve. His body weight decreased from 55 kg to 48 kg over 8 weeks and he complained of persistent malaise, nausea and loss of appetite, and was admitted to our hospital for a detailed assessment. He had no remarkable past history or family history. He was a nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol. He was taking only mosapride and lansoprazole, which had been prescribed at another hospital.\n\n【6】Physical examination on admission revealed that his height was 165 cm, weight was 48 kg, temperature was 37.3 °C and heart rate was 78 beats/min. He was hypertensive, with a blood pressure of 155/84 mmHg. He had moderate conjunctival pallor, gray pigmentation of the gingiva and hyperactive bowel sounds, but no abdominal tenderness. Neurological examination showed no abnormalities. Electrocardiography and chest X-ray were normal, and abdominal X-ray showed increased intestinal gas and constipation . Routine laboratory testing on admission showed normocytic normochromic anemia, mild liver dysfunction, hyponatremia and a high blood urea nitrogen level . His serum iron and haptoglobin levels were normal. His unsaturated iron binding capacity was low despite a high serum ferritin level, suggesting abnormal iron utilization. He had normal serum levels of vitamin B12 (486 pg/mL, normal range: 180 - 914 pg/mL) and folic acid (5.4 ng/mL, normal range: 2.4 - 9.7 ng/mL). His blood smear showed basophilic stippling  and a high reticulocyte count (4.1%). His urinary hippuric acid, methylhippuric acid and 2,5-hexanedione levels were not elevated. We measured his blood lead, chromium and cadmium concentrations because his history suggested possible inhalation or ingestion of stripped paint dust including these heavy metals. His blood chromium concentration was < 2 µg/dL and cadmium concentration was < 1 µg/dL, but his blood lead concentration was high (111 µg/dL, normal range: < 20 µg/dL).\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Laboratory Findings on Admission |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【9】The diagnosis of lead intoxication was confirmed with a positive lead chelation test. We initially intended to administer Ca-EDTA as a first-line chelating agent, but it would have taken about a week to obtain this. Instead, we administered 1 g/day of D-penicillamine orally for a week from day 2. His urinary lead excretion measured from pooled urine samples rose from 0.9 mg/day on day 2 to 5.1 mg/day on day 3, and decreased thereafter . The δ-aminolevulinic acid (δ-ALA) concentration in spot urine samples peaked on day 2 and then gradually decreased. His abdominal pain resolved by day 5, and he was able to tolerate a normal diet by day 10. His constipation improved over the same period. From day 7, his urinary lead excretion measured from pooled urine samples stayed less than 0.5 mg/day, and his δ-ALA concentration in spot urine samples stayed below 15 mg/L. We therefore stopped chelation therapy on day 8. Although his anemia and associated symptoms such as shortness of breath on effort persisted, he was discharged from hospital on day 14, because his hemoglobin concentration was gradually improving. He was moved to the sales department of his company, where there was no possibility of further exposure to lead. His blood lead concentration was 26.3 µg/dL at 1 month after discharge and 15.9 µg/dL at 2 months. His δ-ALA concentration in spot urine samples also normalized to 2.1 mg/L after 2 months. His hemoglobin concentration increased to 10.0 g/dL after 1 month, and returned to normal (14.5 g/dL) after 2 months. His serum ferritin level decreased to 212.3 ng/mL after 1 month and normalized to 69.6 ng/mL after 2 months, and his liver dysfunction resolved after 2 months. The basophilic stippling in his blood smear also resolved after 2 months. He was well at his 1-year follow-up assessment, with no recurrence of plumbism.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. Daily urinary lead excretion (rectangles) and δ-aminolevulinic acid (δ-ALA) concentration in spot urine samples (triangles). The δ-ALA concentration peaked on day 2. Lead excretion increased significantly after administration of D-penicillamine, peaking on day 3. Both parameters gradually decreased after the peak. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】The most common clinical picture of plumbism is of chronic lead intoxication, often due to occupational exposure over a prolonged period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The blood lead concentration reflects lead distribution in the red blood cells and plasma and may be useful for the diagnosis of plumbism, but lead is also distributed in the soft tissues and bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The active pool is distributed in the blood and soft tissues and the storage pool is in the bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The half-life of lead is 35 days in the blood, 40 days in the soft tissues and 20 - 30 years in the bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The blood lead concentration may therefore not be an accurate reflection of previous lead absorption if the exposure is not continuous and ongoing. Moreover, many patients who presented with severe lead poisoning had lower blood lead concentrations (< 40 µg/dL) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, suggesting a need for other indicators for early-stage diagnosis of plumbism. Lead is an electropositive metal with a high affinity for sulfhydryl groups, and inhibits 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and ferrochelatase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. A high urinary δ-ALA concentration or blood zinc protoporphyrin level may therefore be useful for diagnosing lead intoxication, especially in patients with an acceptable blood lead concentration despite symptoms of lead intoxication. Furthermore, re-elevation of the urinary δ-ALA level due to tissue redistribution of lead can indicate the need for additional administration of chelating agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Measurement of the total urinary lead excretion the day after Ca-EDTA infusion (30 mg/kg, up to 2 g) is the most direct method of estimating the total body lead burden, and this test is positive if a 24-h urine collection after chelation contains more than 2.89 µmol (0.6 mg) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In the present case, we administered D-penicillamine instead of Ca-EDTA and the 24-h urinary lead excretion peaked at 5.1 mg/day. Until recently, Ca-EDTA and BAL were the main drugs used for the treatment of lead intoxication in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Both these drugs are not effective when taken orally, and should be administered intravenously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Ca-EDTA is also reported to remove substantial amounts of zinc, an essential metal, from the body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. More recently, succimer (DMSA), a water-soluble analogue of BAL that can be administered orally, has been used for the treatment of heavy metal poisoning including lead, arsenic and mercury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. D-penicillamine is another chelating agent that can be taken orally, but is not as effective as EDTA or BAL, and is associated with serious adverse events including nephrotic syndrome, severe bleeding and leukopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The results of a recent study suggest that the optimal regimen for D-penicillamine administration in lead poisoning is 25 - 35 mg/kg/day in divided doses for 3 weeks, with a gap of 7 days between courses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Two or three courses of D-penicillamine are often needed to reduce the blood lead concentration to an acceptable level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Fortunately, our patient did not develop any complications related to D-penicillamine therapy, and there was no re-elevation of his urinary δ-ALA concentration or blood lead concentration after 7 days of chelation therapy. This suggests that a single course of oral D-penicillamine can provide sufficient chelation of lead in patients with relatively low body lead levels.\n\n【13】A previous review of adult cases of inorganic lead intoxication reported 31 cases due to occupational exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Of these, 29% had no complaints, and the most common symptom in the remainder was abdominal pain, followed by fatigue and arthralgia. All six patients who presented with acute-onset symptoms had abdominal pain. Moreover, loss of appetite and weakness are more common in patients with plumbism than in healthy adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. We searched the PubMed database from 2000 to 2013, and found 10 reported patients with acute-onset symptoms of lead intoxication  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 , 16 \\- 20 \\]</u>. Six of these 10 patients had occupational lead exposure, and nine underwent chelation therapy. The period of lead exposure was reported in only three cases. Although most of the patients had symptoms such as abdominal pain, malaise, headache, nausea and constipation, they did not seek treatment from a hospital or their local doctor while they could still tolerate the symptoms, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. In five patients (cases 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10), abdominal pain led to consultation with a doctor even though preceding nonspecific complaints such as fatigue, malaise and headache had been tolerated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 17 , 19 \\- 21 \\]</u>. None of the reported cases had severe encephalopathy. Routine hematology and biochemistry testing may show anemia, which is typically hypochromic and microcytic and generally appears when the blood lead concentration exceeds 50 µg/dL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Anemia is therefore not observed in all patients with lead intoxication, and bone marrow biopsy does not show specific findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. It should be noted that the hemoglobin concentration was above 10 g/dL in three cases (cases 3, 5 and 6) despite high blood lead concentrations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 15 , 17 \\]</u>. Basophilic stippling, caused by aggregation of ribonucleic acid within erythrocytes due to inhibition of pyrimidine 5’-nucleotidase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 8 \\]</u>, was observed in seven of the cases. Although basophilic stippling was also found in 27% of consecutive internal medicine patients without lead exposure and in patients with thalassemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 22 \\]</u>, it is worth remembering that this finding may indicate lead intoxication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. An elevated urinary δ-ALA or porphyrin level in the absence of urinary porphobilinogen may enable definitive diagnosis of lead intoxication, and diagnostic testing for porphyria is therefore recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 18 \\]</u>. A high blood zinc protoporphyrin level is also useful for diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 19 \\]</u>. Increased serum alanine aminotransferase or creatinine levels may be observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 20 , 21 \\]</u>, but these findings are also nonspecific. In some patients, especially those with no obvious history of occupational lead exposure, diagnosis may be delayed from the time of first presentation with symptoms and it may take several months to start appropriate treatment for lead intoxication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. In case 1, the occasional use of a mug with a ceramic inner surface that contained lead caused intoxication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. In case 8, ingestion of medication purchased online for erectile dysfunction led to acute lead intoxication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. A recent study also reported cases of lead intoxication due to regular use of lead-contaminated opium (case 9) or alternative medications (case 10) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>. Physicians should therefore be aware that lead intoxication can be associated with food preparation or storage habits, medications and opium addiction, as well as occupational lead exposure.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 2. Reported Adult Patients with Acute-Onset Symptoms of Lead Intoxication |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【15】In conclusion, we reported a patient who presented with lead intoxication after 2 months of occupational lead inhalation despite appropriate use of a respirator. Chelation therapy with oral D-penicillamine was effective and his clinical course was good. Abdominal pain is the most frequent symptom in patients with acute-onset symptoms of lead intoxication, and concomitant symptoms are nonspecific for making a diagnosis. Thus, it may be difficult for physicians to make a rapid diagnosis of lead intoxication. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of lead intoxication and the potential causes of plumbism when investigating patients with frequent abdominal pain with no obvious cause.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank Mr. Yousuke Kitadume for his assistance in preparing blood smear samples and Miss Hisae Kuribara for her secretarial assistance under the financial support provided by Social Insurance Gunma Chuo General Hospital.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant Support</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All the authors report no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:05:11", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:05:40", "cost": 29.301}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:05:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:05:10"}

The case consisted of a patient with dysphagia and eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Current epidemiological studies suggest that this disease is more common than previously thought. Noel et al demonstrated that the incidence of the disease in Cincinnati, OH, was 10 out of 100,000 children and the prevalence was 43 out of 100,000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In Australia, the incidence of primary EE increased from 0.05 to 0.89 out of 10,000 between 1995 and 2004 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, it is unknown if this rise is due to a real incidence increase or just better diagnosis.\n\n【3】EE is part of a group of pathological entities that have eosinophilic infiltration; these are known as gastrointestinal eosinophilic diseases (GEDs). There are various theories that try to explain the physiopathological process of sensitization and activation of eosinophils in the esophagus. The first theory consists on an exposure of the bronchi to an aeroallergen, which consequently extends to the esophagus forming an aeroesophageal immune unit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Other theories relate EE to allergen ingestion through food, producing organ sensitization. Blanchard et al demonstrated that patients with EE have an induction of the eotaxin-3 gene (CCL26) which has a chemoattractant effect on eosinophils. They determined that levels of this gene expression directly correlate to the severity of the disease taking into account the number of eosinophils and mast cells as well as their basal layer expansion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【4】EE affects predominantly men between the ages of 20 to 40 on a 3:1 male-to-female ratio. More than 90% of patients with EE present with intermittent dysphagia to solids which could lead to food impaction on the esophagus. They can also present heartburn, non-cardiac chest pain or abdominal pain and vomiting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】Eighty percent of patients with EE have a history of atopic disease. They can also present peripheral eosinophilia and increased serum immunoglobulin E levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【6】Endoscopic alterations of EE consist on longitudinal or annular furrows on a fragile, corrugated esophageal mucosa. Other findings are narrowness, white papules and a diminished caliber on the middle and distal esophagus. Distal erosive modifications, typical of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), are not present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】EE diagnosis must meet the following criteria: symptoms of esophageal dysfunction, more than 15 eosinophils per high-power field (HPF) on the esophageal mucosa and no response to high doses of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or normal pH monitoring results on the distal esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 51-year-old male patient, who suffered from hypertension (treatment with amlodipine 5 mg PO bid), presented with heartburn, dysphagia, regurgitation and retrosternal pain to the emergency department. An upper digestive endoscopy was performed, which reported hiatal hernia and characteristic changes of non-erosive GERD; the stomach and duodenum revealed no abnormalities. The mucosal biopsy of the esophagus showed histopathological changes suggestive of GERD . Colonoscopy was also performed at this time, and it did not reveal any abnormalities. Biopsy samples were not taken from other organs (e.g. stomach, duodenum and colon), as no evidence of alterations was observed on endoscopic studies. The patient was therefore diagnosed with GERD and treatment with esomeprazole and ranitidine was started at high doses. A complete blood count performed at this time showed an eosinophil count of 4% (eosinophil absolute count (EAC): 580 eosinophils/μL).\n\n|  Figure 1. Biopsy of an endoscopically obtained sample of the esophagus (× 10). Note the absence of eosinophils infiltrating the mucosal epithelium. |\n| --- |\n\n【11】During the following 3 months, symptoms worsened which resulted in a 30-kg weight loss. The patient was admitted to the emergency care unit. The eosinophil count at this moment was 1.0% (EAC: 159 eosinophils/μL). An esophagogram showed esophageal motor dysfunction and scarce aperture of the mid and distal esophagus. An esophageal manometry was also performed and reported diffuse esophageal spasm and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) hypertension with incomplete relaxation. Due to these results achalasia was diagnosed and a laparoscopic Heller cardiomyotomy was carried out. During the procedure, biopsy samples were taken from the esophageal mucosa, muscular layer and paraesophageal fat.\n\n【12】The biopsy demonstrated an extensive esophageal wall fibrosis with an inflammatory mixed-cell infiltrate composed primarily by eosinophils, which comprised the muscular layer . Treatment with esomeprazol 40 mg bid and prednisone 50 mg was indicated for 3 months with apparent reduction of symptoms.\n\n|  Figure 2. Biopsy of the muscular layer sample obtained during the Heller cardiomyotomy (× 30). Note the presence of a mixed-cell inflammatory infiltrate, composed primarily by eosinophils. |\n| --- |\n\n|  Figure 3. Biopsy of the muscular layer sample obtained during the Heller cardiomyotomy (× 100). Note the abundance of eosinophils infiltrating the muscular fibers. |\n| --- |\n\n【15】During this time, different diagnostic procedures were carried out. A CBC after discharge revealed an eosinophil count of 12.2% (EAC: 1,172 eosinophils/μL). A skin-pick test (which showed no sensitization to any antigens) and determination of IgE levels were performed and showed no abnormalities (IgE: 87.3 IU/mL, reference values: 20.00 - 100.00 IU/mL). Celiac disease antibodies measured at this time were negative. Stool was examined in various opportunities but there was no evidence of bacterial or parasitic infection. A video capsule endoscopy was performed and it revealed no abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【16】One month later, the patient presented to the emergency department because his previous symptoms had resurfaced. During the interrogation the patient referred having a papulous exanthema on his face and neck before the symptoms appeared which was treated with topical cetirizine. Macular erythematous lesions of the skin were seen on his face. He also referred moderate pain during epigastric palpation.\n\n【17】A superior digestive endoscopy was performed and reported a normal-aspect mucosa, a stomach with abundant food residues in the body and fundus, and an edematous pylorus and duodenum. Presence of fragments of esophageal squamous epithelium with discrete acanthosis and papillomatosis and chronic gastritis in the antrum (with focal epithelial loss and necrosis of the superior third of the mucosa) were also noticed on histopathological analysis.\n\n【18】Owing to the persistence of symptoms, a double-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis was performed. A diffuse concentric thickening of the mid and lower esophagus conditioned a small hydro-aerial level. The esophageal alteration extended throughout the esophagogastric junction to the gastric walls, which had a 1.9 cm thickening in the gastric fundus .\n\n|  Figure 4.

Note the diffuse thickening of the esophageal wall, which impairs the contrast passage through the mid and lower esophagus. |\n| --- |\n\n【20】During his hospitalization, the patient received methylprednisolone 250 mg IV bid with significant improvement 24 h after the initial dose. He was discharged 2 days later with oral methylprednisolone, indicated for 2 months. Eosinophil count at discharge was 4.6% (EAC: 515 eosinophils/μL) . The methylprednisolone was later replaced with oral budesonide 12 mg OD for 4 months and dose was later reduced to 9 mg OD.\n\n|  Figure 5.

Note that the threshold level for diagnosis of hypereosinophilic syndromes (> 1,500 eosinophils/μL) was never reached. |\n| --- |\n\n【22】A control CT scan of the thorax (with oral contrast) was performed 4 months after discharge, and showed diffuse thickening of the esophagus walls from the level of the carina to the gastroesophageal junction, which reduced significantly the organ lumen .\n\n【23】The patient currently receives budesonide 9 mg PO OD and pantoprazole 40 mg PO OD, he is asymptomatic, with good response to treatment and has gained 20 kg since the last medical checkup .\n\n|  Figure 6. Case report timeline. Presented according to CARE guidelines. |\n| --- |\n\n【25】Discussion\n\n【26】The prevalence of EE has increased in the last few years, although it is unknown if this increment is due to a real increase of its incidence or its diagnosis. The classic clinical presentation of this pathology is dysphagia, regurgitation, heartburn, and food impaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. EE is often confused with other pathologies with similar symptoms such as GERD or achalasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】The diagnosis of EE is based on the symptoms, endoscopic findings, alterations in manometry tests and changes seen through image studies. However, the diagnosis is established when eosinophilic infiltration is greater than 15 eosinophils per HPF microscopic evaluation in biopsies of esophageal mucosa of patients who have previously received high doses of PPI and had no positive response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】It is important to emphasize that EE is not the only cause of eosinophilic infiltration; in fact, GERD is the most common cause of it. This is why, it is established that the finding of less than 5 eosinophils leads to the diagnosis of GERD, between 5 and 14 to a mixed condition and more than 15 to EE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Zhao et al reported a case of a mural form of EE accompanied with squamous esophageal cancer. This patient presented dysphagia as the principal symptom. Endoscopic studies evidenced a tumor in the esophageal mucosa, which led to the resection of the esophagus. The biopsy of the resected tumor demonstrated that in addition to the cancer, eosinophilic infiltration in all the layers of the esophagus was also present, predominating in the muscular layer. Due to the histopathological changes, it could be determined that the eosinophilic infiltration preceded the neoplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】There are also other reported cases by Lucendo et al where patients, in addition to having the diagnostic criteria of EE, also presented motor impairments of the esophagus (66%) and manometric changes such as secondary waves and abnormal peristalsis (one case), hypertension and incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (two cases) and incomplete upper esophageal sphincter relaxation (one case). In this study, it was presumed that these disorders could be associated to an eosinophilic infiltration of the muscular layer or the esophageal ganglion cells. Nevertheless, this could not be proven 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】In our case, the patient presented dysphagia, regurgitation, heartburn and nausea. He also suffered an allergic cutaneous reaction 2 months before the onset of symptoms, but antigen sensitization tests and IgE concentration determination showed no abnormalities. The endoscopy showed changes in the esophageal mucosa suggestive of GERD and the esophageal manometry reported incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. However, the multiple biopsy samples obtained during the different endoscopies performed did not demonstrate an eosinophilic infiltration in the mucosa of the digestive tract. These findings led to treat the patient with high doses of PPI and to perform a Heller myotomy surgery, which were not effective.\n\n【32】After the Heller myotomy, fragments of the muscular layer were obtained. The histopathological analysis of these fragments revealed a severe eosinophilic infiltration of the muscular layer of the esophagus that suggested EE diagnosis, even though the mucosa did not have eosinophil infiltration.\n\n【33】Allergic conditions and involvement of other organs were ruled out. EAC was lower than 1,500 eosinophils/μL in every CBC performed, thus excluding the presence of a hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The patient referred no symptoms suggestive of eosinophilic myositis or fasciitis (such as swelling and/or itching of the skin, or muscle weakness/pain); this is why no other studies were performed to rule out these pathologic entities.\n\n【34】The patient received the treatment established by the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, which consists on the administration of an intravenous steroid and then an oral one in order to manage the medical emergency and weight loss. Afterwards, the steroids were substituted by a low-dose non-intestinal-absorbable steroid (oral budesonide) as a maintenance treatment, although this change did not modify the patient’s medical progress. The use of oral budesonide was effective.\n\n【35】Taking into account the latest advances made in the etiology and pathophysiology of EE, as well as the new variants that have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>, it is evident that there is a group of patients who probably have an eosinophilic disorder and do not meet the diagnostic criteria for any of those entities.\n\n【36】In this case, exclusive eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal muscular layer, with evidence of esophageal dysfunction, was observed. The patient did not meet the diagnostic criteria for any of the differential diagnoses that were suggested (i.e. EE, GERD, HES, and GED), but the treatment with intravenous and oral steroids, as in EE, actually brought relief to the symptoms.\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interests</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors have nothing to disclose.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Jose Plaz provided the clinical and gastroenterologic studies’ information of the patient as well as helped with the preparation of the manuscript.

An upper digestive endoscopy was performed, which reported hiatal hernia and characteristic changes of non-erosive GERD; the stomach and duodenum revealed no abnormalities. The mucosal biopsy of the esophagus showed histopathological changes suggestive of GERD . Colonoscopy was also performed at this time, and it did not reveal any abnormalities. Biopsy samples were not taken from other organs (e.g. stomach, duodenum and colon), as no evidence of alterations was observed on endoscopic studies. The patient was therefore diagnosed with GERD and treatment with esomeprazole and ranitidine was started at high doses. A complete blood count performed at this time showed an eosinophil count of 4% (eosinophil absolute count (EAC): 580 eosinophils/μL).\n\n|  Figure 1. Biopsy of an endoscopically obtained sample of the esophagus (× 10). Note the absence of eosinophils infiltrating the mucosal epithelium. |\n| --- |\n\n【11】During the following 3 months, symptoms worsened which resulted in a 30-kg weight loss. The patient was admitted to the emergency care unit. The eosinophil count at this moment was 1.0% (EAC: 159 eosinophils/μL). An esophagogram showed esophageal motor dysfunction and scarce aperture of the mid and distal esophagus. An esophageal manometry was also performed and reported diffuse esophageal spasm and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) hypertension with incomplete relaxation. Due to these results achalasia was diagnosed and a laparoscopic Heller cardiomyotomy was carried out. During the procedure, biopsy samples were taken from the esophageal mucosa, muscular layer and paraesophageal fat.\n\n【12】The biopsy demonstrated an extensive esophageal wall fibrosis with an inflammatory mixed-cell infiltrate composed primarily by eosinophils, which comprised the muscular layer . Treatment with esomeprazol 40 mg bid and prednisone 50 mg was indicated for 3 months with apparent reduction of symptoms.\n\n|  Figure 2.

Biopsy of the muscular layer sample obtained during the Heller cardiomyotomy (× 100). Note the abundance of eosinophils infiltrating the muscular fibers. |\n| --- |\n\n【15】During this time, different diagnostic procedures were carried out. A CBC after discharge revealed an eosinophil count of 12.2% (EAC: 1,172 eosinophils/μL). A skin-pick test (which showed no sensitization to any antigens) and determination of IgE levels were performed and showed no abnormalities (IgE: 87.3 IU/mL, reference values: 20.00 - 100.00 IU/mL). Celiac disease antibodies measured at this time were negative. Stool was examined in various opportunities but there was no evidence of bacterial or parasitic infection. A video capsule endoscopy was performed and it revealed no abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【16】One month later, the patient presented to the emergency department because his previous symptoms had resurfaced. During the interrogation the patient referred having a papulous exanthema on his face and neck before the symptoms appeared which was treated with topical cetirizine. Macular erythematous lesions of the skin were seen on his face. He also referred moderate pain during epigastric palpation.\n\n【17】A superior digestive endoscopy was performed and reported a normal-aspect mucosa, a stomach with abundant food residues in the body and fundus, and an edematous pylorus and duodenum. Presence of fragments of esophageal squamous epithelium with discrete acanthosis and papillomatosis and chronic gastritis in the antrum (with focal epithelial loss and necrosis of the superior third of the mucosa) were also noticed on histopathological analysis.\n\n【18】Owing to the persistence of symptoms, a double-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis was performed. A diffuse concentric thickening of the mid and lower esophagus conditioned a small hydro-aerial level. The esophageal alteration extended throughout the esophagogastric junction to the gastric walls, which had a 1.9 cm thickening in the gastric fundus .\n\n|  Figure 4.

He was discharged 2 days later with oral methylprednisolone, indicated for 2 months. Eosinophil count at discharge was 4.6% (EAC: 515 eosinophils/μL) .

Presented according to CARE guidelines. |\n| --- |\n\n【25】Discussion\n\n【26】The prevalence of EE has increased in the last few years, although it is unknown if this increment is due to a real increase of its incidence or its diagnosis. The classic clinical presentation of this pathology is dysphagia, regurgitation, heartburn, and food impaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. EE is often confused with other pathologies with similar symptoms such as GERD or achalasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】The diagnosis of EE is based on the symptoms, endoscopic findings, alterations in manometry tests and changes seen through image studies. However, the diagnosis is established when eosinophilic infiltration is greater than 15 eosinophils per HPF microscopic evaluation in biopsies of esophageal mucosa of patients who have previously received high doses of PPI and had no positive response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】It is important to emphasize that EE is not the only cause of eosinophilic infiltration; in fact, GERD is the most common cause of it. This is why, it is established that the finding of less than 5 eosinophils leads to the diagnosis of GERD, between 5 and 14 to a mixed condition and more than 15 to EE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Zhao et al reported a case of a mural form of EE accompanied with squamous esophageal cancer. This patient presented dysphagia as the principal symptom. Endoscopic studies evidenced a tumor in the esophageal mucosa, which led to the resection of the esophagus. The biopsy of the resected tumor demonstrated that in addition to the cancer, eosinophilic infiltration in all the layers of the esophagus was also present, predominating in the muscular layer. Due to the histopathological changes, it could be determined that the eosinophilic infiltration preceded the neoplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】There are also other reported cases by Lucendo et al where patients, in addition to having the diagnostic criteria of EE, also presented motor impairments of the esophagus (66%) and manometric changes such as secondary waves and abnormal peristalsis (one case), hypertension and incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (two cases) and incomplete upper esophageal sphincter relaxation (one case). In this study, it was presumed that these disorders could be associated to an eosinophilic infiltration of the muscular layer or the esophageal ganglion cells. Nevertheless, this could not be proven 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】In our case, the patient presented dysphagia, regurgitation, heartburn and nausea. He also suffered an allergic cutaneous reaction 2 months before the onset of symptoms, but antigen sensitization tests and IgE concentration determination showed no abnormalities. The endoscopy showed changes in the esophageal mucosa suggestive of GERD and the esophageal manometry reported incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. However, the multiple biopsy samples obtained during the different endoscopies performed did not demonstrate an eosinophilic infiltration in the mucosa of the digestive tract. These findings led to treat the patient with high doses of PPI and to perform a Heller myotomy surgery, which were not effective.\n\n【32】After the Heller myotomy, fragments of the muscular layer were obtained. The histopathological analysis of these fragments revealed a severe eosinophilic infiltration of the muscular layer of the esophagus that suggested EE diagnosis, even though the mucosa did not have eosinophil infiltration.\n\n【33】Allergic conditions and involvement of other organs were ruled out. EAC was lower than 1,500 eosinophils/μL in every CBC performed, thus excluding the presence of a hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The patient referred no symptoms suggestive of eosinophilic myositis or fasciitis (such as swelling and/or itching of the skin, or muscle weakness/pain); this is why no other studies were performed to rule out these pathologic entities.\n\n【34】The patient received the treatment established by the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, which consists on the administration of an intravenous steroid and then an oral one in order to manage the medical emergency and weight loss. Afterwards, the steroids were substituted by a low-dose non-intestinal-absorbable steroid (oral budesonide) as a maintenance treatment, although this change did not modify the patient’s medical progress. The use of oral budesonide was effective.\n\n【35】Taking into account the latest advances made in the etiology and pathophysiology of EE, as well as the new variants that have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>, it is evident that there is a group of patients who probably have an eosinophilic disorder and do not meet the diagnostic criteria for any of those entities.\n\n【36】In this case, exclusive eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal muscular layer, with evidence of esophageal dysfunction, was observed. The patient did not meet the diagnostic criteria for any of the differential diagnoses that were suggested (i.e. EE, GERD, HES, and GED), but the treatment with intravenous and oral steroids, as in EE, actually brought relief to the symptoms.\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interests</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors have nothing to disclose.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Jose Plaz provided the clinical and gastroenterologic studies’ information of the patient as well as helped with the preparation of the manuscript.

An upper digestive endoscopy was performed, which reported hiatal hernia and characteristic changes of non-erosive GERD; the stomach and duodenum revealed no abnormalities. The mucosal biopsy of the esophagus showed histopathological changes suggestive of GERD . Colonoscopy was also performed at this time, and it did not reveal any abnormalities. Biopsy samples were not taken from other organs (e.g. stomach, duodenum and colon), as no evidence of alterations was observed on endoscopic studies. The patient was therefore diagnosed with GERD and treatment with esomeprazole and ranitidine was started at high doses. A complete blood count performed at this time showed an eosinophil count of 4% (eosinophil absolute count (EAC): 580 eosinophils/μL).\n\n|  Figure 1. Biopsy of an endoscopically obtained sample of the esophagus (× 10). Note the absence of eosinophils infiltrating the mucosal epithelium. |\n| --- |\n\n【11】During the following 3 months, symptoms worsened which resulted in a 30-kg weight loss. The patient was admitted to the emergency care unit. The eosinophil count at this moment was 1.0% (EAC: 159 eosinophils/μL). An esophagogram showed esophageal motor dysfunction and scarce aperture of the mid and distal esophagus. An esophageal manometry was also performed and reported diffuse esophageal spasm and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) hypertension with incomplete relaxation. Due to these results achalasia was diagnosed and a laparoscopic Heller cardiomyotomy was carried out. During the procedure, biopsy samples were taken from the esophageal mucosa, muscular layer and paraesophageal fat.\n\n【12】The biopsy demonstrated an extensive esophageal wall fibrosis with an inflammatory mixed-cell infiltrate composed primarily by eosinophils, which comprised the muscular layer . Treatment with esomeprazol 40 mg bid and prednisone 50 mg was indicated for 3 months with apparent reduction of symptoms.\n\n|  <mark>Figure 2.

A CBC after discharge revealed an eosinophil count of 12.2% (EAC: 1,172 eosinophils/μL). A skin-pick test (which showed no sensitization to any antigens) and determination of IgE levels were performed and showed no abnormalities (IgE: 87.3 IU/mL, reference values: 20.00 - 100.00 IU/mL). Celiac disease antibodies measured at this time were negative. Stool was examined in various opportunities but there was no evidence of bacterial or parasitic infection. A video capsule endoscopy was performed and it revealed no abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【16】One month later, the patient presented to the emergency department because his previous symptoms had resurfaced. During the interrogation the patient referred having a papulous exanthema on his face and neck before the symptoms appeared which was treated with topical cetirizine. Macular erythematous lesions of the skin were seen on his face. He also referred moderate pain during epigastric palpation.\n\n【17】A superior digestive endoscopy was performed and reported a normal-aspect mucosa, a stomach with abundant food residues in the body and fundus, and an edematous pylorus and duodenum. Presence of fragments of esophageal squamous epithelium with discrete acanthosis and papillomatosis and chronic gastritis in the antrum (with focal epithelial loss and necrosis of the superior third of the mucosa) were also noticed on histopathological analysis.\n\n【18】Owing to the persistence of symptoms, a double-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis was performed. A diffuse concentric thickening of the mid and lower esophagus conditioned a small hydro-aerial level. The esophageal alteration extended throughout the esophagogastric junction to the gastric walls, which had a 1.9 cm thickening in the gastric fundus .\n\n|  <mark>Figure 4.

He was discharged 2 days later with oral methylprednisolone, indicated for 2 months. Eosinophil count at discharge was 4.6% (EAC: 515 eosinophils/μL) .

The classic clinical presentation of this pathology is dysphagia, regurgitation, heartburn, and food impaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. EE is often confused with other pathologies with similar symptoms such as GERD or achalasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】The diagnosis of EE is based on the symptoms, endoscopic findings, alterations in manometry tests and changes seen through image studies.

This patient presented dysphagia as the principal symptom. Endoscopic studies evidenced a tumor in the esophageal mucosa, which led to the resection of the esophagus. The biopsy of the resected tumor demonstrated that in addition to the cancer, eosinophilic infiltration in all the layers of the esophagus was also present, predominating in the muscular layer. Due to the histopathological changes, it could be determined that the eosinophilic infiltration preceded the neoplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】There are also other reported cases by Lucendo et al where patients, in addition to having the diagnostic criteria of EE, also presented motor impairments of the esophagus (66%) and manometric changes such as secondary waves and abnormal peristalsis (one case), hypertension and incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (two cases) and incomplete upper esophageal sphincter relaxation (one case). In this study, it was presumed that these disorders could be associated to an eosinophilic infiltration of the muscular layer or the esophageal ganglion cells. Nevertheless, this could not be proven 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】In our case, the patient presented dysphagia, regurgitation, heartburn and nausea. He also suffered an allergic cutaneous reaction 2 months before the onset of symptoms, but antigen sensitization tests and IgE concentration determination showed no abnormalities. The endoscopy showed changes in the esophageal mucosa suggestive of GERD and the esophageal manometry reported incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. However, the multiple biopsy samples obtained during the different endoscopies performed did not demonstrate an eosinophilic infiltration in the mucosa of the digestive tract. These findings led to treat the patient with high doses of PPI and to perform a Heller myotomy surgery, which were not effective.\n\n【32】After the Heller myotomy, fragments of the muscular layer were obtained. The histopathological analysis of these fragments revealed a severe eosinophilic infiltration of the muscular layer of the esophagus that suggested EE diagnosis, even though the mucosa did not have eosinophil infiltration.\n\n【33】Allergic conditions and involvement of other organs were ruled out. EAC was lower than 1,500 eosinophils/μL in every CBC performed, thus excluding the presence of a hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The patient referred no symptoms suggestive of eosinophilic myositis or fasciitis (such as swelling and/or itching of the skin, or muscle weakness/pain); this is why no other studies were performed to rule out these pathologic entities.\n\n【34】The patient received the treatment established by the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, which consists on the administration of an intravenous steroid and then an oral one in order to manage the medical emergency and weight loss. Afterwards, the steroids were substituted by a low-dose non-intestinal-absorbable steroid (oral budesonide) as a maintenance treatment, although this change did not modify the patient’s medical progress. The use of oral budesonide was effective.\n\n【35】Taking into account the latest advances made in the etiology and pathophysiology of EE, as well as the new variants that have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>, it is evident that there is a group of patients who probably have an eosinophilic disorder and do not meet the diagnostic criteria for any of those entities.\n\n【36】In this case, exclusive eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal muscular layer, with evidence of esophageal dysfunction, was observed. The patient did not meet the diagnostic criteria for any of the differential diagnoses that were suggested (i.e. EE, GERD, HES, and GED), but the treatment with intravenous and oral steroids, as in EE, actually brought relief to the symptoms.\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interests</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors have nothing to disclose.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Jose Plaz provided the clinical and gastroenterologic studies’ information of the patient as well as helped with the preparation of the manuscript.

Primary liposarcoma in the pyriform sinus of the hypopharynx is extremely rare, with only 14 cases reported to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\- 11 \\]</u>. There is a distinct male preponderance and only one female case aged 90 years old has been reported. It has been previously reported that the rate of recurrence in liposarcoma of the hypopharynx is relatively high. This report presents a pregnant case of a patient with liposarcoma in the pyriform sinus of hypopharynx and also discusses the treatment options by reviewing the previous studies of hypopharyngeal liposarcoma.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 38-year-old female presented with dysphagia and throat discomfort at 3 months of pregnancy. She had experienced similar symptoms 10 years earlier, and lipoma-like tumor involving the pyriform sinus was removed by the intraoral approach using a direct suspension laryngomicroscope under general anesthesia twice for 2 years. The pathological diagnosis was lipoma. Three years later, the recurrent tumor mass was removed by a lateral pharyngotomy. The pathology was diagnosed as a well-differentiated liposarcoma. She therefore underwent an additional systemic examination for metastases, however no regional and no distance metastasis were found.\n\n【4】Recent physical examination revealed a smooth tumor involving the pyriform sinus and aryepiglottic folds . MRI showed a moderately heterogeneous mass spreading submucosally around the right pharynx and pyriform sinus with signal intensity equal to the subcutaneous fat in a T1 weighted image, and high intensity in a T2 weighted image. The mass showed low signal intensity with fat suppression of the T1 weighted image .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

The size was 30 mm x 15 mm x 10 mm. Although she complained of slight dysphagia and hoarseness, oral feeding was resumed the day after the operation. She has had an uneventful post-operative course and delivered a healthy female child without any trouble 5 months after the operation.\n\n【8】The histopathological findings showed that the tumor was submucosal, unencapsulated and composed of lobules of fat traversed by varying amounts of fibrous tissue-like spindle cells . Fat cells and spindle cells with enlarged and atypical nuclei were observed in the lobules . The lesion was therefore classified as well-differentiated liposarcoma.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3. Pathological study.

The liposarcoma of hypopharynx thus has a significant male predominance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Most of cases occur in the fourth through seventh decades of life, ranging from 23 to 90 years old. The most frequent symptoms are airway obstruction, dysphagia, throat discomfort and hoarseness. The size of liposarcoma in previous reports ranged from 20 mm to 215 mm.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. Clinicopathological Data for Cases With Hypopharyngeal Liposarcoma |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【13】Liposarcomas are divided into four histological types: well-differentiated type, myxoid type, round cell type and pleomorphic type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The most common histological types of liposarcoma in the head and neck are the well-differentiated and the myxoid types, which account for 30% of all types each 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Thirteen of the 15 reported cases with liposarcoma are classified as well-differentiated type and 2 cases as myxoid type. The prognosis of the liposarcoma depends on the histological grade. The well-differentiated and the myxoid types are thought to be low grade malignancies, and the clinical courses of both types progress satisfactorily. Golledge et al. reported 5-year survival rates of 100% for well-differentiated, 73% for myxoid, 42% for pleomorphic, and 0% for round cell in 76 cases of liposarcoma of the head and neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】A complete resection by wide excision is the treatment of choice for liposarcoma of the hypopharynx, as it is for liposarcoma of other regions. However, a local recurrence in cases with liposarcoma of hypopharynx has been reported in 8 cases (61.5%) of 13 cases that included the prognosis. An endoscopic excision with laryngomicroscopy was the initial treatment in 7 cases, of which 5 cases had additional treatments for local recurrence; 3 cases by a lateral pharyngotomy and 2 cases by a total laryngectomy. A lateral pharyngotomy was the initial treatment in 6 cases, of which 3 cases received additional treatment for local recurrences. Two cases were treated by an endoscopic excision with laryngomicroscopy and one case was treated with a total laryngectomy and postoperative radiotherapy. One case was initially treated by a lateral pharyngotomy and chemo-radiation therapy. The rate of recurrence in liposarcoma of the hypopharynx is thus relatively high.\n\n【15】The well-differentiated type and myxoid type liposarcoma frequently recur, however they rarely show lymph node or distant metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Therefore, a routine neck dissection is not indicated. One fatal case with a myxoid type liposarcoma in the head and neck was reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, and Weiss et al. reported that the well-differentiated type of liposarcoma occasionally de-differentiates in extremities and retroperitoneal region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Postoperative radiotherapy has been shown to be efficient for the myxoid type of liposarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. However, a study recommends avoiding radiotherapy since the radiotherapy may induce de-differentiation although the chance is rare in well-differentiated liposarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Chemotherapeutic intervention has been performed for liposarcoma; however there is no established chemotherapy for liposarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The current case was treated with suspension microlaryngoscopy and the transoral approach using a Holmium-YAG laser, which is minimally invasive in comparison to a lateral pharyngotomy. The advantage of the transoral approach by laser is that oral intake can be resumed the day after the laser surgery and a tracheotomy is unnecessary in most cases. The post-operative advantage is crucial for pregnant women and aged patients. However, the disadvantage of the laser surgery is the difficulty in adequately evaluating the surgical margins via the oral approach using the laser resection in some cases due to fragmentation of the tumor. The frequent recurrence may be that liposarcoma appears to have a clear capsule whereas it often undergoes microscopic infiltration into the surrounding structures. A complete function preserving excision with clear margins may therefore constitute definitively and may be a choice of the treatment, however careful follow-up of these patients at regular intervals is also important for detecting of recurrence.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:50:16", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:50:24", "cost": 8.69}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:50:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:50:06"}

The tumor was localized, but an operation was not indicated because of cardiac dysfunction; therefore, only biliary drainage was performed. Two years after the diagnosis, he felt giddy and showed severe anemia, with a serum hemoglobin (Hb) level of 4.4 g/dL. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a poorly-enhanced, low-density mass in the lower common bile duct, which invaded the duodenal wall . Duodenoscopy revealed sustained oozing hemorrhage from the papilla due to invasive cholangiocarcinoma . Palliative external-beam RT was attempted for the tumor of the papilla of Vater because his anemia was not improved after 16 units of blood had been transfused . The radiation dose was 30 Gy in 12 fractions. After starting RT, neither progression of anemia nor treatment toxicity was observed. He received meals normally and spent 4 months at home until he died of hepatic failure due to multiple metastases.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Ten months after the operation, he showed black stool and epigastralgia. The serum Hb level was 5.2 g/dL, and CT revealed both a poorly-enhanced, low-density recurrent mass at the porta hepatis, which invaded the duodenal wall, and an aneurismal dilation of the invaded-tumor vessel . Duodenocsopy showed a red-colored, easily-hemorrhaged ulcer with submucosal growth appearance at the supraduodenal angle , which was diagnosed histopathologically as adenocarcinoma. Palliative RT with 30 Gy in 10 fractions was indicated for the recurrent tumor because conservative treatment including fasting, blood transfusion and the administration of a proton-pump inhibitor was not effective . After starting RT, neither progression of anemia nor treatment toxicity was observed. He is still asymptomatic at 3 months after RT.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 4.

Therefore, RT is not recommended as a standard treatment, except for in a palliative setting, including for localized metastases or uncontrolled bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Radiation gives rise to denudation of the surface of blood vessels, leading to thrombosis and capillary necrosis as the result of acute damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Favorable results of prolonging the survival time in BTC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> and the reported efficacy for TAB in other cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> suggest the hemostatic effect of RT in BTC; however, we found no reports describing the efficacy and safety of TAB from BTC in detail.\n\n【16】The effect of palliative RT on bleeding from gastric cancer has received more attention than that on bleeding from BTC. Small retrospective studies have shown a treatment success rate of 54-91% and a median duration of response ranging from 1.5 to 11.4 months with dose fractionation regimens of 6 - 60 Gy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Grade 3 - 4 acute toxicities occurred in up to 15% of patients treated with RT alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Therefore, hemostatic RT for gastric cancer is suggested not only to be an effective and safe treatment option but to improve the patient’s quality of life, although the optimum dose fractionation regimen is unclear.\n\n【17】In our cases, treatment success was achieved in both patients, and they were able to spend their remaining life at home with no restriction on their oral intake. Furthermore, no adverse events were seen in any of the two patients after palliative RT. Therefore, palliative RT for TAB from BTC with 30 Gy in 10 - 12 fractions is expected to be an effective and safe treatment modality.\n\n【18】Conclusions\n\n【19】Palliative RT for TAB from BTC is suggested not only to be an effective and safe treatment option, but to improve the patient’s quality of life. The further accumulation of cases will be required in order to confirm the usefulness of hemostatic RT for BTC.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No competing financial interests exist.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:40:48", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:41:01", "cost": 13.361}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:40:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:40:38"}

They originate from primitive mesenchymal cells rather than from mature fat cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. They can be seen everywhere in the body containg the fat tissue. Myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) is a major subtype of these liposarcomas which represents approximately 30-50% of all the liposarcomas and the mean age is 42 years (between 18 - 67 years ) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. MLS commonly presents in the extremities, particularly in the thigh, however, it is relatively rare in the perineum or pararectal spaces 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.The major factors in determining the behavior and prognosis of liposarcoma are the histologic features, site, and size of the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 7 , 9 \\]</u>. Also the very rare form of MLS involvement in intrascrotal location has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. MLS involves the intermuscular fascial planes or deep-seated areas, rarely found in the subcutaneous tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Clinically they tend to present as painless swellings that progressively increase in size. MLS usually grow to a considerable size before become clinically symptomatic. The tumor is relatively soft and non-tender at physical examination.\n\n【10】Diagnosis is usually depends on the clinical symptoms (swelling, maybe pain) and the mostly on the imaging. Generally the multi-imaging modalities help for the exact preoperative assessment, diagnosis, staging of MLS, providing the curative resection and minimizing the local recurrence risk in patients. CT and MRI are useful crosssectional imaging modalities, which have large spectrum of signal intensity in MRI and CT attenuation, may provide information about the size, biological behavior, tissue characterization, the tumor extention.\n\n【11】The imaging abnormalities in both modalities (CT and specially for MRI) depends on the amount of fat content (less than 10-25% of the tumour volume), the degree of cellularity and vascularity, and the presence of necrosis within the tumor, the quantity of mucinous and myxoid materials in the tumor, they may show hyperintense foci (represents fat within the tumor ) in a predominantly homogeneous hypointense mass on T1-weighted images, in intermediate signal intensity On T2-Weighted images 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】The most majority part of MLS contain lacy or linear, amorphous foci of fat. Typically MLS tend to be hypointense on nonenhanced T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Contrarily to this, due to their relatively high fat content, lipomas and well-differentiated liposarcomas show high signal intensity on T1-weighted images 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Although they may appear as a cystic lesion on non-enhanced MR imaging or they may have similar appearance to a fluid-filled cyst at T2-weighted imaging, some MLS tend to enhance the contrast material like other solid tumors at contrast-enhanced MR study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. On Contrast-enhanced images there may be very little non-remarkable contrast enhacement, because of this reason they may mimic a cystic lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】Because of this reason, contrast (Godalinium) enhanced MRI is prefered and essential to differantiate the cystic or necrotic lesions from solid or cellular lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u> There are three contrast enhancing pattern in MRI including homogeneous (total enhancement), heterogeneous (partial enhancement, intensity more than 80% of the tumor volume) and no enhancement patterns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】The signal intensity of the lesion is variable due to its contents. If any lesion contains an extracellular matrix with a high level of mucopolysaccharide, hyaline cartilage, edema and areas of necrosis tends to be cystic in nature and it appears as a cystic mass on nonenhanced images 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. It makes the diagnosis difficult to differantiate cystic lesion from solid masses. In this level ultrasonography (US) may provide information about the internal nature of the lesions. If the MLS is purely cystic appearance at MRI, both US and contrast-enhanced MR imaging and US are helpful in the differential diagnosis.\n\n【15】MLS may mimic a fluid-filled cyst at T2-weighted imaging, therefore, contrast-enhanced MR imaging is important in differantiating cystic or necrotic lesions from solid, cellular lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】The local recurrence rates of MLS are relatively high at about 40-50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Pure MLS has a rate of metastasis about 20% to the common sites including lungs, bones, and rarely the serosal surfaces (of the pleura, peritoneum and pericardium) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. It is of great value to mention that the major predicting factor for local recurrence of MLS is the surgical margins and the major factor for metastasis is the histological grade and the percentage of round cells of the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】In differantial diagnosis some tumors which contain myxoid tissue such as extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, intramuscular myxoma, ganglion and myxoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma should be considered. Unlike MLS, these tumors tend to be homogeneous and have well defined contour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】Depends on the anatomical site, perineal location (the rare region) of the low attenuation in dansity or intensity cystic lesions ,as was in our case, mixoid liposarcoma should be consider in differantial diagnosis. It should be kept in mind that it is of a great value to obtain the contrast enhanced imaging in order to distinguish the cystic lesions from the solid masses.\n\n【20】Abbreviations\n\n【21】MLS: Myxoid liposarcoma; CT: Computed Tomography; MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging; US: Ultrasonography; STIR: Short Tau Inversion Recovery", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:55:03", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:55:18", "cost": 14.61}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:55:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:54:54"}

Early diagnosis and treatment of traumatic chylothorax are crucial in avoiding these associated morbidities. We are reporting a rare case of a multi-trauma patient with a surgically treated thoracic spine fracture who developed chylothorax several days after his initial admission complicating his post-operative course.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 19-year-old man was referred to our neurosurgery department after a reported motor vehicle accident which resulted in a three column thoracic spine fracture and subsequent paraplegia. His initial clinical examination revealed bilateral chest wall tenderness to palpation, decreased breath sounds bilaterally, lower thoracic spine tenderness to palpation, a complete loss of motor function in his lower extremities and loss of sensory function below the level of T7. Patient also had a loss of his cremasteric and bulbar cavernous reflex, and he did not have rectal tone (ASIA A). The patient was intubated due to unstable breathing and low saturation. Reconstructed 3D computer tomography of his thoracic spine showed a fracture of T7 thoracic vertebrae and dislocation of T7 vertebra on T8 vertebra . Rib fractures, bilateral pneumothorax, and lung contusions bilaterally were also found. After the placement of chest tube thoracostomies, patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital where he stayed for 45 days . During that period of time, he underwent posterior stabilization of his unstable thoracic spine fracture. Patient was transferred to the neurosurgery clinic after his discharge from the ICU where his left chest tube had a daily bloody drainage of 100 mL. The right chest tube had been removed in the ICU. On the 50th day of his hospitalization and after the initiation of food uptake, the patient presented with milky white fluid excretion from his left-sided chest tube. Chest X-ray and thoracic CT revealed an enlarged fluid pleural effusion at the base of his left lung . Biochemical analysis of the pleural fluid revealed triglycerides of 276 mg/dL, total protein of 2,200 mg/ dL, and LDH of 2,555 units/L. These results confirmed the presence of chylothorax. Conservative management was decided with total parenteral nutrition, a low-fat and medium-chain triglycerides diet and maintenance of the left drainage. The closure of the major thoracic duct was achieved over a period of 2 weeks. The chest tube was then removed and patient was started on a regular diet. Follow-up chest X-rays did not reveal any recurrent pleural effusions. His pulmonary status remained stable and the patient was discharged in order to participate in a rehabilitation program after a 3-month period of hospitalization.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. 3D reconstruction computer tomography of patient’s thoracic spine demonstrating the T7 vertebra fracture-dislocation upon T8 vertebra. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

Chylothorax associated with thoracic vertebral injury was noted first by Krabbell in 1885 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. Until today there have been described several cases in bibliography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 17-31 \\]</u>. Leturgie et al reported in 1979 a case of a patient with traumatic chylothorax in combination with a dorsal spine fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Chylothorax was recognized at the 13th day of patient’s hospitalization. Similarly, in all the other reported cases, chylothorax was noted immediately to several days after injury occurrence. In our case, chylothorax was noted 50 days after injury took place which is rarely documented in the literature. There is only one other case report in the literature in which chylothorax was described 20 years after a blunt thoracic trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Generally, chyle extravasation could be caused by two major mechanisms. Chylothorax could be either a result of direct trauma to the lymphatic vessels in the chyle pathway or either the result of thoracic chyle duct occlusion. Clinical manifestations of chylothorax are: 1) hypovolemia due to large amount of chyle loss, 2) dyspnea, 3) malnutrition due to the loss of protein, fats and vitamins, 4) hyponatremia, 5) hypocalcaemia and 6) immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32-34 \\]</u>. Clinical suspicion of chylothorax exists when milky or white fluid is drained out of the thorax. This classical white appearance is also noted in pseudochylothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>. Lymphangiography could be used to identify the spot of the chyle leakage or blockage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 , 36 \\]</u>. Thoracentesis and laboratory analysis of the pleural fluid could lead to the diagnosis which is based on the presence of chylomicrons in the pleural fluid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>. The presence of chylomicrons could be also speculated with the measurement of fluid cholesterol and triglyceride levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In recently published data near-infrared fluorescence imaging of thoracic duct and scintigraphy by orally administered 123 I BMIPP using SPECT/CT could reveal the chylous leakage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 37 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Treatment of traumatic chylothorax is mainly conservative with chest drainage and total parenteral nutrition (TPN), followed by medium-chain triglyceride diet. This kind of treatment was supported by many authors with satisfactory results for their patients as chyle production reduced in a period of time of a few days to 3 - 4 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 19 , 21 , 22 , 24-26 , 28-30 , 38 \\]</u>. In some cases octreotide can be administrated with good results for the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 , 39 , 40 \\]</u>. Surgical treatment should be followed only in the cases that chyle production is not reduced after the second to the third week of the conservative management. The goal of the operative treatment is the ligation of the thoracic duct as this was performed in a few cases in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 23 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】Traumatic chylothorax after a thoracic spine fracture is a rare pathological entity and it could be present immediately after trauma or more than a month after injury as in our case. Diagnosis is simplified through laboratory exams of the milky excreted fluid. Treatment is conservative for the majority of the patients with total parenteral nutrition followed by medium-chain triglyceride diet.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they do not have any conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 10:25:27", "endTime": "2024/09/19 10:26:25", "cost": 57.5}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 18:26:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 18:25:27"}

These fibrin adhesions between epicardium and pericardium increase not only the cost, but also bleeding, duration of surgery and poor clinical outcomes. If cardiac re-surgery will be performed several weeks after the first surgery, it corresponds to the time when adhesion around the heart is the most intensive and pericardial inflammation is the maximum. These materials, which are locally performed on the surgical area, made the surgeons remain distant due to their undesirable effects, mainly increased risk of infection and immune reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Cardiac re-surgery was performed in 2014 in a patient, who had undergone mitral commissurotomy with the assistance of heart-lung machine (CPB) in 1998 and in whom a material considered to reduce adhesion has been wrapped around the heart. Detailed information on the film barrier used during the first surgery could not be obtained from the center where the surgery was performed. In our clinic, effect of the material wrapped around the heart during mitral valve replacement on adhesion was observed.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 64-year-old female patient presented to our clinic with shortness of breath, palpitation and limited effort. Whilst transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated mitral stenosis (mean gradient: 9.5 mm Hg, area: 1.8 cm <sup>2 </sup> ), mitral insufficiency (grade 2-3/4), pulmonary artery pressure of 60 mm Hg, and tricuspid insufficiency (grade 2-3/4), aortic valve was considered to be within the normal limits. Coronary angiography revealed no lesion. The patient was admitted to the cardiovascular surgery clinic for mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve De Vega annuloplasty. Prior to the open heart surgery, routine laboratory analyses (complete blood count, biochemical analyses, telegram, urinalysis, dental examination report, electrocardiography, etc.) were requested, preoperative medical treatment was arranged, and the patient was prepared for surgery.\n\n【5】On the day of surgery, the patient was admitted to the operating room. Fentanyl, midazolam and pancuronium bromide were used for the induction of anesthesia. Standard median sternotomy was performed. Heparin sodium was given at a dose of 300 IU/kg (Nevparin <sup>® </sup> flacon 25,000 IU/5 mL). CPB and cross-clamp, standard aortic and selective (VCS, VCI) venous cannulation were performed. Jostra-Cobe (model 043213 105, VLC 865, Sweden) heart-lung machine was used. Crystalloid cardioplegy was given during surgery, whereas hot shot cardioplegy was given at the end of surgery. Standard left atriotomy and right atriotomy were performed. Unnecessary electrocautery use and luxury perfusion in CPB were avoided. Hematocrit and hemoglobin values were checked every 20 min after induction of anesthesia until the end of surgery. Intraoperative blood transfusion was performed when hematocrit value decreased to 20%. Mediastinal and chest drains were placed subxyphoidally. At the end of surgery, appropriate dose of protamine hydrochloride (Protamin <sup>® </sup> ampoule 1,000 IU/1 mL) was administered for full-dose neutralization in the patient that underwent on-pump CABG, and activated clothing time (ACT) was kept between 100 and 120 s. The patient was then admitted to the cardiovascular surgery intensive care unit.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Although the mechanism of adhesion formation is unclear, inflammatory response plays a role in its pathogenesis. Open heart surgery increases reactive oxygen species (ROS). This is reported to cause postoperative adhesion. In some animal experiments, it was demonstrated that ROS scavengers could prevent adhesion formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】What expected after cardiac surgery is the complete healing of pericardium in the presence of membrane formation. Second, it results in formation of single-layer, flattened mesothelial cells over disappeared connective tissue. It has been determined that mesothelial cells can differentiate from multipotent cells that occurred on the collagen basis. These cells prevent adhesion by synthesizing growth factors, lubricants and extracellular matrix proteins and secreting fibrin scavenging factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Some local drugs or biologicals can prevent adhesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Although there is no protective method, postoperative pericardial adhesion significantly influences mortality and morbidity. Whilst some studies have focused on autogenous, heterogeneous and synthetic structures that could act as a barrier between epicardium and pericardium or sternum, some other studies have focused on the agents that could prevent adhesion after cardiac surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1-3 \\]</u>. Efficacy of synthetic and xenogeneic membranes has been understood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, there are reports that these membranes are associated with formation of calcification, capsule and epicardial reaction. Their effectivity has not been proven. As these structures are not transparent, they make the examination of cardiac structure difficult during surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that systemic anti-inflammatory drugs and topical fibrinolytic agents reduce adhesion. However, both approaches impair wound healing and unfavorably influence bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Inflammatory response is important in the pathogenesis of adhesion formation. It is known that decreased tissue oxygen due to ischemia leads to adhesion formation. Free oxygen radicals are significantly increased following endothelial tissue injury. These radicals rapidly react with oxygen and aggravate oxygen gap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Free oxygen radicals such as superoxide, peroxide and hydroxyl radicals have the potential to oxidize polyunsaturated fatty acids. Oxidation of fatty acids would result in peroxidation of cell membrane lipids and accordingly in the process that would enhance vascular permeability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. This process causes formation of serosanguineous exudate. Exudation triggers adhesion. In general, these adhesions are exposed to lysis after 72 h. Endogenous fibrinolytic activity is the factor that enables lysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Collected fibrin, which results from the balance between fibrin collection and degradation being in favor of fibrin, forms the adhesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】It was determined that the area with adhesion-preventing material covered over the anterior and lateral aspects of the heart after sternotomy and mitral commissurotomy performed in 1998  has equal adhesion (even higher in some places) to the area with no material performed while exposing to surgical procedure in 2014. We can say that the film barrier wrapped around the heart during cardiac surgery to prevent adhesion is not effective. However, case series are needed to support this statement.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1.

Early recognition and prompt management will reduce maternal mortality.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 22-year-old woman in her third pregnancy presented in labor and on examination was found to be 5 cm dilated. Thirty minutes later fetal bradycardia was noted and assessment showed she was fully dilated. The fetal head was below the spine, following which she had a ventouse delivery. The first stage lasted 30 minutes and second stage 10 minutes.\n\n【4】Placenta and membranes were delivered by controlled cord traction and maternal effort with the third stage lasting only 5 minutes. As soon as the placenta was delivered, an unusual hard mass was noticed outside the introitus. The uterine fundus was not palpable abdominally and patient complained of abdominal pain which was followed by a drop in blood pressure and maternal tachycardia with cold clammy extremities, in keeping with shock. She was resuscitated with colloids pending the arrival of blood. Attempted reduction of the inverted uterus in the room by the attending Obstetrician was unsuccessful. With resuscitation and rise of her blood pressure she was immediately transferred to theatre for replacement of the uterus.\n\n【5】Examination in theatre under general anesthesia confirmed complete uterine inversion. The uterus was partially replaced manually and a Rusch balloon catheter inserted into the partially reduced uterus and inflated with about 300 ml of normal saline to achieve full repositioning of the uterus to its anatomical position. The inflated Rusch balloon catheter served the purpose of achieving replacing, maintaining the normal anatomy of the uterus and at the same time preventing further hemorrhage by a tamponade effect on the uterus. Total blood loss was 3000 ml and she required 4 units blood transfusion. A urinary catheter was inserted and vaginal packs used to support and hold the Rusch balloon catheter in place.\n\n【6】She had Syntometrine injection, Syntocinon infusion and Carbaprost as part of management for the associated post-partum hemorrhage. The next day the Rusch balloon catheter was removed and patient debriefed. She made good recovery and was discharged 2 days later.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Uterine inversion is a rare but significant cause of massive obstetric hemorrhage which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Incidence varies widely from 1:500 to 1:57393 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Maternal mortality rate of up to 15% have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The rapid emptying of the uterus as in this case has also been suggested as a possible predisposing factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Other recognized risk factors include excessive fundal pressure, relaxed uterus, fundal placenta and short umbilical cord 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Diagnosis is clinical and for complete inversion, a mass is palpated or seen at the introitus. An associated fundal defect will be noted on abdominal palpation. The presence of symptoms and signs of shock will further consolidate the diagnosis of uterine inversion.\n\n【9】Management involves immediate replacement of the inverted uterus and simultaneous correction of shock which is usually out of proportion. Most Obstetricians will advise removal of the placenta only after reduction of the uterus, as doing otherwise will result in increased blood loss and worsening hemodynamics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In this case the placenta had already been removed at delivery. Tocolytic drugs like terbutaline, magnesium sulphate and glyceryl trinitrate have all been used to aid uterine replacement by relaxing the uterus. General anesthetic agent like Halothane is also useful.\n\n【10】The reduction here was achieved by partially replacing the uterus manually and inserting a Rusch balloon catheter which was inflated to achieve full replacement of the uterus. This can be described as a modified form of hydrostatic reduction. Hydrostatic reduction was first described by O’Sullivan in 1945 and the principle involves infusing fluid while maintaining a water seal around the vagina to generate the pressure required in correcting the inversion. One of the drawbacks of the hydrostatic method is the difficulty in maintaining a water seal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This has been overcome by the use of the Rusch balloon catheter in this case. Other methods of achieving a water seal including use of a ventouse cup have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Another method of correction is the manual method also known as Johnson maneuver, in which the inverted uterine fundus is pushed back in through the cervical ring with pressure directed towards the umbilicus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Surgical procedures are indicated when manual reduction fails. Huntington procedure involves a laparotomy to locate the cup of the uterus. Allis forceps is used to gently apply upward traction until the inversion is corrected. Haultain technique involves a longitudinal incision on the posterior cervical ring and reversal by gentle traction as in the Huntington procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 9 \\]</u>. A modified laparoscopic reduction has been reported recently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. When all these methods fail, then a hysterectomy may be the only option. The use of an intrauterine Rusch balloon catheter in this case achieved three objectives of replacing the inverted uterus, maintaining the position and preventing further post-partum hemorrhage.\n\n【13】It has been shown that quick replacement of the inverted uterus and resuscitation will give a better outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The early involvement of a senior Obstetrician and multi-disciplinary Obstetric emergency team, is very vital.

The most major cause for duodeno-biliary fistula is inflammation of the bile duct due to gallstones, and the minors include duodenal ulcer, pancreatic neoplasm, and inflammation of neighbor organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\- 2 \\]</u>. Yamashita et al. reported that 33 of 1929 cases (1.9%) with biliary diseases showed duodeno-biliary fistula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

Of these, biliary fistula seems more often than others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Stricture is also uncommon condition of duodenal ulcer. In the present case, both the complications occurred as a result of recurrence of the disease.

Endoscopic therapy such as endoscopic closure and dilatation, may be an alternative method for surgery. In our case, however, both fistula and stricture coexisted, and endoscopic closure was not available because the location of the fistula could not be confirmed precisely. Additionally, since the stricture was very severe, we could not try endoscopic dilatation. Then we did not choose endoscopic or conservative treatment, but did surgical operation.\n\n【12】Here we reported on a rare case of duodenal ulcer accompanied by duodeno-biliary fistula and duodenal stricture.

It occurs in previously healthy women in the final month of pregnancy and up to 5 months after delivery. Although the incidence is low, morbidity and mortality rates are high, ranging from 5% to 32%. The diagnosis of this rare disease is difficult to make. Pregnancy-related pathologies such as pre-eclampsia, myocarditis, or underlying genetic disease show overlapping symptoms with PPCM. Pre-eclampsia is a multisystemic disorder that presents with hypertension and proteinuria. Edema is frequently present in patients with pre-eclampsia. Hypertension, proteinuria and edema are also symptoms of PPCM. Patients with severe pre-eclampsia complicated by PPCM should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of specialists to improve morbidity and mortality.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】Our patient is a 35-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 2, bearing a singleton pregnancy. Her first pregnancy was normal with a term delivery. She presented with first trimester hypertension and was given methyldopa but defaulted on her medication.\n\n【4】She was seen in outpatient clinic at 33 weeks of gestation and was noted to have a raised blood pressure but no proteinuria. Ultrasound done showed mild intrauterine growth restriction. She was admitted for observation and started on methyldopa. At 34 weeks of gestation, she presented with sudden onset epigastric pain and her blood pressure was 220/110 mm Hg. Liver function test showed transaminitis. Oral nifedipine, intravenous hydralazine and intravenous magnesium sulphate was started and she underwent an emergency cesarean section at 34 weeks of gestation.\n\n【5】On postoperative day 1, the patient developed jaundice. Blood tests showed raised bilirubin, transaminitis and low platelets. The patient also had gross hematuria. A diagnosis of HELLP syndrome was made and the patient was transfused with platelets and fresh frozen plasma. Her hemoglobin level was noted to be 7.1 g/dL. Therefore, one pint of packed cells was transfused. Her creatinine level was noted to be 341 µmol/L. She was seen by the renal physician and was diagnosed to have acute kidney injury secondary to HELLP syndrome.\n\n【6】On postoperative day 3, she developed worsening dyspnea. Chest radiography showed left lower lobe pneumonia and pulmonary congestion. In view of rising trend of total white blood cells, a diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia was made. She was started on intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics.\n\n【7】On postoperative day 5, she had persistent and worsening dyspnea and was noted to be clinically overloaded. Chest X-ray showed that the lungs were congested and there is bilateral perihilar airspace opacification in a bat wing’s configuration, which was worrisome for pulmonary edema. She was given frusemide and a cardiologist referral was made. A two-dimensional echocardiography was done which showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 58% with moderate mitral regurgitation, unlikely to be PPCM.\n\n【8】Ultrasound abdomen and kidneys showed normal liver and kidney functions. Her creatinine levels and liver function tests progressively returned to normal. Fluid overload resolved with strict fluid restriction. Her pneumonia resolved after 10 days of intravenous antibiotics. The patient was discharged on POD15 well and afebrile.\n\n【9】The patient returned 3 days later to the emergency department complaining of left thigh blisters with fever. She also complained of mild dyspnea and a productive cough. Her vitals showed tachycardia with a pulse rate of 124 beats per minute but blood pressure was normal. On examination, there was a 2 cm vesicular lesion on the anterior aspect of her left thigh. Chest X-ray showed increased opacity and haziness over bilateral lower lung lobes compared to previous X-rays. Patient was advised for admission to treat for pneumonia but she declined and went home.\n\n【10】She returned to the emergency department a day later with increased shortness of breath and persistent left thigh blister that was increasing in size. She was tachypneic and unable to speak in full sentences. Her blood pressure was 169/126 mm Hg and heart rate was 158 beats per minute. The temperature was 37.5 °C. Her oxygen saturation was 35% on a non-rebreather mask. Arterial blood gas showed metabolic and respiratory acidosis with type 1 respiratory failure. Patient had a seizure while her blood was taken which was aborted with intravenous midazolam. She was subsequently intubated and kept on mechanical ventilation. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral basal crepitation. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary congestion and a diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema was made. She was then admitted to the surgical intensive care unit with central line monitoring.\n\n【11】The patient was reviewed by the cardiologists and a formal two-dimensional echocardiography was done. It showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 25-30%, mild global left ventricular hypokinesia, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, moderately dilated left atrium, mildly dilated right atrium and normal ventricles. A diagnosis of PPCM was made. Patient was treated with intravenous frusemide and started on broad spectrum antibiotics. Residual HELLP syndrome was unlikely as the patient was 3 weeks postpartum and biochemical investigations do not support ongoing or worsening HELLP syndrome. The patient had an episode of pulseless electrical activity 1 day after admission to intensive care unit. She was resuscitated for 3 min and intravenous adrenaline was given with return of spontaneous circulation within 2 min. The patient’s care was taken over by the cardiologists and she was transferred to the cardiology intensive care unit.\n\n【12】She was extubated 3 days after admission and intravenous frusemide was converted to oral. Anti-hypertensives were started for blood pressure control and diuresis was achieved with negative balance of up to 500 mL/day. Her renal function gradually improved with creatinine levels on a downward trend till normal before discharge. Infection markers were also on a downward trend and intravenous antibiotics were stopped. The patient was discharged home well 10 days after the second admission.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Our patient first presented with HELLP syndrome secondary to severe pre-eclampsia. She was unfortunate to have suffered from nosocomial pneumonia due to prolonged hospital stay. Acute kidney injury was thought to be a complication of HELLP syndrome but the renal physicians did not rule out the possibility of chronic kidney disease that was not diagnosed before pregnancy. PPCM is likely, as the patient had no past history of cardiac disease before pregnancy. The patient gave a history of increased fluid intake when she was at home as she thought it would improve her kidney function. Her actions probably resulted in acute pulmonary edema as her heart was unable to cope with the increased fluid due to cardiomyopathy.\n\n【15】PPCM is a type of dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown origin. It occurs in previously healthy women in the final month of pregnancy and up to 5 months after delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. PPCM is rare in some places but more common in others. It seems to be more prevalent in developing countries. For example, the incidence in Nigeria (1%) or Haiti (0.33%) surpasses that in more developed countries, such as South Africa (0.1%) or the United States (1:3,000 - 4,000 deliveries) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The reason for these discrepancies remain unknown but may be due to environmental and genetics factor, quality of perinatal care and also socio-cultural practices.\n\n【16】Although the incidence is low, morbidity and mortality rates are high, ranging from 5% to 32% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, and the diagnosis of this rare disease is not always straightforward.\n\n【17】PPCM is a diagnosis of exclusion and defined based on four criteria: 1) development of cardiac failure in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months postpartum; 2) the absence of an identifiable cause for the cardiac failure; 3) absence of recognizable heart disease before the last month of pregnancy; and 4) LV systolic dysfunction shown by echocardiographic data such as depressed shortening fraction (e.g. ejection fraction less than 45%, M-mode fractional shortening less than 30%, or both, and an LV end-diastolic dimension of more than 2.7 cm/m <sup>2 </sup> ) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】It may be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to those of normal late pregnancy. Giddiness, shortness of breath, fatigue, or pedal edema can happen in both normal late pregnancy and early congestive heart failure. Therefore, we need to be extremely cautious when dealing with patients with dyspnea in late pregnancy or postpartum. Careful history taking and physical examination need to be undertaken to exclude conditions that can cause or exacerbate heart failure. Volume status of the patient needs to be assessed through postural blood pressure, weight, blood investigations and physical examination. A complete works of blood investigations should be done to exclude causes of heart failure. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram and chest radiograph should be done to assess for cardiac abnormalities and hypertrophy of the heart. Chest radiographs can also be used to look for pulmonary edema. Two-dimensional echocardiogram is useful to assess LV size, wall thickness, and valvular function.\n\n【19】Several etiologies have been postulated but none is definite. They include viral myocarditis, abnormal immune response to pregnancy, stress activated cytokines, abnormal responses to hemodynamic stress of pregnancy, increased myocyte apoptosis, malnutrition, genetics factors, abnormal prolactin production, abnormal hormonal function, increased adrenergic tone secondary to emotional or physical stress, and myocardial ischemia.\n\n【20】Risk factors include advanced maternal age, multiparity, obesity, African origin, multiple pregnancy, malnutrition, gestational hypertension, diabetes, prolonged tocolysis, low socioeconomic status, poor perinatal care, breast feeding, substance and tobacco abuse, and family history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The standard principles of acute treatment for PPCM are the same as for heart failure. This includes fluid and salt restriction, treatment of hypertension, diuretics, vasodilators and digoxin. The aim of the treatment is to relieve the symptoms, delay progression of left ventricular dysfunction, and improving survival. Special cautions need to be given when deciding which medications when given to the mother will be harmful to the neonate when breastfeeding. Currently, cardiologists use three types of drugs (diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and B-blockers) for the treatment of chronic heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Diuretics help to improve pulmonary and peripheral edema within hours or days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. ACEIs improve survival in all severities of myocardial disease, but are contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding, due to its severe teratogenicity. ARBs help to improve survival in patients with heart failure but they have similar teratogenic risks as ACEIs. Three different B-blockers (metoprolol, carvedilol and bisoprolol) have been shown to reduce mortality in heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Atrial arrhythmias should be treated with digoxin. However, class III and class IV anti-arrhythmias should be avoided because of their teratogenic risks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Early delivery is recommended if the condition of a patient with PPCM is unstable despite medical treatment. Prostaglandins and oxytocin can be used as methods of inducing labor with minimal risks. Adequate analgesia, such as epidural, is recommended to reduce the load of the heart as pain will stimulate a sympathetic response. Strict fluid restriction should be maintained in order to avoid fluid overload. It will be beneficial to insert an indwelling urine catheter or even a central line to monitor the volume status of the patient. A vaginal delivery is recommended over cesarean section in view of the potential surgical risks of cesarean section. However, a cesarean delivery should be performed if there are obstetrics indications. Thromboprophylaxis should be given peripartum.\n\n【25】Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem condition, involving hypertension and proteinuria, which happens in pregnancy after 20 weeks of gestation. Edema is frequently present. The pathophysiology is multifactorial and involves endothelial damage and capillary leak. Some of the signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia include headache or visual disturbances, impaired coagulation, impaired liver function, pulmonary edema, ascites, and renal failure. Pulmonary edema, ascites and proteinuria are caused by endothelial dysfunction with subsequent capillary leak. As pulmonary edema, ascites and proteinuria occur in heart failure too, it makes the diagnosis of PPCM difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】HELLP syndrome is a severe complication of pre-eclampsia and it involves hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. It occurs in < 1% of pregnancies during the third trimester or in the first few days postpartum. The pathophysiology involves microangiopathic hemolytic anemia secondary to general activation of coagulation cascade. It presents with epigastric pain, visual disturbances, headache and parasthesiae. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is the most frequent major complication. Acute renal failure occurs in almost half of such cases.\n\n【27】Our patient’s encounter demonstrates the complexity of managing a patient with severe pre-eclampsia complicated by HELLP syndrome and acute renal failure, and PPCM. The symptoms are often similar which makes the diagnosis extremely difficult. A multidisciplinary team of specialists will be required for optimal care and management of such patients.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Grant</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 09:57:17", "endTime": "2024/09/19 09:59:41", "cost": 144.199}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 17:59:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 17:57:16"}

These ectopic implants most commonly involve the ovaries, ovarian fossa, uterosacral ligaments, rectovaginal septum, and the pouch of Douglas. While endometriosis is common and can be found in up to 10% of women of reproductive age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, urinary tract involvement is rare and accounts for approximately 1% of women with endometriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】The etiology of endometriosis of the urinary tract is not entirely clear. General theories of endometriosis include retrograde menstruation, celomic metaplasia, lymphatic or hematogenous dissemination of endometrial cells, spread of endometrium-derived stem or progenitor cells, and altered genetic or immune factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The pathophysiology of bladder endometriosis may be divided into two different causes, namely primary and secondary. The primary form occurs spontaneously and manifests in a form of a generalized pelvic disease whereas the secondary form is thought to be iatrogenic and typically occurs after pelvic surgery such as Cesarean section or hysterectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】We present a case report on a patient presenting with an invasive bladder mass initially thought to be from a pelvic malignancy. The final histology showed isolated bladder endometriosis. She had a significant past medical history of two previous Cesarean sections.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】In November 2017, a 49-year-old lady, para 2, was referred to our gynecology unit for further evaluation of an incidental left ovarian mass with bladder infiltration found on a health screen. She presented with symptoms of a 1-year history of increased urinary frequency every 2 h without any urinary incontinence. This was not associated with any abdominal pain, nocturia, dysuria or hematuria. Her menses were infrequent and she experienced spotting every 6 months due to her Mirena, which she had changed every 5 years since 2003. She had a past medical history of a laparoscopic myomectomy in 1998 and two previous Cesarean sections in 2001 and 2003 respectively. She was up to date with her cervical smears and mammograms and they were unremarkable. She had a significant family history of ovarian cancer wherein her mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer with metastases to the colon at the age of 75.\n\n【6】On examination, her abdomen was soft, non-tender and there were no obvious palpable masses. A lower transverse incision was noted. Speculum examination revealed a normal cervix. A left adnexal mass measuring 4 cm was palpable bimanually.\n\n【7】The ultrasound pelvis revealed an enlarged left ovary which was solid with heterogeneous echogenicity. There was no hypervascularity noted. No other adnexal masses or free fluid was noted. A 4-cm irregular papillary mucosal lesion was noted at the left lateral wall of the urinary bladder posteriorly and this was medial to the left ureteric orifice. The lesion appeared cystic and the posterior wall of the bladder appeared to be infiltrated. Normal ureteric jet was observed. An ultrasound of the kidneys confirmed normal sized kidneys bilaterally.\n\n【8】Her ovarian tumor markers were normal. The cancer antigen-125 (CA125) was 8 U/mL, CA19-9 was 7 U/mL, alpha-fetoprotein was 2.4 ng/mL and carcino-embryonic antigen was 1.2 ng/mL. Her creatinine was normal at 58 µmol/L.\n\n【9】The computed tomography (CT) scan of her thorax, abdomen and pelvis showed a left ovarian mass measuring 4.6 × 4.2 × 2.9 cm, suggestive of a left ovarian tumor. The inferior border of the ovarian mass was noted to be inseparable from the adjacent uterus. The ovarian mass was also noted to be contiguous with a small focus of irregular soft tissue thickening involving the superior left side of the bladder, measuring about 1.2 × 0.4 cm. No lymphadenopathy or metastasis was identified.\n\n【10】A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis was ordered to further characterize the ovarian mass. A 4.1 × 3.7 × 4.9 cm enhancing mass was noted to be inseparable from the left side of the uterus and was deemed to be likely uterine in origin . Bilateral ovaries were small and the left ovary appeared to be separate from the mass. An area of nodular thickening and enhancement of the superior wall of the bladder measuring about 2.5 cm in diameter was noted. It exhibited T1 hyperintense and T2 hypointense foci. No lymphadenopathy or ascites was seen.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. MRI images showing the sagittal view of the Cesarean scar niche (N), tract (T) and bladder tumor (BT).

A cystoscopy and bilateral double J-stent insertion was performed prior to the surgery. Cystoscopy revealed a tumor plaque in the bladder dome measuring approximately 4 cm, suspicious for invasion from an endometrial mass . Bilateral ureteric orifices were normal. Bilateral double J-stents were subsequently inserted. A midline incision was performed. On inspection of the pelvis, a 5-cm left uterine fundal fibroid and normal ovaries bilaterally were noted. Intraperitoneal survey was normal. Figure 3 is the intraoperative image showing an endometrial mass with invasion into the bladder. The decision was made for a partial cystectomy with resection of the mass in the bladder. En-bloc resection of the bladder mass and total hysterectomy bilateral salpingectomy was performed with conservation of the ovaries. Figure 4 shows the resected specimen sent for histology. Frozen section of the bladder mucosa revealed endometriosis and cystitis glandularis. The patient had an unremarkable recovery and was discharged home well on the fourth post-operative day with an indwelling urinary catheter. A micturating cystourethrogram was performed 2 weeks after the surgery that showed no evidence of contrast leak. The urinary catheter was removed successfully. She was subsequently followed up in the gynecology clinic with regular scans for surveillance of the ovaries.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

A benign leiomyoma was also noted. There were also no findings of concurrent endometriosis or adenomyosis in the specimens sent.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】The most common site of urological endometriosis is the bladder. A previous case series by Donnez et al found that 4 out of 17 patients had previous Cesarean sections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Endometriotic lesions of the bladder are closely located to the uterus and typically affect the detrusor muscle in the bladder trigone and bladder apex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Most patients with bladder endometriosis present with cyclical suprapubic and back pain with irritative voiding symptoms worsened during menstruation. Approximately 20% of patients would experience cyclical menstrual hematuria, a pathognomonic sign for bladder endometriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Patients can also present with symptoms suggestive of pelvic endometriosis such as a dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Our patient presented in an atypical manner and did not complain of any symptoms suggestive of pelvic or bladder endometriosis. In a study by Vercellini et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, only 2 out of the 40 women who had bladder endometriosis were asymptomatic. We postulate that the absence of menstrual symptoms suggestive of pelvic endometriosis may be possibly related to the use of Mirena.\n\n【20】In the assessment of urological endometriosis, both cystoscopy and MRI have been shown to be useful modalities. Cystoscopy has also been noted to be useful in the evaluation of bladder endometriosis as concurrent biopsies can be performed to confirm endometriosis. Bladder endometriomas have a typical appearance of edematous bluish submucosal multilocular lesions in the bladder dome or bladder base on cystoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. These findings were similar to the intraoperative cystoscopy findings in our patient.\n\n【21】MRI has been shown to have an accuracy of up to 98% in diagnosis of endometriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. MRI is also beneficial in assessing the extent and severity of endometriosis in other sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In our patient, the diagnosis was not clear before surgery as the patient did not have typical features of endometriosis. Her initial pelvic ultrasound and CT scan were suspicious for a possible pelvic malignancy with bladder invasion. Moreover, she did not have clinical features of endometriosis as she was asymptomatic and her CA125 was not elevated. The MRI showed features of possible bladder endometriosis such as T1 hyperintense and T2 hypointense foci in the bladder lesion. However, as malignancy could not be entirely excluded, surgery was performed for histological diagnosis.\n\n【22】In our retrospective review of the MRI findings of our patient with hindsight of the final histology, we noted that the area of bladder endometriosis was closely associated with the Cesarean scar niche and tract. This suggests that the isolated bladder endometriosis in our patient may be secondary to her previous Cesarean section and Cesarean scar niche. Our theory is also supported by the fact that our patient only had isolated bladder endometriosis with no endometriosis seen elsewhere in the pelvis both macroscopically and microscopically. The patient also has no recurrence of endometriosis 3 years post-operatively despite conservation of her ovaries. A similar case of isolated bladder endometriosis in a patient with two prior Cesarean sections has been described by Ayari et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The patient underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor and was started on estrogen-progesterone medications post-operatively. At her 3-month follow-up, there were no signs of recurrence. Another previous case report by Posner et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> described a patient with bladder endometriosis and two prior Cesarean sections who underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, hysterectomy, partial cystectomy, distal right ureterectomy, and ureteroneocystostomy. During pelvic exploration, a solitary endometrioma was noted involving the distal right ureter, right posterior bladder wall and uterus. As the mass was mobilized from the uterus, an attenuated myometrium was encountered, which appeared to be the site of a prior Cesarean section. Histologic examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis of vesical endometriosis that extended from the uterus to the bladder mucosa. No other endometriomas were identified. These findings correlate to the MRI findings in our patient. However, it is difficult to say if the tract seen on MRI is the cause of her bladder endometriosis or a result of chronic endometriosis. There is also no prior data on Cesarean scar niche and the occurrence of bladder endometriosis, and it is also not known if repair of the niche can prevent such a complication. Moving forward, more attention should be paid to the Cesarean scar niche to establish if there is a correlation between the niche and endometriosis although this would be challenging because of the rarity of the condition.\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】Bladder endometriosis can often mimic pelvic malignancy resulting in radical surgeries. They can be a rare complication of a previous Cesarean section. More data is needed to determine the relationship of Cesarean scar niche in bladder endometriosis.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>It was obtained from the patient.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CLKL summarized the case, performed the literature review, and wrote the manuscript; CG performed the literature review and wrote the manuscript; YKL supervised the write up of case and was the surgeon in charge of the care of the patient.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Data Availability</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>  </u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:52:56", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:53:06", "cost": 10.232}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:53", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:52:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:52:47"}

Pigmentation on the lips and the oral mucosa. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【5】Initially, we performed endoscopic polypectomy for colorectal polyps, using intravenous analgesics (pentazocine 15 mg and hydroxyzine 25 mg). Three polyps were resected, the largest being 2 cm in size. The pathology was compatible with PJ-type polyps. Two weeks later, the patient underwent oral DBE after obtaining informed consent. We performed DBE carefully in the same manner as we would for an adult, except under general anesthesia. Many polyps were found in the jejunum, the largest 3 cm in size . Almost all the polyps were pedunculated, and 10 polyps were removed. In view of the low rates of carcinomatous change of PJ-type polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, we retrieved only 2 large polyps in order to obtain pathological samples. The pathology revealed that these polyps were compatible with the PJ-type polyps, and had no adenomatous or carcinomatous components . Although small polyps remained in the ileum, patient’s family did not want removal at that time. She was well after the polypectomy and discharged 6 days later.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2.

Since there were no therapeutic strategies for PJS except surgery prior to the advent of DBE, frequent laparotomies were needed. Pathologically, PJ-type polyps are mostly hamartomatous, and those less than 3 cm in size have a low risk of carcinomatous changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. If the polyps are resected without laparotomies, patients appear to have no need of surgery.\n\n【10】DBE is now available for the diagnosis and treatment of small intestinal diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Some studies have revealed that DBE is useful to PJS, but primarily for adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\- 7 \\]</u>. However, it is sometimes necessary for children to undergo surgery. To date, only several children have underwent polypectomy using DBE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In an infant, perforation was reported due to adhesion after polypectomy. PJS in children is associated with a high recurrence rate of small intestinal polyps in short-term follow-ups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In our patient, 2 years after the first polypectomy mentioned above, we performed polypectomy safely from the anus with DBE. She appeared to have no abdominal adhesion. Our patient is approximately 140 cm in height and 47 kg in weight, which are within the mean ± 2 SD of Japanese children of the same age. In cases in which adhesion occurs following laparotomies, we often experience difficulty in inserting the scope into the small intestine. In such conditions, it is preferable to perform DBE in patients with PJS prior to surgery. The present case reveals that repeated polypectomy with DBE is safe and useful for PJS, even in children.\n\n【11】By perfoming repeated polypectomy with DBE, we expect that in the future there will no longer be a need for unnecessary laparotomies in case of PJS.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 11:50:27", "endTime": "2024/09/19 11:50:32", "cost": 5.338}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:52", "update_time": "2024-09-18 19:50:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 19:50:17"}

In the adult patient cohort, central nervous system infection leading to meningitis is clinically one of the most commonly seen manifestations of Listeria infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The incidence rate of listeriosis in those on anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α therapy is around three cases per 10,000 patient-years, significantly higher than in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】TNF is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The inflamed bowel mucosa is made up of a variety of stromal and immune cells that produce both soluble and membrane-bound TNF, along with other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-18 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Hence, TNF inhibitors are a clinically effective option in the treatment of several chronic inflammatory disorders making it even more important for clinicians to be aware of their risks. These agents essentially alter the natural course of ulcerative colitis by encouraging mucosal healing and delaying potential colectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. There are multiple case reports detailing the development of opportunistic infections associated with anti-TNF therapy. Examples of opportunistic infections described in the literature include tuberculosis, listeriosis, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and viral or invasive fungal infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】This report explores the rationale, risks and benefits of anti-TNF therapy through a case where infliximab was introduced as rescue therapy for steroid-unresponsive ulcerative colitis (UC). This is one of the few case-based reviews on listeriosis in patients on anti-TNF therapy to present a conundrum with regards to immunosuppression. Most case reports reviewed as part of this article demonstrate the potential severity and heterogeneity of L. monocytogenes infection 通用删除1(英):<u>( Supplementary Material 1 , www.journalmc.org)</u>. Primary teams generally had to commence the patient on an extended course of antibiotics and consider alternative immunosuppression or reintroduce the same agent once their patient was more stable. However, what makes our report stand out is the “domino effect” of listeriosis where severe infection compels the clinician to hold immunosuppressants only to lead to worsening colitis.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Investigations\n\n【6】We hereby present a case of a 62-year-old female with a history of UC first diagnosed in December 2020, initially maintained with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). She had an acute severe flare of UC in August 2021 which prompted initiation of infliximab with a 10 mg/kg loading dose (week 0, 2, 6 and 8). Computed tomography (CT) findings show significant colonic inflammation . Other investigations included positive serology for perinuclear anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and antinuclear antibody (ANA). She had a prior history of breast carcinoma and a family history of UC.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. (a, b) There is circumferential thickening of the distal ascending (blue arrow), transverse (green arrow), descending (yellow arrow) and rectosigmoid colon (orange arrow) in keeping with colitis. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【8】The patient received two infliximab infusions at week 0 and 2 and re-presented to the emergency department with fever, cough, vomiting and diarrhea associated with generalized weakness, confusion and lethargy. On examination, her Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score was low (12/15) with acutely altered mental status and mild neck stiffness. General examination was unremarkable. Along with baseline bloods, a chest X-ray was performed and a full septic screen including blood and urine cultures was sent. C-reactive protein was elevated at 94 mg/dL (normal range 0 - 5 mg/dL). Hemoglobin was stable at 12.8 g/dL (normal range 12 - 15 g/dL). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) was not detected. Chest X-ray demonstrated a lower respiratory tract infection and she was commenced on broad-spectrum intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam (Tazocin) as well as fluids.\n\n【9】Due to new-onset confusion and persistent hypotension, she was admitted to the intensive care unit. Shortly after admission, her blood cultures were positive for L. monocytogenes . There was no acute intracranial pathology detected on the brain CT with normal parenchymal brain appearances reported . Neck stiffness is a red flag symptom for meningeal irritation and hence a lumbar puncture was performed.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 2. Computed tomography of brain (09/10/2021) demonstrating normal parenchymal appearances. Lumbar puncture revealed grossly cloudy cerebrospinal fluid with massively elevated white blood cell count of 1,600/mm 3 , with 70% polymorphonuclear neutrophils and 30% mononuclear cells. No organisms were seen on gram stains with no growth on cultures but Listeria monocytogenes DNA was detected via polymerase chain reaction. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose was low at 1.8 mmol/L (2.22 to 4.44) and CSF protein was raised at 1.75 g/L (0.15 to 0.6) which confirmed a bacterial meningitis. Apart from bacteremia and meningitis, there were no other manifestations of listeriosis in this patient. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【11】After appropriate inpatient management, she suffered a flare of colitis 2 months later which showed Mayo 3 endoscopic appearance .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 3. Endoscopic photograph of sigmoid - edematous mucosa (blue arrow), erosions (green arrow) and ulcerations (grey arrow). Also note absence of vascular pattern with marked erythematous appearances. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【13】Diagnosis\n\n【14】Her initial diagnosis was an acute severe UC. She received high-dose immunosuppression with infliximab thereafter and developed L. monocytogenes sepsis with meningeal involvement.\n\n【15】Treatment\n\n【16】With the diagnosis of L. monocytogenes septicemia, her infliximab was held and was started on a 21-day course of intravenous amoxicillin. After completing the antibiotic course, infliximab was discontinued (third induction dose was not administered).\n\n【17】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【18】The patient recovered from L. monocytogenes meningitis and was followed up in the outpatient clinic. Vedolizumab, an α4β7 integrin antagonist, was commenced in November 2021 after discussion with multidisciplinary team (MDT) as a more gut selective biological agent. During this period, the option of a colectomy was discussed with her at several points but was declined.\n\n【19】Unfortunately, she presented again with an acute flare of severe UC 2 months later with Mayo 3 on endoscopy. Upon discussion with MDT, she was a suitable candidate for colectomy due to severe pancolitis, recurrent flares and recent sepsis while on biological therapy. She underwent a subtotal colectomy and had an unremarkable post-surgical course.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】IBD patients on immunosuppression are at increased risk of opportunistic infections compared to the general population. This risk may be further compounded by a patient’s comorbidities or advanced age. An opportunistic infection is often described as a microbial infection that is non-pathogenic in the general population but occurs with increasing frequency and severity in patients with a weakened immune system either due to their underlying disease or its management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This case is important because it encourages clinicians to remain vigilant for opportunistic infections in IBD patients on potent immunosuppression. It also raises awareness of the importance of tuberculosis and virology testing before the initiation of anti-TNF biologics. We highlight such infections as a key safety issue and discuss how we can better handle them in clinical practice. Early recognition and prompt workup is imperative to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with pathogens like L. monocytogenes . ECCO guidance recommends the discontinuation of anti-TNF-α biologics during infection with Listeria monocytogenes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. As seen in the case described above, the consequent decision to withhold immunosuppression runs the risk of relapse of inflammatory colitis. Such inflammatory exacerbations often call for a multidisciplinary team approach, and at times, escalation to surgical management.\n\n【22】We searched PubMed using the search terms “listeria” and “TNF”. A total of 522 results were generated. Additional reports and articles were identified by reading the literature found via electronic searches, of which 25 articles were examined for existing knowledge on this subject as well as clinical learning points. Other articles were excluded due to either pathophysiology dominant content or because they were unrelated to the topic at hand. There were only three articles excluded due to non-English language. Our literature review is not exhaustive but comprised of the most relevant case reports published to date regarding listeriosis in patients commenced on anti-TNF agents 通用删除1(英):<u>( Supplementary Material 1 , www.journalmc.org)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 8 \\- 31 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】We included 25 articles in our review which discussed a total of 44 cases. Of note, we also included a case report of pseudomonas meningitis during vedolizumab treatment. Listeria infections related to immunosuppression presented as meningitis in 23 cases (53.5%), isolated bacteremia in 11 cases (25.6%), and brain abscess in two cases. Other sites of infections also included cerebritis, rhombencephalitis, ankle osteomyelitis, endocarditis, terminal ileitis, septic joint arthritis and gallbladder infections. This demonstrates the heterogeneity of listeriosis leading to variable patient presentations, thereby highlighting the high index of suspicion we need to maintain for such opportunistic infections in patients with risk factors. Seventeen patients (38.6%) had UC, 11 (25%) patients had Crohn’s disease (CD), and 13 (29.5%) had rheumatoid arthritis. There was one case of multiple myeloma as well as psoriatic arthritis. Thirty-five case reports featured the use of infliximab. Where infliximab was commenced, 21 cases (60%) developed symptoms of infection after 1 - 2 doses. Nearly all of the reported cases had concomitant immunosuppression on board such as corticosteroids, azathioprine or mercaptopurine which further rendered these patients vulnerable to opportunistic infections 通用删除1(英):<u>( Supplementary Material 1 , www.journalmc.org)</u>.\n\n【24】Immunosuppressants such as anti-TNF therapy, corticosteroids, mercaptopurine and azathioprine have become the mainstay of management in IBD. Anti-TNF therapy is also used widely for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis 通用删除1(英):<u>( Supplementary Material 1 , www.journalmc.org)</u>.\n\n【25】Most patients diagnosed with listeriosis tend to have an invasive infection, meaning the bacteria can potentially spread from their intestines to the blood, causing severe bloodstream infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. The World Health Organisation recognizes the following as risk factors for listeria: pregnancy, patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), cancer and hematological malignancies like leukemia, solid organ transplant recipients or a background of chronic steroid use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】The patient was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2018 for which she underwent resection and received chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She was also more susceptible to opportunistic infections due to the recent initiation of anti-TNF-α therapy and recurrent admissions where concomitant high-dose steroids were prescribed for flares of acute severe UC. These vulnerable patient groups should be advised to avoid high-risk meat products such as deli meat as well as supermarket processed meats - this may include cured, cooked and/or fermented sausages and meats, unpasteurised dairy products and cold-smoked fish 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】In this case, two biologics were featured - infliximab and vedolizumab. Infliximab is a mouse/human chimeric immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the cytokine TNF-alpha. In the European Union, it is licensed for the management of IBD, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis as well as psoriatic arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>. Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody with α4β7 integrin antagonist activity. It is a humanized monoclonal antibody with selectivity for the gut that is indicated for use in adults with moderate to severe UC or CD. This is seen being used in clinical practice for patients who either had an inadequate response to, experienced disease relapse, or had intolerance to either conventional UC or CD management or a TNF-alpha inhibitor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】The above patient’s treatment for UC was escalated to infliximab (second-line rescue therapy) and eventual surgical intervention in accordance with the guidance provided by the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 36 \\]</u>. Although she refused colonoscopy at the index admission, CT imaging at the time demonstrated circumferential thickening of the distal ascending, transverse, descending and rectosigmoid colon in keeping with colitis. The extensive nature of her colitis in conjunction with the prolonged duration of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain warranted the use of oral 5-ASA (mesalazine) and steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 37 \\]</u>. She was later escalated to anti-TNF therapy due to frequent flares.\n\n【29】There is ongoing debate surrounding the optimal dosing of infliximab as rescue therapy in acute severe colitis. The British Society of Gastroenterology recommends an initial dose of 5 mg/kg infliximab as second-line therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. Induction with an “intensified” regimen has been explored in one of two ways: either through 1) higher infliximab concentrations or through 2) an accelerated infliximab dosing strategy. There is some evidence that during periods of severe inflammation, there is increased infliximab clearance due to factors such as inflammatory burden, fecal loss and generation of anti-drug antibodies. Further, case-control and case series level data have revealed that an intensified induction strategy may reduce colectomy rates in the short term after an acute exacerbation of UC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 39 \\]</u>. This is one of the reasons why some clinicians have adopted the 10 mg/kg dose as “salvage” therapy; however, there is insufficient data to make a recommendation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Surgical management is indicated in UC where patients have disease refractory to medical therapy or have intolerable adverse effects to medications. Other surgical indications also include toxic megacolon, perforation or life-threatening bleeding. In the acute setting, a subtotal colectomy with formation of an end ileostomy with long rectal stump is generally recommended. The gold standard would be a proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) which has been shown to generate satisfactory patient outcomes. It is avoided in the emergency setting as there is a higher risk of surgical complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. In this case, the patient underwent a subtotal colectomy as an intermediate procedure for severe pancolitis and recurrent disease flares.\n\n【31】Serious and opportunistic infections should be on our diagnostic radar even before we commence immunomodulator therapy in IBD. It is important to screen patients for viral infections such as hepatitis, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) as well as tuberculosis and recommend vaccination and prophylaxis as appropriate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In a patient with acute severe colitis, immunosuppression plays a significant role in their management but they also potentiate severe infections and septicemia. However, if stopped or held during infections, the patient can develop worsening colitis culminating in colectomy. In conclusion, we should aim for more rigorous pre-biological screening, patient education about high-risk foods and better recognition and prompt management of both opportunistic infections and acute severe colitis.\n\n【32】Learning points\n\n【33】Our review demonstrates the risks of opportunistic infections with anti-TNF therapy and the importance of counselling patients before initiation of immunomodulators about the avoidance of high-risk foods for listeriosis such as soft cheeses and unpasteurized milk. In addition, we should be wary of holding immunosuppression in patients with severe colitis - worsening colitis may lead to need for future colectomy. Lastly, it is important to consider a patient’s immune risk profile (i.e. underlying malignancy, comorbidities, older adults, obesity, diabetes, etc.) when commencing immunosuppression - this may guide dosing and also encourage early and close surveillance of high-risk patients.\n\n【34】删除2:<u>Supplementary Material</u>\n\n【35】删除3:<u>Suppl 1.

Around 60% of patients will have one or more of these risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The epidemiology of Candida bloodstream infection is changing, as most invasive fungal infections previously caused by C. albicans , are now increasingly caused by C. glabrata , C. parapsilosis and C. krusei 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The change in the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream infection means that in vitro testing should include genus- and species-specific susceptibility testing to support clinical decisions.\n\n【2】The use of fluconazole prophylaxis has been associated with the increase in colonization and disease from azole resistant Candida strains 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. It is reported that, in patients with more than 2 weeks azole prophylaxis, over 17% of Candida spp. exhibited a reduced susceptibility to fluconazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Intrinsic low-level and acquired high-level azole resistance of C. glabrata has been postulated to have contributed to the emergence of this fungal pathogen in the intensive care unit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. As the use of the echinocandins has increased so has selection pressure, and sporadic reports of echinocandin resistance have begun to appear in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The molecular mechanisms of resistance to the echinocandins relate to amino acid substitutions within the FKS1 target gene. At the time of this patient’s treatment, the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) suggested a “susceptible only” breakpoint of < 2 µg/mL for Candida spp. for caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, infections involving isolates with target alterations in the FKS1 gene did not necessarily show minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) above this breakpoint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. In addition, in vitro susceptibility testing does not take into account the effect of serum protein binding, which may influence the relative clinical efficacy of the echinocandins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Thus, MIC and susceptibility testing are often poor predictors of clinical outcome in Candida bloodstream infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Recently, the CLSI have reset the breakpoints for Candida based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling. Echinocandin breakpoints for Candida are now species specific and in the case of C. glabrata , different for micafungin than to caspofungin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Similarly, the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) have also set drug-specific breakpoints for Candida for each of the echinocandin drugs, although due to inter laboratory variation in MIC ranges, the breakpoints for caspofungin against C. glabrata have not yet been established by EUCAST 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Here we report a case of breakthrough Candida bloodstream infection in a 16-year-old male who had previously undergone an emergency laparotomy and had received repeated courses of fluconazole and caspofungin.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】In July 2008, a 16-year-old male weighing 50 kg was admitted to hospital with a previous history of constipation and a 4-day history of abdominal pain. Vital signs on admission included a respiratory rate of 32 bpm, blood pressure of 111/60 mmHg, and temperature of 38 °C. The patient was clinically dehydrated and peritonitic; a chest X-ray showed free intraperitoneal gas. Emergency laparotomy revealed a well-established perforation of the mid-sigmoid colon and extensive fecal contamination. A Hartmann’s procedure was carried out, followed by thorough peritoneal lavage and primary abdominal closure. The patient was subsequently transferred to intensive care. In the post-operative period antibacterial prophylaxis with cefuroxime (750 mg, TDS, days 1 to 6), metronidazole (500 mg, TDS, days 1 to 6), piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g, TDS, Days 6 to 12), gentamicin (320 mg, OD, days 7 to 13) and erythromycin (250 mg, TDS, days 7 to 12) was given.\n\n【6】Recovery from surgery was hampered by multiple infectious complications. On day 3, the patient became pyrexial with a temperature of 39.2 °C. Staphylococcus epidermidis was cultured from blood cultures. The CVC was replaced on Day 9 from which Candida tropicalis was reported on day 12; in view of this, fluconazole 400 mg OD was then started. Despite continued combined anti-microbial (meropenem 1 g, TDS days 13 to 18) and anti-fungal therapy, blood cultures remained positive for S. epidermidis and C. tropicalis .\n\n【7】On day 12, the patient also developed a wound infection, and CT scan revealed a pelvic collection. Following dehiscence of the abdominal wound on day 16 which was treated with a VAC dressing, the patient developed a high volume enterocutaneous fistula on day 23 which drained several liters of effluent a day. The CVC was replaced on day 19, and again on day 26, when a Hickman line was introduced instead. The CVC tip culture returned as C. albicans positive. On day 35, fluconazole was replaced with caspofungin (70 mg first dose and then 50 mg OD) due to persistent fever and positive C. tropicalis blood culture. Two further line changes also followed. On day 46, the patient's fever finally abated and bloods returned without fungal-positive cultures. During caspofungin therapy the patient also received antimicrobial therapy with meropenem (1 g, TDS, days 35 to 46), vancomycin (1 g, BD, days 41 to 45) and gentamicin (240 mg, OD, days 32 to 38).\n\n【8】After a couple of days of being afebrile, the patient re-spiked a temperature, and blood cultures once again became positive for S. epidermidis . The CVC was changed for the sixth time and the patient received gentamicin therapy between days 48 and 51. On day 55, meropenem (1 g, TDS) and vancomycin (1 g, BD) were restarted and given until day 62. On day 60, blood cultures returned positive for C. glabrata . Fluconazole 400 mg OD was re-started and the CVC line changed again. Based on sensitivities , the fluconazole therapy was replaced with caspofungin on day 66. The ninth CVC was removed and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was inserted instead. Despite continued caspofungin therapy, the patient’s condition did not improve. On day 84, the PICC line was replaced under cefuroxime, caspofungin plus voriconazole cover for 48-hours while micafungin availability was arranged by pharmacy. Taurolidine citrate 4% line lock was used for the PICC. Micafungin 100 mg OD was started on day 86. On day 89, the PICC line had to be removed for non-infective reasons and a Hickman line inserted with continued taurolodine lock. Micafungin was given between days 86 to 101, and the patient had no further episodes of infection. The patient received TPN for the whole of this period.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1.

Around 60% of patients will have one or more of these risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The epidemiology of Candida bloodstream infection is changing, as most invasive fungal infections previously caused by C. albicans , are now increasingly caused by C. glabrata , C. parapsilosis and C. krusei 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The change in the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream infection means that in vitro testing should include genus- and species-specific susceptibility testing to support clinical decisions.\n\n【2】The use of fluconazole prophylaxis has been associated with the increase in colonization and disease from azole resistant Candida strains 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. It is reported that, in patients with more than 2 weeks azole prophylaxis, over 17% of Candida spp. exhibited a reduced susceptibility to fluconazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Intrinsic low-level and acquired high-level azole resistance of C. glabrata has been postulated to have contributed to the emergence of this fungal pathogen in the intensive care unit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. As the use of the echinocandins has increased so has selection pressure, and sporadic reports of echinocandin resistance have begun to appear in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The molecular mechanisms of resistance to the echinocandins relate to amino acid substitutions within the FKS1 target gene. At the time of this patient’s treatment, the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) suggested a “susceptible only” breakpoint of < 2 µg/mL for Candida spp. for caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, infections involving isolates with target alterations in the FKS1 gene did not necessarily show minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) above this breakpoint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. In addition, in vitro susceptibility testing does not take into account the effect of serum protein binding, which may influence the relative clinical efficacy of the echinocandins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Thus, MIC and susceptibility testing are often poor predictors of clinical outcome in Candida bloodstream infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Recently, the CLSI have reset the breakpoints for Candida based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling. Echinocandin breakpoints for Candida are now species specific and in the case of C. glabrata , different for micafungin than to caspofungin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Similarly, the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) have also set drug-specific breakpoints for Candida for each of the echinocandin drugs, although due to inter laboratory variation in MIC ranges, the breakpoints for caspofungin against C. glabrata have not yet been established by EUCAST 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【3】Here we report a case of breakthrough Candida bloodstream infection in a 16-year-old male who had previously undergone an emergency laparotomy and had received repeated courses of fluconazole and caspofungin.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】In July 2008, a 16-year-old male weighing 50 kg was admitted to hospital with a previous history of constipation and a 4-day history of abdominal pain. Vital signs on admission included a respiratory rate of 32 bpm, blood pressure of 111/60 mmHg, and temperature of 38 °C. The patient was clinically dehydrated and peritonitic; a chest X-ray showed free intraperitoneal gas. Emergency laparotomy revealed a well-established perforation of the mid-sigmoid colon and extensive fecal contamination. A Hartmann’s procedure was carried out, followed by thorough peritoneal lavage and primary abdominal closure. The patient was subsequently transferred to intensive care. In the post-operative period antibacterial prophylaxis with cefuroxime (750 mg, TDS, days 1 to 6), metronidazole (500 mg, TDS, days 1 to 6), piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g, TDS, Days 6 to 12), gentamicin (320 mg, OD, days 7 to 13) and erythromycin (250 mg, TDS, days 7 to 12) was given.\n\n【6】Recovery from surgery was hampered by multiple infectious complications. On day 3, the patient became pyrexial with a temperature of 39.2 °C. Staphylococcus epidermidis was cultured from blood cultures. The CVC was replaced on Day 9 from which Candida tropicalis was reported on day 12; in view of this, fluconazole 400 mg OD was then started. Despite continued combined anti-microbial (meropenem 1 g, TDS days 13 to 18) and anti-fungal therapy, blood cultures remained positive for S. epidermidis and C. tropicalis .\n\n【7】On day 12, the patient also developed a wound infection, and CT scan revealed a pelvic collection. Following dehiscence of the abdominal wound on day 16 which was treated with a VAC dressing, the patient developed a high volume enterocutaneous fistula on day 23 which drained several liters of effluent a day. The CVC was replaced on day 19, and again on day 26, when a Hickman line was introduced instead. The CVC tip culture returned as C. albicans positive. On day 35, fluconazole was replaced with caspofungin (70 mg first dose and then 50 mg OD) due to persistent fever and positive C. tropicalis blood culture. Two further line changes also followed. On day 46, the patient's fever finally abated and bloods returned without fungal-positive cultures. During caspofungin therapy the patient also received antimicrobial therapy with meropenem (1 g, TDS, days 35 to 46), vancomycin (1 g, BD, days 41 to 45) and gentamicin (240 mg, OD, days 32 to 38).\n\n【8】After a couple of days of being afebrile, the patient re-spiked a temperature, and blood cultures once again became positive for S. epidermidis . The CVC was changed for the sixth time and the patient received gentamicin therapy between days 48 and 51. On day 55, meropenem (1 g, TDS) and vancomycin (1 g, BD) were restarted and given until day 62. On day 60, blood cultures returned positive for C. glabrata . Fluconazole 400 mg OD was re-started and the CVC line changed again. Based on sensitivities , the fluconazole therapy was replaced with caspofungin on day 66. The ninth CVC was removed and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was inserted instead. Despite continued caspofungin therapy, the patient’s condition did not improve. On day 84, the PICC line was replaced under cefuroxime, caspofungin plus voriconazole cover for 48-hours while micafungin availability was arranged by pharmacy. Taurolidine citrate 4% line lock was used for the PICC. Micafungin 100 mg OD was started on day 86. On day 89, the PICC line had to be removed for non-infective reasons and a Hickman line inserted with continued taurolodine lock. Micafungin was given between days 86 to 101, and the patient had no further episodes of infection. The patient received TPN for the whole of this period.\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1.

However, PaO <sub>2 </sub> in the arterial blood sample can be affected by many reasons, one being the presence of metabolically active cells like white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets leading to spurious or pseudo hypoxemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. We present a case of blast crisis due to acute myelogenous leukemia ((AML) presenting with spurious hypoxemia which improved after leukapheresis.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】An 85-year-old elderly female with past medical history of diabetes, hypertension and recent diagnosis of AML was admitted to our ICU with severe metabolic acidosis and acute respiratory failure. She received recent chemotherapy at outside hospital. Her chest X-ray was normal, thereby, ruling out pneumonia or congestive heart failure. Suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism was high with acute hypoxemia in a cancer patient with unimpressive chest X-ray. Transthoracic echocardiography did not show any right heart strain pattern. On arrival, she was clinically in shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and had WBC count of 455,000/µL. Her initial arterial blood gas (ABG) on admission after endotracheal intubation showed pH of 6.64, pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 67 mm Hg and pO <sub>2 </sub> of 29 mm Hg on 100% FiO <sub>2 </sub> but pulse oximetry read SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 100%. Her ICU course was complicated by septic shock, multi-system organ failure and refractory metabolic acidosis. Oncology service was consulted, and patient underwent emergent leukapheresis for blast crisis with improvement in WBC count to 140,000/µL. Her ABG improved to pH of 6.89, pCO <sub>2 </sub> of 30 mm Hg and pO <sub>2 </sub> of 351 mm Hg with SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 100% on pulse oximetry. Her PO <sub>2 </sub> improved dramatically after leukapheresis and removal of WBC from the blood. Family soon opted for comfort care measures, and she developed asystolic cardiac arrest and died.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Hypoxemia is a serious condition commonly seen in the ICU patients. Underlying physiologic derangements include ventilation/perfusion mismatch, hypoventilation, shunt and abnormality of diffusion capacity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. ABG is a common test employed to diagnose hypoxemia. Hypoxemia can be true or spurious. Common clinical conditions leading to hypoxemia in ICU include pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome and congestive heart failure. Pseudo hypoxemia or spurious hypoxemia is an entity where laboratory abnormalities of PaO <sub>2 </sub> are not a true reflection of patient’s bloodstream oxygen tension. Causes of inaccurate measurements of PaO <sub>2 </sub> include improper sampling, delay in transport with failure to cool the specimen, presence of bubbles in the sample, elevated cell count, blood gas analyzer malfunction or miscalibration or methemoglobinemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Spurious hypoxemia has been reported in patients with hyperleukocytosis or thrombocytosis in the setting of hematological malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>. It was first described in 1979 by Fox et al and was coined leukocyte larceny 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This is due to the presence of high number of metabolically active WBCs with elevated consumption of dissolved oxygen in the arterial blood samples 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The rate of oxygen consumption by WBCs is typically not important clinically in majority of patients with normal blood counts. Spuriously low PaO <sub>2 </sub> measurements are common when WBC count exceeds 50,000/µL or with severe thrombocytosis. This entity is not very well described in the critical care literature with not many cases reported in ICU setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>\n\n【6】Patients with hyperleukocytosis in the setting of acute myelogenous or lymphocytic leukemia or blast crisis can develop true or spurious hypoxemia. Causes of true hypoxemia in these patients include sepsis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary leukostasis, leukemic infiltration, hemorrhage and drug-related toxicities. Inconsistencies between SpO <sub>2 </sub> with pulse oximetry and PaO <sub>2 </sub> in the arterial blood can help to differentiate spurious hypoxemia from these causes. In leukocyte larceny, SpO <sub>2 </sub> is normal and PaO <sub>2 </sub> is low. Cooling of blood sample on ice and rapid analysis can help reduce the discrepancy.\n\n【7】Pulse oximetry is the most accurate method to assess oxygenation in patients with hyperleukocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. It measures hemoglobin saturation directly and is unaffected by the plasma oxygen tension. Understanding the concept of spurious hypoxemia in patients with hematologic malignancies will help to prevent unnecessary tests like CT scans and ventilation/perfusion scans to rule out pulmonary embolism, minimizing ICU admission of these patients and saving hospital resources and costs.\n\n【8】Our patient did not undergo these expensive tests for the workup of pulmonary embolism as PaO <sub>2 </sub> improved after leukapheresis.\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】ICU physicians should be vigilant about the concept of pseudo/spurious hypoxemia and leukocyte larceny in patients with leukemias and blast crisis. Causes of true hypoxemia still need to be ruled out in the correct clinical setting. Pulse oximetry is the most reliable and easy method to clinically assess oxygenation in patients with leukocyte larceny.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmc_case", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 09:46:16", "endTime": "2024/09/19 09:47:12", "cost": 55.819}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-17 23:08:52", "update_time": "2024-09-18 17:47:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 17:46:13"}

Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the popularity and use of electronic cigarettes. The expansion of these products and their popularity has resulted in a multi-billion-dollar industry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\- 5 \\]</u>. While electronic cigarettes were initially thought to be a mechanism for smoking cessation with elimination of some of the safety issues related to the inhalation of tobacco smoke, the long-term safety and health effects of these devices and the chemicals delivered require more research 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Electronic cigarettes and the chemicals in the solutions delivered may have widespread effects on the respiratory, immunologic and cardiovascular systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\- 4 \\]</u>. Another concern is the significant rate of use of these products by the adolescent population, which has been highly influenced by successful targeted marketing and the availability of a variety of flavored vaporization solutions. The use of electronic cigarettes with higher nicotine concentrations by youths may increase dependence and the subsequent frequency and intensity of smoking and vaping 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【2】Recent concerns have been raised regarding the potential for significant acute and chronic health care risks of these devices including pneumonitis, airway reactivity and respiratory failure from adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. These effects may be related to nicotine or to the diluent used for aerosolization. Given that many of the acute effects are related to the respiratory system, invasive procedures including bronchoscopy may be required when investigating the etiology of acute respiratory symptomatology. While these procedures frequently require anesthetic care, there is limited information on the perioperative implications of vaping. We present an adolescent who presented to the operating room for bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to investigate the etiology of respiratory involvement following an episode of vaping. The healthcare and end-organ effects of nicotine, tobacco smoke and vaping are discussed, and potential anesthetic implications are presented.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 16-year-old, 59-kg female adolescent presented for anesthetic care during bronchoscopy and BAL. Past medical history included familial porphyria cutanea tarda, protein S deficiency and environmental allergies for which she took levocetirizine, 5 mg daily. Past social history included living on a farm with multiple farm animals and hay, vaping, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) inhalation and second-hand cigarette smoke exposure at home. Her past family history was positive for asthma, hematological disorders and polycystic ovary syndrome. She had originally presented to the emergency department (ED) with cough and difficulty breathing for 4 days and a 1-week history of chest pain. Prior to her ED admission, she was diagnosed with left lower lobe pneumonia and started on azithromycin by a physician at an urgent care clinic. She also had increased albuterol inhaler use (approximately 4 - 5 daily uses) without symptomatic relief. The respiratory symptoms worsened with exertion, heat exposure and lying supine. She also reported decreased oral intake and energy but denied fevers or rashes. Physical examination in the ED revealed tachypnea, diminished air entry bilaterally, inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, rales and labored breathing. Her vital signs were notable for a pulse of 111 beats/min, respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min, blood pressure of 122/82 mm Hg, temperature of 36.7 °C and oxygen saturation (SpO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 91% on room air. A chest radiograph demonstrated multi-focal airspace disease suggestive of pneumonia with hilar lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary embolism was ruled out by computed tomography angiography (CTA) which showed normal main, branch, lobar and segmental pulmonary arteries with normal enhancement. However, the CTA did show bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, the largest of which was 2.3 cm in dimension, and multi-focal airspace opacities in all lobes. The electrocardiogram revealed a prolonged QTc of 531 ms with T-wave abnormalities, so pediatric cardiology was consulted. A complete blood count was negative for leukocytosis but did show a left shift. Procalcitonin, hepatic function tests and urinalysis were unremarkable. Electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were normal except for mild hypokalemia (3 mEq/L). C-reactive protein and sedimentation rate were elevated on multiple tests. Treatment in the ED included inhaled albuterol-ipratropium, oral prednisone (60 mg) and ceftriaxone. Three months prior to this acute presentation, the patient had been diagnosed with pneumonia and multi-focal small airways disease, and at that time, the differential diagnosis included environmental exposure causing hypersensitivity pneumonitis as she had a history of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) use by vaping, farm environment exposure and other infectious causes. During the previous visit, a complete blood count showed eosinophilia of 33% (reference range 1-4%) and a respiratory infection antigen array was negative. Sputum cultures showed mixed bacteria with purulent secretions. Fungal antibody panel showed rare Candida albicans . HIV 1 and 2 serology results were negative. Histoplasma, Blastomyces, Aspergillus antigens and antibodies were all negative. Legionella serology was negative, and a TB test was negative. Given the uncertain etiology of her recurrent lung disease, she was scheduled for bronchoscopy and BAL in the operating room. She was held nil per os for 6 h and transferred to the operating room where routine American Society of Anesthesiologists’ monitors were placed. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and endotracheal intubation facilitated by the administration of rocuronium. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in air and oxygen. Bronchoscopic findings included profuse edema throughout the right and left tracheobronchial tree, mucopurulent mucus plugs in the left lower lobe and throughout the right tracheobronchial tree. She tolerated the procedure well with no intraoperative complications. After recovery in the post-anesthesia care unit, she was discharged to the inpatient ward without postoperative complications. BAL showed 61% eosinophils and Charcot-Leyden crystals without signs of parasitic larvae or eggs, consistent with the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis or acute eosinophilic pneumonia. All subsequent cultures and the infectious disease work-up were negative. The patient’s oxygen requirement postoperatively was stable at 2 L/min via nasal cannula. Following the procedure, the patient was started on systemic corticosteroids. Her oxygen requirement decreased, and she was weaned to room air over the next 48 - 72 h. She was later discharged home on postoperative day 4 on a prolonged corticosteroid course. After discharge, she remained compliant with the treatment plan. Her symptoms slowly resolved, and follow-up chest radiograph showed clearing of the pulmonary involvement. Spirometry conducted 2 months after the start of the corticosteroid regimen revealed a mild obstructive pattern that resolved with albuterol. A repeat complete blood count showed a normal white blood count of 7.1 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL and decreased peripheral eosinophilia of 10.7% (reference range 1.0-4.0%). The patient reported a good state of health with no further symptoms after finishing the corticosteroid treatment regimen and continued cessation of vaping and THC use.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Although the detrimental and addictive effects of tobacco (nicotine) use have been clearly demonstrated over the last few decades, tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable death globally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. There has been a gradual decline in global tobacco use due to preventive measures such as reduced access to cigarettes and increased public awareness on its risks including lung and other malignancies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inflammatory bowel disease, acute kidney injury, osteoporosis and bone fractures, stroke and coronary artery disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\- 11 \\]</u>. Another reason for the decline in tobacco use has been a shift towards the use of other nicotine products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems (e-cigarettes) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. This shift has been encouraged and aided by aggressive promotion of e-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids; however, evidence-based medicine has not been able to provide adequate data to document their efficacy in this regard. Moreover, current research even suggests that the use of e-cigarettes may encourage the use of conventional cigarettes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\- 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【7】E-cigarettes use has increased for several reasons including reduced costs, perceived reduced toxicity, more freedom of use in smoke-free places, and to allow for smoking cessation. An especially important population within this shift from tobacco use to electronic nicotine systems (e-cigarettes) are adolescents. E-cigarette use among adolescents and high school students has increased significantly in the last decade to rates as high as 25% among high school students. Measurement of serum cotinine, a marker for tobacco use, has shown that there are significant similarities between the effects of e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Although e-cigarettes reduce exposure to the harmful toxins in conventional tobacco and cigarette smoke, they introduce a new array of potential toxins in the diluents used to carry the nicotine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. They also expose the smoker to potentially higher levels of nicotine and thereby elevate its addiction potential 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【8】The physiological effects from the use of e-cigarettes are numerous to both the users as well as non-users who are exposed to the vapor and the exhaled smoke. The aerosol from e-cigarettes may contain harmful substances and chemicals including ultrafine particles with flavoring such as diacetyl that cause serious lung disease, carcinogens, as well as heavy metals such as nickel, tin and lead. There are over 7,700 flavors available with more than 240 new flavors added every month 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Toxic chemicals may be used to increase the e-cigarette solution’s colors, aromatic properties and scents in order to appeal to the adolescent population. Acute effects of e-cigarette use have been reported to involve the pulmonary, cardiovascular and immune systems.\n\n【9】Pulmonary effects of toxic chemicals within the solution include disturbances of the cough reflex, throat irritation, dry cough and increased chronic respiratory problems with an increased incidence of sinusitis and rhinitis. A recent study involving healthy smokers (n = 30, 14 men and 16 women with a mean age of 34.8 years) compared to a control group (n = 10) showed that a 5-min exposure to a e-cigarette cartridge led to immediate respiratory changes within the experimental group when comparing respiratory function tests before and after exposure including changes dynamic lung volume, exhaled nitric oxide levels and total respiratory resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>. The study cohort included patients ranging in age from 19 to 56 years with no history of lung disease, currently using no medications and no acute illnesses in the previous two weeks. Specific changes in the experimental group included a decreased fraction of exhaled nitric oxide, increased respiratory impedance, increased inspiratory flow resistance and increased overall peripheral airway resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】In addition to the respiratory effects related to diluent for e-cigarette use, the nicotine within the aerosol solution may cause vasoconstriction, decreased microvascular tissue perfusion and oxygenation, and increase the risk for cardiovascular disturbances. E-cigarette inhalation affects vascular function, specifically endothelial function and inhibits nitric oxide bioavailability leading to decreased vasodilation and increased platelet activation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 21 , 22 \\]</u>. The nicotine within e-cigarette aerosol may activate the sympathetic nervous system, thereby resulting in vasoconstriction of the coronary blood vessels as well as increases in heart rate and blood pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Animal studies have noted that nicotine increases the risk of arrhythmias by reducing the ventricular fibrillation threshold and promoting the development of ventricular fibrillation after experimental myocardial infarctions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. These changes and others have showcased nicotine’s role in impaired heart remodeling, increased risk of heart failure, sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmias, and progressive heart failure due to cardiovascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 23 \\]</u>. Overall, nicotine leads to increased hemodynamic instability through the increased release of catecholamines under general anesthesia. E-cigarettes may also increase the risk of nicotine toxicity due to the increased availability of high concentrations of nicotine in the e-cigarette solutions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Nicotine toxicity during adolescence has recently been associated with significant neuronal deficits in auditory processing, working memory, attentiveness, with an increase in impulsivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. Other studies and human case reports have shown decreased density and viability of Kupffer cells, increases in complement protein activation and deposition onto hepatic Kupffer cells, enhanced hydrogen peroxide production due to increased xanthine oxidase and peroxidase activity and ultimately increased reactive oxygen species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 26 \\]</u>. The potential deleterious physiologic implications of e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury (EVALI) are significant with recent reports in the lay literature of death related to vaping and its associated lung injury.\n\n【12】During the perioperative period, e-cigarettes have recently been found to be associated with pro-inflammatory effects, increased cytotoxicity and decreased immune defenses, all leading to increased perioperative risk for patients undergoing surgical procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. Due to the physiological similarities of the effects of tobacco use and e-cigarette use, perioperative and postoperative considerations between the two appear to be similar 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. For instance, heavy tobacco or e-cigarette uses are both associated with increased risk of systemic postoperative complications including wound dehiscence and surgical site infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 29 \\]</u>. Additional postoperative complications of tobacco usage included venous thromboembolism, acute cardiac or cerebrovascular events, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, urinary tract infections and pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 28 \\]</u>. A recent analysis reported an increased postoperative complication rate (42.5% vs. 8.9%, P < 0.001) when comparing smokers to those who have never smoked, the majority of these being infection-related 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 , 30 \\]</u>. Following spinal decompression and fusion, smoking has been shown to be an independent risk factor for infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. Other common postoperative complications reported in smokers include pulmonary and cardiac related morbidity such as postoperative pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure, myocardial infarction and arrhythmias. Smoking has also been shown to have transient effects on local tissue microenvironments leading to prolonged inflammation and defective reparative cell functioning which may result in delayed healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. More superficially, a systematic review reported numerous perioperative changes result from smoking including an imbalance of proteolytic enzymes and their respective inhibitors, decreased tissue oxygenation and aerobic metabolism, reduced fibroblast proliferation and migration leading to the downregulation of collagen synthesis and deposition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】As with all anesthetic care, preoperative preparation begins with a thorough preoperative evaluation and identification of acute issues as well as chronic comorbid conditions. Although asking patients regarding their cigarette/tobacco usage is normal practice, inquiring specifically about e-cigarette usage has also become important as the various health effects of e-cigarette use need to be considered for patients undergoing anesthesia. Patients may deny tobacco use and yet continue e-cigarette use without considering its impact. As noted above, many of the effects and concerns of e-cigarette parallel those related to tobacco use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>. Although abstinence from smoking is suggested prior to major surgical procedures, guidelines regarding e-cigarette use have not been universally defined. Cessation of smoking for 4 - 6 weeks prior to a procedure has been shown to decrease the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\- 37 \\]</u>. However, cessation closer to the time of surgery may increase bronchorrhea and the incidence of perioperative respiratory complications.\n\n【14】When considering the end-organ effects of vaping and its potential perioperative implications, attention must be focused on both the chemical inhaled and the carrier solution. Nicotine affects hepatic microsomal enzymes and the activity of cytochrome P-450 mixed oxidase metabolic pathways, altering the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many anesthetic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. E-cigarette use results in the production of toluene and other volatile organic compounds that possess central nervous system depressant effects which may alter a patient’s anesthetic requirements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 39 \\]</u>. In addition to the hepatic effects, nicotine in e-cigarettes increases airway resistance and impedance through direct stimulation of afferent pathways in the bronchial mucosa, triggering the parasympathetic cholinergic pathways leading to bronchoconstriction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 40 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】Managing the patient with suspected EVALI may include hospitalization, to treat decreased O <sub>2 </sub> saturation or respiratory insufficiency, the impact of which may be escalated in patients with comorbid respiratory conditions. Treatment plans may include corticosteroids to treat hypersensitivity pneumonitis and early initiation of antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia. As noted in our patient, the most predominant acute effects related to the respiratory system and e-cigarette use were increased airway reactivity, presenting as bronchoconstriction, bronchospasm, and air-trapping, similar to obstructive airway with depressed pulmonary function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 \\]</u>. Regardless of the etiology, increased airway reactivity should be acutely treated with albuterol. Given involvement of the cholinergic pathway, the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents (ipratropium) may be useful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 42 \\]</u>. Additionally, prior to endotracheal intubation, topical or intravenous lidocaine may be administered to suppress laryngeal hyper-reactivity. Warming and humidifying the inspired gases may also be helpful in reducing airway reactivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 43 \\]</u>. Acute treatment of intraoperative bronchospasm may respond to deepening the level of anesthesia or inhaled β-adrenergic agonists 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 \\]</u>. Refractory cases may require intravenous epinephrine, ketamine or magnesium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 42 \\]</u>. In particular, the volatile anesthetics such as sevoflurane and isoflurane produce significantly sustained bronchodilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 45 \\]</u>. Patients should be counseled on the negative effects of e-cigarette use on recovery including the potential for increased postoperative respiratory issues, decreased wound healing and an increased incidence of postoperative infections. When considering the effects of e-cigarette use on the perioperative course, attention should be directed toward both the diluent and the chemical inhaled. These agents may have significant end-organ effects due to their direct irritant properties as well as the profound physiologic effects of the chemicals inhaled.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Financial Disclosure</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None to declare.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed Consent</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>In accordance with IRB of Nationwide Children’s Hospital, need for documentation of informed consent waved.</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Amogha Krishna contributed to incorporation of edits, preparation of secondary and final drafts.

Collateral history obtained suggested changes in personality and behavior from pre-morbid baseline which include disorganized behavior, increasing agitation and poor coping over a 4-week period. A brain CT was normal. An electroencephalography (EEG) showed moderately diffuse slowing. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis with glucose and protein within the normal range. Her serum and CSF were sent to screen for infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune and metabolic cause of encephalitis which were all subsequently negative . She was commenced on levetiracetam and intravenous acyclovir .\n\n删除1:<u>| Click to view | Table 1. List of Investigations and Results |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n删除1:<u>| Click for large image | Figure 1. Timeline of the case report. |\n| --- | --- |</u>\n\n【6】On day 2, her symptoms deteriorated rapidly. She evolved into a state of mutism, unpredictable episodes of extreme agitation and a dramatic deterioration in social conduct. Further EEG studies and brain imaging by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were unremarkable. She was commenced on intravenous methylprednisolone on day 2.\n\n【7】On day 3, her symptoms deteriorated further. She became increasingly confused with intermittent episodes of psychomotor excitation and abrupt stereotyped movement. She was assessed by the liaison psychiatry team. On mental state examination, the patient was sitting abnormally still with minimal interaction. She was verbally unresponsive to majority of the questions. She had a fixed stare with occasional shifts of attention. There was no evidence of posturing. When she did verbalize, there was evidence of intermittent echolalia. There was evidence of abrupt repetitive motor activity, i.e. abruptly standing on the bed followed by tumbling forwards. There was evidence of automatic obedience and ambitendency, i.e. she was observed to be stuck in mid-way from standing to sitting position for several minutes. She scored 16 out 69 on a Bush-Francis catatonia rating scale.\n\n【8】Her condition deteriorated further on day 12 with worsening agitation which required sedation to manage the challenging behavior due to risk of self-injury. She was commenced on regular olanzapine at this stage. Methyprednisolone was stopped after 5 days and was switched to oral prednisolone. On day 9, she was commenced on intravenous immunoglobulins for 5 days with no response. On day 15, she developed symptoms of autonomic instability which include episodes of bradycardia, tachycardia, and hypoventilation. She was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in which she required intubation and full assisted ventilation. In ICU, she had five sessions of plasmapheresis with a trial of weekly rituximab. She responded well to the combination of plasmapheresis and rituximab. There was a difficulty in weaning off sedation initially due to her challenging behavior which required high-dose olanzapine. She gradually improved and was transferred to the ward after 32 days in ICU. On re-assessment, she had residual emotional lability with poor abstraction. She received full score on Addenbrooke’s cognitive assessment (ACE-R). She was discharged from hospital on day 62 on prophylactic antiviral, reducing prednisolone, levetiracetam and olanzapine. She was reviewed 10 days post-discharge. Her mental state was stable, and had improved concentration with normal behavior. The olanzapine and prednisolone were gradually weaned.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】In 60% of cases of encephalitis, the cause remains unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.
